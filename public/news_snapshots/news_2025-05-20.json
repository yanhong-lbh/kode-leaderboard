    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court, and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. Maine state representative Laurel Libby is allowed to vote for her constituents after three months of being censured, thanks to a7-2 Supreme Court decisionTuesday. After the state's Democrat majority voted to strip Libby of her voting rights in February for making a social media post that called out a biologicallytrans athletewho won a girls' pole vault competition, she fought a legal battle to overturn it all the way up to the Supreme Court. And it paid off with Tuesday's decision. Libby called the battle a 'civil rights' case in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"I most certainly do believe this is a civil rights issue for Maine girls and girls across the country who are being sidelines by biological males,\" Libby said, later adding that the censure \"was political retaliation from start to finish,\" over her vocal stance on trans athlete inclusion. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Libby believes the ruling is essential in order to protect Americans who want to speak out against allowing trans athletes in girls' and women's sports while the country is in a pivotal standoff over the issue. \"Thankfully the Supreme Court saw the merits and the high stakes with this case, and really what was on the line not just for just me, my constituents in Maine, but really the entire country if this was upheld… No one should ever be silenced for speaking up on behalf of our girls,\" Libby said. \"Now we have a ruling from the Supreme Court that says no one can be silenced for speaking the truth even if it's an unpopular truth. So I hope we will be seeing more folks speaking up on behalf of women and girls and their rights.\" The main defendant in Libby's lawsuit, Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, who passed the censure against Libby on Feb. 15, has vowed to restore Libby's voting rights to comply with the Supreme Court ruling. \"In accordance with the Supreme Court’s injunction pending appeal, Representative Libby’s ability to vote on the floor of the House has been restored until the current appeal process runs its course,\" Fecteau told Fox News Digital. \"The Clerk of the House, whom the injunction is against, has already complied with this court ruling. We look forward to continuing with the important work Maine people expect of us.\" President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that requires states only allow females to compete, but multiple Democrat-run states, including Maine, have defied the order and continued to enable trans inclusion. The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi have even filed their own separate lawsuit against the state of Maine for continuing to defy the order. MAINE ROCKED BY TRANS ATHLETE DOMINANCE AT GIRLS' TRACK MEET AMID ONGOING LEGAL CONFLICT WITH TRUMP Libby has been a central figure in the conservative pushback against Democrat policies that enable trans inclusion in girls' sports in Maine. In addition to her lawsuit against Fecteau, Libby has been repeatedly critical of Mills for her refusal to comply with Trump. \"Ryan Fecteau and Janet Mills have been ruling our state for the last six years with an iron fist regardless of the will of Maine people,\" Libby said. \"This sends a message that they can not continue to operate outside of the constitution and ignore the will of Maine people any longer.\" Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said that school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" Many Maine residents have even entire school districts have stood up against Mills' policies alongside Libby. Maine's school districts RSU No. 24 and MSAD No. 70 have each passed their own localized resolutions to keep girls' spots for female students only. There have also been three large-scale protests against the current policies in the state's capital city Augusta since February. MAINE TEENS BATTLING STATE DEMOCRATS ON GIRLS' SPORTS BILL AFTER ENDURING TRANS ATHLETE CHAOS IN HIGH SCHOOL And Libby has had the support of the federal government along the way. Just days before the decision, the DOJ filed an amicus brief on Libby's behalf to the Supreme Court, and Bondi spoke out in support of the embattled lawmaker to Fox News Digital. \"I am so thankful for Attorney General Pam Bondi's response,\" Libby said. However, Libby's legal battle is not done yet. The Supreme Court decision has granted her back her right to vote on the state house floor, but she still does not have the right to speak. Libby's case will now go back to the First Circuit Court of Appeals for oral arguments on June 5, as she will look to regain her voting rights. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP FILE -State Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Auburn, speaks with a colleague, Feb. 14, 2023, at the State House in Augusta, Maine.(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) Additionally, Libby was not able to vote on several bills in the state legislature in the last three months during her censure. These included the state's bi-annual budget vote and a bill to codify the Maine Human Rights Act, which protects trans inclusion in girls' sports, into the state's constitution. Libby said she believes the records should be reflected to include her vote on those bills as well, but does not yet know if she will be actively seeking to have those records changed legally yet.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump sat down with 'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier to discuss the significance of economics in creating peace on the world stage, signaling he'd be open to trading with Iran as he advocates for a nuclear deal. Iranian Supreme Leader AyatollahAli Khameneion Tuesday called U.S. demands that Tehran stop enriching uranium entirely \"utter nonsense\" and questioned whether future nuclear talks could succeed. \"For the Americans to say, ‘We won’t allow Iran to enrich uranium,’ is utter nonsense,\" he said in apost on X. \"We aren’t waiting for anyone’s permission. \"The Islamic Republic has certain policies, and it will pursue them,\" he added, without expanding on what these policies are.

Iran has not stated it intends to build a nuclear weapon, but it hasenriched uranium to near-weapons gradeand bolstered its missile program in what experts argue is an important step to ensure Tehran could fire a nuclear warhead. While uranium can be enriched for civil nuclear power and nations across the globe rely on nuclear energy, including the U.S., which utilizes nuclear energy to supply nearly 20% of its energy needs and is its largest source of clean energy, Iran’s reliance on nuclear energyamounted to less than 1%in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

However, Khamenei suggested the Trump administration’s push to negotiate on Iran’s nuclear programcould be short-lived. \"Indirect negotiations took place during Martyr Raisi's term similar to what’s happening now. Needless to say, there was no result,\" he added in reference to negotiation attempts under the Biden administration. \"We don’t think these negotiations will yield results now either.

The President made it very clear that he wants something to come to conclusion.\" \"I know that he and Steve [Witkoff] are working very hard right now to try to bring that home. So, a very fluid situation, but our primary focus is number one, the hostages, and number two, Israel’s security,\" he said. On the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Boehler addressed the recent development of opening borders to allow aid trucks into Gaza after two months of a blockade. He also discussed the new U.S.-backed mechanism that could potentially replace theUnited Nations Relief and WorksAgency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). \"Perhaps there needs to be a replacement for UNRWA.

It was an unbelievable moment on Sunday. The whole time, we couldn’t sleep. It was exciting, nerve-wracking. We watched pretty much real-time. We were waiting for Steve Witkoff to come.

If Hamas wants to come forward and make a legitimate offer, they’re willing to stand by and release hostages, we’re always open to that.\" He also credited the recent Israeli ground operations for increasing pressure on Hamas, saying, \"I do think we’re closer than we ever were.

Senate Republicans indicated that they intend to vote this week on whether to nix California's emissions waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has allowed the blue state to adopt stricter vehicle emissions standards than those imposed at the federal level, including a mandate that all vehicles sold in the state must be electric by 2035. The planned vote sets up a battle between Republicans and Democrats over whether the waiver is a government \"rule\" subject to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to get rid of regulations with just a simple majority, as opposed to the typical 60-votes required to pass a bill. Democrats have described theGOP maneuveringas a \"nuclear option\" aimed at upending formal Senate rules. \"The administration says it's a rule.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on lawmakers’ reactions to President Donald Trump’s visit to Capitol Hill, where he urged Republicans to unite behind his spending bill. FIRST ON FOX:Most of the nation's Republican governors on Tuesday signed on to a letter of support for the massive GOP-crafted budget bill advancing PresidentDonald Trump'ssecond-term agenda on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. The letter was sent to the White House as the massive measure, known as Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is slowly making its way through numerous votes and hurdles in the House of Representatives. And the letter, shared first with Fox News by the Republican Governors Association (RGA), came as Trump made a rare visit Tuesday morning toCapitol Hillto rally Republicans in support of the legislation. INSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE REPUBLICANS President Donald Trump, center, is joined by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., left, as he departs the Capitol following a meeting with the House Republican Conference, Tuesday, May 20, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.) \"AsRepublican Governors,we stand UNITED in strong support of your One, Big, Beautiful Bill. This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival. It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation,\" stated the letter, which was signed by 20 of the nation's 27 GOP governors. And the governors argued that \"after four long years of tremendous hardship under President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the American people cannot wait any longer for Congress to enact the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\" \"The American people have witnessed the tireless work undertaken by you and your administration to reverse the disastrous consequences of President Biden’s failed and often illegal policies,\" the governors claimed. \"You have demonstrated a commitment to using every ounce of Executive authority available to reinstitute fiscal sanity, fight the deep state, secure our borders, and achieve energy dominance.\" With a fragile, razor-thin majority in the House,GOP leadersin the chamber cannot afford more than a couple of Republicans to hold out against the bill in order to pass it and send it to the Senate. No Democrats in the House are expected to vote for the measure. Upon arriving on Capitol Hill, Trump suggested that any GOP lawmaker who votes against the bill would be \"knocked out so fast,\" as he mentioned a couple of \"grandstanders.\" He urged House Republicans must get his \"one big, beautiful bill\" done, and added that the GOP is a \"very unified party.\" While Trump's meeting with the House Republicans was kept behind closed doors, two people in the room told Fox News Digital that the president warned House Republicans to not \"f--- around\" with Medicaid and state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, two significant points of contention for warring conservative and moderate GOP factions. The Republican governors, in their letter to Trump, said that \"we agree with you; Republicans must UNIFY around this unprecedented piece of conservative legislation.\" Gov.

The letter was signed by Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Mike Dunleavy of Alaska, Sarah Sanders of Arkansas, Brian Kemp of Georgia (the chair of the RGA), Brad Little of Idaho, Mike Braun of Indiana, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Jeff Laundry of Louisiana, Tate Reeves of Mississippi, Mike Kehoe of Missouri, Greg Gianforte of Montana, Jim Pillen of Nebraska, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Bill Lee of Tennessee, Greg Abbott of Texas, Spencer Cox of Utah, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, and Mark Gordon of Wyoming.

    "title": "Trump FDA overhauls COVID-19 vaccine approval to focus on older populations, high-risk individuals",
    "article_text": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says people should still be treated if seeking a religious exemption and opens up about the Kennedy files on 'Special Report.' TheFood and Drug Administrationis shifting its annual COVID-19 vaccine approval policies to focus on Americans older than age 65 and other \"high-risk\" individuals, while increasing the standard of evidence to approve COVID vaccines for low-risk individuals. \"The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,\" FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research chief, Vinay Prasad, and FDA Commissioner Martin Makary, wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine Tuesday. \"These clinical trials will inform future directions for the FDA, but more important, they will provide information that is desperately craved by health care providers and the American people.\" Americans over the age of 65 and those considered at high-risk of contracting the virus will be able to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine this fall, the essay outlined, while vaccines for low-risk Americans will likely face stricter scientific analysis before they are made available to the public. The FDA estimated that about \"100 million to 200 million Americans\" older than age 65 or considered at high-risk will stillhave access to vaccines. Prasad and Makary said in their essay that the U.S. will move away from a \"one-size-fits-all\" paradigm that promoted COVID-19 vaccines for the vast majority of Americans, stretching from children to the elderly. The shift, they said, will bring America's policies more in line with guidelines in European nations. RFK JR'S HHS TO END ROUTINE COVID VACCINE GUIDANCE FOR CHILDREN, PREGNANT WOMEN: REPORT Dr. Vinay Prasad and Dr. Marty Makary said in their essay that the U.S. will move away from a \"one-size-fits-all\" paradigm that promoted COVID-19 vaccines for the vast majority of Americans.(Getty Images) \"While all other high-income nations confine vaccine recommendations to older adults (typically those older than 65 years of age), or those at high risk for severe Covid-19, the United States has adopted a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework and has granted broad marketing authorization to all Americans over the age of 6 months,\" the health leaders wrote in the New England Journal. \"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations,\" they wrote. \"We reject this view.\" FIERY RFK JR. FLOGS WHO FOR CAVING TO CHINA ON COVID, CELEBRATING PANDEMIC ‘FAILURES’ IN STUNNING VIDEO TO ORG President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

BEN & JERRY'S CO-FOUNDER ARRESTED PROTESTING SENATE HEARING: 'RFK KILLS PEOPLE WITH HATE' Prasad and Makary held a roundtable discussion on the framework outlined in their medical essay Tuesday afternoon to walk Americans through the policy shift. Prasad explained that health officials under theTrump administrationare taking into account that Americans have balked at the FDA's guidance under the Biden administration to receive multiple booster shots, while other Americans demand access to the vaccines. \"We have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeatCOVID 19 vaccinedoses or boosters,\" he said. \"There are some Americans out there who are worried that the FDA has not fully documented and interrogated the safety harms of these products, and they are categorically opposed to these products. There are also some Americans we also have to recognize, who are desperate for additional protection, and they demand these products. But the truth is that most doctors and most of the public are entirely uncertain, and that is reflected in low vaccine uptake of these products.\" Americans' trust in the scientific community has cratered since the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Vinay Prasad and Dr. Marty Makary noted.(AP Photo, File) The pair added during the roundtable that Americans' trust in the scientific community has cratered since the pandemic. \"Survey after survey shows trust in institutions like the FDA and scientists in general, it's rock bottom,\" Prasad said during the roundtable. \"I mean, we have lower trust than Congress, and that's saying something, you know. And we need to rebuild that trust. And part of rebuilding that trust is having conversations like this, writing articles like we've done in the New England Journal, and having a common-sense evidence-based framework for rebuilding that trust.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The pair cited in their article in the New England Journal that \"public trust in vaccination in general has declined,\" including for \"vital immunization programs such as that for measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccination, which has been clearly established as safe and highly effective.\"",

    "title": "GOP holdouts unmoved by Trump's 'big, beautiful' trip to Capitol Hill",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on President Donald Trump’s visit to Capitol Hill to rally Republican support for his spending bill as several GOP lawmakers continue to hold out. PresidentDonald Trump'srallying speech to House Republicans Tuesday morning wasn't enough to convince some holdouts to unite behind his \"big, beautiful bill\" ahead of a planned vote this week. Trump urged Republicans to cease infighting on Medicaid reform and state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps at the House GOP’s weekly conference meeting. Several Republicans who emerged said they were still concerned enough to oppose the bill, however. House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and representatives Nick LaLota, Mike Lawler and Andrew Garbino of New York told Fox News Digital Tuesday they would vote against the bill if changes were not made. On the other hand, Trump did persuade some people. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina,one of several Republicansto sink a committee vote on the bill Friday, told reporters he would review it and make a \"judgment call\" ahead of a 1 a.m. meeting to advance the bill through the House Rules Committee. INSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Rep. Mike Lawler (left) and Rep. Thomas Massie (right) said President Donald Trump did not convince them Tuesday to vote for his \"big, beautiful bill\" in its current form.(Getty Images) Norman said Trump did a \"fantastic job\" and delivered \"one of the best speeches I've heard\" at the House GOP meeting, and he urged his blue state colleagues to \"take the words the president said to heart about SALT.\" CONSERVATIVE RIPS BLUE STATE REPUBLICAN'S PROPOSAL TO RAISE TAXES ON WEALTHY IN SALT DEBATE Norman and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, are both members of the powerful rules panel who have not been shy about their concerns with the current bill. The committee acts as the final gatekeeper before most legislation sees a full House vote. Roy did not appear to attend Trump's speech but told reporters Monday evening the 1 a.m. Wednesday vote should be postponed. But the New York Republicans weren't budging after Trump's \"big, beautiful\" speech, maintaining the bill doesn't go far enough to deliver for middle-class New Yorkers on the SALT deduction cap. \"This is the single biggest issue that I've talked about, and, with all due respect to the president, I'm not budging,\" Lawler said. \"Between property taxes and income taxes, it blows well past the $30,000 cap with the $400,000 income cap. So, as I've said repeatedly, that is insufficient. We will continue the dialogue with leadership, but as it stands right now, I do not support the bill,\" Lawler said. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill.(Reuters/Anna Rose Layden) Lawler said SALT is one of the biggest issues affecting his district in New York and campaigned on never supporting a tax bill that doesn't \"adequately lift the cap.\" \"The president can say whatever he wants, and I respect him, but the fact is, I certainly understand my district. I'm one of only three Republican members that won in a districtKamala Harriswon, and I did so for reasons,\" Lawler said. \"We need a little more SALT on the table to get to this,\" fellow New York Republican LaLota added. \"I hope the president's presence motivates my leadership to give us a number that we can go sell back home.\" LaLota said while he is still a \"no,\" he hopes \"the president's presence here today motivates some folks in the Ways and Means Committee and my leadership to give us a number to which we can actually say ‘yes.’\" Rep. Nick Lalota, R-N.Y., leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) When asked if Trump did enough to ease concerns in Tuesday's meeting, Garbarino, another New York Republican, said, \"No. There were no specifics. … It was more of a rally. We need to get this done.\" \"We share President Trump's call for unity within the House Republican Conference,\" Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif.,said in a joint statementafter Trump's visit to Capitol Hill. \"We hope his remarks today motivate the Speaker to advance a SALT proposal that delivers meaningful relief for our middle-class constituents, as we have worked in good faith with House Leadership for more than a year,\" the statement from Kim, Garbarino, Lawler, LaLota and Rep. Tom Kean, R-N.J., said. Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., speaks during a hearing March 10, 2021, on Capitol Hill.(Ting Shen-Pool/Getty Images) Meanwhile, Trump urged Republicans not to \"f--- with\" Medicaid in his speech, though different factions came to different conclusions about what he meant. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee, who was not in the room for Trump's speech, called for more cuts to the entitlement program in an X post Tuesday afternoon but told Fox News Digital he was opposed to the legislation as written. \"I agree with President Trump — we must crush the waste, fraud, and abuse. Liberal states like California and New York are abusing Medicaid — and making you pay for it. Illegal aliens and freeloaders have no right to taxpayer-funded benefits,\" Ogles said on X. Other fiscal conservatives, like Ogles, who were in the room, said the bill does not go far enough to reform Medicaid and would also vote \"no\" in the bill's current form. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., outside the Capitol building Dec. 18, 2024.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) \"I think it's inappropriate for us to say we're not going to touch it and then leave all of this fraud that's happening in the system,\" Burlison said. Harris, the House Freedom Caucus chair, said, \"I can't support the bill. It does not eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid. The president called for waste, fraud and abuse to be eliminated. I don't think that's where the bill sits.\" Massie, known for being a libertarian, was unconvinced by Trump's appearance, telling reporters that his constituents didn't \"vote for increased deficits and Biden-level spending.\" He acknowledged that younger members or those who harbor ambitions for higher office would likely fall in line, however. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think he probably closed the deal in there,\" Massie said. SALT deduction caps and Medicaid remain two of the biggest sticking points in Republican negotiations. SALT deduction caps primarily benefit people living in high-cost-of-living areas like New York City, Los Angeles and their surrounding suburbs. Republicans representing those areas have argued that raisingthe SALT deduction capis a critical issue and that a failure to address it could cost the GOP the House majority in the 2026 midterms. Republicans in redder, lower-tax areas have said in response that SALT deductions favor wealthy people living in Democrat-controlled states and that such deductions reward progressive high-tax policies. It was Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that first instituted caps on SALT deductions, setting the maximum at $10,000 for both married couples and single filers. SALT Caucus members have rejected House Republican leaders' offer to increase that to $30,000. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, meanwhile, are pushing for the bill to be more aggressive in cutting waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system, including a faster timeline for implementing work requirements for able-bodied recipients. Currently, the legislation has work requirements kicking in 2029. They also want to restructure Medicaid cost-sharing to put a bigger burden on the states. Moderates, meanwhile, have been wary of making significant cuts to the program. House GOP leaders are hoping to hold a full House vote on the bill this week.

    "article_text": "Trump administration seeks end to Manhattan toll program while New York officials push back. CREDIT: U.S. Department of Transportation FIRST ON FOX:Government watchdog group Democracy Restored is calling on theDepartment of Justice (DOJ)to investigate U.S. attorneys in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), accusing them of potentially seeking to undermine Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's efforts to end New York City's driving tax, also known as a congestion tax. New York City'scongestion pricing programessentially assesses drivers a toll for driving on some streets in Manhattan, with the price varying depending on the time of day. Late in the night of April 23, SDNY attorneys representing Duffy and the Department of Transportation published an 11-page confidential memo in federal court in Manhattan, explaining that the Trump administration's argument to end the NYC driver's tax was weak and included \"considerable litigation risk.\" The next day, the memo was taken down from the public case docket, and theU.S. Attorney's Officefor the Southern District said the filing was a mistake. In response, officials at the Transportation Department said they would be transferring the case to the DOJ's civil division, according to theNew York Times. Fox News Digital reached out to the DOT to confirm the attorneys involved in the mistaken filing were off the case, but did not immediately receive a response.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Wednesday, June 5, 2024 indefinitely delayed implementation of a plan to charge motorists big tolls to enter the core of Manhattan, just weeks before the nation's first \"congestion pricing\" system was set to launch.(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) \"It's imperative to know whether this filing was inadvertent, and incompetent, or something worse,\" Houston Keene, the director of Democracy Restored said. \"The memo contains confidential legal advice that just happens to criticize the secretary and department's legal strategy — quite an inconvenient document to have made public for lawyers doing their best for their client.\" Democracy Restored said in its letter that more fact-finding must take place, but indicated there are \"a variety\" of potential ethical and legal violations associated with the mistaken filing, particularly if the act was done on purpose. While it can not be concluded whether the act stemmed from incompetence, or whether it was purposeful, Democracy Restored points to the \"partisan political activity\" and involvement in political non-profits by the attorneys involved, suggesting it could shed light on the motivations behind the action. EXCLUSIVE: 'SHADY TRIAL LAWYER PIPELINE' FUNNELING MILLIONS TO DEMOCRATS, ACCORDING TO REPORT According to Democracy Restored, the attorneys involved were allregistered Democratsand had a history of donating to Democratic political candidates and campaigns. The attorneys' public social media posts also showed them supporting left-wing political groups and acts of defiance against President Donald Trump's executive directives. \"US Attorneys must be nonpartisan and objective in their work and the partisan backgrounds of these attorneys add to the doubts,\" Keene said. \"Far too many questions remain unanswered about this incident. The DOJ must investigate this matter immediately.\" In early January, NYC launched its congestion pricing program, ordriver's tax,which imposed a $9 daytime toll on most individuals driving their cars into Manhattan's core, south of Central Park. A month later, the Trump administration issued a federal order meant to halt the program by March 21, but the tolls have continued as the result of a federal lawsuit filed by New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency that runs New York City's public transit system.

Earlier this month, as the legal battle over the matter has continued, New York City and the MTArequested a federal judge block the Trump administration's effortsto squash the program. City officials say the program has significantly reduced congestion, improving travel times due to reduced traffic. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because the program involves tolls on federal highways, it must have Department of Transportation approval. The Justice Department declined to comment for this article. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Department of Transportation and the office of the U.S. Attorney or the Southern District of New York, but did not hear back in advance of publication.

    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., clashed in a racially charged exchange over South African refugees during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Secretary of StateMarco Rubioand Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., clashed in a heated and racially charged exchange over South African refugees on Tuesday – with Kaine accusing Rubio and the Trump administration of prioritizing white South African farmers for refugee entry. The spat was prompted after the United States last week welcomed dozens of whiteSouth African refugeeswho the State Department said are victims of \"government-sponsored racial discrimination\" in their homeland. Their arrival comes as the administration has suspendedmost refugee resettlementprograms. Kaine, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, called the persecution claims \"specious,\" noting that South Africa now has a government of national unity and the agriculture minister is an Afrikaner.

TRUMP TO BRING WHITE AFRIKANERS TO US AS REFUGEES FROM SOUTH AFRICA, IN WAKE OF EXPROPRIATION LEGISLATION He inferred that the Trump administration was giving preference to Afrikaners because of their skin color. \"Can you have a different standard based upon the color of somebody's skin? Would that be acceptable?\" Kaine said before Rubio shot back. \"I'm not the one arguing that, apparently you are because you don't like the fact that they’re white and that’s why they’re coming,\" Rubio said. \"I’m asking you to say that that would be unacceptable, that would seem to be a very easy thing to say,\" Kaine said. \"The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States,\" Rubio said before Kaine cut across him. \"Based on the color of somebody's skin?\" Kaine asked. \"You're the one that's talking about the color of their skin, not me.These are people whose farms were burned down and they were killed because of the color of their skin,\" Rubio said.

Trump claimed the law would be used to target South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner group, descended from Dutch and other European settlers who arrived more than 300 years ago. Amid his immigration crackdown, Trump said in January the U.S. will onlyadmit refugeeswho \"can fully and appropriately assimilate.\" Kaine played down the threat the Afrikaners face and said that the U.S. did not establish a special refugee program for Black South Africans during the apartheid era. \"Now we’re creating a special pathway for white Afrikaner farmers in a country governed by a unity government that includes the Afrikaner parties,\" Kaine said. \"Would you agree, Mr. Secretary, that if we’re interpreting the phrase 'a well-founded fear of persecution', we should apply that standard evenhandedly?\" \"I think we should apply it in the national security interest of the United States,\" Rubio said. \"The United States has the right to choose who it allows in and to prioritize that choice,\" Rubio asserted. \"And should that be applied evenhandedly?\" Kaine asked, with Rubio responding, \"Our foreign policy does not require evenhandedness.\" President Donald Trump directed the State Department to bump up Afrikaners to the front of the line for resettlement after a law was passed by the South African government allowing it to take private land for public use, sometimes without compensation.(SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Rubio also said that Kaine seems to think everyone should be allowed into the country for any reason, and reasserted that the government’s immigration policy should reflect what benefits the United States. In March, Rubio expelled the South African ambassador to the U.S., calling him a \"race-baiting\" politician who hates America and Trump after he said the commander-in-chief is leading a global white supremacist movement. South Africa's foreign ministry has said the accusations of racial discrimination against Afrikaners are \"unfounded.\" Elsewhere in the hearing on Tuesday, Rubio requested a budget totaling $28.5 billion, which he said will allow the State Department to fulfill its mission while also outlining a bureaucratic overhaul, proposing the recission of $20 billion in duplicate, wasteful and ideologically driven programs. Rubio announced the creation of new consolidated funds that will absorb many U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) functions. Last month, Rubio announced he was overhauling the agency andshuttering more than 130 officesaround the world in order to streamline operations and align the department more closely with the administration's foreign policy objectives.

    "article_text": "Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan could face prison time if convicted as protestors come out in support. The Milwaukee judge accused of helping anillegal immigrantevade Immigration and Customs Enforcement is back in the spotlight — this time because of the liberal federal judge presiding over her trial. U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, 85, was randomly assigned to preside over the jury trial of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan, who was indicted earlier this month for allegedly shielding an illegal immigrant from ICE in her courtroom. Adelman, a former Democratic lawmaker and outspoken judge, faces mounting criticism and scrutiny of his record as he handles the high-profile case. Adelman spent 20 years as a Democrat in the Wisconsin state Senate before then-President Bill Clinton nominated him in 1997 to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Though the judge hasn’t been active in politics for years, critics note recent rulings and writings in which he’s taken aim at PresidentDonald Trump, Chief Justice Roberts and others. TRUMP CONSIDERS FORMER DEFENSE ATTORNEY EMIL BOVE FOR FEDERAL APPEALS COURT VACANCY Supporters of Judge Hannah Dugan protest outside the United States Federal Building and Courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Thursday, May 15, 2025 ahead of Dugan's arraignment.(AP/Todd Richmond) Some fear this continued political bias could risk his impartiality in presiding over Dugan's trial — or at least the perceptions of it, in the eyes of Trump allies. Adelman did not respond to a request for comment. In 2020, Adelmanpublished an articlefor Harvard Law & Policy Review, titled, \"The Roberts Court’s Assault on Democracy\" that set off a torrent of criticism from Trump allies and court commentators alike. The article accused Chief Justice John Roberts of breaking with his Senate confirmation testimony in 2005 — instead ushering in a \"hard-right majority\" on the Supreme Court, and \"actively participating in undermining American democracy.\" Adelman also took aim at Trump, whose temperament he said \"is that of an autocrat,\" but who he said \"is also disinclined to buck the wealthy individuals and corporations who control his party.\" Adelman used the article to advocate for \"righting the ship\" of the high court, in part by embracing an approach similar to the Warren Court — known both for its landmark civil rights rulings and a slew of other progressive decisions. 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan speaks at a pro-Ukraine rally on February 24, 2025.(Lee Matz/Milwaukee Independent via AP) Adelman was later admonished by the Civility Committee for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for his remarks in the article. They found his remarks did not violate prohibited political activity under the Canons of Judicial Conduct, but issued the following rebuke: \"The opening two sentences regarding the Chief Justice and the very pointed criticisms of Republican Party policy positions could be seen as inconsistent with a judge's duty to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary and as reflecting adversely on the judge's impartiality,\" the committee said. Adelman later issued a public apology for those remarks. Adelman was also at the center of a major case involving Wisconsin's voter ID law, which sought to make it harder for citizens to vote. He blocked the law fromtaking force ahead of the elections— a decision that was later reversed by the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which again issued a sharp rebuke of his ruling. In \"our hierarchical judicial system, a district court cannot declare a statute unconstitutional just because he thinks (with or without the support of a political scientist) that the dissent was right and the majority wrong,\"the appeals court said, noting that Adelman did not rely on any Supreme Court precedent to base his decision. In light of his previous remarks and progressive rulings, court-watchers expect his behavior here to be closely scrutinized. It's unclear whether his behavior could assuage the concerns of longtime critics — among them, Mike Davis of the Article III Project, and conservative scholar Josh Blackman, who took aim at Adelman's 2020 remarks in ablog postat the time. This is due in part to the canons of judicial ethics, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley notedin an op-edfor The Hill. \"Because of these ethical principles, judges are usually highly restrained in their public comments, particularly about political or ideological matters,\" he said. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem testifies before a House Homeland Security hearing on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 14, 2025.(REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden) Dugan's trial comes at a time when Trump and his allies have blasted so-called \"activist\" judges who they see as acting politically to block his agenda — suggesting her trial, and Adelman's behavior — will be underespecially close scrutiny. But others noted that federal judges often take great caution to avoid the appearance of political bias, even more so in public remarks, understanding that doing so could violate the canons for judicial behavior. Many also see their roles on the court as a serious job that requires them to be impartial arbiters of the law — looking to precedent, rather than politics — as their guide. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In presiding over Dugan's case, experts hope Adelman will do the same. \"When I have served on panels with sitting federal judges, they often balk at even discussing the scope of constitutional rights out of concern for these canons,\" Turley notedin the an op-ed. \"Federal judges are expected to speak through opinions in court decisions rather than in editorials or law review articles.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump, during his speech to members of Congress on Tuesday, called the withdrawal from Afghanistan \"disastrous and incompetent.\" Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethis instructing the Pentagon to launch a comprehensive review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. In 2021, then-PresidentJoe Bidenremoved U.S. troops from Afghanistan, following up on existing plans from the first Trump administration in 2020 with Taliban leaders to end the war in the region. Biden faced scrutiny after the withdrawal as the Taliban quickly took over Afghanistan again and more than a dozen U.S. service members died supporting evacuation efforts. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed during thewithdrawal processdue to a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, outside the then-Hamid Karzai International Airport, as the Taliban quickly seized control of Kabul. TRUMP PUSHES TO RECOVER ‘BILLIONS OF DOLLARS’ OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT LEFT BEHIND IN AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL The Taliban takes control of the then-Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 31, 2021, after the completion of the U.S. withdrawal.(Wali Sabawoon/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) \"The Department of Defense has an obligation, both to the American people and to the warfighters who sacrificed their youth in Afghanistan, to get to the facts,\" Hegseth said in a Tuesday memo. \"This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation.\" Hegseth said the Pentagon has already completed a review into the \"catastrophic\" withdrawal and concluded that a full investigation is necessary to provide a complete picture of the event and to hold those responsible accountable. As a result, Hegseth is directing Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell to spearhead a special review panel to evaluate previous investigations and to \"analyze the decision-making that led to one of America’s darkest and deadliest international moments.\" \"This team will ensure ACCOUNTABILITY to the American people and the warfighters of our great Nation,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. On Aug. 26, 2021, an ISIS-K suicide bomber who the Taliban released earlier that month detonated his body-worn improvised explosive device at Abbey Gate outside Kabul's airport, according to a U.S. Army Central Command investigation released in 2024. In addition to the 13 U.S. service members who were killed, approximately 170 Afghan civilians also died. HOUSE GOP RELEASES SCATHING REPORT ON BIDEN'S WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN Hundreds of people gather near an Air Force C-17 transport plane at the international airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 17, 2021.(AP) The Biden administration's White House released a report in 2023 evaluating the Afghanistan withdrawal, which stated that top intelligence officials did not accurately assess how quickly the Taliban would retake control of Kabul. Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee conducted their own investigation into the withdrawal, and the U.S. military produced at least two reports on the matter. The Biden administration \"prioritized the optics of the withdrawal over the security of U.S. personnel on the ground,\" according to the House Foreign Affairs Committee report. \"For that reason, they failed to plan for all contingencies, including a noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO) and refused to order a NEO until after the Taliban had already entered Kabul,\" the report said. Additionally, the report said the \"failure\" to adequately establish evacuation plans led to an unsafe environment at the airport and put the lives of service members and State Department officials at risk. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In February, Trump told reporters that he wouldn’t instruct Hegseth on what actions the Pentagon should take when asked if he was considering firing military leaders who oversaw the withdrawal. But Trump said he would \"fire every single one of them.\" The commander of U.S. Central Command in 2021, retired Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., in 2024 took full ownership of the loss of U.S. troops that day. \"I was the overall commander, and I and I alone bear full military responsibility for what happened at Abbey Gate,\" McKenzie told theHouse Foreign Affairs Committee in March 2024.

Mark Milley, the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers at the same hearing that he believed the evacuation should have occurred sooner and that multiple factors contributed to failures in the withdrawal. Both McKenzie and Milley told lawmakers they advised Biden to keep some U.S. troops in Afghanistan after pulling out most U.S. forces. \"The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war,\" Milley told lawmakers. \"Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome.\" Fox News' Liz Friden contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel addresses the possible 'disturbing’ scenarios surrounding former President Joe Biden’s stage 4 prostate cancer diagnosis and more on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Joe Biden’s recent diagnosis of \"aggressive\" prostate cancer has sparked concerns about how far the disease has advanced. The former president’s prostate cancer has been characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (grade group 5) with \"metastasis to the bone.\" The score of 9 indicates \"high-grade\" prostate cancer with very abnormal cells that are likely to grow quickly, experts say. BIDEN'S PROSTATE CANCER DESCRIBED AS 'AGGRESSIVE' — WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE DISEASE'S PROGNOSIS \"While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,\" the statement said. \"The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\" The fact that Biden’s cancer has been classified as \"hormone-sensitive\" means it could be more responsive to hormone therapies, and thus more treatable. Joe Biden’s recent diagnosis of \"aggressive\" prostate cancer has sparked concerns about how far the disease has advanced.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer needs androgens (male hormones) to grow, according to the National Cancer Institute. When those androgens are reduced or blocked, the cancer stops growing. Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, said the hormone-sensitive designation doesn’t necessarily mean Biden has already been taking hormone therapies, which is unknown. GLEASON SCORE FOR PROSTATE CANCER: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S DIAGNOSIS \"You can tell under a microscope if this is the type of cancer that could respond to hormone therapy, but no matter what it looks like, you don’t know until you try it,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"And sometimes it looks like there will be an effect, but it ends up being resistant to therapy.\" The former president’s prostate cancer has been characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (grade group 5) with \"metastasis to the bone.\"(AP/Evan Vucci) Prostate cancer has long been known to feed on the male hormone testosterone, according to Dr. Bilal Siddiqui, M.D., a medical oncologist and prostate cancer researcher at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. \"The overwhelming majority of prostate cancers — 99% plus — are hormone-sensitive and dependent on testosterone in the beginning,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I would say it’s a very reasonable assumption [of hormone sensitivity], but we would know definitively once hormone therapy has started.\" \"The overwhelming majority of prostate cancers are hormone-sensitive and dependent on testosterone in the beginning.\" The backbone of treatment for any metastatic prostate cancer is \"androgen deprivation therapy,\" which is geared toward decreasing the body's level of testosterone. \"Typically, when you start the androgen deprivation therapy, testosterone levels will decrease and the PSA levels will decrease along with it, and that's your definitive proof that the cancer is hormone-sensitive,\" Siddiqui said. The backbone of treatment for any metastatic prostate cancer is \"androgen deprivation therapy,\" which is geared toward decreasing the body's level of testosterone.(iStock) Historically, androgen (hormone) deprivation therapy was done surgically through removal of the testes — but today’s typical methods include pills or injections, according to the oncologist. \"That eliminates about 80 to 85% of the testosterone that's produced in the body,\" he said. In many cases, doctors may add other drugs to block testosterone from secondary sources in the body, such as the adrenal glands that sit above the kidneys. NEW PROSTATE CANCER TEST PINPOINTS DISEASE BETTER THAN PSA OPTION, STUDY FINDS North Carolina family physician Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk reiterated that prostate cancer that shrinks or slows in progression after blocking testosterone qualifies as hormone-sensitive. \"This means that it grows or shrinks in relation to how much androgen or testosterone is circulating in the body,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Typically, when you start the androgen deprivation therapy, testosterone levels will decrease and the PSA levels will decrease along with it, and that's your definitive proof that the cancer is hormone-sensitive,\" an oncologist said.(iStock) \"If you suppress testosterone and the cancer does not shrink and continues to grow or spread, then the cancer is independent of the amount of hormone circulating in the body.\" There are a number of different ways to monitor disease progression, but it’s most commonly done by a combination of PSA blood tests and imaging studies, the doctor noted. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Eventually, metastatic prostate cancer will progress to become hormone-resistant, which means it no longer responds to hormone therapy, according to Siddiqui. \"It can vary in how long it takes to get to that point,\" the oncologist said. \"It's usually a couple of years before it evolves from hormone-sensitive to hormone-resistant.\" The \"ultimate test\" of whether cancer has become hormone-resistant is to lower testosterone levels and observe where the cancer goes, he noted. \"It's usually a couple of years before it evolves from hormone-sensitive to hormone-resistant.\" There may also signs of the disease getting worse. \"That might mean a rising PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test, new pain or symptoms, or new tumors that show up on the scan,\" Siddiqui told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that men aged 55 to 69 years should have the option to undergo periodic prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening to monitor for prostate cancer. \"Before deciding whether to be screened, men should have an opportunity to discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and to incorporate their values and preferences in the decision,\" the USPSTF states. Siegel questioned this guidance to skip screening for older men. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"I don’t agree with guidelines to not test over 70 years of age, especially with so many treatments to offer for prostate cancer,\" he said.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel breaks down frightening statistics about stroke cases in the U.S. and reacts to a study showing marijuana use is outpacing alcohol use. Prolonged fatigue could indicatepoor sleep habits— but it could also be a lingering effect of mini-strokes. That’s according to a new study from Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark, which was published this week in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). Amini-stroke— medically known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) — is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain that causes a \"short period of symptoms,\" according to Mayo Clinic. STROKE, DEMENTIA AND DEPRESSION SHARE THESE 17 PREVENTABLE RISK FACTORS The study found that people who experience a TIA are more likely to report prolonged fatigue lasting up to one year. \"Patients with a presumed transient event reported fatigue at levels comparable to a stroke,\" lead study author Birgitte Hede Ebbesen, PT, PhD, a physiotherapist at Aalborg University Hospital, told Fox News Digital. A new study found that people who experience a mini-stroke are more likely to report prolonged fatigue lasting up to one year.(iStock) The researchers followed 354 people averaging 70 years of age who had experienced a mini-stroke. Over a 12-month period, the participants reported their level of fatigue in five areas: overall tiredness, physical tiredness, reduced activity, reduced motivation andmental fatigue, according to a university press release. HEART DISEASE COULD BE PREVENTED WITH THIS ONE SIMPLE TEST On a scale ranging from 4 to 20 — with 20 being the most fatigued — the participants reported an average score of 12.3 in the two weeks after the mini-stroke, 11.9 at three months, 11.4 at six months and 11.1 at the one-year mark. Two weeks after the mini-stroke, 61% reported high levels of fatigue. At three, six and 12 months, 54% said they experienced fatigue. Two weeks after the mini-stroke, 61% reported high levels of fatigue. At three, six and 12 months, 54% said they experienced fatigue.(iStock) Those who reported prolonged fatigue were twice as likely to have experiencedanxiety and/or depression, the study found. Some also reported \"We had encountered fatigue among patients with TIA inclinical settings, so we knew it was there — but the frequency still surprised us,\" Modrau told Fox News Digital. FEELING EXTRA TIRED? THIS VIRUS COULD BE THE CULPRIT, STUDY SUGGESTS \"Long-term fatigue was common in our group of study participants, and we found that if people experience fatigue within two weeks of leaving the hospital, it is likely they will continue to have fatigue for up to a year.\" Based on these findings, Modrau suggests that people diagnosed with a transient ischemic attack should be monitored forlingering fatiguein the ensuing weeks and months. A mini-stroke — medically known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) — is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain that causes a \"short period of symptoms,\" according to Mayo Clinic.(iStock) \"This could help us better understand who might struggle with fatigue long-term and require further care.\" The more commonly known symptoms of stroke include face drooping, arm weakness or slurred speech, which usually resolve within a day, according to Modrau. Some patients also reported long-term cognitive issues. Bradley Serwer, aninterventional cardiologistand chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an Ingenovis Health company that offers cardiovascular and anesthesiology services to hospitals nationwide, confirmed that fatigue is very common — and sometimes \"debilitating\" — following a stroke. \"Fatigue is multifactorial and can rarely be attributed to a single cause,\" Serwer, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"Fatigue is multifactorial and can rarely be attributed to a single cause.\" The Maryland-based cardiologist shared the following potential reasons for fatigue following a mini-stroke. Brain healing:\"After a stroke, the brain tries to heal itself,\" Serwer said. \"This process causes thebrain to work harderto ‘rewire’ itself, which results in a higher demand for energy. This often leaves patients feeling drained or fatigued.\" Increased inflammation:This can occur due to the immune response following a TIA. Reduced levels of chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine can result in depression, fatigue or lack of motivation.(iStock) Lower levels of neurotransmitters in the brain:Reduced levels of chemicals like serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine canresult in depression, fatigue or lack of motivation, according to Serwer. Sleep disturbances:\"These are very common after a stroke and can lead to significant sleep deprivation,\" the cardiologist said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Medications:Drugs used to treat strokes may have adverse side effects, including fatigue. \"Betablockers are excellentblood pressure medicationsand are often prescribed after a stroke or heart attack, but they may cause notable fatigue,\" Serwer noted. Other factors:\"Simple tasks may require more mental effort than before the injury,\" the cardiologist said. \"Depression or anxiety after a stroke can also be a confounding predictor of fatigue.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The study did have some limitations, the researchers noted. \"It is anobservational studyand therefore we cannot determine causality,\" Modrau said. \"Results are based on self-reported questionnaires, and we cannot be certain that relatives didn’t help fill them out or influence results.\" Drugs used to treat strokes may have adverse side effects, including fatigue.(iStock) The researchers also did not have information on pre-TIA fatigue levels, although previous studies suggested that it was \"much more frequent\" after mini-strokes.

    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court, and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Maine state legislature to revoke its censure of GOP state representativeLaurel Libbyon Tuesday. Libby has been censured since Feb. 15 for a social media post that identified a transgender Maine high school athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition. In a 7-2 decision, the court ruled that Libby's entitlement torelief from the censureis \"indisputably clear.\" The GOP lawmaker celebrated the Supreme Court decision in an X post. \"This is a victory not just for my constituents, but for the Constitution itself. The Supreme Court has affirmed what should NEVER have been in question — that no state legislature has the power to silence an elected official simply for speaking truthfully about issues that matter,\" Libby wrote. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM FILE -State Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Auburn, speaks with a colleague, Feb. 14, 2023, at the State House in Augusta, Maine.(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) Meanwhile, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. Jackson criticized the grant of emergency relief for Libby, and broader concerns of ‘shadow docket’ emergency appeals.' \"The watering down of our Court’s standards for granting emergency relief is, to me, an unfortunate development,\" Jackson said. \"At the very least, by lowering the bar for granting emergency relief, the Court itself will bear responsibility for the resulting systemic disruption, as a surge in requests for our 'extraordinary' intervention—at earlier and earlier stages of ongoing lower court proceedings, and with greater and greater frequency—will undoubtedly follow.\" Ever since her censure was placed in February, Libby has argued that her post did not initially publicize the incident or the figure, since the athlete had already been publicized in other media. Libby previously told Fox News Digital that no one from the school or the athlete's family ever reached out to her about the post. The first person Libby says she heard from that took issue with her post was Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, who she is now suing for censuring her over the post. \"He found it objectionable and asked me to take it down, at the same time I asked him if he would support Maine girls, and support policy that stopped discrimination against Maine young women in sports and he declined to answer,\" Libby said. \"The main criticism all along from the Democrats is that it was a picture of a minor.\" MAINE TEENS ARE BATTLING STATE DEMOCRATS ON GIRLS' SPORTS BILL AFTER ENDURING TRANS ATHLETE CHAOS IN HIGH SCHOOL Fecteau's office previously provided documents to Fox News Digital confirming the conversation took place. \"I am asking you to take the post down,\" Fecteau wrote in a letter to Libby on Feb. 18. \"In addition to risking the young person's safety, your post violates one of the long held political traditions of ‘leaving kids out of it’ — a tradition that has even been observed by political pundits with regard to the treatment of kids who are in the White House, the most scrutinized office in the nation.\" Then, after the censure was passed at the state house in February, Fecteau told Libby that the censure would be revoked if she apologized for the social media post. But Libby firmly refused. Instead, the state representative filed a lawsuit to have the censure overturned, but was ruled against by Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose, who was appointed by former President Biden in January. DuBose presided over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take the case. Libby then filed an appeal to First Circuit Court of Appeals, but was ruled against there too. So she took her case to the Supreme Court in April. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP State Rep Laurel Libby(Fox News) The defendants,Fecteau and House Clerk Robert Hunt, represented by Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey, defended the decision to censure Libby for the February post in their response to the Supreme Court appeal last week. \"Like other censures of Maine House members, the censure resolution required Rep. Libby to apologize for her conduct—not recant her views. Rep. Libby has steadfastly refused to comply with this modest punishment, which is designed to restore the integrity and reputation of the body,\" the response read. \"Her refusal places her in breach of a centuries-old rule of the Maine House, Rule 401(11), that Rep. Libby previously agreed, along with all of her House colleagues, would govern House proceedings. Rule 401(11) provides that a member found by the body to be in breach of its rules may not participate in floor debates or vote on matters before the full House until they have 'made satisfaction,' i.e., here, apologized for their breach.\" Libby had the support of the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi, who filed an amicus brief supporting Libby in her lawsuit, and Bondi has personally spoken out in support of the embattled Republican state representative. \"The Department of Justiceis proud to fight for girls in Maine and stand alongside Rep. Libby, who is being attacked simply for defending girls in her home state.  As our lawsuit against the state of Maine illustrates, we will always protect girls’ sports and girls’ spaces from radical gender ideology,\" Bondi told Fox News Digital.

Tyra Mae Steele is poised to become a rising star on the WWE NXT roster as soon as she steps into the ring on the brand following her\"WWE Legends and Future Greats\"(\"WWE LFG\") victory. For Steele,pro wrestlingwas not always in the cards. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tyra Mae Steele won the women's portion of \"WWE LFG.\"(WWE) Anyone who watched the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 may know Steele as Tamyra Mensah-Stock. She won the gold medal in the women’s 68-kilogram freestyle competition, becoming the first female African American and first Black female wrestler to win Olympic gold. She became a viral sensation during the Summer Olympics. However, she told Fox News Digital in a recent interview that the drive to stay on the wrestling mountain top began to wither away and that freestyle wrestling was becoming more of a chore. \"I’m a natural athlete. God gave me a natural ability to just crush people and I love doing it and I enjoy doing it. When I won theOlympics, I had a lot of pleasure in it, but it was during COVID when nobody was around, and it was very, very unfortunate that there wasn’t anybody in the crowd,\" she said. \"I wrestled for another two years and I didn’t have much love for it. \"Every time I would wrestle somebody, it was easy overseas. And what I love is putting in hard work and having somebody combat me and just having that fight. That what brings me joy and pleasure – I don’t know why, I’m sadistic, but whatever you want to call it, it’s the fighter in me.\" Tamyra Mensah-Stock of Team United States celebrates defeating Blessing Oborududu of Team Nigeria during the Women's Freestyle 68kg Gold Medal Match on day eleven of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games at Makuhari Messe Hall on Aug. 3, 2021 in Chiba, Japan.(Tom Pennington/Getty Images) WWE STAR ZELINA VEGA RECALLS WRESTLING IN NJ, MAKING HISTORY AS US CHAMP AND TOUTS SUMMERSLAM Steele said she got \"bored\" with Olympic training, and when WWE knocked on her door, she answered.

It’s been an absolute blessing with me being here. I have found, I swear, joy in life all over again.\" Putting weight cutting behind her and the ability to showcase her personality more was something that appealed to Steele as well. She embraced the new challenge in a new sport. \"So, why am I here? I’m here because I feel like I’m called to be here,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"I’m here because I enjoy the fight. I’m here because I get a fresh start to be a new person and to get my face and my energy into new eyes. And, I can also bring my fans that are like, ‘No, wait, do another Olympics.’ No, no, no.

    "title": "Pam Bondi backs Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby's Supreme Court appeal after being censured for trans athlete post",
    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court, and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. EXCLUSIVE:The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Attorney General Pam Bondi have come out in support of Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby as she seeks to have hercensure in the state legislatureoverturned. Libby hasbeen censured since February after the state's Democrat majority voted to take away her voting and speaking rights for a social media post that identified a transgender high school athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition earlier that month. Libby filed a lawsuit in response and is now looking for U.S. Supreme Court intervention after a district judge and the court of appeals ruled against her. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The DOJ has now filed an amicus brief supporting Libby in her lawsuit, and Bondi has personally spoken out in support of the embattled Republican state representative. \"The Department of Justiceis proud to fight for girls in Maine and stand alongside Rep. Libby, who is being attacked simply for defending girls in her home state.  As our lawsuit against the state of Maine illustrates, we will always protect girls’ sports and girls’ spaces from radical gender ideology,\" Bondi told Fox News Digital. The amicus brief argues that Libby's censure violates the Equal Protection Clause’s \"one-person, one-vote\" guarantee, as the state legislature withdrew her voting and speaking rights for a private act and offered to remove the censure if Libby apologizes. \"Stripping District 90’s voters of their house representation and vote because their chosen representative will not apologize for fulfilling this obligation is well beyond the bounds of an appropriate sanction,\" the document read. DOJ Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon spoke out in support of Libby as well. \"The Maine House Speaker silenced Rep. Laurel Libby for refusing to apologize over her stance against male athletes in girls’ sports. This isn’t leadership, it’s unconstitutional. The Civil Rights Division stands ready to defend the rule of law,\" Dhillon told Fox News Digital. MAINE TEENS ARE BATTLING STATE DEMOCRATS ON GIRLS' SPORTS BILL AFTER ENDURING TRANS ATHLETE CHAOS IN HIGH SCHOOL Libby herself has insisted she will not apologize for the social media post and previously told Fox News Digital that no one from the trans athlete's family or high school reached out to her about the post. She has also argued the athlete was already publicized in other media. The Portland Press Herald published a recap of the event, mentioning the athlete, before Libby made her post. Libby's lawsuit names Maine House SpeakerRyan Fecteauand House Clerk Robert Hunt as the defendants, and they are represented by Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey. Fecteau, Hunt and Frey all defended the decision to censure Libby for the February post in their response last week. \"Like other censures of Maine House members, the censure resolution required Rep. Libby to apologize for her conduct—not recant her views. Rep. Libby has steadfastly refused to comply with this modest punishment, which is designed to restore the integrity and reputation of the body,\" the response read. \"Her refusal places her in breach of a centuries-old rule of the Maine House, Rule 401(11), that Rep. Libby previously agreed, along with all of her House colleagues, would govern House proceedings. Rule 401(11) provides that a member found by the body to be in breach of its rules may not participate in floor debates or vote on matters before the full House until they have 'made satisfaction,' i.e., here, apologized for their breach.\" Maine's Democrats, led by Gov. Janet Mills, have fought unyieldingly to prevent PresidentDonald Trumpfrom enforcing his \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" in the state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bondi and the DOJ are currently involved in a lawsuit against the state directly over the issue, and Libby was present at the press conference where the lawsuit was announced back in April. Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it is \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls' sports tobiological females.

A survey of 2,019 U.K. parents,conducted by Perspectus Globaland commissioned by Swiss privacy tech company Proton, found that 48% of parents were unaware providers like Google Photos, Apple iCloud, Amazon Photos and Dropbox can access and analyze the photos they upload. TEENS ARE NOW USING AI CHATBOTS TO CREATE AND SPREAD NUDE IMAGES OF CLASSMATES, ALARMING EDUCATION EXPERTS First lady Melania Trump, joined by President Donald Trump, delivers remarks before President Trump signed the Take it Down Act into law in the Rose Garden of the White House May 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) These companiesuse artificial intelligenceto sort images into albums, recognize faces and locations and suggest memories. While convenient, the same technology can also have more dangerous uses, like deepfake videos. Professor Carsten Maple, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Warwick, warns that, with as few as 20 photos, AI tools can create a convincing digital clone of a person, including deepfake videos. These tools don’t need a high-resolution scan or video footage, just a handful ofeveryday pictures in the cloud. \"Parents are unwittingly opening their children up to possible exploitation by criminals who want to use their data for their own purposes,\" Maple told the Edinburgh Evening News. He added that even mundane photos, like a child at school or in the backyard, can reveal names and locations. Fifty-three percent of parents surveyed had no idea this was possible. PROTECTING YOUR DAUGHTER FROM DEEPFAKES AND ONLINE ABUSE President Donald Trump invited first lady Melania Trump to sign the new anti-revenge porn act she helped usher through to the finish line during a signing ceremony at the White House's Rose Garden Monday afternoon.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Over half of parents, 56%, have automatic photo uploads enabled, meaning their phones constantly send new images to the cloud without ever having to tap \"upload.\" WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Even without deepfakes, data collection is extensive. Only 43% of parents knew cloud services collect metadata like time, date and location, and just 36% surveyed were aware that these companies analyze the contents of photos too. Concern is catching up to convenience. Nearly three in four parents (72%) surveyed said photo privacy is important, and 69% acknowledged the risks of digital footprints left by storing family photos online.

Who is looking at them? And what could they be turned into? In the age of AI, a family photo isn’t just a memory, it’s also data which can be scanned, stored, sold and, increasingly, manipulated into deepfakes.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPPerspectus Global did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

    "title": "Ascension healthcare data breach exposes 430,000 patient records",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale. The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers. What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year. Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) According toAscension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data \"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals. The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft. A healthcare worker typing on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration). For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached. The timing aligns with a series ofrecent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign. Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, aBlack Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people. The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care. We reached out to Ascension for a comment on our article but did not hear back before our deadline. A man typing on a laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach. 1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 4) Set up fraud alerts:Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they’ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit. 5) Monitor your credit reports:Regularly check your credit reports throughAnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you’re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage. 6) Change passwords and use a password manager:Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 7) Be wary of social engineering attacks:Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key. HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.

    "title": "Android scam lets hackers use your credit card remotely",
    "article_text": "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams. Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay. It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! An Android phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported byresearchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN. The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card. Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices. SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust. Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card. Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker. Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time. A woman scrolling on her phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT 1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts. 3) Turn off NFC when not in use:NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it. On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you’ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers. 4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it’s possible your banking details are already compromised. That’s why it’s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don’t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It’s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues. 5) Use a personal data removal service:If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they’ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:If you think you’ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don’t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name. 7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority:Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI’sInternet Crime Complaint Centeror theFederal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure. HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China’s Zhiyuan unveiling the world’s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control. Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking. Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo. Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them. On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.

USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT This wearable eVTOL isn't just a cool gadget. Zhiyuan sees it as being useful in all kinds of real-world situations. It could help with emergency rescues, maintaining electrical infrastructure or cleaning skyscrapers. It also has the potential for sightseeing and leisure flights, and it could be used for border patrol or customs inspections. With its versatility and easy controls, this aircraft could be a game changer for both professionals and adventure seekers. However, there is currently no official information on the commercial availability or price of Zhiyuan's tri-ducted wearable eVTOL. The aircraft has completed its first public demonstration, but details about when it will be available for purchase and at what cost remain undisclosed. Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ARE THESE AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORT PODS THE FUTURE OF SKY-HIGH COMMUTING? This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.

    "title": "PAUL MAURO: New Orleans jailbreak exposes flat out failures of federal oversight",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Nate Foy provides updates on day five of the manhunt for the remaining six inmates who escaped a New Orleans jail. 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in. The recent escape of ten inmates from aNew Orleans jailis the latest wake-up call proving that federal consent decrees do more harm than good when it comes to public safety. The jail, part of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office system, has operated under a federal consent decreesince 2013—a full 12 years of federal oversight with little to show in terms of competence, safety, or accountability. This wasn’t a jailbreak from a maximum-security fortress. These inmates—including several facing charges forviolent felonies, including murder—simply walked out of a minimum-security facility that was staffed at 60% of the required personnel.  It was hours before they were even noticed missing. As of this writing, multiple escapees remain at large. Consent decrees were originally intended as a way to reform abusive or corrupt police and correctional systems. But in practice, they often become sprawling bureaucratic disasters. Expensive, unaccountable, and slow to adapt, they tie the hands of local officials while encouraging a mindset of avoidance rather than enforcement. MASSIVE JAIL BREAK IN NEW ORLEANS 'IMPOSSIBLE' WITHOUT STAFF INVOLVEMENT, SAYS EX-FBI FUGITIVE HUNTER Adding insult to injury, the so-called federal \"monitor\" of these consent decrees is usually a private law firm—one that bills taxpayers for millions of dollars in oversight fees. These firms have no incentive to wrap things up quickly, and every delay becomes another invoice paid by the public, not for safety or reform, but for paper-pushing and partner bonuses. The truth is, once instituted, federal monitorships become essentially interminable, with new \"concerns\" surfacing from the worthies-in-charge whenever the decree is in danger of expiring. Some monitorships literally go on for decades. LOUISIANA GOVERNOR BLASTS 'PROGRESSIVE PROMISES' AFTER NEW ORLEANS JAIL ESCAPE That’s why, under the Trump administration,an Executive Orderwas issued last month to review and wind down federal consent decrees imposed on law enforcement agencies across the country. The rationale was simple: let local officials do their job without long-distance interference fromWashington lawyersand ideologues who have no stake in the neighborhoods affected. The New Orleans debacle offers a textbook case in how these agreements backfire. The consent decree for the jail, overseen by a federal judge and an out-of-town monitor, was supposed to improve conditions. Instead, it has delivered chronic understaffing, poor morale, and a culture of indecision. Because one result of consent decrees is often the inability to answer a simple, vital question: Who is running things? The left’s obsession with de-carceration and federal micromanagement is proving to be yet another failed experiment in soft-on-crime governance. New Orleans just became its latest victim. All of this is unfolding as progressive politicians continue pushing the \"decarceration\" movement nationwide—another ideological train wreck that treats fewer jail beds as moral progress, regardless of public safety consequences. InNew York City, for example, Rikers Island, the city jail, is slated to be closed soon in favor of scattered, \"borough-based\" jails – with a diminution of roughly 30% in available prisoner beds. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION New York City locks barely locks anybody up now.  We’re going down 30 percent? At some point, we have to admit the obvious: systems engineered by federal judges, consultants, academics and law firms aren’t delivering safety or reform. They're delivering escapes, lawsuits, public distrust – andcops and corrections officersfearful of doing their jobs without being second-guessed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The left’s obsession with de-carceration and federal micromanagement is proving to be just another failed experiment in soft-on-crime governance. New Orleans just became its latest victim. Let’s hope there aren’t anymore, as the escapees remain at large.

    "title": "Rewarding racism: How tribal politics is tearing America apart",
    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says there's a 'better America' out there beyond 'racial tribalism' and party lines. I have seen much in my time on this earth. Never did I imagine that I would see a White woman call a Black child a racial epithet on a playground and be rewarded with hundreds of thousands of dollars. But, then again, should I have been surprised?Over the last several decades I have witnessed how Black people exploited race from theO.J. Simpson caseto Michael Brown in Ferguson and George Floyd in Minnesota. They used race as their catch-all to subvert justice and/or to advance certain racial ideologies. In all of these cases, tribal loyalty trumped everything even if O.J. was a stone-cold killer who nearly decapitated Nicole Simpson or Michael Brown was high on marijuana when he indisputably charged Officer Darren Wilson. Race was the only thing that mattered.We saw that again recently when Karmelo Anthony, a Black teen, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations — after allegedly stabbing a White teen to death at a Texas track meet. I watched in horror as Black people began creating a narrative around this teen and began throwing money at him – all before due process. This was nothing but pure racial tribalism and I could see how it would be an affront to those outside the race. A BOLD MOVE TO RESCUE CHICAGO'S YOUTH FROM LEFTIST DEPENDENCY So when Shiloh Hendrix ofRochester, Minn., called a Black boy — of Somali heritage and autistic — a racial epithet for the crime of going through her diaper bag, she reacted in a manner that revealed more about her low quality of character than anything. I have kids and anyone who goes to the playground knows that kids are always getting into other people’s stuff. Never once have I heard any decent person insult a kid. You either educate the kid or let the parent know what happened. That’s how you civilize kids.But Shiloh instead spewed racism. When she was being recorded, she doubled down, flipping the camera off and repeated the racial epithet and said, \"I don’t give a sh**.\"The video has been spread across social media platforms like X and TikTok. The NAACP held a town hall, urging authorities to charge Hendrix with a hate crime. The Rochester Police Department investigated but as of now no charges have been filed against Hendrix.It was at this point that Hendrix flipped the script and decided to make herself the victim here. She launched an online fundraiser called, \"Help Me Protect My Family,\" and said she needed to relocate due to \"threats.\"Many conservatives, outraged at the perceived racial double-standard, decided to reward Shiloh’s despicable behavior. These tribal conservatives framed Hendrix as a victim of \"cancel culture\" and said if Blacks can raise money for a black teen charged with murder, then we can support a White lady and her racism.As of May 8, 2025, she had raised $750,000 — all for calling a child a racial epithet. Some call this \"vice signaling\" as opposed to \"virtue signaling.\"Now we have those on the right saying the racial epithet loudly and proudly on social media. We have seemingly endless social media battles where videos featuring the worst attributes of each race are thrown at each other's face.Is America better off?No.Many of us have been fighting for a better America. With Trump in office, we finally have the chance to push back at the racial essentialism that has divided our nation for the last 60 years and even more profoundly so since the death ofGeorge Floyd. Engaging in vice signaling costs us the high moral ground and gives ammunition to the Left — \"See, we told you all along the Right was racist and look at how they uplift a racist.\"Anyone who knows the left knows that the Shiloh debacle is not going to impact or convince them in any way. The left will just exploit this incident as evidence of racism to fuel its long march.But let me tell you what I know. I know there is a better America out there. There is a better America out there where people are beyond sick and tired of this racial tribalism that gets us nowhere. There is a better America where people want to return to the land of individualism, merit and brotherhood across all class, race, and religious lines. There is a better America out there where people want to surround themselves with like-minded people who realize the great gift they have been given by being born in this country and want to use this gift to make themselves into somebodies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONI saw this better America for myself several years ago when I stayed on a rooftop for 346 days to raise money for my new community center on theSouth Side of Chicago. I had no help from the government and I knew my community didn’t have the funds to build this center. And I’m just a pastor who doesn’t know much outside of my faith. All I did wasfollow the path of Jesusand put my faith in America.What I didn’t experience was the lowdown racism of Shiloh Hendrix. Instead, what I experienced was something so beautiful that I will never forget as long as I walk this earth. As I began doing my Rooftop Revelations series, releasing an article and video every day, I started hearing from Americans from all over. Florida. Alabama. Alaska.California. Maine. Rhode Island. Many from places I have never been to. They wrote me letters saying that my stories touched them and they wanted to help. A woman who cleans house wrote that she doesn’t make much but wanted to donate her earrings for a day: $85 dollars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWhat touched me was how they believed in my community. They knew how the policies of post-60s liberalism had made so many people in my community dependent on the government. They wanted to help me help these people restore themselves to the path of the American Dream where they can be somebodies.That’s the America I know and love. I will never let racial tribalism — the work of the devil -- distract me from the greater purpose that is America.

    "title": "Reagan and Trump are more alike than you think",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie has the latest on President-elect Donald Trump's history-making appearance and nominations on 'Special Report.' Ronald Reagan would have appreciated Donald Trump’s moxie.  Stylistically, they are different but all men are different in this regard. Ideologically however, there are many similarities. Reagan spoke out often against the political establishment. Reagan was himself anti-status quo. He was of the conservative/populist Goldwater wing of the GOP. Don’t forget, he ran against the establishment candidate, incumbent PresidentGerald Fordin 1976, almost beating him for the presidential nomination. He ran again in 1980 against the establishment candidates Amb. George H.W. Bush and former Texas Gov. John Connolly, defeated them, and in so doing remade the GOP. TRUMP EMBRACES DEM POLICIES TRADITIONALLY REJECTED BY GOP IN BID TO BUILD 'PARTY OF COMMON SENSE' The president is embracing some Democratic policies in his second term's push for a 'golden age' for America. For men like Reagan and Trump, it’s always been the same: Outsiders versus insiders. British versus the Colonists. Jefferson versus Adams. Goldwater versus Rockefeller. The conservative movement versus the GOP establishment.  Delta House versus Omega House. The Jedi versus the Evil Empire. President Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy wave to the crowd from the Presidential Limosine as they ride down Pennsylvania Avenue during the Inaugural parade January 20, 1981 in Washington, DC. Bill Clintononce said, \"Democrats want to fall in love; Republicans want to fall in line.\" Nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats love power and all its abuses and fall in line behind anyone with perceived power; Republicans fall in love with ideas centered on the individual. Republicans cherished Reagan and now Trump, because both these men have acted on their conservative ideas. ON REAGAN’S BIRTHDAY, HOW HE AND TRUMP HELPED MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN One stark example, Reagan wanted to destroy the Soviet Union which he called an \"Evil Empire.\" He wanted to consign it to the \"ash heap\" of history. Meanwhile the political establishment supported \"Détente\" which was co-existence, even as the Soviets were gobbling up the rest of the world, Reagan was challenging this way of thinking. The Berlin Wall fell as a result of Reagan’s conservative actions. He wanted to eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy seeing them as fraudulent and wasteful. Just as Trump is now doing. The entrenched establishment supported them even as they were worthless, counter-productive and costly. President Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025.(MORRY GASH/AFP via Getty Images) Reagan supported gay rights long before it was fashionable or accepted by the political establishment because it was about the individual. Later, as president, Reagan was never comfortable in the trappings of Washington, often leaving for the weekend to go the Camp David or for longer trips to his ranch inSanta Barbara. WILLIAM J. BENNETT, CHRIS BEACH: 5 WAYS TRUMP HAS TRANSFORMED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY When he left Washington in January 1989, he only returned once to accept the Medal of Freedom award from President George W. Bush 43. Reagan was wildly popular with blue-collar voters, just as Trump now is. And yes, both men had and have a tremendous sense of humor.Joe Biden? He is the butt of jokes. The Republican Party has changed its positions on many issues over the years, whereas the Democratic Party has remained more or less constant as the pro-government party, since 1932. The GOP used to be the balanced budget, Green eyeshade party before Ronald Reagan introduced tax cuts as a canon of the party, to liberate the individual. 'NEW GOLDEN AGE': REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ECSTATIC AS TRUMP TAKES OFFICE WITH SLATE OF NEW ORDERS The party has switched back and forth on trade and other matters over the years. But in 1980,Reaganbrought a cluster of issues to the party which it still embraces and Trump pursues today. Tax cuts, federalism, strong national defense, pro-life, all centered on the importance of the individual. Reagan often said, \"Our party must be the party of the individual.\" All these issuesDonald Trumphas heartily embraced. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The only issue with separates them may be trade, but Reagan also used tariffs to save Harley-Davidson from cheap Japanese imports, thus saving a cherished company. Everything Reagan did must be judged in the shadow of the Cold War. He supported NAFTA and the Caribbean Basin Initiative as they strengthened the trading, cultural and political ties between these Western Hemisphere countries. And, for Reagan, they were a restatement of the Monroe Doctrine.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: Biden cancer announcement has my sympathy and my skepticism",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her reaction to former President Biden's cancer diagnosis and lingering questions surrounding the announcement. Former PresidentJoe Bidenannounced over the weekend that he had just recently been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. A statement from the former president’s office identified the cancer as \"aggressive\" but also \"hormone sensitive,\" indicating the possibility of \"effective management.\" The news generated an outpouring of sympathy from friends and foes alike. President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.\" We share that concern and optimism; we hope the former president beats the disease. But, like much of the public, our initial sympathy has turned skeptical. Doctors say that it is highly unlikely anyone could be \"suddenly\" diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. Especially one which, according to Biden’s statement, had metastasized into his bone. POLITICAL WORLD REACTS TO FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 'AGGRESSIVE' CANCER DIAGNOSIS: 'INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT' Nearly every man over 50 gets checked regularly forprostate cancer. Certainly, a U.S. president, and especially one under close surveillance for age-related illnesses, would have been examined rigorously for a disease that strikes one in seven men during their lifetime. Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel, an oncologist and Democrat policy-maker, told Joe Scarborough on MSNBC, that Biden had certainly had the disease for \"more than several years.\" \"He did not develop it in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. I don't think there's any disagreement about that.\" Pressed by Scarborough on whether Biden would have been tested for prostate cancer, Emmanuel said most White House doctors would likely recommend the test. During their administrations, as he pointed out, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both got the test, even though they were younger than Biden. MEDICAL EXPERT 'ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED' BY TIMING OF BIDEN'S PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS Dr. Steven Quay, a board-certified anatomic pathologist, noted on X: \"Prostate cancer is the easiest cancer to diagnose when it first starts and to watch it progress to bone metastases… For even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic.\" Some observers have noted that in 2022, then-President Biden gave a peculiar speech about pollution causing oil slicks on his family’s car window, saying \"That’s why I and so damn many other people I grew up with have cancer and why…for the longest time Delaware has the highest cancer rate in the nation.\" BIDEN SPEAKS OUT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE CANCER DIAGNOSIS At the time, this was dismissed by the White House as just another of Biden’s famous \"gaffes,\" with his staff denying he had cancer. In retrospect, the president may have been telling the truth, for once. Why would President Biden and his inner circle have withheld his cancer diagnosis from the public? And why come out with it now? When Biden ran for the Oval Office in 2020, at the age of 77, critics questioned his health and his ability to serve in the toughest job on earth for four years. Many cited his evident cognitive challenges; political opponents argued that Biden’s handlers kept him largely hidden in his basement during the campaign to hide his mental lapses, using COVID as a pretext. CNN'S AXELROD SUGGESTS DISCUSSIONS AROUND BIDEN’S MENTAL ACUITY SHOULD BE SET ASIDE AMID CANCER DIAGNOSIS In the Democratic primaries, opponents used his age against him. During one 2019 debate, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro accused Biden of forgetting something he had just said, implying he was too old for the job. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., also vying for the nomination, expressed concern about Biden’s age as well. If Biden had acknowledged at that time that he was ill with a life-threatening disease, he would probably not have won the nomination and he almost certainly would not have beatenDonald Trumpin what turned out to be a very close election. After just one year in office, with Biden still ducking interviews and press conferences, doubts had grown about Biden’s fitness, witha poll revealingthat only 40% of voters agreed that Biden \"is in good health,\" while 50 percent disagreed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Biden, Inc. has plenty of reasons to go public with his cancer diagnosis today.  Axios recently released audio tapes of the former president being interviewed bySpecial Counsel Robert Hur, which shows the president struggling with serious memory lapses and unable to answer simple questions. The recordings make Hur’s famous description of Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory\" appear generous. In addition, on Tuesday, the much-heralded book \"Original Sin\" by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, goes on sale. The book exposes the frantic efforts by Biden’s inner circle to hide his decline hidden from the public. The book’s revelations raise anew charges that it was not only the White House that lied to the American people about Biden’s decline, but that the Democratic Party and their media allies did as well. Partly because of that coverup, approval ratings for the party are at all-time lows, and trust in the liberal media has collapsed. Democrats are furious with Joe Biden, critical of his decision to stay in the race which, they say, cost them the election. They would prefer he retire to the sidelines, but the former president apparently wants to remain in view, making speeches and also making money. His few recent outings have not gone well, with signature lapses and stumbles reminding the nation of – yes -- the Big Lie that he was, to quote one admirer, \"sharp as a tack.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrat allyDavid Axelrodtold CNN that conversations about the coverup of Biden’s decline should be \"more muted and set aside for now\" because of his cancer diagnosis. If that was the motivation behind the announcement -- if revealing the cancer diagnosis was meant to elicit sympathy, and distract from the torrent of bad publicity flowing from ex-staffers and disillusioned Democrats, it looks like a bust. People can be sorry the former president is ill but remain angry that he and his inner circle perpetrated the greatest political scandal of our lifetimes. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

    "article_text": "Israeli Minister of Culture Miki Zohar joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss misinformation against Israel and President Donald Trump's influence in the Middle East. President Donald Trump’s tour of the Middle East would receive an A+ with an asterisk from any objective observer. The asterisk is because of his meeting with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The former Al Qaeda member battled and probably killed American troops in Iraq. The 42-year-old did time in Abu Graib prison and has been fighting the now-toppled Assad regime for years. Syria has become, in effect, three statelets on its way to perhaps four or five, but al-Sharaa runs much of Damascus and its suburbs. From that position of strength he can block Iran from resupplying the Hezbollah forces in Lebanon —a very good result for Lebanon and the region. TRUMP'S MIDDLE EAST TRIP HANDED ISRAEL A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY – IF IT CHOOSES TO ACT, EXPERTS SAY Trump met with al-Assad at the request of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (\"MBS\") and Turkey’s President Recep Erdogan. According to the U.S. \"readout\" of the meeting, the U.S. president demanded the Syrian warlord deport Palestinian terrorists, sign the Abraham Accords recognizing Israel’s right to exist, exile all other foreign terrorists from the portions of Syria he controls, and battle ISIS where it remains in Syria. That’s a good set of \"asks\" by Trump. If Trump’s conditions are met, remove the asterisk. Time will tell and not weeks or even months. If al-Shaara wants to stand up his own statelet, he will invite the U.S. to remove or destroy the chemical weapons depots that still exist in the hidden caches maintained by the Assad regime from the time when Barack Obama caved on his own \"red line\" in exchange for a half-hearted effort by Russia to remove some of the deadly weapons. If Israel and Syria achieve a cold peace much less a warm one, more kudos to President Trump. The Middle East is being remade and Trump is poised to knock Iran off its remaining claim to power in the region if the mullahs in Tehran don’t see reason. The U.S. and Israel can conduct the operations necessary to cripple Ayatollah Khamenei’s dreams of a nuclear weapon without committing the U.S. to a war, and the president has said Iran has one of two choices at least a dozen times and without any ambiguity, including to me on air. \"I would much prefer a strong, verified deal where we actually blow them up, but blow them up or just de-nuke them,\" Trump told me. \"But the other alternative, there are only two alternatives there – blow them up nicely or blow them up viciously.\" That’s tough talk, but Trump is a tough negotiator and his record of follow-through on threats made to foreign powers speaks for itself. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION With every Gulf nation seated at a circular table when Trump sat down with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the president repeated the same, stark choice before Khamenei, added in Iran’s abandonment of terror and added for good measure the Palestinian leadership’s renunciation of \"rape, torture and murder,\" and explicitly demanded the release of the hostages as a \"stepping stone\" to peace, not part of a deal. Trump, in short, was at his bluntest best. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The economic deals he signed are enormous and the potential for \"AI\" partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are powering a surge in optimism for \"AI\"-based equities as the quartet of the U.S.-Israel-the Kingdom—U.A.E. Is impossible to top when it comes to a joint venture on anything, but especially for breakout \"AI\" advances. The other deals with American defense firms are great for that sector of our economy, its employees and shareholders in the U.S., and world stability that depends on a strong America with well-trained and equipped allies. Check and check. Trump’s always \"outside-the-box\" when it comes to diplomacy. That’s why the U.S. embassy is in Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords exist. Trump doesn’t play by Council on Foreign Relations rules because he’s not interested in its seminars and the approval of its senior fellows but in creating seminal moments. Last week’s trip was one of the latter.

Brin was a surprise addition to an interview with Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis conducted by Big Technology Podcast’s Alex Kantrowitz. Brin went on to say he “didn’t know anything about consumer electronic supply chains,” or how difficult it would be to build smart glasses at a reasonable price point. The Google co-founder noted he’s a big believer in the form factor of smart glasses, and said he’s glad the company is pursuing them yet again, this time with “great partners who are helping us build this.” Earlier on Tuesday, Google unveiled its latest effort to developAndroid XR smart glasses,roughly a decade after the Google Glass project shut down. Onstage, Google leaders showcased how their smart glasses, powered by DeepMind’s Project Astra, could assist with live translations, directions, and generally AI queries. To develop Android XR glasses with AI and AR capabilities, Google is working with a network of partners, such as Samsung and Xreal. Google is alsoinvesting up to $150 million in a partnership with Warby Parker, and taking an equity stake in the eyewear company, to support its smart glasses efforts. As Brin referenced, those experienced eyewear and electronics makers may be able to help with some of the supply chain problems associated with producing smart glasses. Brin noted how the advent of generative AI makes the capabilities of smart glasses much more tangible than when Google Glass was around. Earlier in the interview, Brin acknowledged how he’s effectively come out of retirement to work on Google’s Gemini efforts. The Google co-founder says he’s in the Mountain View, California office nearly every day, and says he’s helping the Gemini team with multimodal projects, such as Google’s video-generating model Veo 3. “Anybody who’s a computer scientist should not be retired right now,” said Brin. “They should be working on AI.” Previous reports have suggested thatBrin has pushed Google’s Gemini teams quite aggressivelyto compete in the AI race. Reportedly, Brin told Google employees in a memo they should be in the office at least every weekday, and that working 60 hours a week is likely the sweet spot for productivity.

DuringGoogle I/O 2025on Tuesday, Google took the wraps off Gemma 3n, a model designed to run “smoothly” on phones, laptops, and tablets. Available in preview starting Tuesday, Gemma 3n can handle audio, text, images, and videos, according to Google. Models efficient enough to run offline and without the need for computing in the cloud have gained steam in the AI community in recent years. Not only are they cheaper to use than large models, but they preserve privacy by eliminating the need to transfer data to a remote data center. During a keynote at I/O, Gemma Product Manager Gus Martins said that Gemma 3n can run on devices with less than 2GB of RAM. “Gemma 3n shares the same architecture asGemini Nano, and is and is engineered for incredible performance,” he added. In addition to Gemma 3n, Google is releasing MedGemma through its Health AI Developer Foundations program. According to the company, MedGemma is its most capable open model for analyzing health-related text and images. “MedGemma [is] our […] collection of open models for multimodal [health] text and image understanding,” Martins said. “MedGemma works great across a range of image and text applications, so that developers […] can adapt the models for their own health apps.” Also on the horizon is SignGemma, an open model to translate sign language into spoken-language text. Google says that SignGemma will enable developers to create new apps and integrations for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. “SignGemma is a new family of models trained to translate sign language to spoken-language text, but it’s best at American Sign Language and English,” Martins said. “It’s the most capable sign language understanding model ever, and we can’t wait for you — developers and deaf and hard-of-hearing communities — to take this foundation and build with it.” Worth noting is that Gemma has been criticized for its custom, non-standard licensing terms, whichsome developers sayhave made using the models commercially a risky proposition. That hasn’t dissuaded developers from downloading Gemma modelstens of millions of timescollectively, however. Updated 2:40 p.m. Pacific: Added several quotes from Gemma Product Manager Gus Martins.

Google has already committed $75 million to Warby Parker’s product development and commercialization costs, the companies said in apress release. Google says it will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones. At Google I/O 2025, Google alsoannounced partnerships with several companiesto develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and Gentle Monster. Google seems to be taking a page out of Meta’s smart glasses strategy. Meta has found success partnering and investing in the Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica to develop its smart glasses. Part of the reason behind Ray-Ban Meta’s success is that the smart glasses have an attractive, familiar design and they’re being sold in Ray-Ban stores. It seems likely that Google will have a similar relationship with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company’s popular frame designs and perhaps its retail stores. In the press release, Warby Parker and Google said they intend to launch a series of products over time. Their first line of eyewear will launch “after 2025” and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses.

Scales used to work on talent acquisition at xAI. Since April, she’s worked on the talent side of the company once again,per her LinkedIn profile. Previously, Scales was in human resources and talent at San Francisco-based VC firm Human Capital, as well as at Uber. Scales’ return to xAI comes as Musk has indicated that he plans to pull back from DOGE. The tech billionaire has made himself increasingly scarce in Washington, according to the Times. Last month, Musk told Wall Street analysts that he planned to spend less time on politics and more on his companies like Tesla. Sales at Teslahave suffered since Musk devoted more time and resources to DOGE. Last month, a group of employees published an open letter calling for his removal as CEO.

Tesla’s cars are “not going to take intersections unless we are highly confident [they’re] going to do well with that intersection, or it’ll just take a route around that intersection,” Musk said. “We’re going to be extremely paranoid about the deployment, as we should be. It would be foolish not to be.” Using a geofence represents a major strategy shift for Musk, who spent years claiming his company would be able to create a general purpose self-driving solution that could be dropped in to any location and work without human supervision. (Geofence is a jargon term used in the autonomous vehicle industry that means vehicle is restricted to a certain area.) Musk has claimed Tesla will attempt to launch similar trials for its robotaxi service in California and possibly other states later this year. Musk telegraphed the idea of using a geofence on Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call in April, though he did not explicitly say that was the approach the company would use. The CEO said at the time that it was “increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set” for its early robotaxi operations. As part of Tesla’s “paranoid” approach, Musk said Tuesday the company will have employees remotely monitor the initial fleet of around 10 Model Y SUVs equipped with the “unsupervised” version of its Full Self-Driving software. Musk also claimed those vehicles will be driving without any safety operator inside. “I think it’s prudent for us to start with a small number, confirm that things are going well, and then scale it up proportionate to how well we see it’s doing,” he said. It is common practice for autonomous vehicle companies like Waymo to have an operations center staffed with people who are monitoring their robotaxis and providing remote guidance, if needed. Waymo, whichposted a blog on the topic in 2024, doesn’t take take control of the vehicles though. Instead human employees primarily communicate through questions and answers with the self-driving system to give it proper context and help it problem solve.

We’re on the ground bringing you the latest updates from the event. I/O showcases product announcements from across Google’s portfolio. We’ve got plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and — of course — Google’s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini. Google hosted a separate event dedicated to Android updates:The Android Show. The company announcednew ways to find lost Android phones and other items,additional device-level features for its Advanced Protection program,security tools to protect against scams and theft, anda new design language called Material 3 Expressive. Here are all the things announced at Google I/O 2025. Gemini Ultra (only in the U.S. for now) delivers the “highest level of access” to Google’s AI-powered apps and services, according to Google.It’s priced at $249.99 per monthand includes Google’s Veo 3 video generator, the company’s new Flow video editing app, and a powerful AI capability called Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think mode, which hasn’t launched yet. AI Ultra comes with higher limits in Google’s NotebookLM platform andWhisk, the company’s image remixing app. AI Ultra subscribers also get access to Google’s Gemini chatbot in Chrome; some “agentic” tools powered by the company’sProject Marinertech; YouTube Premium; and 30TB of storage across Google Drive, Google Photos, and Gmail. Deep Think is an“enhanced” reasoning modefor Google’s flagship Gemini 2.5 Pro model. It allows the model to consider multiple answers to questions before responding, boosting its performance on certain benchmarks. Google didn’t go into detail about Deep Think works, but it could be similar to OpenAI’s o1-pro and upcoming o3-pro models, which likely use an engine to search for and synthesize the best solution to a given problem. Deep Think is available to “trusted testers” via the Gemini API. Google said that it’s taking additional time to conduct safety evaluations before rolling out Deep Think widely. Google claims that Veo 3 can generate sound effects, background noises, and even dialogue to accompany the videos it creates.Veo 3 also improves upon its predecessor, Veo 2, in terms of the quality of footage it can generate, Google says. Veo 3 is available beginning Tuesday in Google’s Gemini chatbot app for subscribers to Google’s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan, where it can be prompted with text or an image. According to Google,Imagen 4 is fast— faster than Imagen 3. And it’ll soon get faster. In the near future, Google plans to release a variant of Imagen 4 that’s up to 10x quicker than Imagen 3. Imagen 4 is capable of rendering “fine details” like fabrics, water droplets, and animal fur, according to Google. It can handle both photorealistic and abstract styles, creating images in a range of aspect ratios and up to 2K resolution. Both Veo 3 and Imagen 4 will beused to power Flow, the company’s AI-powered video tool geared towards filmmaking. Google announced thatGemini apps have more than 400 monthly active users. Gemini Live’scamera and screen-sharing capabilitieswill roll out this week to all users on iOS and Android. The feature, powered by Project Astra, lets people have near-real time verbal conversations with Gemini, while also streaming video from their smartphone’s camera or screen to the AI model. Google says Gemini Live will also start to integrate more deeply with its other apps in the coming weeks: It will soon be able to offer directions from Google Maps, create events in Google Calendar, and make to-do lists with Google Tasks. Google says it’s updating Deep Research, Gemini’s AI agent that generates thorough research reports, by allowing users to upload their own private PDFs and images. Stitch is an AI-powered tool to help people design web and mobile app front ends by generating the necessary UI elements and code.Stitch can be promptedto create app UIs with a few words or even an image, providing HTML and CSS markup for the designs it generates. Stitch is a bit more limited in what it can do compared to some other vibe coding products, but there’s a fair amount of customization options. Google has also expanded access toJules, its AI agent aimed at helping developers fix bugs in code. The tool helps developers understand complex code, create pull requests on GitHub, and handle certain backlog items and programming tasks. Project Mariner is Google’s experimental AI agent that browses and uses websites. Google says it hassignificantly updated how Project Mariner works, allowing the agent to take on nearly a dozen tasks at a time, and is now rolling it out to users. For example, Project Mariner users can purchase tickets to a baseball game or buy groceries online without ever visiting a third-party website. People can just chat with Google’s AI agent, and it visits websites and takes actions for them. Google’s low latency, multimodal AI experience,Project Astra, will power an array of new experiences in Search, the Gemini AI app, and products from third-party developers. Project Astra was born out of Google DeepMind as a way to showcase nearly real-time, multimodal AI capabilities. The company says it’s now building those Project Astra glasses with partners including Samsung andWarby Parker, but the company doesn’t have a set launch date yet. Google is rolling out AI Mode, the experimentalGoogle Search featurethat lets people ask complex, multi-part questions via an AI interface, to users in the U.S. this week. AI Mode will support the use of complex data in sports and finance queries, and it will offer “try it on” options for apparel. Search Live, which is rolling out later this summer, will let you ask questions based on what your phone’s camera is seeing in real-time. Gmail is the first app to be supported with personalized context. Beam, previously called Starline, uses a combination of software and hardware, including a six-camera array and custom light field display, to let a user converse with someone as if they were in the same meeting room. An AI model converts video from the cameras, which are positioned at different angles and pointed toward the user, into a 3D rendering. Google’s Beam boasts “near-perfect” millimeter-level head tracking and 60fps video streaming. When used with Google Meet, Beam provides an AI-powered real-time speech translation feature that preserves the original speaker’s voice, tone, and expressions. And speaking of Google Meet, Google announced thatMeet is getting real-time speech translation. Google is launchingGemini in Chrome, which will give people access to a new AI browsing assistant that will help them quickly understand the context of a page and get tasks done. Gemma 3n is a model designed torun “smoothly” on phones, laptops, and tablets. It’s available in preview starting Tuesday; it can handle audio, text, images, and videos, according to Google. The company also announced a ton ofAI Workspace featurescoming to Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Vids. Most notably, Gmail is getting personalized smart replies and a new inbox-cleaning feature, while Vids is getting new ways to create and edit content. Video Overviews are coming to NotebookLM, and the company rolled outSynthID Detector, a verification portal that uses Google’s SynthID watermarking technology to help identify AI-generated content.Lyria RealTime, the AI model that powers its experimental music production app, is now available via an API. Wear OS 6brings a unified font to tiles for a cleaner app look, and Pixel Watches are getting dynamic theming that syncs app colors with watch faces. The core promise of the new design reference platform is to let developers build better customization in apps along with seamless transitions. The company is releasinga design guidelinefor developers along withFigma design files. Google isbeefing up the Play Store for Android developerswith fresh tools to handle subscriptions, topic pages so users can dive into specific interests, audio samples to give folks a sneak peek into app content, and a new checkout experience to make selling add-ons smoother. “Topic browse” pages for movies and shows (U.S. only for now) will connect users to apps tied to tons of shows and movies. Plus, developers are getting dedicated pages for testing and releases, and tools to keep an eye on and improve their app rollouts. Developers using Google can also now halt live app releases if a critical problem pops up. Subscription management tools are also getting an upgrade with multi-product checkout. Devs will soon be able to offer subscription add-ons alongside main subscriptions, all under one payment. Android Studio is integrating new AI features, including “Journeys,” an “agentic AI” capability that coincides with the release of the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. And an “Agent Mode” will be able to handle more-intricate development processes. Android Studio will receive new AI capabilities, including an enhanced “crash insights” feature in the App Quality Insights panel. This improvement, powered by Gemini, will analyze an app’s source code to identify potential causes of crashes and suggest fixes.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google isrolling outa series of upgrades to its Play Store to help Android app developers better market their software and services to consumers. Among the highlights are new tools for managing subscription apps, topic pages that let users explore a specific subject on the Play Store, a new feature that allows people to sample audio from developers’ apps, and a more flexible checkout experience that will make it easier for developers to sell add-ons, among other things. Google last week shared a number ofAndroid-related announcementsat a pre-show before the start of its annual developer conference, Google I/O. However, it saved the Play Store improvements forTuesday’s keynote at Google I/O, highlighting their importance to Google’s bottom line. Today, tech giants like Apple and Google are facing a market where app developers have more choice in how they price and sell their mobile software, thanks to anticompetitive regulations, new laws, and recent court victories. As a result, Google has been working to make its own Android app marketplace more compelling for developers, who now collectively sell over a quarter-billion subscriptions. For starters, the company said it’s giving developers the useful ability to halt fully live app releases if the developer identifies a problem that needs to be quickly addressed. Another feature, initially only available in the U.S., will add new “topic browse” pages for media and entertainment on the Play Store, allowing users to connect with apps related to over 100,000 different shows and movies. For example, you could look up a favorite show, movie, or sports event and find out which apps you could use to stream them. (Plus, the existing “Where to Watch” feature that deep links users to their subscribed apps will roll out to the U.K., Korea, Indonesia, and Mexico after it initially launched in the U.S. last year.) These pages will be accessible from multiple places within the Play Store, including the Apps Home page, store listing pages, and search. Developers will also be able to add a hero content carousel and YouTube playlist carousel to app listings on the Play Store. For apps that have audio content, the Play Store will soon launch audio samples on the Apps Home page. (This feature is already live for Health & Wellness app developers in the U.S. Google says in early tests, audio samples helped improve app installs by 3x.) Curated spaces, a feature launched last year to Google Play users to connect with their interests — like comics or soccer, for instance — will also roll out to more locations and categories this year. Google noted that the curated space for comics was fairly popular, reaching over 920,000 users in Japan per month. In the Play Console for managing apps, a new asset library will help developers organize their visual assets, including uploading them from Google Drive, tagging them, and cropping them for reuse. Other new metrics will offer insights into apps’ listing performance. New dedicated overview pages for testing and releasing software will arrive, as well as pages focused on monitoring and improving app releases. Both of these will include additional metrics and actionable advice for developers in a new “Take Action” section. Subscription management tools are getting an upgrade, too, with added support for multi-product checkout for subscriptions, which means developers will be able to sell subscription add-ons alongside their base subscriptions under a single payment schedule. For users, this leads to a simplified checkout experience, while also letting them better control their subscriptions when it comes time to upgrade or downgrade their add-ons. The Play Store will remind users of their subscription benefits in more places, including in the Subscription Center, in reminder emails, and during purchase and cancellation flows. The changes, which have already rolled out, are decreasing voluntary churn by 3%, Google claims. Developers will additionally be able to choose to offer a grace period of 30 days or account hold of up to 60 days when their customers’ payment method declines, giving the users time to fix the problem before their account is cancelled. TheEngage SDK,launched last year,has offered developers a way to send personalized content recommendations to users’ home screens on Android devices. Now it’s adding support for more categories, like Travel, and is rolling out to more markets, including Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Mexico. Plus, content created with the SDK will be featured on the Play Store later this summer, in addition to existing spaces likeCollections on users’ Android smartphonesor the Entertainment Space on select Android tablets. Google notes that thePlay Integrity API,which is designed to help combat emerging threats on the Play Store, has been enhanced with stronger abuse detection for all developers and device security update checks to safeguard an app’s more sensitive actions, like transfers or data access. It will also be able to detect if a device is being reused for abuse or repeated actions, even after a device reset. This latter feature will be offered inbeta.

Google also says it’s significantly updated how Project Mariner works, allowing the agent to take on nearly a dozen tasks at a time. U.S. subscribers to Google’s new$249.99-per-month AI Ultra planwill get access to Project Mariner, and the company says support for more countries is coming soon. Google also says it’s bringing Project Mariner’s capabilities to the Gemini API and Vertex AI, allowing developers to build out applications powered by the agent. First unveiled in late 2024,Project Marinerrepresents Google’s boldest effort yet to revamp how users interact with the internet through AI agents. At launch, Google Search leaders said they viewed Project Mariner as part of a fundamental user experience shift, in which people will delegate more tasks to an AI agent, instead of visiting websites and completing those tasks themselves. For example, Project Mariner users can purchase tickets to a baseball game or buy groceries online without ever visiting a third-party website — they just chat with Google’s AI agent, and it visits websites and takes actions for them. Project Mariner competes with other web-browsing AI agents, such asOpenAI’s Operator,Amazon’s Nova Act, andAnthropic’s Computer Use. These tools are all in an experimental stage, and TechCrunch’s experience has proven the prototypes to be slow and prone to mistakes. However, Google says it’s taken feedback from early testers to improve Project Mariner’s capabilities. A Google spokesperson tells TechCrunch the company updated Project Mariner to run on virtual machines in the cloud, much like agents from OpenAI and Amazon. This means users can work on other projects while Project Mariner completes tasks in the background — Google says the new Project Mariner can handle up to 10 tasks simultaneously. This update makes Project Mariner significantly more useful compared to its predecessor, which ran on a user’s browser. As I noted in myinitial review, Project Mariner’s early design meant users couldn’t use other tabs or apps on their desktop while the AI agent was working. This kind of defeated the purpose of an AI agent — it would work for you, but you couldn’t do anything else while it was working. In the coming months, Google says users will be able to access Project Mariner in AI Mode, the company’s AI-powered Google Search experience. When it launches, the feature will be limited to Search Labs, Google’s opt-in testing ground for search features. Google says it’s working with Ticketmaster, StubHub, Resy, and Vagaro to power some of these agentic flows. Separately today, Google unveiled an early demo of another agentic experience called “Agent Mode.” The company says this feature combines web browsing with research features and integrations, as well as with other Google apps. Google says Ultra subscribers will gain access to Agent Mode on desktop soon. At this year’s I/O, Google finally seems willing to ship the agentic experiences it’s been talking about for years. Project Mariner, Agent Mode, and AI Mode all seem poised to change how users navigate the web, and how vendors interact with their customers online. Web-browsing agents have big implications for the internet economy, but Google seems ready to put all these agents out in the world.

Starting Tuesday, Google is rolling out Gemini Live’s camera and screen-sharing capabilities to all users on iOS and Android. The feature, powered by Project Astra, allows users to have near-real-time verbal conversations with Gemini, while simultaneously streaming video from their smartphone’s camera or screen to the AI model. For example, while walking around a new city, users could point their phone at a building and ask Gemini Live about the architecture or history behind it, and get answers with little to no delay. In the coming weeks, Google says Gemini Live will also start to integrate more deeply with its other apps. The company says Gemini Live will soon be able to offer directions from Google Maps, create events in Google Calendar, and make to-do lists with Google Tasks. The slew of updates to Google’s Gemini are part of the company’s efforts to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Apple’s Siri, and other digital assistant providers. The rise of AI chatbots has given users a new way to interact with the internet and their devices. This has put pressure on several Big Tech businesses, including Google Search and Google Assistant. Google announced during I/O 2025 that Gemini now has 400 million monthly active users, and the company surely hopes to grow that user base with these updates. Google introduced two new AI subscriptions: Google AI Pro, a rebrand for its $20-per-month Gemini Advanced plan, andGoogle AI Ultra, a $250-per-month plan that competes with ChatGPT Pro. The Ultra plan gives users very high rate limits, early access to new AI models, and exclusive access to certain features. U.S. subscribers to Pro and Ultra who have English selected as their language in Chrome will also get access to Gemini in their Chrome browser, Google announced Tuesday. The integration aims to let users ask Gemini to summarize information or answer questions about what appears on their screen. Google says it’s updating Deep Research, Gemini’s AI agent that generates thorough research reports, by allowing users to upload their own private PDFs and images. Deep Research will cross-reference these private PDFs with public data to create more personalized reports. The company says that soon users will be able to directly integrate Drive and Gmail to Deep Research. Free users of Gemini are getting an updated AI image model, Imagen 4, which Google says delivers better text outputs. Subscribers to the company’s new $250-per-month AI Ultra plan will also get access to Google’s latest AI video model, Veo 3, which generates sound that corresponds to video scenes through native audio generation. Google is also updating the default model in Gemini to be Gemini 2.5 Flash, which the company says will offer higher quality responses with lower latency. To cater to the growing number of students that use AI chatbots, Google says Gemini will now create personalized quizzes focused on areas that users find challenging. When users answer questions wrong, Gemini will help create additional quizzes and action plans to strengthen those areas.

Stitch can be prompted to create app UIs with a few words or even an image, providing HTML and CSS markup for the designs it generates. Users can choose between Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash AI models to power Stitch’s code and interface ideation. Stitch arrives as so-called vibe coding — programming using code-generating AI models — continues to grow in popularity. There’s a number of large tech startups going after the burgeoning market, includingCursormaker Anysphere,Cognition, andWindsurf. Just last week, OpenAI launched a new assistive coding service calledCodex. And yesterday during its Build 2025 kickoff, Microsoft rolled out a series of updates to its GitHub Copilot coding assistant. Stitch is a bit more limited in what it can do compared to some other vibe coding products, but there’s a fair amount of customization options. The tool supports directly exporting to Figma and can expose code so that it can be refined and worked on in an IDE. Stitch also lets users fine-tune any of the app design elements it generates. In a demo with TechCrunch, Google product manager Kathy Korevec showed two projects created using Stitch: a responsive mobile UI design for an app for bookworms and a web dashboard for beekeeping. “[Stitch is] where you can come and get your initial iteration done, and then you can keep going from there,” said Korevec. “What we want to do is make it super, super easy and approachable for people to do that next level of design thinking or that next level of software building for them.” Soon after I/O, Google plans to add a feature that’ll allow users to make changes in their UI designs by taking screenshots of the object they want to tweak and annotating it with the modifications they want, Korevec said. She added that while Stitch is reasonably powerful, it isn’t meant to be a full-fledged design platform like Figma or Adobe XD. Alongside Stitch, Google has expanded access toJules, its AI agent aimed at helping developers fix bugs in their code. Now inpublic beta, the tool helps developers understand complex code, create pull requests on GitHub, and handle certain backlog items and programming tasks. In a separate demo, Korevec showed Jules upgrading a website running the deprecated Node.js version 16 to Node.js 22. Jules cloned the site’s codebase in a clean virtual machine and shared a “plan” for the upgrade, which Korevec was then prompted to approve. Once the upgrade was completed, Korevec asked Jules to verify that the website still worked correctly — which Jules did. Jules currently uses Gemini 2.5 Pro, but Korevec told TechCrunch that users will be able to switch between different models in the future.

The feature leverages a large language audio model from Google DeepMind to allow for a natural, free-flowing conversation with someone in a different language, Google says. Speech translation in Meet translates spoken words into the listener’s preferred language in real time. Voice, tone, and expression are all preserved in the translation. The tech giant says the new feature has a variety of use cases. For instance, it can be used for English-speaking grandchildren talking to their Spanish-speaking grandparents. Or, it could be used by companies that operate across different regions to allow global colleagues to connect and chat in real-time. The latency for speech translation is very low, according to Google, allowing for multiple people to chat together, which the company says hasn’t been possible until now. When the person on the other side speaks, you will still faintly hear their original voice, with the translated speech overlaid on top. Speech translation in Google Meet will begin rolling out to consumer AI subscribers in beta starting Tuesday. The feature will first be available in English and Spanish, with more languages coming in the next few weeks, including Italian, German, and Portuguese. Google says it’s building out the speech translation in Meet for businesses, with early testing coming to Workspace customers this year.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Android Studio, the integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app developers, is getting an AI upgrade, Google announced at itsdeveloper conference, Google I/O 2025, on Tuesday. In addition to the rollout of the latest Gemini 2.5 Pro model, Android Studio is gaining a new “agentic AI” capability called Journeys and will soon introduce an “Agent Mode” for more complex development tasks. Using Gemini, journeys will allow developers to test their app by describing the actions and assertions in natural language for the user journeys across the app. Gemini will then perform the tests for you. The feature, explains Google, will let developers test their apps more easily, without having to write extensive code to do so. The company cautioned that this is still experimental, but ultimately, the goal is to increase the speed of shipping high-quality code while reducing the time it takes to test, validate, or reproduce issues. The tests can run on physical or virtual Android devices, and their results will appear directly in the IDE, Google says. Another soon-to-arrive addition involves an autonomous AI feature powered by Gemini called Agent Mode. This will allow developers to use various tools to handle more complex, multi-stage development tasks. For instance, if a developer is trying to integrate a new API, the agent may come up with an execution plan that adds the necessary dependencies, edits files, and fixes bugs. Other AI features coming to Android Studio include a Gemini-powered improvement to the App Quality Insights panel’s “crash insights” feature, which can now use AI to help determine what in an app’s source code may have caused the app to crash, and suggest a fix. Plus, Google will now allow developers to try out its still experimental AI features through a new “Studio Labs” menu in the Settings menu of Android Studio. This option will be available in stable releases only, starting with the release codenamed Narwhal. Another experiment now available is the public preview of Android Studio Cloud. Accessed through Firebase Studio, the new service streams a Linux machine running Android Studio to your web browser, enabling Android development anywhere you have access to an internet connection. A Version Upgrade Agent will soon arrive as part of Gemini in Android Studio to help automate dependency upgrades. Gemini will also help developers automatically generate Jetpack Compose preview code, transform UI code within the Compose Preview environment using natural language, attach image files (like UI mockups or screenshots) to AI prompts, attach project files as context in chats with Gemini, and set up preferred coding styles or output formats with a new “Rules in Gemini” feature. The company is also rolling out an enterprise-ready version of its AI-powered Android Studio with the launch of Gemini in Android Studio for businesses, which lets teams deploy AI while keeping data safe when subscribing to Gemini Code Assist in Standard or Enterprise editions, it says. Other updates include resizable previews in Compose Preview and navigation improvements, an embedded Android XR emulator that launches by default in the embedded state, and upgrades to Backup and Restore and  Backup and Sync, among other things. Android’s Kotlin Multiplatform will also see a small handful of improvements. In addition, Google says it will help developers prepare for Android’s 16KB page sizes — a change to Android’s underlying architecture — with early warnings and tools for testing apps in the new environment.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google’s latest video-generating AI model, Veo 3, can create audio to go along with the clips that it generates. On Tuesdayduring the Google I/O 2025 developer conference, Google unveiled Veo 3, which the company claims can generate sound effects, background noises, and even dialogue to accompany the videos it creates. Veo 3 also improves upon its predecessor,Veo 2, in terms of the quality of footage it can generate, Google says. Veo 3 is available beginning Tuesday in Google’s Gemini chatbot app for subscribers toGoogle’s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan, where it can be prompted with text or an image. “For the first time, we’re emerging from the silent era of video generation,” Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, Google’s AI R&D division, said during a press briefing. “[You can give Veo 3] a prompt describing characters and an environment, and suggest dialogue with a description of how you want it to sound.” The wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to such an explosion of providers that the space is becoming saturated. Startups includingRunway,Lightricks, Genmo,Pika,Higgsfield, Kling, andLuma, as well as tech giants such asOpenAIand Alibaba, are releasing models at a fast clip. In many cases, little distinguishes one model from another. Audio output stands to be a big differentiator for Veo 3, if Google can deliver on its promises. AI-powered sound-generating toolsaren’tnovel, nor are models to createvideosoundeffects. But Veo 3 uniquely can understand the raw pixels from its videos and sync generated sounds with clips automatically, per Google. Here’s a sample clip from the model: cooking up something tasty for tomorrow…pic.twitter.com/wyIRMsXkFG Veo 3 was likely made possible byDeepMind’s earlier workin “video-to-audio” AI. Last June, DeepMind revealed that it was developing AI tech to generate soundtracks for videos by training a model on a combination of sounds and dialogue transcripts as well as video clips. DeepMind won’t say exactly where it sourced the content to train Veo 3, but YouTube is a strong possibility. Google owns YouTube, and DeepMindpreviouslytold TechCrunch that Google models like Veo “may” be trained on some YouTube material. To mitigate the risk of deepfakes, DeepMind says it’s using its proprietary watermarking technology, SynthID, to embed invisible markers into frames Veo 3 generates. While companies like Google pitch Veo 3 as powerful creative tools, many artists are understandably wary of them — they threaten to upend entire industries. A 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026. Google also today rolled out new capabilities for Veo 2, including a feature that lets users give the model images of characters, scenes, objects, and styles for better consistency. The latest Veo 2 can understand camera movements like rotations, dollies, and zooms, and it allows users to add or erase objects from videos or broaden the frames of clips to, for example, turn them from portrait into landscape. Google says that all of these new Veo 2 capabilities will come to its Vertex AI API platform in the coming weeks.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Google’s AI Mode, the experimental Google Searchfeaturethat lets users ask complex, multi-part questions via an AI interface, will roll out to everyone in the U.S. starting this week, the company announced atits annual developer conference, Google I/O 2025, on Tuesday. The feature builds on Google’s existing AI-powered search experience, AI Overviews, whichdisplay AI-generated summariesat the top of its search results page. Launched last year, AI Overviews saw mixed results as Google’s AI offeredquestionable answersand advice, like asuggestion to use glue on pizza, among other things. However, Google claims AI Overviews is a success in terms of adoption, if not accuracy, as over 1.5 billion monthly users have used the AI feature. It will now exit Labs, expand to over 200 countries and territories, and become available in more than 40 languages, the company says. AI Mode, meanwhile, lets users ask complex questions and ask follow-ups. Initially available in Google’s Search Labs for testing, the feature arrived as other AI companies, like Perplexity and OpenAI, expanded into Google’s territory with web search features of their own. Worried about potentially ceding search market share to rivals, AI Mode represents Google’s pitch for what the future of search will look like. As AI Mode rolls out more broadly, Google is touting some of its new capabilities, including Deep Search. While AI Mode takes a question and breaks it up into different subtopics to answer your query, Deep Search does so at scale. It can issue dozens or even hundreds of queries to provide your answers, which will also include links so you can dig into the research yourself. The result is a fully cited report generated in minutes, potentially saving you hours of research, Google says. The company suggested using the Deep Search feature for things like comparison shopping, whether that’s for a big-ticket home appliance or a summer camp for the kids. AnotherAI-powered shopping featurecoming to AI Mode is a virtual “try it on” option for apparel, which uses an uploaded picture of yourself to generate an image of yourself wearing the item in question. The feature will have an understanding of 3D shapes and fabric types, and stretch, Google notes, and will begin rolling out in Search Labs today. In the months ahead, Google says it willoffer a shopping tool for U.S. usersthat will purchase items on your behalf after it hits a specific price. (You’ll still have to click “buy for me” to kick off this agent, however.) Both AI Overviews and AI Mode will now use a custom version of Gemini 2.5, and Google says that AI Mode’s capabilities will gradually roll out to AI Overviews over time. AI Mode will also support the use of complex data in sports and finance queries, available through Labs sometime “soon.” This lets users ask complex questions — like “compare the Phillies and White Sox home game win percentages by year for the past five seasons.” The AI will search across multiple sources, put that data together in a single answer, and even create visualizations on the fly to help you better understand the data. Another feature leverages Project Mariner, Google’s agent that can interact with the web to take actions on your behalf. Initially available for queries involving restaurants, events, and other local services, AI Mode will save you time researching prices and availability across multiple sites to find the best option — like affordable concert tickets, for instance. Search Live, rolling out later this summer, will let you ask questions based on what your phone’s camera is seeing in real time. This goes beyond the visual search capabilities of Google Lens, as you can have an interactive back-and-forth conversation with the AI using both video and audio, similar to Google’s multimodal AI system,Project Astra. Search results will also be personalized based on your past searches, and if you choose to connect your Google Apps using a feature that will roll out this summer. For instance, if you connect your Gmail, Google could know about your travel dates from a booking confirmation email, then use that to recommend events in the city you’re visiting that will be taking place while you’re there. (Expecting some pushback over privacy concerns, Google notes that you can connect or disconnect your apps at any time.) Gmail is the first app to be supported with personalized context, the company notes. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "title": "UK steps up action against Israel over Gaza offensive",
    "article_text": "The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers, as Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the military escalation in Gaza \"morally unjustifiable\". The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation over the weekend. There were fiery exchanges in Parliament with Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who suggested the actions would be welcomed by Hamas, but also angry calls for the government to go further. In response, Israel's foreign spokesman said external pressure would \"not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence\". Global experts have warned of a looming famine because the Israeli government has blockaded supplies of food, fuel and medicine to Gaza for the last 11 weeks. Officials say the sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis after two months of blockade played a part in the latest announcements, as did growing pressure from MPs and the public. Ministers were also responding to the lack of any clear path towards a ceasefire and a sense of frustration from the White House, with President Donald Trump sidestepping the country on his Middle East tour last week and Vice-President JD Vance postponing a trip there this week. The Israeli government has already been warned it must end its \"egregious\" military expansion and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\" in ajoint statementfrom the leaders of the UK, Canada and France on Monday. Israel said it had allowed five lorries carrying humanitarian aid into the territorybut  the UN's humanitarian chief said this was a \"drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed\". Later on Tuesday, the UN confirmed that, although permission had now been given to send about 100 aid trucks into Gaza,no aid had yet been distributed. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the current situation \"intolerable\", saying \"humanitarian aid needs to get in at pace\". In the House of Commons, there were shouts of \"shame\" from MPs as Lammy set out how an Israeli minister had said their latest operations would be \"cleansing Gaza\", \"destroying what's left\" and relocating Palestinians \"to third countries\". \"We must call this what it is,\" he told MPs. \"It is extremism, it is dangerous, it is repellent, it is monstrous, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.\" Lammy said Israel had suffered \"a heinous attack\" on 7 October 2023 and the UK had always backed the country's right to defend itself. However, the foreign secretary said the Israeli government had set out on a \"morally unjustifiable\" and \"utterly counterproductive\" path that would not bring hostages safely home. Instead, he accused the government led by Benjamin Netanyahu of \"isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world\", as he announced negotiations on a free trade deal had been suspended. The Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, told Israeli Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely that the UK would not \"stand by\" as Israel increased military operations in Gaza. \"Today I summoned Israel's ambassador to the FCDO,\" Falconer said in a post on X. \"I made clear the UK's opposition to expanded military operations in Gaza and rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities in the West Bank.\" \"The UK will not stand by as this happens,\" he added. Condemning settler violence, Lammy also set out sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, against three individuals and four companies who were \"carrying out heinous abuses of human rights\". Dame Priti said: \"Strong words will do little to resolve the real challenges that are taking place and the suffering we are seeing taking place day in, day out.\" She added that it \"should be the cause of concern\" that the UK government's actions had been \"supported by Hamas, a terrorist organisation\". Following the statement there were calls for the foreign secretary to go further, including from Labour backbenchers, who raised the possibility of a breach of international law. Abtisam Mohamed, the Labour MP for Sheffield Central, said Netanyahu had made an \"explicit admission that Israeli officials intend to carry out ethnic cleansing\". Lammy said the suspension of some arms sales to Israel had ensured \"none of us are complicit in any acts that breach international humanitarian law\" but he had announced further measures because the war was still continuing. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, said the \"weaponisation of food\" was \"morally reprehensible\" and called for an arms embargo to be imposed, as well as sanctions on Israeli officials. Lammy gave an \"absolute commitment\" that the UK government would take further action \"if needed over the coming days and weeks\". He also responded to calls to officially recognise the state of Palestine by confirming he was \"in close dialogue\" with both France and Saudi Arabia about recognition. Diplomats told the BBC they would still prefer to use recognition of Palestine as a spur to further action, perhaps as part of a wider peace settlement, rather than a symbolic expression of anger against Israel and support for Palestinians. Israeli foreign spokesman Oren Marmorstein responded defiantlyto Lammy's statement on X, saying the decisions on sanctions were \"unjustified\". \"External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction,\" he said. Marmorstein also suggested the UK government had not been advancing negotiations on a trade deal \"at all\" before the announcement in the Commons. \"If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy - that is its own prerogative,\" he added. Meanwhile, the EU - Israel's biggest trading partner - is to review its trade agreement with the country in light of its actions in Gaza.

    "article_text": "A British surgeon who returned to southern Gaza a week ago has been describing life at Nassar Hosptial in Khan Younis. Israel has issued an evacuation call to Palestinians around Khan Yunis ahead of what it described as an \"unprecedented attack\". Dr Rose says if Nassar hospital is evacuated - there's nowhere else with intensive care for the patients to be moved to. Tuesday's strike killed 28 people, the Hamas-run civil defence said. Israel says it was a precise strike on Hamas. In the first major diplomatic trip during his second term, the president is hoping to secure significant new investment in the US in the four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE. At least four people have been killed and 500 more injured in Bandar Abbas. Netanyahu is the first world leader to visit the White House since the US president announced tariffs on global trading partners. The video was published by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), which said it was obtained from the phone of a paramedic who was killed. BBC Verify explains what we know about the incident after reviewing videos that were posted online. Israel has sent more troops into Gaza after resuming airstrikes on what it calls \"terror targets\". Thousands of Syrians have crossed into Lebanon from the provinces of Latakia and Tartus. Zakaria, 11, volunteered at a busy Gaza hospital during the war - one of three children in a new BBC documentary. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey called on the PM to reiterate to the White House that the UK is committed to two-state solution. The former solider collected information and passed it to Tehran, before escaping from HMP Wandsworth. Three freed hostages are returned to Israel after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into force. Doron Steinbrecher, 31, Emily Damari, 28, and Romi Gonen, 24, were seen getting out of a Red Cross vehicle, in footage released by the Israeli Defense Forces. Feras Killani grew up in Yarmouk in Damascus, which saw brutal fighting between rebel and government forces. Orla Guerin visits Al-Sina prison in north-eastern Syria, where many suspected fighters have been held for years. Sharaa led the rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime in Syria less than two weeks ago. The BBC's Hugo Bachega sees Syrians dancing, waving flags and making peace signs in Aleppo.

    "title": "Police investigation into UK retail hacks focuses on English-speaking youths",
    "article_text": "Detectives investigating cyber attacks on UK retailers are focussing on a notorious cluster of cyber criminals known to be young English-speakers, some of them teenagers, police have revealed. For weeks speculation has mounted thatdisruptive attacks on M&S, Co-op, Harrods and some US retailerscould be the work of a hacking community called Scattered Spider. Speaking about the hacks for the first time, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has told BBC News the group is a key part of its ongoing investigation to find the culprits. \"We are looking at the group that is publicly known as Scattered Spider, but we've got a range of different hypotheses and we'll follow the evidence to get to the offenders,\" Paul Foster, head of the NCA's national cyber crime unit, said in a new BBC documentary. \"In light of all the damage that we're seeing, catching whoever is behind these attacks is our top priority,\" he added. The wave of attacks, which began at Easter, have resulted inempty shelves in stores, the suspension of online ordering, and millions of people's private data being stolen. The hacks have been carried out using DragonForce, a platform that gives criminals the tools to carry out ransomware attacks. However, the hackers pulling the strings have still not been identified and no arrests have been made. Some cyber experts say the hackers display the traits of Scattered Spider, a loose community of often young individuals who organise across sites like Discord, Telegram and in forums, most likely located in the UK and US. Although the NCA says it is exploring all parts of the cyber crime ecosystem, it too is looking in the same direction. \"We know that Scattered Spider are largely English-speaking but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the UK - we know that they communicate online amongst themselves in a range of different platforms and channels, which is, I guess, key to their ability to then be able to operate as a collective,\" Mr Foster said. M&S has been hit with ransomware, which has scrambled the company's servers rendering computer systems useless. The high street giant is still struggling to keep shelves stocked and has halted online shopping for weeks.Hackers have also stolen customer and employee datafrom the company. At Co-op, staff took systems offline to prevent a ransomware infection but a huge amount of customer and staff data was stolen and is being held to ransom. Operations at the firm's supermarkets, insurance offices and funeral services have been badly affected. It is not knownwhat is happening at Harrodsbut the company admitted it had to pull computer systems offline because of an attempted cyber attack. When the hackers behind the M&S and Co-op attacksanonymously contacted the BBC last week, they declined to say whether or not they were Scattered Spider. Cyber security researchers at CrowdStrike formed the name \"Scattered Spider\" because of the group's sporadic nature, but other cyber companies have given the cluster nicknames including Octo Tempest and Muddled Libra. The group was also linked to high-profile attacks including on two US casinos in 2023 and Transport for London last year. And in November, the US charged five British and American men and boys in their twenties and teens for alleged Scattered Spider activity. One is 23-year-old Scottish man Tyler Buchanan, who has not made a plea, and the rest are US based. NCA investigators will not say how the retail hackers have managed to breach victim organisations but earlier this month, theNational Cyber Security Centre issued guidance to organisationsurging them to review their IT help desk password reset processes. \"Calling up IT help desks is a tactic that Scattered Spider seems to favour and they use social engineering techniques to manipulate someone into doing something like clicking on a link or resetting someone's account to a password they can use,\" Lisa Forte, from cyber security firm Red Goat, explained. In the BBC documentary, a former teen hacker who was arrested nine years ago and now works in cyber security, said he was not surprised that teenagers could be behind the hacks. \"It wouldn't surprise me - quite [the] opposite. The tools are readily available and it's very easy to jump online and search straight away. You can feel a bit untouchable but for what end? You're gonna be arrested 99% of the time,\" he said.

    "article_text": "George Wendt, who starred as Norm Peterson in the popular comedy series Cheers, has died at the age of 76. The beloved actor and comedian died peacefully in his sleep at his home early on Tuesday morning, his family said. \"George was a doting family man, a well-loved friend and confidant to all of those lucky enough to have known him. He will be missed forever,\" a representative told the BBC. Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers, which ran from 1982-93. He earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series. Wendt's character Norm was a well-loved bar regular, and was one of the few characters to appear in every episode of Cheers. His entrance into the bar was a running gag on the show, beginning with him greeting the other patrons followed by the crowd yelling his name. Wendt reunited with some of the cast at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2024, including Ted Danson, Rhea Perlman, Kelsey Grammer and John Ratzenberger. In addition to the NBC sitcom, Wendt appeared in several movies such as Dreamscape, Forever Young and Gung Ho. He also appeared as the father of a boy played by Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson's Black or White music video, which was released in 1991. He had been married to fellow actor Bernadette Birkett since 1978, with whom he had three children. He was also the uncle of actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis, who is most recently known for playing the title character in the sports comedy Ted Lasso. Wendt's Cheers co-star Ted Danson told People magazine that he was \"devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us\". \"I am sending all my love to Bernadette and the children,\" he said. \"It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie.\" Cheers Boston, the pub that inspired the hit television show, paid tribute by sharing a picture of Norm's spot at the bar on Instagram. \"George wasn't just an actor - he was a symbol of comfort, laughter, and that familiar feeling of walking into a place where everybody knows your name,\" they said. \"To George: thank you for the laughs, the memories, and the legacy you leave behind. You'll always have a stool at our bar.\" Actress Melissa Joan Hart reflected on the handful of times they had worked together on the show Sabrina the Teenage Witch. \"He was warm, professional and kind and our cast and crew were gifted with his presence every time. Rest in peace!\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Heaven just got a little funnier\".",

    "title": "Trump unveils plans for 'Golden Dome' defence system",
    "article_text": "The US has selected a design for the futuristic \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system, says US President Donald Trump, adding that it will be operational by the end of his time in office. Just days after returning to the White House in January, Trump unveiled his intentions for the system, aimed at countering \"next-generation\" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles. An initial sum of $25bn (£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it will end up costing much more than that over decades. Officials warn that existing systems have not kept pace with increasingly sophisticated weapons possessed by potential adversaries. President Trump also announced that Space Force General Michael Guetlein will oversee the project. Gen Guetlein is currently vice chief of space operations at Space Force. Seven days into his second administration, Trump ordered the defence department to submit plans for a system that would deter and defend against aerial attacks, which the White House said remain \"the most catastrophic threat\" facing the US. Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said the system would consist of \"next-generation\" technologies across land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. He added that Canada had asked to be a part of the system. During a visit to Washington earlier this year, then-Canadian defence minister Bill Blair acknowledged that Canada was interested in participating in the dome project, arguing that it \"makes sense\" and was in the country's \"national interest\". He added that \"Canada has to know what's going on in the region\" and be aware of incoming threats, including in the Arctic. Trump added that the system would be \"capable even of intercepting missiles launched from the other side of the world, or launched from space\". The system is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011. The Golden Dome, however, would  be many times larger and designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of sound and fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space. \"All of them will be knocked out of the air,\" Trump said. \"The success rate is very close to 100%.\" US officials had previously said that the Golden Dome will have the aim of allowing the US to stop missiles at various stages of their deployment, including before they launch and while they are still in the air. The many aspects of the system will fall under one centralised command, US defence officials have said. Trump said on Tuesday that the programme would require an initial investment of $25bn, with a total cost of $175bn over time. The initial $25bn has been identified within his One Big Beautiful Bill on tax, which has not yet been passed. The Congressional Budget Office, however, has estimated that the government could ultimately spend more, up to $542bn over 20 years, on the space-based parts of the system alone. Pentagon officials have long-warned that existing systems have not kept pace with new missile technology designed by Russia and China. \"There really is no current system,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"We have certain areas of missiles and certain missile defence, but there is no system... there has never been anything like this.\" A briefing document recently released by the Defense Intelligence Agency noted that missile threats \"will expand in scale and sophistication\", with China and Russia actively designing systems \"to exploit gaps\" in US defences. Sterling Williams is accused of helping 10 inmates escape the Orleans Parish Jail on Friday. The judge orders the migrants to be kept in US government custody, holding the plane on the tarmac if necessary. On Tuesday, a Los Angeles judge reduced Lyle and Erik's murder sentence, making them eligible for parole. The South African president will try to reset relations with the US in a high-stakes White House meeting on Wednesday. He was best known for playing Norm Peterson in the popular comedy series Cheers from 1982 to 1993.",

    "article_text": "The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference in the wake of advice following last month's ruling on the legal definition of a woman. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex. Up until the ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists. The decision has been condemned by trans rights advocates as an \"attempt to isolate trans people\" and by gender critical activists as \"a kneejerk reaction\". Labour Women's Conference is traditionally held the day before the main conference and brings together hundreds of women from Labour's activist base, including MPs, councillors, and supporters for a day of discussion and policy-making. A leaked advice paper to Labour's governing body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), recommended delaying the conference because the \"only legally defensible alternative\" would be to restrict attendance to biological women. The paper set out how \"there is a significant risk of legal challenge to the event as it currently operates\" and \"there may be protests, direct action and heightened security risks\" if it goes ahead on 27 September. That could carry a \"political risk\" of overshadowing the party's showcase autumn conference which begins the following day on 28 September. On Tuesday night, the party's NEC voted to delay the conference, pending a wider review of positive action measures. The NEC also decided to postpone the elections to the National Labour Women's Committee, which are normally held at the conference, and to extend the terms of those currently serving. Labour moved away from using all-women shortlists at the last general election. The leaked paper also advised the party to issue guidance to make clear that all-women shortlists can only apply to \"applicants who were biologically female at birth\". A Labour Party spokesperson said the party must make sure all its procedures \"comply with the Supreme Court's clear ruling\". \"Labour is clear that everyone in our society deserves to be treated with dignity and respect,\" he said. \"The party will work closely with individuals and local parties to implement the necessary changes with sensitivity and care.\" Ministers will consider the Equality and Human Rights Commission's code of practice, which it has just put out for consultation. The decision was condemned by Georgia Meadows, who was speaking as LGBT+ Labour's trans officer. \"It is a blatant attack on trans rights and is seemingly an attempt to isolate trans people even further within the Labour Party and the Labour movement more widely,\" they said. The Labour Women's Declaration group, which backs \"sex-based rights\", said cancelling the conference would be a \"knee-jerk reaction\". A spokesperson told the LabourList website: \"We are shocked that hundreds of women in the Labour Party might be prevented from meeting at conference because the NEC would prefer to disadvantage all women rather than to exclude the very small number of trans-identified men who may wish to attend the women's conference.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "title": "Millions of consumers could get £70 after Mastercard ruling",
    "article_text": "Millions of shoppers could get up to £70 each after a tribunal approved a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard which stemmed from historic fees levied on businesses by the card provider. The decision comes after a long-running legal case going back almost a decade, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman. Walter Merricks argued that shoppers were charged higher prices after fees were wrongly levied on transactions made over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008. It is not necessary to have owned a Mastercard at any point to be eligible for compensation. Mastercard declined to comment on the court ruling. Consumers are eligible to claim compensation if they lived in England, Wales or Northern Ireland for at least three months between June 1997 and June 2008, and  bought goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard credit cards. For those who live in Scotland, the starting point is May 1992. The entire settlement is for £200m, with £100m ringfenced for consumers who have until the end of this year to claim and if the expected 5% of claimants - 2.5 million people - come forward, then each will receive £45. If fewer people apply, payments will be capped at £70 per claimant. Mr Merricks said consumers would soon be able to register to receive a payout by completing an online form. He launched his claim after the European Commission ruled in 2007 that Mastercard's \"multilateral interchange fees\" charged to businesses had infringed competition law since 1992. The fees were paid by retailers accepting Mastercard payments, rather than by consumers themselves. But Mr Merricks said that, despite retailers paying the fees, shoppers had lost out due to the charges being passed on through higher prices for goods and services. He alleged that 46 million shoppers in Britain were overcharged. Any unclaimed cash is expected to go to the company that funded the lawsuit. The Competition Appeal Tribunal approved a settlement in the class action case on Tuesday. Commenting on the outcome, Mr Merricks said he started this case because  he believed that \"Mastercard's fees paid by retailers for processing card transactions had been unlawfully high\". \"Virtually all UK consumers had lost out for long periods by paying higher prices than they should have done as retailers passed on those costs,\" he added. \"The settlement that has today been finally approved represents a fair and just outcome for UK consumers.\" Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in the regulator's price cap. Gas and electricity prices are expected to fall in July, under regulator Ofgem's new price cap. Lenders will have to carry out affordability checks and shoppers will have faster access to refunds under the plans. Stress and anxiety among those with debts remains high but help is available, a major survey finds. Young buyers are saving hard, moving cities, and using government schemes to get on the housing ladder.",

    "title": "Gaza baby sent back to war zone after open-heart surgery in Jordan",
    "article_text": "In a makeshift tent in al-Shati refugee camp, in the north of the Gaza Strip, 33-year-old Enas Abu Daqqa holds her tiny baby daughter Niveen in her arms. A fan hums constantly behind her to break the morning heat. Enas worries that Niveen's health might deteriorate at any point. She is only seven months old, and was born during the war with a hole in her heart. As her mother explains how she struggled to keep her alive amid a collapsing health system in Gaza, Niveen, with her big brown eyes and tiny frame, cries and fidgets. \"The war has been very tough for her,\" Enas tells the BBC. \"She wasn't gaining any weight, and she would get sick so easily.\" Niveen's only chance to survive was to receive urgent care outside Gaza. And in early March, Jordan made that possible. As a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel held, 29 sick Gazan children, including Niveen, were evacuated to Jordan to receive treatment in the country's hospitals. Her mother and older sister were brought out with her. They were the first children evacuated to Jordan after King Abdullah announced plans to treat 2,000 sick Gazan children in hospitals there during a visit to the US the previous month. These evacuations were co-ordinated with the Israeli authorities who do background checks on the parents travelling with their children. Doctors in Jordan performed successful open-heart surgery on Niveen, and she was slowly beginning to recover. But about two weeks into the children's treatment, the ceasefire in Gaza collapsed when Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas, and the war was back on, in full force. For weeks, Enas followed the news from her daughter's hospital room in Jordan, worrying about the safety of her husband and other children who were still in Gaza. And then late at night on 12 May, the Jordanian authorities told Enas they were sending her and her family back to Gaza the following day, as they said Niveen had completed her treatment. Enas was shocked. \"We left while there was a ceasefire. How could they send us back after the war had restarted?\" she says, frustrated. Enas is now reunited with her husband and children in Gaza. They say Niveen did not complete her treatment before she was sent back, and they worry that her condition could get worse. \"My daughter is in a very bad condition that could lead to her death,\" says Enas. \"She has heart disease. Sometimes she suffocates and turns blue. She can't continue living in a tent.\" On 13 May, Jordan announced that it had sent 17 children back to Gaza \"after completing their treatment\". And the next day, a new group of four sick children were evacuated from Gaza to Jordan. The Jordanian authorities have told the BBC that all children sent back were in good medical condition, rejecting claims that they did not complete their treatment. The authorities noted that the kingdom was clear from the beginning about its intention to send the children back once they were better, adding that this was necessary \"for logistical and political reasons\". \"Jordan's policy is to keep Palestinians on their land, and not to contribute to their displacement outside their territory,\" a foreign ministry statement sent to the BBC said. The return of the 17 children would also allow for more sick children to be evacuated from Gaza, it added. But an official in the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza told the BBC the children still needed care, and that their return to the war endangered their lives. This is exactly what worries 30-year-old Nihaya Bassel. Her son, Mohammed, who is just over a year old, suffers from asthma and serious food allergies. She believes her son did not receive the full treatment he deserved. \"We're back to living in fear and hunger, surrounded by death,\" Nihaya says as her eyes fill up with tears. \"How can I get this child the milk that he needs to drink? He doesn't eat even though he's just over a year old, because if he eats, he will immediately get sick.\" Israel imposed a strict siege on the Gaza Strip 11 weeks ago, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel. It said this and the resumed offensive were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza. International organisations warn that Palestinians living there are at \"critical risk of famine\". On Monday, Israel announced it would allow a \"minimal\" amount of food into Gaza following US pressure. The UN welcomed the crossing of five lorries carrying aid including baby food, but called it \"a drop in the ocean\". Nihaya is now living in a small, tented area in al-Shati camp with her brother-in-law's family. Her husband and three other children had fled there from elsewhere in northern Gaza, escaping heavy Israeli strikes as the war restarted while she was in Jordan. \"I left my children here. I left my husband here. They went through hell while I was away,\" Nihaya says as she bursts into tears. \"My mind and heart were constantly with them in Gaza while I was in Jordan. All of this so that my child could get treated. Why force me back before finishing his treatment?\" As she speaks, the sounds of Israeli surveillance drones drown out her voice. Her toddler runs around next to her, at times almost stumbling into a smoky open fire in the tent that the family uses for cooking meals. She struggles to contain her anger as she recounts her journey back to Gaza. \"We didn't leave [till] 04:00, and didn't arrive in Gaza till 22:45,\" she says. As they reached the border crossing, Nihaya says they were harassed by Israeli security forces. \"They started cursing at us. They threatened to beat us. They took all our money. They took our mobile phones, our bags and everything,\" she says, noting that they confiscated all the bags of anyone who had cash on them. Enas said the same thing happened to her, noting that her medical supplies were confiscated too. The Israeli army told the BBC that they confiscated \"undeclared cash exceeding normal limits\" from Gazans returning from Jordan due to suspicions that they would be \"used for terrorism within Gaza\". It notes that the money is being held while circumstances are investigated. It has not given a reason for why other personal belongings were confiscated. Nihaya says she has come back from Jordan \"empty-handed\"; even her son's medical records were in the bags that the Israeli security forces took away, she says. Jordan says it has given children like Niveen and Mohammed the best healthcare it can offer, and both families acknowledge this. But they worry that a life in one of the world's deadliest war zones for children will just undo all the progress their children have made over the past two months. \"I got my son to a point where I was very happy to see him like that,\" Nihaya says through her tears. \"Now they want to bring him back to square one? I don't want my son to die.\" Edited by Alexandra Fouché Jen Craft is among MPs calling for urgent improvements to community-based care plans.

    "title": "Paul Adams: Starmer and Lammy sound genuinely angry at Israel",
    "article_text": "After more than a year and a half of the war in Gaza, Britain appears to have finally lost patience with Israel. Speaking to MPs, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy sounded genuinely angry. Sir Keir said the level of suffering in Gaza, especially among innocent children, was \"intolerable\". Israel's decision to allow in a small amount of aid was, he said, \"utterly inadequate\". The prime minister added he was \"horrified\" by Israel's decision to escalate its military campaign. Lammy employed similar language, saying the situation in Gaza was \"abominable\". He condemned as \"monstrous\" the suggestion by Israel's hardline finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, that Gaza should be cleansed of its civilian population. Israel's actions, Lammy said, were isolating Israel from friends and partners around the world and \"damaging the image of the State of Israel in the eyes of the world\". Nor is Britain alone in expressions of outrage or threats of concrete action. The EU says it's reviewing its association agreement with Israel, which governs its political and economic relationship. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said a \"strong majority\" of members favoured looking again at the 25-year-old agreement. On Monday night,Britain joined France and Canada in signing a strongly worded joint statement, condemning Israel's military actionand warning of \"further concrete actions\" if the humanitarian situation in Gaza did not approve. Another statement followed, signed by 27 donor countries including the UK, condemning a new Gaza aid delivery model being promoted by Israel. The model aims to replace existing humanitarian agencies, including the UN, with civilian contractors, backed by the Israeli military. The UN and its donors say the new model is poorly conceived and politically motivated, incapable of replacing the decades-long tried and tested international humanitarian ecosystem in Gaza. A representative of one of the aid agencies operating in Gaza told me the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme was \"totally premature,\" adding that Israel had never provided evidence to back up its assertion that Hamas was responsible for the widespread diversion of aid. One western diplomat, quoted in Israel's liberal Haaretz newspaper, described the new model as a \"crazy plan and absolute madness\". During a passionate debate in the House of Commons, Lammy clashed with his Conservative opposite number, Dame Priti Patel, who suggested Hamas was benefitting from international criticism of Israel. Lammy accused her of refusing to confront the reality of what was happening in Gaza. Other MPs said Britain wasn't going far enough, with several suggesting, once again, that the time has come for Britain to recognise a Palestinian state. The government's view is that taking such a significant step for purely symbolic reasons wouldn't actually change anything. But with France possibly poised to recognise Palestine at a conference it's co-hosting with Saudi Arabia next month, some are hoping Britain follows suit. Even if it doesn't, it's clear that Israel's supporters are increasingly exasperated, and fearful that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest military operation, dubbed \"Gideon's Chariots\" is poised to heap misery on Gaza just as the area's two million civilians face the very real prospect of starvation. Even US President Donald Trump has expressed impatience, warning that \"a lot of people are starving\" as he concluded his regional tour last week. Netanyahu's government is losing support, even among some of Israel's staunchest allies. At a World Jewish Congress conference in Jerusalem, the organisation's president Ronald Lauder challenged Israel's foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar. \"All the best things Israel does are being destroyed by Smotrich because his statement about starving the Gazans and causing destruction is broadcast all over the world,\" Lauder said, asking why Netanyahu does nothing to stop him. According to veteran Israeli journalist Ben Caspit, Sa'ar's answer was brief. \"Duly noted.\" Foreign Secretary David Lammy summons the Israeli ambassador and suspends talks on a trade deal. The decision comes after students took part in demonstrations and protests last year. Israel says its reopened access for a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, after blocking supplies from entering the territory for the last 11 weeks. BBC Verify has been looking into the latest strikes and aid situation in Gaza. Keir Starmer apologises to Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster for being \"overly rude\" to her.

    "title": "Gaza aid yet to reach civilians, UN says, as pressure grows on Israel",
    "article_text": "The UN says no aid has yet been distributed in Gaza despite aid lorries starting to cross the border after an 11-week blockade. Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, carrying aid including flour, baby food, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical drugs. But the UN said, despite trucks reaching the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, no aid has been distributed so far. Its spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a team \"waited several hours\" for Israel to allow them to access the area but \"unfortunately, they were not able to bring those supplies into our warehouse\". Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a \"basic amount of food\" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine. But international pressure on Israel has continued to grow. TheUK said it would be suspending trade talksover what it described as Israel's \"morally unjustifiable\" military escalation in Gaza, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing the situation as \"intolerable\". Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc would be reviewing its trade agreement with Israel in light of its actions in Gaza. Dujarric said the aid operation was made \"complex\" as Israel required the UN to \"offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and reload them separately once they secure our teams' access from inside the Gaza Strip\". He added the arrival of the supplies was a positive development but described it as \"a drop in the ocean of what's needed\". UN bodies estimate 600 trucks a day are required to begin tackling Gaza's chronic humanitarian crisis. Earlier, the UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC thousands of babies could die in Gaza if Israel does not immediately let aid in. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fletcher said: \"There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them.\" When pressed on how he had arrived at that figure, he said there were \"strong teams on the ground\" operating in medical centres and schools - but did not provide further details. The BBC later asked for clarification on the figure from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which said: \"We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.\" It highlighted a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which stated 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition are expected to occur among children aged six to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026. The IPC report says this could take place over the course of about a year - not 48 hours. When pressed on the figures at a news conference, UNOCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said: \"For now let me just say that we know for a fact that there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements that need to come in because their mothers are unable to feed themselves.\" \"And if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger,\" he said. Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday welcomed Israel's decision to allow some aid into Gaza, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"We are pleased to see that aid is starting to flow in again.\" Replying to a Democrat who said the number of aid trucks allowed in was too little, Rubio said: \"I understand your point that it's not in sufficient amounts, but we were pleased to see that decision was made.\" On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada issued a statement calling on the Israeli government to \"stop its military operations\" and \"immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza\". As part of its announcement today, the UK also issuedsanctions on several prominent Israeli settlersand settler-linked groups. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry. Foreign Secretary David Lammy summons the Israeli ambassador and suspends talks on a trade deal. The PM sounded genuinely angry at Israel's aid blockade and expanded Gaza offensive, writes diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams. The decision comes after students took part in demonstrations and protests last year. Dr Rose has been describing life at Nassar Hospital in Gazan city of Khan Younis. The foreign secretary said the move \"demonstrates our determination to hold extremist settlers to account\".",

    "title": "Can Mandela's former negotiator charm Donald Trump?",
    "article_text": "South Africa's president has faced tough challenges before - he was the chief negotiator for Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) during talks to end white-minority rule in the early 1990s - but his forthcoming meeting in the White House will require all his charm. Cyril Ramaphosa wants to mend his nation's fractured relationship with the US - and his famous negotiating skills will be put to the test as he tries to win over the world's most powerful leader. US President Donald Trump and his team have been uncharacteristically quiet about the trip, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declining on Monday to provide any details - or even publicly acknowledge that the visit is taking place. \"The trade relations are what's most important — that's what has brought us here,\" Ramaphosa said in Washington on Tuesday. \"We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal. We want to strengthen those relations and we want to consolidate good relations between our two countries.\" The two have been at loggerheads for months, with Trump repeatedly insisting that South Africa's Afrikaner community is facing a \"genocide\" - a claim amplified by his close adviser Elon Musk, the South African-born tech billionaire. Tensions ramped up days after Trump took office for his second term in January when President Ramaphosasigned into law a controversial billallowing South Africa's government to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed \"equitable and in the public interest\". This only served to tarnish the image of Africa's biggest economy in the eyes of the Trump administration - alreadyangered by its genocide case against Israelat the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to help members from the Afrikaner community, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US as \"refugees\". South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool,was also expelled in Marchafter accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Rasool was a \"race-baiting politician\" who was \"no longer welcome in our great country\". The arrival of the first group of Afrikaners in the US last weekfurther inflamed the situation, with Trump again doubling down on his claims that white farmers were being \"brutally killed\" and their \"land is being confiscated\" - which has been repeatedly denied by the South Africa government. According to South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk, Ramaphosa's decision to go the White House is a \"high-risk strategy\", especially given Trump's recent hard-line stance. Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, told the BBC it was hoped the trip would \"set in motion a process towards the normalisation of diplomatic relations\" and \"lay the foundation\" for improved trade relations. Given that it had all been confirmed at short notice, the South African delegation - which includes four senior cabinet ministers - had had little time to set up a \"formal programme\", he said. But he suggested it was likely to focus on extending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), a 25-year-old piece of US legislation guaranteeing duty-free access to American consumers for certain goods from Africa. South Africa is one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn (£2bn) in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals. There is concern the deal may not be renewedwhen it comes up for review later this year or that if it is, South Africa may be excluded from the new agreement. \"In the absence of that continuation or extension of Agoa, we are ready to engage with the Trump administration over a new trade relationship framework that we believe will be mutually beneficial,\" Mr Magwenya said. On the souring of relations between Pretoria and Washington, he said South Africa hoped to have a \"frank, constructive discussion about them\". Interestingly Agricultural Minister John Steenhuisen is part of the delegation. His Democratic Alliance political party is part of South Africa's coalition government and has been a vocal critic of the ANC's empowerment policies, saying they lead to cronyism and corruption. The ANC denies this. Speaking of the ICJ case, in which South Africa accused Israel in December 2023 of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza - an allegation Israel denies, Mr Magwenya admitted it might \"lead to a robust discussion\". \"Procedurally, we can't withdraw that issue [and it] will remain in contention. \"However, with respect to the humanitarian crisis and its alleviation - there's agreement there with President Trump and we will focus more on what we can do together on those areas where we agree.\" On Friday, Trump acknowledged \"a lot of people are starving\" in Gaza following Israel's recent blockade of humanitarian supplies to the territory - comments that have led to a \"basic amount of food\" entering Gaza. Prof Van Nieuwkerk predicts two likely scenarios playing out - the first sees \"pleasant and cordial\" interaction and the reset that South Africa is keen on \"if rational minds prevail and if a lot of homework has been done\" on both sides. But he warns should \"emotional minds prevail\" and the focus be on white genocide claims, things could unravel quickly. \"If the South African delegation cannot convince the Trump administration of the right of South Africa to exercise its own policy choices domestically and internationally… then the Oval Office moment will be used by Trump to humiliate Ramaphosa and to read him the riot act,\" the University of South Africa academic said. \"That second scenario is not what we want.\" He hopes that South Africa's delegation has arrived in the US with an \"enticing proposal\", adding: \"The negotiations cannot start in the Oval Office, in front of the cameras. That live moment must be the conclusion of a negotiation that should have happened earlier.\" On this score, he says South Africa does have an ace up its sleeve: Ramaphosa, known for his negotiating skills and warmth. He knows what buttons to press - and finding common ground over golf could be the swing he takes - the 72-year-old has already invited the US leader for a friendly round of golf during the G20 Summit taking place in South Africa in November. \"Whether people like Cyril Ramaphosa or not, we have to acknowledge that he was one of the key players in the transition from apartheid to democracy. He made it happen because of his personality and style,\" Prof Van Nieuwkerk said. Dr Lubna Nadvi, a political analyst based at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, agrees the South African president has the personality to \"handle the situation should things get out of hand\". \"I anticipate that this face-to-face meeting will allow for the relationship to be strengthened, for facts to be placed on the table,\" she said, adding that the \"propaganda\" that had influenced Trump would have to be tackled. It was important for Ramaphosa's team to get the US to \"accept that South Africa is a sovereign country and is entitled to take the decisions it wants to take\", Dr Nadvi said. Mr Magwenya also made the point that South Africa would not be heading into Wednesday's meeting \"with a begging bowl\". \"As much as South Africa needs access to one of the world's largest markets... the United States equally needs certain products and goods out of South Africa.\" South Africa currently exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese, as well as precious stones, metals and fruit. Its \"geo-strategic location\" also made it \"attractive\" to the US, Prof Van Nieuwkerk added.

    "title": "An island called Hope is standing up to Beijing in the South China Sea",
    "article_text": "At just 37 hectares, the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa – or \"hope\" - is smaller than Buckingham Palace. There is almost nothing there. The 300 or so inhabitants live in a cluster of small, wooden houses. They fish in the clear, turquoise waters, and grow what vegetables they can in the sandy ground. But they are not alone in these disputed waters: just off shore, to the west, lies an armada of ships. These are all Chinese, from the navy, the coastguard or the so-called maritime militia – large fishing vessels repurposed to maintain Chinese dominance of this sea. As our plane approached the island we counted at least 20. For the past 10 years, China has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea, taking over submerged coral reefs, building three large air bases on them, and deploying hundreds of ships, to reinforce its claim to almost all of the strategic sea lanes running south from the great exporting cities on the Chinese coast. Few of the South East Asian countries which also claim islands in the same sea have dared to push back against China; only Vietnam and the Philippines have done so. The militaries of both countries are much smaller than China's, but they are holding on to a handful of reefs and islands. Pagasa – also known as Thitu and other names, as it is claimed by several other countries – is the largest of these. What makes it exceptional, though, is the civilian population, found nowhere else on the islands of the South China Sea. From the point of view of the Philippines this, and the fact that Pagasa is solid land, not a partially submerged reef or sandy cay, strengthens its legal claims in the area. \"Pagasa is very important to us,\" Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the Philippines National Security Council, tells the BBC. \"It has a runway. It can support life – it has a resident Filipino community, and fishermen living there. \"And given the size of the island, one of the few that did not need reclaiming from the sea, under international law it generates its own territorial sea of 12 nautical miles. \"So it is, in a way, a linchpin for the Philippine presence.\" Reaching Pagasa is a two-to-three-day boat ride from the Philippines island of Palawan, or a one-hour plane ride, but both are at the mercy of frequent stormy weather. Until they surfaced the runway two years ago, and lengthened it to 1,300m (4,600ft), only small planes could land. Now they can bring in big C130 transport aircraft. Travelling in them, as we did, is a bit like riding a bus in rush hour. Everything has to be brought from the mainland, which is why our plane was packed, floor to ceiling, with mattresses, eggs, bags of rice, a couple of motorbikes and piles of luggage – not to mention lots of military personnel, most of whom had to stand for the entire flight. A lot has changed in recent years. There is a new hangar, big enough to shelter aircraft during storms. They are building a control tower and dredging a small harbour to allow bigger boats to dock. We were driven around the island by some of the Philippines marines who are stationed there, though given its size it hardly seemed necessary The Philippines seized Pagasa from Taiwan in 1971, when the Taiwanese garrison left it during a typhoon. It was formally annexed by the Philippines in 1978. Later, the government started encouraging civilians to settle there. But they need support to survive on this remote sliver of land. Families get official donations of food, water and other groceries every month. They now have electricity and mobile phone connectivity, but that only came four years ago. Aside from government jobs, fishing is the only viable way to make a living, and since the arrival of the Chinese flotillas even that has become difficult. Fisherman Larry Hugo has lived on the island for 16 years, and has chronicled the increasing Chinese control of the area. He filmed the initial construction on Subi Reef, around 32km (20 miles) from Pagasa, which eventually became a full-size military air base. One of his videos, showing his little wooden boat being nearly rammed by a Chinese coastguard ship in 2021 made him a minor celebrity. But Chinese harassment has forced him to fish in a smaller area closer to home. \"Their ships are huge compared to ours. They threaten us, coming close and sounding their horns to chase us away. They really scare us. So I no longer go to my old fishing grounds further away. I now have to fish close to the island, but the fish stocks here are falling, and it is much harder to fill our tubs like we used to.\" Realyn Limbo has been a teacher on the island for 10 years, and seen the school grow from a small hut to full-size school teaching more than 100 pupils, from kindergarten to 18 years old. \"To me this island is like paradise,\" she says. \"All our basic needs are taken care of. It is clean and peaceful – the children can play basketball or go swimming after school. We don't need shopping malls or all that materialism.\" Pagasa is really quiet. In the fierce midday heat we found most people snoozing in hammocks, or playing music on their porches. We came across Melania Alojado, a village health worker, rocking a small baby  to help it sleep. \"The biggest challenge for us is when people, especially children, fall ill,\" she says. \"If it is serious then we need to evacuate them to the mainland. I am not a registered nurse, so I cannot perform complicated medical tasks. But planes are not always available, and sometimes the weather is too rough to travel. \"When that happens we just have to care for them as best we can.\" But she too values the tranquillity of island life. \"We are free of many stresses. We get subsidised food, and we can grow some of our own. In the big city everything you do needs money.\" We saw a few new houses being built, but there really isn't room for Pagasa to accommodate many more people. With very few jobs, young people usually leave the island once they finish school. For all of its sleepy charm, and stunning white-sand beaches, it has the feel of a garrison community, holding the line against the overpowering Chinese presence which is clearly visible just offshore. \"The Chinese at the airbase on Subi Reef always challenge us when we approach Pagasa,\" the pilot says. \"They always warn us we are entering Chinese territory without permission.\" Do they ever try to stop you? \"No, it's a routine. We tell them this is Philippines territory. We do this every time.\" Jonathan Malaya says his government has made a formal diplomatic protest every week to the Chinese Embassy over the presence of its ships in what the Philippines views as the territorial waters of Pagasa. This is in marked contrast to the previous administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, which avoided confrontations with China in the hope of getting more investment in the Philippines. \"I think we will get more respect from China if we hold our ground, and show them we can play this game as well. But the problem of democracies like the Philippines is policies can change with new administrations. China does not have that problem.\" The volcano on the Negros island spewed plumes of ash around 3km (1.8 miles) high into the air. The mid-term results will shape the bitter feud between President Bongbong Marcos and his Vice-President Sara Duterte. The Philippines' mid-term elections saw fewer than expected senators elected from President Marcos' camp. Darren Ashton streamed real-time acts of child sexual abuse and shared indecent images. The eldest daughter of the Philippines' ex-leader Rodrigo Duterte, Sara, is no stranger to controversy.",

    "title": "Nicotine pouches helped me quit vaping – but now I'm addicted",
    "article_text": "Johnpaul began using nicotine pouches to help him get off vapes – but says it just led to another addiction. At one stage he was using 15 pouches a day, although the 16-year-old has now cut back to five. Health experts say the pouches – small sachets that fit between the top lip and the gum, nicknamed \"snus\" by some teenagers - are addictive and may have other harmful side effects. They are largely unregulated in the UK and there is currently no law to stop children buying them. Some campaigners fear that the ban on disposable vapes which comes into effect on 1 June could see more young people turning to the stronger nicotine pouches. Johnpaul started using the pouches as a coping mechanism, and to help him get off vapes. \"It just led to another addiction,\" he said. \"It's just an instant hit. It makes me forget my surroundings. \"I'm not going to say I don't enjoy that, I do, but there are still a lot more negatives to it than there are positives.\" Johnpaul is working with other young people to raise awareness about nicotine pouches as part of a project with the charity Fast Forward and the Skills Training Programme at West Lothian Council. While packs contain age restriction warnings, Johnpaul says he has no problem buying them. \"At the moment, I really don't want to stop, but I definitely want to cut down and cut down the amount of milligrams I'm taking. \"Just keep it as low as I can, so it'll be a lot easier to quit when I feel that I'm ready to.\" Lee, 16, says he and most of his friends use nicotine pouches – although he wishes he had never started. \"Most times people wouldn't know because it's tucked away in your gum and sometimes you can push it up so people really can't see it,\" he said. \"I've tried to stop before, but it's something you can get highly addicted to, which is quite a bad thing. \"If I could go back and not start, I would.\" Aleksandra, 16, has tried nicotine pouches, but says they're not for her. \"It was fine for the first five minutes and after you swallow your spit it doesn't taste good. \"It burns and it makes you feel sick. It wasn't great.\" She says the products are marketed towards young people on social media and given away at railway stations, where they can easily be given to teenagers who look older. Leigh Ronald from Fast Forward, which offers health and wellbeing support, says young people are increasingly talking about pouches and looking to find out more information. She says it is likely that they will look for alternatives, like nicotine pouches, when the ban on disposable vapes comes into effect across the UK on 1 June. Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine, while some contain 50mg - about five times stronger than an average cigarette. The pouches are often referred to as snus, although that is a different product which contains tobacco and has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992. The general use of nicotine pouches remains low in Great Britain. Research suggeststhat about 5% of adults and 3% of under-18s have tried them – but use appears to be increasing and is higher in some groups, particularly young men. One popular brand reported a 121% increase in sales in 2023. Retailers approached by BBC Scotland said they did not sell nicotine pouches to under-18s. Alan McLevy is head of manufacturing at VPZ, which sells vapes, pouches and other nicotine products. He says his firm operates a Challenge 25 policy and that its aim is to help people quit smoking. He said: \"If you've not smoked before, if you've not vaped before, there's absolutely no need to buy a pouch. None whatsoever. \"It's a harm reduction technique and it's for current smokers to find a way to stop using combustible cigarettes.\" Dr Richard Holliday, senior lecturer at the School of Dental Sciences at Newcastle University, says nicotine pouches are less harmful than cigarettes - but not risk free. His team recentlypublished an article on nicotine pouches in the British Dental Journalthat was downloaded more than 250,000 times. It says more research is needed and that there may be an impact on oral health – such as gum recession. \"The paper has obviously touched a nerve. I think a lot of people are looking for information on this topic,\" he says. Dr Zoe Coyle, a lecturer at the Dental Institute in Edinburgh, also warned that repeated use of nicotine pouches can lead to gum recession and other issues with teeth and lips. \"I would be concerned particularly about young people using nicotine pouches,\" she says. Sheila Duffy, chief executive of anti-smoking charity Ash Scotland, says teachers have raised concerns about the pouches, which retail at \"pocket money prices\". \"It's very fast absorbed, it can easily be twice the level of nicotine in nicotine replacement therapy. So this is very highly addictive,\" she said. \"Addiction to nicotine in any form opens you up to the whole profile of products – industry knows this. \"So a kid that starts using nicotine pouches, which are easily concealed, which may be highly flavoured and attractive because they've been pushed through social media, that child is much more at risk of ending up as a smoker.\" UK-wide legislation is being proposed to ban the sale of nicotine products - including pouches - to under-18s. The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also stop free distribution and give ministers the power to regulate the flavours, packaging and display of all vapes and other nicotine products. Ash Scotland say it is a step in the right direction, but fears that the introduction of new regulations will take too long. Unravelling the case of a US fugitive who claimed to be the victim of mistaken identity after being traced in Glasgow. Ministers are expected to adopt the recommendations after abandoning repeatedly-missed targets last year.

    "title": "Italy's Meloni ready to help if Vatican agrees to Trump's war mediation plan",
    "article_text": "Italy has backed President Donald Trump's suggestion the Vatican might mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine, while he appears keen to step back from the process himself. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said Italy was ready to \"facilitate contacts and work towards peace\" in Ukraine and it \"viewed positively\" what it said was the Pope's willingness to host the talks at the Vatican. In fact there's no firm agreement yet on further discussions: last Friday's meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul brought additional demands from Moscow, not progress. Pope Leo said last week the Vatican was \"always ready\" to bring enemies together and he would \"make every effort\" for peace to prevail. But the Holy See says the idea of hosting, or even mediating, talks – which Trump suggested was an option - is more a hope for now than any concrete plan. If direct engagement does continue, Ukraine seems open to the notion of the Vatican as host. Volodymyr Zelensky posted on X on Tuesday that he had talked to Giorgia Meloni, including about \"possible platforms for talks with the Russians\". The Italian prime minister had, he said, \"as always, cool ideas\", although he has raised Turkey and Switzerland as alternative venues too. The Kremlin might prefer to stay in Turkey. It talks about a process called \"Istanbul Plus\", styling any talks as a follow-up on the deal initially discussed in Turkey shortly after the full-scale invasion. Those terms, which included Ukraine drastically reducing its own military, would represent capitulation for Kyiv now. But Russia has added more: the \"plus\" part means recognition of its annexation of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine as well as Crimea. The actual venue matters little to the Kremlin: all it wants is for the discussion to be on Vladimir Putin's terms. The prospect of meaningful progress, bluntly, looks slim. But might the Vatican lend some extra moral authority in the push for some kind of compromise? The Catholic Church has a history of helping to mediate conflicts and it has already been involved in talks to free prisoners and return Ukrainian children abducted by Russia. Its real input there isn't clear, though, as others have fulfilled the same role. On the other hand, the Vatican – especially any involvement of the new Pope – would introduce a different tone to proceedings. Its quiet style couldn't be further from Donald Trump's capitalised social media posts and his brutal public showdown with Zelensky in the Oval Office. And the setting already seems to have worked wonders on the men's relationship. It was at Pope Francis' funeral that they were snapped deep in conversation, heads close, inside St Peter's Basilica. The Vatican prides itself on its diplomacy: that's why, when others severed ties with Moscow after it began bombing Ukraine, the Catholic Church sent a cardinal envoy to talk to the Kremlin. It made no impact. Pope Francis, like Donald Trump, always avoided openly identifying Russia as the aggressor. Vatican sources say that was to keep the door for dialogue ajar, even when it seemed hopeless. But Francis upset Ukrainians more by suggesting that Russia had been \"provoked\" by Nato into its invasion. He then agreed it might be wise for Kyiv to \"raise the white flag\" and surrender. For Kyiv, Pope Leo might be a preferable potential peace-broker. He is on record as bishop denouncing Russia's invasion as an imperialist war and condemning crimes against humanity being committed by Putin's troops. That's unlikely to faze the Kremlin, if the Vatican were ever to host talks. \"Putin can explain his position to the Pope, he believes it's just. In his mind, it's Ukraine that's not serious about peace talks,\" argued Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre. \"I don't believe for one second that the Pope could affect Putin's understanding in any way.\" At this point, Russia is under no major pressure to give ground: all Donald Trump's talk of punishing Putin for his intransigence has turned into talk of trade with Russia. Offering incentives, not threating sanctions. It's true that Moscow wanted a lot more. \"They want Zelensky removed and for the US and EU to stop military aid, but on this, the US has been on Ukraine's side – from the Russian perspective,\" Tatiana Stanovaya says. So Russia is prepared to play the long game - which doesn't involve compromise. \"If the Pope could help pressure Ukraine, Putin wouldn't have a problem [with his involvement],\" she says. That seems to be the real issue here. It runs far deeper than whether the two sides eat meze or antipasti between hypothetical rounds of fresh talks. Bhai Sahib, Prof Mohinder Singh from Birmingham was among an audience with the Pope at the Vatican. The four Italians travelled to burgle three high-value homes in April last year, a court hears. Acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer, Yuri Grigorovich, received top Soviet and Russian honours. The new pontiff railed against harm done to the poor and the environment in his first mass at the Vatican. The barrage comes ahead of a planned call between Presidents Trump and Putin on Monday, as the US pushes for a ceasefire.",

    "title": "Biden's cancer diagnosis raises fresh questions about his health in White House",
    "article_text": "Joe Biden's announcement that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer has revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms. Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier. Others pointed out that cancers can grow fast without the patient displaying symptoms - and that men over 70 are not routinely screened. President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday his predecessor should have been more transparent with the public, seeming to imply that the cancer diagnosis had been covered up - a suggestion rejected by a Biden aide. \"I think it is very sad actually. I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,\" Trump said at an event at the White House. \"It could take years to get to this level of danger. So, look, it's a very, very sad situation. I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.\" A Biden aide said the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago. He had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test in 2014, the aide told reporters on Tuesday. \"Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" the aide added. The cancer diagnosis comes amid reports that the Democrat's aides sought to conceal other deteriorating health conditions from the public ahead of the 2024 election. Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. He dropped out of the race last summer after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office. The authors write: \"Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.\" The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election. \"It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,\" Senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday. After the news of Biden's diagnosis, Vice-President JD Vance wished him well, but asked whether Biden's doctors or staff members had sought to keep the public from knowing about the true state of his health. \"This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,\" he added. Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who worked as a Covid adviser to the Biden White House, was among those claiming that Biden probably had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it. \"He did not develop in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president,\" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe show. \"He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.\" US medical guidelines do not recommend routine blood screenings for men over 70 because prostate cancers can be very slow-growing, and the difficulty of testing and treatment may outweigh the risk from the cancer. Biden had previously been diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate. In 2019, before he was elected, his campaign released the report from his medical screening, saying he had been treated with medication and surgery, \"and has never had prostate cancer\". That's led to questions about whether Biden was tested at any point during his four-year presidency - and why the diagnosis came so late. \"I would assume the former president gets a very thorough physical every year,\" Dr Chris George of the Northwestern Health Network told Reuters. \"It's sort of hard for me to believe that he's had a (blood test) within the past year that was normal.\" However, Dr Robert Figlin, interim director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer, told the BBC that the aggressive way Biden's cancer had presented was not that unusual. And he warned critics against \"assuming that somehow something was missed along the way\". Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer for men, according to the Cleveland Clinic. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), out of every 100 American men, 13 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, and two or three men will die from it. Scientists say the new method can diagnose the exact type of tumour within hours, rather than weeks. Russ Penwell, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer at age 28, tells men to check themselves. The former US president has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, his office says. The disease has spread to the 82-year-old's bones but his office said the cancer could be effectively managed. Éanna Mac Cana documents his connection with Fermanagh's Dr Denis Burkitt after his rare cancer diagnosis.",

    "title": "India's Banu Mushtaq scripts history with International Booker win",
    "article_text": "Indian writer-lawyer-activist Banu Mushtaq has scripted history by winning the International Booker prize for the short story anthology, Heart Lamp. It is the first book written in the Kannada language, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, to win the prestigious prize. The stories in Heart Lamp were translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi. Featuring 12 short stories written by Mushtaq over three decades from 1990 to 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Mushtaq's win comes off the back of Geetanjali Shree's Tomb of Sand - translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell - winning the prize in 2022. Her body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. It is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plot-lines. \"In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,\" areviewin the Indian Express newspaper says about the book. Mushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. But her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. Mushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. She began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children. It would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life. Her short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews. In aninterviewwith Vogue magazine, she said, \"I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29\". In the anotherinterviewto The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. Then, a shocking act of defiance set her free. \"Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',\" she told the magazine. In Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience. \"In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors — silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back — not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,\" according to areview ofthe book in The Indian Express newspaper. Mushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism. After leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family. In a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel. But her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate. In aninterviewto The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques. A fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband. But these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty. \"I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,\" shetoldThe Week magazine.

    "title": "Spain orders Airbnb to take down 66,000 listings as mass tourism backlash returns",
    "article_text": "The Spanish government has called for the removal of the listings of nearly 66,000 properties on rental platform Airbnb on the grounds that they breach regulations for tourist accommodation. The clampdown comes as protests against over-tourism have begun ahead of the summer season. Demonstrations in the Canary Islands on Sunday attracted thousands of people. The minister for social rights, consumer affairs and the 2030 Agenda, Pablo Bustinduy, said the rental properties in question had \"violated various norms regarding housing for tourist use\". The announcement followed a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must immediately withdraw from the market 4,984 of the properties cited by the ministry. The properties are in six regions: Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands. Bustinduy's ministry is now awaiting further judicial rulings on the other 60,000 or so properties whose listings it deems unlawful. According to the ministry, the properties it has identified either did not provide a licence number, provided an erroneous number, or did not specify the legal status of the owner to show whether they were renting on a professional basis or as a private individual. He described the court's decision as \"a clear victory for those who fight to protect the right to housing\". Bustinduy added that \"it can be possible to ensure that no economic interest has priority over housing and that no company, however big or powerful, is above the law\". Housing has emerged as Spaniards' biggest concern in recent months, due to spiralling rental costs, particularly in larger towns and cities. Read more:Spanish fightback against record tourism The cost of an average rental has doubled over the last decade, while salaries have failed to keep up. Tourist apartments have been identified by many as a major cause of the problem, depriving local residents of accommodation. Spain is the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, with 94 million foreign visitors in 2024, a 13% rise on the previous year. Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said earlier this year \"there are too many Airbnbs and not enough homes\", and he promised to prevent the \"uncontrolled\" expansion of the use of properties for tourism. Some local governments have also started to act against Airbnb. Barcelona City Hall has said it will eliminate its 10,000 short-term tourist apartmentsby the end of 2028. Others have taken a different approach. In recent months, Airbnb has reached agreements with local authorities in the Canary Islands, Ibiza and Murcia aimed at ensuring property owners comply with tourist rental rules. Airbnb responded to the court ruling and Bustinduy's announcement by insisting it would appeal against decisions linked to this case and that no evidence of rule-breaking by hosts had been provided. It also cited a 2022 ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court which found that the responsibility for listing information lay with the host of each property, not the company, which was a \"neutral intermediary\" and not a real estate provider. The firm also made a broader point about the Spanish housing problem. \"The root cause of the affordable housing crisis in Spain is a lack of supply to meet demand,\" said a spokesperson. \"Governments across the world are seeing that regulating Airbnb does not alleviate housing concerns or return homes to the market – it only hurts local families who rely on hosting to afford their homes and rising costs.\" Last summer, Spain saw a wave of protests against over-tourism in many popular destinations, with its impact on housing the biggest grievance. With the number of foreign visitors to Spain fast approaching 100 million per year, the unrest is expected to continue this summer. On Sunday, several thousand people took to the streets across the Canary Islands under the slogan \"Canaries have a limit\". In Majorca, a group calledMenys Turisme, Més Vida(Less tourism, more life) is preparing for similar actions, with a protest scheduled for 15 June. Pedro Sánchez warns against \"double standards\" after Russia was banned from the song contest in 2022. The short rental firm says it is aiming to offer a wider range of experiences for travellers.

    "title": "Rubio warns Syria could be weeks away from 'full-scale civil war'",
    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for Syria's transitional authorities to be supported, warning that the country could be only weeks away from \"potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions\". At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December. Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained. There was no immediate comment from Syrian officials. The US imposed sanctions on Syria in response to atrocities committed by forces loyal to Assad during the country's devastating 13-year civil war, in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced from their homes. The State Department had previously insisted on several conditions being met before they were lifted, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities. Although Sharaa has promised to do that, the country has been rocked by two waves of deadly sectarian violence in recent months. In March, almost 900 civilians, mainly members of Assad's Alawite sect, were killed by pro-government forces across the western coastal region during fighting between security forces and former regime loyalists, according to one monitoring group. The loyalists reportedly killed almost 450 civilians and 170 security personnel. And at the start of May, more than 100 people were reportedly killed in clashes between gunmen from the Druze religious minority, the new security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters in two suburbs of the capital Damascus and the southern province of Suweida. Even before the violence, many members of minority communities were worried about the new transitional authorities, which are dominated by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It is a former al-Qaeda affiliate still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK. Sharaa himself also continues to be listed by the US as a \"specially designated global terrorist\", although the Biden administration announced in December that the US would scrap the $10m (£7.5m) bounty offered for his arrest. Despite Sharaa's past, Trump took the opportunity to meet him while attending a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia last week. Afterwards, the US president told reporters that he was a \"young, attractive guy\", adding: \"Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.\" \"He's got a real shot at pulling it [Syria] together,\" he said, adding, \"it's a torn-up country\". Sharaa meanwhile said Trump's decision to lift the sanctions on Syria \"was a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth and lays the foundations for stability in the region\". Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington DC on Tuesday, Rubio quipped that \"the bad news is that the transitional authority figures... didn't pass their background check with the FBI\". \"But on the flip side of it is, if we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we did not engage them it was guaranteed to not work out,\" he added. \"In fact, it is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.\" He did not elaborate but said Syria's minorities were \"dealing with deep internal distrust... because Assad deliberately pitted these groups against each other\". He said the Trump decided to lift the sanctions quickly because \"nations in the region want to get aid in, want to start helping them. And they can't because they are afraid of our sanctions\". As Rubio spoke, European Union foreign ministers agreed to also lift economic sanctions on Syria. \"We want to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria,\" the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X. \"The EU has always stood by Syrians throughout the last 14 years - and will keep doing so.\" The Syrian foreign ministry said the decision marked \"the beginning of a new chapter in Syrian-European relations built on shared prosperity and mutual respect\". Sterling Williams is accused of helping 10 inmates escape the Orleans Parish Jail on Friday. The judge orders the migrants to be kept in US government custody, holding the plane on the tarmac if necessary. On Tuesday, a Los Angeles judge reduced Lyle and Erik's murder sentence, making them eligible for parole. The South African president will try to reset relations with the US in a high-stakes White House meeting on Wednesday. He was best known for playing Norm Peterson in the popular comedy series Cheers from 1982 to 1993.",

    "title": "Girl, 11, who drowned at water park unlawfully killed, inquest rules",
    "article_text": "An 11-year-old girl who drowned during a birthday party at a water park in Berkshire was unlawfully killed following gross breaches in health and safety, a coroner has concluded. Kyra Hill got into difficulty in a designated swimming area at Liquid Leisure near Windsor in August 2022. An inquest at Berkshire Coroner's Court in Reading was told how Kyra, from Croydon, south London, was found more than an hour after emergency services were first alerted. The owner of the park wasfined £80,000 in June 2024. Breaches included the lack of an emergency plan or a risk assessment, the inquest heard. The only warning signs related to shallow water, despite depths reaching 4.67m (15.3ft) in parts of the swimming area, which senior coroner Heidi Connor said were \"falsely reassuring\". Mrs Connor said the fact parents were not made aware of the risks or the depth of the water was \"likely to have caused or contributed more than minimally\" to Kyra's death. \"If there had been systems in place to make parents and carers aware that there were deep parts of the water, that there was a requirement for one adult per four children in the water... then it is unlikely that Kyra would have got into trouble in the water as she did,\" she said. Mrs Connor also said poor visibility in the water - described as \"zero\" by the diver who found Kyra - also contributed to her death, and that if an emergency plan or risk assessment was in place, the other risk factors would have been reduced. Her father, Leonard Hill, fought back tears as he read a pen portrait of his daughter at the inquest on Tuesday. \"Kyra was a beautiful, beaming beacon of light in the lives of all who were fortunate enough to know her\", he said. Speaking outside court, Kyra's father described his daughter as \"precious and irreplaceable\". \"Our beloved Kyra was a remarkably strong and exceptional swimmer, a true champion in the water,\" he said. \"Yet, despite her strength, her life was tragically cut short.\" Mr Hill said he was going to campaign for tighter safety regulations at water parks. A 17-year-old lifeguard spotted Kyra struggling at about 15:20 BST on 6 August 2022 and dived in after her, but she said visibility was \"terrible\" and she \"couldn't see anything\". She said she asked a nearby group if there had been someone there, but they said \"they got out\". She told colleagues and a manager quickly attended, but emergency services were only called 37 minutes after Kyra was last seen, Mrs Connor said previously. A diver missed several calls and he entered the water in an effort to find Kyra at about 16:30, finding her at about 17:10. Life jackets were only required for children aged three to five at the water park, or for those who were not competent swimmers. Kelly Edwards, who was at the park that day with her daughter, described the situation after Kyra went missing as a \"nightmare\". She recalled asking a senior member of staff to stop the music as it was \"so loud\" and requested they make \"an announcement that a child was missing\" but they did not, the inquest heard. \"It was like a nightmare that wouldn't stop, the music wasn't stopping, people were carrying on, still in the waters,\" she said. \"They weren't being moved and I was screaming for Kyra, for people to do something.\" Liquid Leisure's owner and director Stuart Marston told the inquest the incident was taken \"very seriously\" from the moment he was made aware. \"I'm a parent myself, of three children, and losing a child sends any parent into a panic,\" he said. Mr Marston said on the day of the incident he had shut the gates to the waterpark, as he could not be sure it was not an abduction. \"We had conflicting reports of where Kyra was last seen, it was very difficult and confusing - I was panicking,\" he added.

    "title": "Ryanair tells flight attendants in Spain to repay salary rises after union wins court case",
    "article_text": "Ryanair has ordered some flight attendants in Spain to repay salary increases of up to €3,000 (£2,525) following a legal dispute with their union. A pay rise had been agreed with the Spanish union, CCOO, and it applied to all flight attendants regardless of what union they belonged to. But another Spanish union - Union Sindical Obrera - won a court case in March to nullify the deal. The Irish airline has now written to Union Sindical Obrera to say it will be informing its members how much they owe. Union Sindical Obrera has hit back at Ryanair's decision to claw back five month's worth of pay rises, but the firm said: \"USO are complaining about pay cuts that result from their court case.\" It added: \"Ryanair is complying with the court case that Union Sindical Obrera took to cut pay while it is under appeal.\" The union told the BBC: \"We are working on finding the most adequate legal solution for the matter.\" The union said it objected to the original agreement because those at the table negotiating were not authorised to do so for its members and \"legally couldn't sign that kind of agreement\". It said this is why it \"left the negotiations, after advising all other parties that the negotiations were irregular\". According to Union Sindical Obrera, the rises that Ryanair is demanding union members pay back range between €1,500 and €3,000. It said also said that members and non-members have had their salary reverted to what it was before the agreement was implemented. A spokesperson for Ryanair declined to answer questions on how many flight attendants it is pursuing or what will happen if they do not pay back the money. Since the court case which nullified the deal for all flight attendants, Ryanair has agreed a pay deal for staff who are members of the CCOO union. They will not be required to pay back the increase they received between October and March, despite that original agreement being declared null and void by the court. The Union Sindical Obrera said the airline has told the affected flight attendants \"that the money will be simply deducted from the payslip until the debt is paid\". It added that \"some of the non-aligned workers are not forced to pay the amount back\" but \"all Union Sindical Obrera delegates have been requested to return the money\". In a letter, Ryanair describes the union's decision to maintain the terms agreed under the original deal with the CCOO, which the Union Sindical Obrera fought to nullify, as \"farcical\". In a document seen by the BBC, Ryanair informs a flight attendant, who is a member of Union Sindical Obrera, that because they are not part of the deal agreed with the CCOO this has \"created an overpayment situation\". The airline tells the worker that based on its calculations they were \"overpaid\" nearly €3,000. It offers to let the flight attendant repay the money over a year by taking a sum out of their monthly salary. About 170,000 nurses, midwives, paramedics and other staff will receive the rise which includes an inflation guarantee. The number of workers on payrolls fell in the first three months of the year, official figures show. Brendan O'Meara appeared before a special sitting of Ennis District Court on Saturday. Staff at Bath and North East Somerset Council are facing a pay cut at the beginning of June BBC Verify examines why political pressure over public sector pay and industrial action has re-emerged.",

    "title": "Elon Musk plans to cut back political spending",
    "article_text": "Billionaire Elon Musk has said he expects to dial back his political donations, a major shift from the figure who shook up the 2024 election as a top donor to President Donald Trump. Musk, who ultimately spent more than $250m (£187m) in support of Trump's campaign, told an economic conference in Qatar that he planned to do \"a lot less\" spending in the future. He also said he was committed to leading electric car company Tesla for another five years. The comments come just a few weeks after he said he would step back from leading the controversial White House effort to slash federal spending, commonly called Doge. Asked whether he expected to continue his political spending at scale, Musk told the conference he felt he had \"done enough\". \"If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,\" he said. \"I do not currently see a reason,\" he added. Musk had largely stayed out of the political arena until last year, and his high-dollar entry raised scrutiny of his companies, which also include rocket firm Starlink and social media company X. Concerns about conflicts of interest bubbled up as he became an influential figure in Trump's White House, given some of his companies have contracts with the federal government while some have been investigated by the government. There were also protests and boycotts of Tesla against his steps to get rid of thousands of federal workers and to give his Doge team access to government information. As sales sank,Tesla's board and investors began to worry publicly that he was not focused enough on the company that helped make him a billionaire. With public opinion souring, Musk also ran into limits to his political influence. Earlier this year, the candidate he backed to join the Wisconsin Supreme Court was defeated, despite receiving more than $20m from Musk and groups he supports. Trump also forged ahead with tariffs, against Musk's advice, while Doge's spending cuts have fallen short of the trillions in dollars in savings Musk originally pledged to achieve. At the conference Musk defended Doge's performance, noting it has little power over spending. \"We are simply the adviser,\" he said. \"In that context we are doing very well.\" He also disputed reports by the UN and others that Doge's cuts have had adevastating impact on people helped by initiativespreviously backed by the US, such as HIV/AIDS prevention. Musk said he had taken the backlash, which included violent attacks on Tesla cars, personally. But when asked if he had any regrets about his political activities, Musk said: \"I did what needed to be done.\" He brushed off worries about the impact on Tesla, saying it was doing well outside of Europe. \"It's already turned around,\" he said, noting Tesla's share price has risen recently. \"We see no problem with demand.\" Bloomberg journalist Mishal Hussain, who conducted the on-stage interview at the conference, pressed Musk about whether his commitment to Tesla was contingent on pay. The world's richest person has been pushing to receive a record-breaking compensation package, which has been twice rejected by a federal judge. \"It's not a money thing,\" Musk said. \"It's a reasonable control thing.\" It was removed in 2020 for violating Apple's policies by launching its own in-app payment system. Some analysts question whether the amount of investment will ultimately be that high. The fate of Trump's tax plan remains mired in uncertainty despite a last minute, in-person pitch to Republicans. Government-funded welfare programmes have become a major point of contention in Trump's tax bill. New trade agreements will boost economic growth, says chancellor, as she sets sights on Middle East.",

    "article_text": "Kevin de Bruyne was playing his 142nd and final league game for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium Kevin de Bruyne received an emotional farewell at Etihad Stadium for the final time on Tuesday night - and the moment even brought manager Pep Guardiola to tears, who called it a \"sad day\". The 33-year-old will go down as a Manchester City legend and proclaimed he will \"always be here\" after the announcement thata statue will be built,externalin his honour outside the stadium. Captain De Bruyne is set to depart this summer and started his last home game in City's3-1 victory over Bournemouth,but the Premier League great bowed out in a somewhat abject manner. He had the chance to go out in style but missed a first-half sitter and was then sacrificed in the second half after Mateo Kovacic's sending off - a sad ending for such an illustrious career. De Bruyne said in his post-match speech: \"I wanted to play with creativity, I wanted to play with passion. I wanted to enjoy football and I hope everyone enjoyed it. \"Everybody has pushed me so hard inside and outside the club to be the best version of myself and these guys in front of me have made me better than I was before. \"It's an honour to play with these guys. I've made so many friends for life.\" The decade-long association has produced unprecedented success for City, while the player has etched himself into the club's history books by taking home an incredible 16 winners' medals during that period. Once the full-time whistle was blown, nothing was going to spoil his grand send-off as City players, staff and supporters paid tribute to their midfield maestro. Guardiola said: \"Everybody saw how much the people from Manchester City are connected with him and his family and how much love [they have]. \"Titles are nice and everything that he has achieved, but when you leave after 10 years with this much respect and gratitude, there is nothing else better than that. \"I am part of that, the club will take the decision, but it is a sad day and he will be missed, there is no doubt about that.\" Guardiola added: \"When Kevin arrived here, I am pretty sure he was not a Man City fan, I don't know who he supports, but I am pretty sure he is a fan now and will be forever. \"That is because of the connection between all the people and him.\" Reduce squad size or I'll quit - Guardiola Man City beat Bournemouth to close in on Champions League De Bruyne shared an embrace with his children before kick-off On a night when 'The Boss' rolled into town, 'The King' waved goodbye for the final time. De Bruyne's face was plastered everywhere you looked on arrival at the stadium and although legendary US singer Bruce Springsteen may have been playing a few yards away at the Co-Op Live arena, this was the hottest ticket of the day. Merchandise stalls had scarves emblazoned with De Bruyne's name, as did the shirts of supporters, while the matchday programme has a mock-up of the player with the crown from the Premier League trophy atop his head. City had announced in the lead-up to kick-off that they had dedicated a mosaic and named a road after De Bruyne at the club's academy. It was also fitting that a playmaker that has created such artistry on the grass canvass has had a huge mural painted of him in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Once chants of \"ohh Kevin De Bruyne\" to Seven Nations Army died down, there was a buzz of anticipation each time he had his foot on the ball, willing him to showcase a goal or assist for one last time on their turf. The big moment could not have been planned any better - the ball laid to him on a plate, in front of an open goal, a couple of yards out, but De Bruyne in slow motion scooped the ball onto the bar. The 33-year-old had his head in his hands, so did the returning Rodri on the bench and City fans all around as the dream finale went awry. \"It's terrible,\" De Bruyne said of the miss. \"There's no excuses. My son is going to be very tough on me today.\" At full-time, a montage of his best moments over the past decade flashed up on the screen with messages from the likes of Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany, Raheem Sterling and Pablo Zabaleta. De Bruyne was given a guard of honour as he returned to the pitch with his wife and kids by his side. Then came the outpouring of emotion. The former Chelsea man struggled to hold it together during his speech in the middle of the park, as did a tearful Guardiola watching on from the sidelines. \"We want you to stay, Kevin de Bruyne, we want you to stay,\" was the chant that rung out from supporters but there appears to be no turning back, as he led his team-mates on a lap of appreciation before making an exit for one last time. Former City defender Micah Richards said: \"He lets his football do the talking. He's such a shy character but I have been meeting him over the years and seeing how humble he is and how great a player he is, it is just great to see. \"He has deserved his send-off. Everyone who's played with him speaks highly of him, and to do what he's one in the Premier League is just sensational.\" This video can not be played 'It's a sad day' - Pep pays tribute to De Bruyne after final home game Guardiola holds De Bruyne in such high esteem that he described the Belgian as the \"second best\" passer he has worked with - after the great Lionel Messi. Since his debut in September 2015, De Bruyne has played 283 top-flight games and has provided 119 assists, second in the Premier League's all-time list behind Ryan Giggs' 162, and scored 72 goals. Those 190 goal involvements puts him fourth on the Premier League list during that period behind Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. With 843 chances created during that period, De Bruyne has been, by far, the most prolific creative player in the division, with Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes lagging behind in second with 535. The game against Bournemouth was De Bruyne's 142nd and final home league appearance for City, with only David Silva having played more Premier League games at the Etihad with 160. Asked what City meant to him, De Bruyne said it was \"home\", \"family\" and that his kid \"were Manc\". Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp said on Sky Sports: \"Who is the next De Bruyne in world football? They don't exist. He is like a unicorn, so don't even bother looking for another KDB. \"There is absolutely no doubt he is a genius. For him it is so easy.\" De Bruyne has made it clear he is not abdicating his throne by his own choice, sayinghe was surprisednot to be offered a new contract by the club. While his next move could be to Chicago Fire in the US, attention will soon turn to the difficult task of finding a replacement. BBC Sport understandsCity are withdrawing their initial interest in Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz, owing to the soaring costs of any deal, but Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White is among the options. City, though, have two players at the club in Phil Foden and Jack Grealish that have played a bit-part role this term and could provide the answer if they can rediscover their form. \"He [De Bruyne] is irreplaceable,\" said Richards. \"I have been disappointed with Phil Foden, but he needs to step up now. \"There is a vacancy available and this is Foden's time.\" De Bruyne added: \"To do what we've done as a club, supporters, teammates we've won everything. \"We made the city, the club bigger and now they're going to take over.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Reduce squad size or I'll quit - Guardiola",
    "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has been Manchester City manager since 2016 Pep Guardiola has said he will quit as manager of Manchester City if he is given a big squad to select from after the summer transfer market. A number of Man City's senior players were not included in the squad forTuesday's 3-1 win against Bournemouthand Guardiola says he is unhappy at leaving so many players out. Abdukodir Khusanov, Savinho, James McAtee, Claudio Echeverri and Rico Lewis all missed out on Tuesday's 20-man matchday squad as City moved to third in the Premier League and within a point of Champions League qualification. But, despite this showing the depth Guardiola has at his disposal, the Spaniard wants to work with a smaller squad. He said: \"I said to the club I don't want that [a bigger squad]. I don't want to leave five or six players in the freezer. I don't want that. I will quit. Make a shorter squad, I will stay.\" Guardiola says it is \"impossible for my soul\" to leave players watching from the stands. \"Maybe [for] three, four months we couldn't select 11 players, we didn't have defenders, it was so difficult. After people come back but next season it cannot be like that,\" the 54-year-old added. \"As a manager I cannot train 24 players and every time I select I have to have four, five, six stay in Manchester at home because they cannot play. This is not going to happen. I said to the club. I don't want that.\" City spent more than Â£200m on four players in January after suffering a number of key injuries. Kevin De Bruyne is one of those players who will definitely depart in the summer, while the future of Jack Grealish is in doubt. When asked if it meant more exits were inevitable, Guardiola - whosigned a dealkeeping him at the club until 2027 - said: \"It is a question for the club. I don't want to have 24, 25, 26 players when everyone is fit. If I have injuries, unlucky, we have some players for the academy and we do it. Guardiola said a big squad is unstainable and that it is important  for \"the soul of the team\" that his players \"create another connection with each other that this season we lost it a bit\". All Premier League clubs can have a 25-man squad, but this is not an exhaustive list of all players eligible to play. A team can also include under-21 players who are eligible over and above the 25-man squad limit.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played My respect towards Murray remains the same - Djokovic Novak Djokovic says he \"couldn't get more\" out of his partnership with Andy Murray but is in no rush to find a new coach. The Serb, who turns 38 on Thursday,parted companywith former rival Murray earlier in May after six months working together. Djokovic has taken a wildcard into the Geneva Open - one of the final tournaments before the French Open - as he looks to find more rhythm on the court. The French Open starts on Sunday, with Djokovic seeking a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title. On his time working with Murray, Djokovic said: \"We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. \"My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. \"I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well.\" Evans beats Harris to move closer to French Open place Why Swiatek's reign as 'Queen of Clay' is under threat Six of world's top 10 men to play at Queen's Djokovic has yet to win a match on clay this year, having suffered early exits in Monte Carlo and Madrid before skipping the Italian Open. Lifting the title in Geneva would make Djokovic just the third man in the Open era to win 100 ATP singles titles - as well as be a welcome boost before Roland Garros. Djokovic is joined in Geneva by Dusan Vemic, who was previously part of his team, and assistant coach and analyst Boris Bosnjakovic. \"At the moment, I'm not in need of a coach,\" Djokovic said. \"I don't need to rush in any context. I feel comfortable with the people around me. \"In the next few tournaments, we'll see what happens.\" Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in his first tournament working with Britain's former world number one Murray, before he was forced to retire through injury. He has had a difficult start to the 2025 season, losing his first match in four of his past five tournaments andbeing beaten in the Miami Open finalby Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik. Djokovic will face 134th-ranked Hungarian Marton Fucsovics on Wednesday. Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Before his campaign in Geneva, Djokovic has not won on clay this season after losing his opening matches in Monte Carlo and Madrid. Among his 24 major titles - which leaves him tied with Margaret Court for the all-time record - the French Open is his least successful, with three triumphs. \"It's a different chapter of my life that I'm trying to navigate myself through,\" Djokovic said. \"I'm not particularly used to having this kind of circumstances where I would lose a consecutive match, tournaments, first rounds and so forth. I don't think it ever happened for me in the last 20 years. But I knew that eventually that moment will come. \"I'm trying to do well, I'm trying to win more trophies, I'm trying to build my form for Roland Garros, and perform at the desired, necessary level in order to go far in the tournament and challenge the best players in the world. \"So yes, the motivation is still there.\"",

    "title": "'I'm not a clown' - Postecoglou defends record in gripping media conference",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played \"Don't worry about my future, mate\" - Ange Postecoglou An emotional Ange Postecoglou angrily dismissed the suggestion he is a \"clown\" in a combative news conference on the eve of Tottenham's Europa League final against Manchester United. Referencing a report in the Standard,externalwhich said he was \"teetering between hero and clown\" depending on the result in Bilbao, Spurs boss Postecoglou defended his managerial record despite his side's poor domestic season. In Wednesday's final, Tottenham will either end a 17-year wait for a trophy or finish the campaign empty-handed again, on the back of their worst campaign since the club returned to the top flight in 1978. Speaking at San Mames Stadium, Postecoglou veered from simmering discontent to his voice cracking with emotion as he recounted his personal journey and that of his family. He brought the conversation back to the article when the reporter who wrote it pointed out this season could become one of the best or worst in the club's \"modern history\" and the Australian was veering a fine line \"between two very different types of infamy\". \"Irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and never will be,\" said Postecoglou. \"You really disappointed me that you used such terminology to describe a person that for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he is leading out a club in a European final. \"For you to suggest that somehow us not being successful means that I'm a clown, I'm not sure how to answer that question.\" Coach trips and 33-hour ferries as fans flock to Bilbao Postecoglou's second-season success - what and how has he won? The Â£100m final Man Utd cannot afford to lose? Postecoglou was born in Athens but emigrated to Australia with his family when he was five. After winning four international caps as a player, he embarked on a stellar coaching career that included spells with Brisbane Roar and Melbourne Victory, before taking over the Australia national side. He moved on to Japan with Yokohama F Marinos, then joined Celtic in 2021 and Tottenham in 2023. Postecoglou evidently feels, regardless of whether Tottenham win or not tomorrow, he is a success story given where he has come from. \"My parents left everything they knew because of their children, because of me, I hold that dear to my heart,\" he added. \"I was born in Greece. My father made sure I knew what it means to be Greek. Then I grew up in Australia, where football is not a prominent sport. \"I feel that very strongly. In Australia, when it comes to sport, you will take on anyone, it doesn't matter how big and strong they are.\" Ange Postecoglou has won 46 and lost 38 of his 99 games in charge of Tottenham Postecoglou has spent months batting away questions about his future. He generally dismisses the impact of losing his job, preferring to concentrate on his players and the task immediately ahead of them. On Tuesday evening in Bilbao, he took a different approach, telling a room full of journalists he will be fine, no matter what the outcome for his team. \"Don't stress,\" he said. \"I have been in this position before where a big game has been the last one I have managed. \"I qualified for a World Cup with Australia and left, won at Celtic and left, won at Brisbane and left. It does happen. \"My future is assured. I have a great family and a great life. Provided my health remains and my family is there my future is assured. \"I still think there is a lot of work to be done [at Tottenham]. There has been some growth I would like to see through. \"Whether that happens I don't know but there is still some growth there.\" Immediately before his manager spoke to the media, Tottenham captain Son Heung-min had done so alongside full-back Pedro Porro. Along with Ben Davies, Son is the remaining link to the teambeaten by Liverpool in the 2019 Champions League final. That loss still stings, judging by Son's \"I still don't think it was a penalty\" response to a question about the game, referring to the contentious first-minute spot-kick for handball against Moussa Sissoko that offered Liverpool a chance to establish a lead they never seriously looked like losing. Son's participation in Wednesday's final had been in doubt due to a foot injury that kept him out for a month prior tothe home defeat by Crystal Palaceon 11 May. But, during Tuesday evening's open training session, Postecoglou appeared to indicate the 32-year-old would start as he operated a three-man attack that also included Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert in the number 10 role behind striker Dominic Solanke. James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall have all been ruled out of the game through injury and, if Postecoglou sticks with that formation tomorrow night, it would mean Brazilian forward Richarlison starts on the bench.

    "title": "Who has made Troy's Premier League team of the week?",
    "article_text": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week. Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page. Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa):More in here for his tears after the win over Spurs - was it theatrics? Is this the last time we see him in the Premier League? Really interesting time. Marc Cucurella (Chelsea):He has been really consistent. I wasn't convinced with him at first but he has been proving himself with his displays and he can step up with a big goal at the big moments. Nikola Milenkovic (Nottingham Forest):The big Serb has arguably been the best centre-half in the Premier League this season. A big shout but he has been really good and scored a big goal in a must-win game for Forest at West Ham. Excellent. Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa):It is not nice for me to talk about Aston Villa players in a really good way, but these guys are performing big at the moment. An excellent performance and he is growing more as a man and as a leader under Unai Emery. I can see him being a real threat for England in the World Cup - and starting. Connor Bradley (Liverpool):A lot of eyes on him. Not only with Trent leaving but what looks like Jeremie Frimpong joining. I think he has been fantastic and showcased how good he can be going forward with a lovely assist at Brighton. A career we will all watch with intrigue. It is up to Mr Frimpong to get him out. Declan Rice (Arsenal):He has stepped up in big, big moments. A lovely finish to beat Newcastle and he is affecting the game all over. He is an infectious personality and now his players are feeding off him. There are a few calls for him to be captain - I don't think that would be fair on Martin Odegaard. But life isn't fair - he is becoming the leader without the armband. Yasin Ayari (Brighton):A lovely goal against Liverpool. He is a very young, very exciting player but played with a maturity and level of confidence that was very impressive. He is another one Brighton have picked off the conveyor belt. The energy he brings, he wasn't scared to put himself about. Excellent. Harvey Elliott (Liverpool):Another youngster who has played with real maturity and confidence. Elliott will have to move on and could play for any of the big teams and be a star. Iliman Ndiaye (Everton):On what was an emotional day for Everton, I think he epitomised the club and Goodison Park. Not the first person you would pick - he has had ups and downs throughout the year but through his form he has shown a level of class. Eddie Nketiah (Crystal Palace):Did we see a glimpse of what Crystal Palace could look like without Jean-Philippe Mateta? Maybe. Nketiah has had a tough season at Palace but great to see him scoring and smiling and, again looking ahead to the World Cup, we need young English strikers who are scoring. Nketiah will be trying his best to get on the England plane. Jamie Vardy (Leicester):The man, the myth, the legend. I don't want to hear Roy of the Rovers any more. All I want to hear is the Jamie Vardy story. Everything he has done in his career was encapsulated as he scored in the win against Ipswich. There is talk of him doing a screenplay - the scene is set to end on '500 games, 200 goals'. Perfect. Can't say enough about the man. Marco Silva (Fulham):There has been a lot of talk about him leaving but the passion, fight and desire he showed at the side of the pitch in the win at Brentford tells me he still cares. The best part is he made four changes and three of them scored. Do you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "article_text": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin was joined by his wife Sandra on the pitch after Everton's final game at Goodison Park on Sunday Everton have condemned \"threatening, racist, and misogynistic\" abuse aimed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Sandra Calvert-Lewin received online abuse after posting a message in support of her husband, who played his final game at Goodison Park in Sunday's 2-0 win over Southampton. The 28-year-old forward has scored 30 Premier League goals for the Toffees at their home ground - a record bettered only by Duncan Ferguson and Romelu Lukaku. Following Everton's finale at Goodison Park before relocating to their new Hill Dickinson Stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock next season, Sandra Calvert-Lewin posted on Instagram: \"30 goals at Goodison. Top 3 ever. They might not shout it - but we're proud every single day.\" Everton midfielder Doucoure to leave this summer The English forward has endured a dismal campaign, scoring just twice at Goodison Park this season, and her post was criticised by some Toffees supporters. The club said: \"Everton Football Club strongly condemns the threatening, racist, and misogynistic abuse directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin on social media. \"This sinister and intimidating behaviour is not only deeply hurtful and distressing, it is also criminal - and does not represent the values of Everton or the overwhelming majority of our supporters. \"The club has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of discriminatory and abusive behaviour. We are working closely with Merseyside Police and the Premier League to ensure the individuals responsible are identified and held accountable for their actions. \"Threats or abuse of any kind - whether online or in person - are completely unacceptable and have no place in our game or in society. The club urges anyone who sees or experiences such behaviour to report it to the authorities and relevant social media platforms immediately. \"We will continue to offer our full support to Dominic and his family.\" In response, Merseyside Police said: \"We are aware of racist and threatening social media comments directed towards the wife of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. \"To send such abhorrent messages to anyone online is utterly appalling and we are working with Everton Football Club as part of our initial enquiries. \"We take these reports extremely seriously and would like to remind social media users that any belief that they can maintain anonymity online to commit offences is misplaced. \"Offences committed online, which includes making threats and racist abuse, can be investigated.\"",

    "title": "Rubio clashes with Democrats over decision to admit white South Africans",
    "article_text": "Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, has defended theTrump administration’s controversial decision toadmit59 Afrikaners fromSouth Africaas refugees after Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, claimed they were getting preferential treatment because they were white. Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s former running mate, challenged Rubio to justify prioritising the Afrikaners while cancelling long-standing refugee programmes for other groups that have been more documented as victims of conflict or persecution. The clash between the two men was Rubio’s most combative exchange in his first appearance before the Senate foreign relations committee since his unanimous approval by senators in confirmation hearing in January. It came a day before South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was due to meet Donald Trump at the White House in an encounter that promises to be highly charged thanks to the backdrop surrounding the incoming Afrikaners. “Right now, the US refugee program allows a special program for Afrikaner farmers, the first group of whom arrived at Dulles airport in Virginia not long ago, while shutting off the refugee program for everyone else,” said Kaine, who was a candidate for vice-president alongside Clinton in her unsuccessful 2016 presidential election campaign against Trump. “Do you think Afrikaner farmers are the most persecuted group in the world?” In response, Rubio said: “I think those 49 people that came surely felt they were persecuted, and they’ve passed … every sort of check mark that had to be checked off in terms of meeting their requirements for that. They live in a country where farms are taken, the land is taken, on a racial basis.” Trump has falsely asserted that white farmers in SouthAfricaare undergoing a “genocide” and deserving of special status. By contrast, he suspended the US’s refugee resettlement programme on his first day in office in January, in effect stranding 100,000 people previously approved for resettlement. Kaine asked why Afrikaners were more important than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, who have faced intense persecution in China and Myanmar respectively, and also cited the cases of political dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, as well as Afghans under the Taliban. “The problem we face there is the volume problem,” Rubio said. “If you look at all the persecuted people of the world, it’s millions of people. They can’t all come here.” Kaine called the claims of persecution against Afrikaner farmers “completely specious” and pointed to the existence of an Afrikaner minister in South Africa’s coalition government. He also contrasted the refugee designation of Afrikaners to the absence of such a programme for the country’s Black majority during the apartheid era. “There never has there been a special programme for Africans to come in as refugees to the United States,” Kaine said, pointing out that special designations were allowed for people being persecuted for religions reasons under communist regimes. Referring to the US statutory standard of recognising a refugee claim as being a “well-justified fear of persecution”, Kaine asked: “Should that be applied in an even-handed way? For example, should we say if you’re persecuted on the grounds of your religion, we’ll let you in if you’re a Christian but not a Muslim?” Rubio replied thatUS foreign policydid not require even-handedness, adding: “The United States has a right to allow into this country and prioritise allowance of who they want to allow to come in. We’re going to prioritise people coming into our country on the basis of what’s in the interests of this country. That’s a small number of people that are coming.” Kaine responded: “So you have a different standard based on the color of somebody’s skin. Would that be acceptable?” Rubio replied: “You’re the one talking about the colour of their skin, not me.” Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said he regretted confirming Rubio as secretary of state, after recalling that the two had spent more than a decade working together in Congress, and accusing him of “making a mockery” of the US asylum system. Van Hollen echoed Kaine, drawing attention to the decision to reject refugees from war-torn countries in Africa and Asia while granting asylum status to white Afrikaners, which Van Hollen said was turning the US’s refugee process into a system of “global apartheid”. “You try to block the admission of people who have already been approved as refugees, while making bogus claims to justify such status to Afrikaners. You’ve made a mockery of our country’s refugee process turning it into a system of global apartheid,” Van Hollen said. More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system that enshrined white minority rule, white South Africans typically own 20 times more wealth than their Black compatriots, according to an article in the Review of Black Economy. Unemployment among Black South Africans currently runs at 46.1%, compared to 9.2% for white South Africans. According to the 2022 census, white people account for 7% of South Africa’s population of 63 million, while Black people account for 81%. Faisal Ali contributed additional reporting",

    "article_text": "The mother of the imprisoned British-Egyptian human rights activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah has announced she has resumed a near-total hunger strike, stopping taking the 300-calorie supplements she had been consuming on her partial hunger strike for the past three months. Since the start of her hunger strike 233 days ago, Laila Soueif, 69, has lost 36kg, about 42% of her original body weight, and now weighs 49kg. She is taking the life-endangering step in protest at the continued detention of her son in Cairo beyond his five-year sentence. She has not eaten any food since 29 September 2024, the date her son’s prison sentence was due to end, and has been surviving only on herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts. At the start of March, amid signs that the UK government was doing more behind the scenes to secure her son’s release, she began a less stringent form of hunger strike, taking a daily 300-calorie liquid nutritional supplement, but on Tuesday she said she was stopping having the supplement after discussions with her family. She had started taking the supplement after being encouraged by a call that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, had made on 28 February to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in which he had lobbied for her son’s release. The Egyptian government refuses to recognise Abd el-Fattah’s British citizenship and does not provide the British embassy in Cairo with consular access. There were signs that the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, was speaking with Egyptian intelligence services, seen as closer to the decision-making centre inside the Egyptian government than the Foreign Office. Soueif said: “It seemed to everyone around me that it was only reasonable to allow a few weeks for a process that might lead to Alaa’s release without me incurring permanent damage to my health, or worse.” On the 149th day of her hunger strike in February, Soueif was taken to hospital with dangerously low blood sugar, blood pressure and sodium levels. During her week-long admission at St Thomas’ hospital in London she was given a glucose drip after her blood sugar level dropped to 1.5mmol/L.Soueif, a mathematics professor, has resumed her daily one-hour vigil outside Downing Street to press Starmer to make her son’s release a priority in Britain’s relations with Egypt. Explaining her decision to resume a full hunger strike, Soueif said: “I have never seen [the UK government] act as if the situation was urgent, except when I was hospitalised. For me and for my family the situation is urgent. We have used up more days than we ever thought we had. We need Alaa released now. We need Alaa with us now. We need Alaa reunited with his son Khaled now.” Soueif returned to London on Saturday after a visit to Egypt where she was able to visit her son on three occasions in Wadi el-Natrun prison. He is also on hunger strike, reaching his 81st day on Tuesday without consuming any calories. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion On her prison visit on the 6 May, Soueif was able to visit her son in an office and hug him for the first time since October. However, despite agreement that this could happen again, on a visit on 14 May the Egyptian authorities only let her see him from behind glass. Her first visit on 4 May was also behind glass. In April, Abd el-Fattah had fallen ill with vomiting, severe stomach pains and dizziness and received treatment from doctors in prison.",

    "article_text": "TheMexicannavy has said that the pilot navigating the training ship Cuauhtémoc during itsSaturday night crashinto the Brooklyn Bridge wasNew York-based. “The ship must be controlled by a specialized harbor pilot from theNew Yorkgovernment,” Admiral Raymundo Pedro Morales Ángeles said at a press conference. Morales Ángeles acknowledged there was not much time for the pilot to react to the situation, possibly as little as 80 to 90 seconds. Two soldiers from the Mexican navy were killed and 22 others were injured during the incident, which collapsed all three of the ship’s masts. The event was captured on video by onlookers and quickly spread on social media. Thedead were identifiedas América Sánchez, 20, from Veracruz, and Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos, 23, from Oaxaca. In interviews withMexico News Daily, family members talked about Sanchez’s aspirations to become a naval engineer, and Maldonado’s long-held dream of following his father’s path as a sailor. The ship, which had 277 people on board, was in the midst of a 254-day global goodwill tour, beginning with a 6 April departure from Acapulco, on Mexico’s Pacific coast, and spent five days docked in New York City. New York police said the ship lost power as it left the harbor for Iceland, and was sucked toward the bridge by the current. The ship, at 157ft tall (48m), was unable to fit under the clearance of theBrooklynBridge, at 134.5ft (41m). A member of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was unclear as to how police discerned the ship lost power, but said there were no structural integrity concerns related to the Brooklyn Bridge itself. Onlookers reported seeing crewmembers hanging from the ships masts and beams while awaiting rescue. A full investigation into the ship’s crash is being handled by the NTSB. A preliminary report is expected to be issued in under 30 days, but the full investigation will probably take over a year.",

    "article_text": "The personal secretary and an adviser toMexicoCity’s mayor have been shot dead by gunmen in a brazen daylight attack in a central part of the city. Mayor Clara Brugada called the murder of her personal secretary Ximena Guzmán and adviser José Muñoz a “direct attack”. The motive is under investigation, but Brugada promised that her government would “continue its relentless fight against insecurity”. The attack took place at about 7am on a busy road in the Moderna neighbourhood, near an entrance to the Xola metro station. Initial reports indicate that Muñoz was waiting in the street for Guzmán, who came to pick him up. Video from a security camerashow a man in a white top and a motorbike helmet waiting by Guzmán’s car before he suddenly pulls out a pistol and starts firing – first at Muñoz, then Guzmán – before running off screen. He reportedly fled with a partner on a nearby motorbike. It had the hallmarks of an organised crime hit – incidents that arerelatively rare in the capital. As mayor of Mexico City, Brugada holds one of the most powerful political posts in the country after PresidentClaudia Sheinbaum, and they are allies in the Morena party. Sheinbaum condemned the killings and said during her morning press conference that there would not be impunity. Neither Guzmán nor Muñoz had a security detail, but Sheinbaum said she was not aware of any threats against them. Guzmán had worked with Brugada for years and was reportedly one of the peopleclosest to her in government. At a press conference shortly after the attack, Brugada, dressed in black, paid tribute to the two victims in a strained voice. “[Guzmán] was a wonderful, tireless, good woman. I’ve known [Muñoz] almost since … He’s one of the most intelligent people I’ve ever met, and extremely responsible,” she said. “I want to embrace their families, friends, loved ones and comrades in struggle. We in the city’s cabinet are shocked and mourn the loss of two dear comrades.” Authorities were investigating the motive and checking surveillance camera footage to identify the attackers, said Brugada in a statement. Two hours after the attack, the bodies had been removed by the police and all that was left was broken glass and a pool of blood drying in the morning sun. Just down the road, a shoeshiner said he was there when it happened. “I was right here working when they shot them and I didn’t even realise,” he said, before explaining: “I’m a little deaf.” “But there was no panic,” he added. “Everyone just started looking that way and then my friend here told me there were two dead people by a car.” “I actually didn’t hear the shots either,” said the friend, a stall owner called José Antonio. “I think it must have been with a silencer.” He added: “The killers didn’t try to hide it – they did it at rush hour.” The murders are the highest-profile attacks on government officials in Mexico City since the assassination attempt on the city’s then police chief Omar García Harfuch five years ago. In that attack, gunmen linked to the Jalisco New Generation cartel ambushed García Harfuch as he left his home, riddling his car with hundreds of bullets and killing three people, but not García Harfuch himself, who survived to become security minister of today’s federal government. “We won’t let this cowardly act go unpunished,” wroteGarcía Harfuch on X, as he promised the federal government’s assistance in the investigation. At the scene of the crime, José Antonio, the stall owner, said he had never seen anything like it in more than half a century living in La Moderna. “It’s a calm neighbourhood,” he said. “They were targeted. I guess for professional killers it doesn’t matter whether there are people around or not. They do it and they get out of there.”",

    "title": "King’s visit to Canada will help counter Trump’s threats, says envoy",
    "article_text": "King Charles’svisit toCanadawill “reinforce” the country’s sovereignty against threats fromDonald Trump, the Canadian high commissioner in the UK has said. Ralph Goodale reiterated his country’s independence as Charles and Camilla visitedCanadaHouse in central London on Tuesday ahead of their trip to Ottawa later this month. Speaking about Trump’srepeated suggestions that Canada could become the 51st state, Goodale told journalists that the king’s visit will show Canada is “the true north, strong and free – and we will stay that way”. Charles will open a session of the Canadian parliament on 27 May – the first time a monarch has done so since 1957. The visit comes after the election ofMark Carney– a former governor of the banks of Canada and England – as Canadian prime minister, amid a wave of anti-Trump sentiment. “It’s a very important opportunity for His Majesty to be in a forum where he will have the opportunity to speak to Canadians at a time when that message about the significance and the strength of Canadian sovereignty needs to be reinforced by every means possible,” Goodale said. “The prime minister has made it clear that Canada is not for sale now, is not for sale ever. “The king, as head of state, will reinforce the power and the strength of that message.” As Charles undertakes his duties as head of state of Canada, he is also playing a role in Keir Starmer’s attempt to maintain strong relations with the US. Charles is expected to host Trump for an unprecedented second state visit, after Starmer handed the president an invitation letter from Charles at the White House in February. Carney has criticised that invitation, saying it “cut across”messages his government is trying to send to the White Housein response to threats against Canadian sovereignty. He said Canadians “weren’t impressed” by the gesture “given the circumstance”. Goodale told the UK’s PA news agency that Carney’s words were “direct” and “very accurate”. He said: “The prime minister was asked the clear, direct question: what do Canadians think? He answered it very directly and very accurately as an assessment of what Canadian public opinion was at that time.” The monarch’s arrival at the high commission marked the 100th anniversary of Canada House in London. The king and queen will visit Ottawa from 26 May to 27 May 2025. The visit will be Charles’s first to Canada as sovereign. He will hold audiences with the governor general and Carney before a short ceremony to swear in the queen as a member of the Canadian privy council. He will attend the state opening of parliament accompanied by the queen. During the ceremony, he will deliver the speech from the throne to the Senate Chamber. The occasion will be only the second time that the sovereign has opened a parliament, following Queen Elizabeth II opening the 23rd Canadian parliament in October 1957, and the third time a sovereign has delivered a speech from the throne.",

    "title": "Reeves eyes Gulf trade pact as ‘next deal,’ Bank of England’s Pill says pace of interest rate cuts ‘too rapid’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "China and Australia cut interest rates; Shell faces protests calling for clean-up in Niger Delta Rachel Reevessaid the UK government is closing in on a trade pact with six Gulf nations, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as its next major deal. The chancellor told the BBC the agreement would be the government’s “next deal” as it looks to boost trade ties following Brexit. Reeves suggested economic growth would be strengthened through recent trade deals with the United States, the EU and India, all inked within a fortnight. Britain is in a better place than any other country in the world in terms of deals with those countries. The first deal and the best deal so far with the US, we’ve got the best deal with the EU for any country outside the EU, and we’ve got the best trade agreement with India. The chancellor also said the UK was “not looking to have trade negotiations with China”. In early April, foreign secretaryDavid Lammysaid Labour was continuing discussions with the Gulf over a trade deal, which were started by the previous Conservative government. Reeves’ comments come after a new trade deal with Brussels was struck on Monday.The Prime Minister hailed his deal, set out at a summit in London, as a “win-win” for both parties, which would be the start of a “new era” in the UK-EU relationship. The wide-ranging deal will allow more British travellers to use passport e-gates when going on holiday to Europe, while farmers will get swifter, easier access to trade on the continent as a result of an agreement on animal and plant product standards. A “youth experience scheme” allowing young Britons to study and live in Europe, and a new security and defence partnership were also agreed.But the deal has been met with criticism after the UK agreed to grant European fishing trawlers a further 12 years’ access to British waters. Sir Keir Starmerhailed a “mood change” in the relationship with the bloc, saying: “The EU and the UK wanting to work together, all of us prepared to say let yesterday be yesterday, we are looking forward to tomorrow. We are not going to litigate old arguments, we are going to go forward in the spirit of what we do together, we do better. Conservative party leaderKemi Badenochsaid, however: This deal will mean Britain becoming a rule-taker, accepting dynamic alignment, giving up fishing rights and paying new money to the EU.Nobody has lost more than the fishermen. Time for a recap, as we wrap up for the day. The pace of UK interest rate cuts has been “too rapid”at a time when pay packet increases remain strong and could fuel a resurgence in inflation, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist,Huw Pill. The chair ofThames Waterhas admitted he may have “misspoken”when he told a parliamentary committee that large bonuses to be paid to senior bosses out of an emergency £3bn loan were insisted upon by creditors. Hundreds of former post office operators will be compensatedby thePost Officeafter it accidentally leaked their names and addresses in June 2024. Keir Starmerhas heralded a “hat-trick of deals”with India, the US and the EU, telling MPs they will protect thousands of jobs and save businesses hundreds of millions of pounds.

Take care! – JK Jobs are to go atITVas budgets are set to be cut at flagship morning shows including Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning to reinvest in programming areas including high quality dramas and sporting coverage such as the World Cup.The biggest impact will be seen at Lorraine, which will be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes and cut back from being on-air 52 weeks to 30 weeks, and Loose Women which will stay the same length but be cut to 30 weeks.This Morning will remain the same length and frequency, while Good Morning Britain will be extended by 30 minutes, running from 6am to 930am.GMB, Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning are currently produced in-house by ITV Studios.Under the plans, which come into effect from January, production of GMB will be handled by a dedicated team at ITV News.ITV News is produced by ITN which also holds the contracts to produce the news for Channel 4 and Channel 5.In an email to staff, Laura Wilshaw, editor of ITV News, said that GMB would need to be produced on a “reduced overall budget”, adding that the intention is to continue to “faithfully recreate the Good Morning Britain programme viewers love as much as we can”.More than a dozen jobs are expected to go because certain back office roles are duplicated at GMB and ITN-produced ITV News.ITV Studios will continue to produce Lorraine, Loose Women and This Morning but is consulting on a plan to reduce the three separate teams to one.ITV would not say how many roles are are at risk by reducing the production teams for the shows.A spokesperson for ITV said that the move was not related to the performance of any of its shows, but about centralising its national newsgathering production in one place and investing in shows like Mr Bates vs The Post Office and events like the football World Cup. Kevin Lygo,managing director of ITV’s media and entertainment division, said: I recognise that our plans will have an impact on staff off screen in our Daytime production teams, and we will work with ITV Studios and ITN as they manage these changes to produce the shows differently from next year, and support them through this transition. Daytime has been a core element of ITV’s schedule for over 40 years and these changes will set ITV up to continue to bring viewers award winning news, views and discussion as we enter our eighth decade. ElonMusksaid that he was committed to being Tesla’s chief executive in five years’ time, speaking at an economic forum in Qatar via video link. Tesla has already “turned around”, Musk said, adding that the weakest market is in Europe while demand is strong everywhere else. The billionaire said that his internet service Starlink might go public at some point in the future, adding there was no rush. The boss of HSBC’s UK arm has said the bank is “being attacked all the time” by cyber criminals, with cyber security now the “biggest expense in business costing lenders hundreds of millions of pounds. Ian Stuarttried to reassure MPs that cyber security was “very much at the top of our agenda,” amid growing concerns that other critical business could end up falling victim to the kind of attacks that caused disruption atMarks & SpencerandtheCo-op. M&S has been struggling for almost a month since its IT systems were targetted over the Easter weekend, with the attack having hit itsonline operationsand left some store shelves empty. Stuart told the Treasury Committee today: It does worry me … we are being attacked all the time, so the defence mechanisms that you put in are absolutely critical. That involves “investing hundreds of millions of pounds…this is our biggest expense in business.” He added: The amount of money banks, all of us, will be spending on our systems is enormous today – and it has to be. It has to be because our customers rely on digital technology all the time. The need to keep a bank’s systems operating seamlessly - 24 hours a day, seven days a week – has increased since bosses started accelerating the pace of branch closures and pushing more customers into digital apps and online banking. Stuart said that, at a group level, HSBC alone was processing 1,000 payments a second. Meanwhile, the bank was making around 8,000 changes to its IT systems every week. The HSBC UK boss said no bank would be able to guarantee that its services could stay online 100% of the time. “So the skill is, how quickly can you recover?” Wall Street has opened slightly lower. The Nasdaq fell by 0.4% at the opening bell while the Dow Jones was flat and the S&P 500 slipped by 0.3%. Germany’sBioNTech, which developed the world’s first approved Covid-19 vaccine with backing from US firmPfizerin the first year of the pandemic, is to invest £1bn in the UK over the next decade, creating two new research centres and a London headquarters. The investment is supported by a government grant of up to £129m, one of the largest grants ever awarded to a pharmaceutical firm,the company said. BioNTech added that it would accelerate clinical trials of personalised mRNA immunotherapies, with a focus on cancer medications. BioNTech, led by chief executive ProfUğur Şahin, intends to create two new research & development centres, the first of which will be based in Cambridge. It will be home to more than 90 scientists, including the company’s existing researchers working in the UK. The Cambridge labs will focus on genomics, oncology, structural biology, and regenerative medicine. The firm will establish its UK headquarters in London, which will bring together its existing London-based teams and create new jobs in global and regional supporting roles iover the next 10 years. BioNTech’s London office will also host its artificial intelligence hub led by its subsidiary InstaDeep. The drug developer hopes to bring several cancer treatments to the market by 2030. So far, several hundred patients have received potential mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies in the UK by taking part in BioNTech’s global clinical trials. BioNTech shot to prominence in late 2020 with its Covid jab, developed by a“dream team” scientist couple, Şahin andÖzlem Türeci, the company’s chief medical officer. Richard Torbett, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: This investment is a testament to the fantastic skills, research capabilities, and scientific infrastructure we have in the UK. It is also a template for how the UK could unlock further life science sector growth by removing the barriers and roadblocks to investment.Big investments like this are years in the making and require both sides to have confidence that the other will deliver on their commitments. Trust is slow to build, but this deal shows it is worth the time and the risk.Life science companies are already the largest investors in UK R&D – but much of this comes from a handful of companies with deep UK roots. The UK has an opportunity to capture more of the global science pie if we can improve our competitive offering to the sector. One ofBT’s biggest unions has rejected a “derisory” pay offer that it says would result in almost 30% of its members receiving no rise at all.Prospect, one of the largest unions representing BT workers, said that 96% of those who voted rejected the offer.The union, which said the turnout for the vote represented 68% of its BT members, said the telecoms giant’s pay offer worked out at just a 1.28% rise six out of ten managers.Under the offer 28% of BT managers would not receive any pay rise, while the current rate of inflation stands at 2.6%. Rachel Curley, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said: This overwhelming rejection of what is a derisory and insulting pay offer shows the strength of feeling among our members. We have notified the employer of our rejection. It is now time for BT to negotiate a fair award for Prospect members and show more respect for their managers. Prospect has previously accused BT of targeting older, long-serving staff in its drive to cut jobs. Rachel Reeveshas backtracked on plans to reduce the tax-free ISA savings allowance, as she bowed to growing pressure from the City. The chancellor has confirmed that she will not change the £20,000 annual limit on popular cash ISAs, a move that will benefit millions of savers. The boss ofShellhas once again played down media reports that the oil major is considering a takeover of its beleaguered rival BP. Wael Sawanfaced shareholders on Tuesday at the company’s annual general meeting where a shareholder questioned the chief executive on the prospects of a Shell-BP takeover. He said the bar for acquisitions was very high, which was especially true given that Shell’s current share price made it very attractive for the company to continue with its buyback programme. Sawan was spared from facing trickier questions from protesters who were forced to gather outside the company’s central HQ after Shell decided to hold its AGM in a Heathrow hotel protected by a court injunction against environmental protesters. Activists from Amnesty International UK, Fossil Free London, and the Justice 4 Nigeria poured fake oil onto a giant map of the Niger Delta, representing the impact of Shell’s activities in the area, while wearing T-shirts reading “Decades of Oil Spills”, “Polluted Waters”, and “Devastated Communities”. The UK’s biggest pig meat producer,Cranswick, is to instigate a “fully independent, expert veterinarian review” of its welfare policies and livestock operations across the UK after secretly filmed footage revealed abuse of animals at one of its farms.Tesco,Sainsbury’s,AsdaandMorrisonssuspended supplies from Cranswick’s Northmoor farm in Lincolnshire after campaigners released footage of workers grabbing piglets by their hind legs and smashing them on to the hard floor – a banned method of killing known as blunt force trauma or “piglet thumping”.The campaigners had also recorded evidence of a sow being kicked and beaten with metal bars, as well as a botched killing that left an animal writhing in agony.Cranswick suspended operations at the farm immediately but said today that it was now carrying out a wider review of its operations which include 400 pig farms as well as poultry facilities. It said: We have always placed the highest importance on animal health and wellbeing and continuously aim to have the most stringent standards in the sector. We take seriously any instance, anywhere in our supply chain, where behaviour fails to meet those standards. The company said it had yet to appoint the reviewers but they would be fully independent. The statement was released alongside full year financial results for Cranswick which revealed the group increased sales by almost 5% to £2.7bn while pre-tax profits rose almost 15% to £181.6m. The number of construction projects started in the UK rose by a third in the past three months, despite a lack of major schemes. Project starts increased by 33% in the three months to April compared with the previous quarter, according to construction data firm Glenigan. The number of projects receiving detailed planing consent rose sharply again, by 52% year on year and 51% higher than in the previous three months, because of the approval of the Lower Thames Crossing. Glenigan’s economic director,Allan Wilen, said: The results are superficially impressive, but a closer look reveals a sector still struggling to reestablish its foothold. It’s hardly surprising. UK construction is continuing to adjust to mercurial market conditions, sometimes having to respond in the moment to the constantly shifting international and domestic economic landscape. Particularly, higher operational costs, likely to keep rising in the near future, mean clients are delaying investment decisions. Likewise, contractors are lukewarm to putting shovels in the ground right now when funding is not forthcoming. There’s no denying US tariff policy has definitely exacerbated the uncertainty. However, steps to de-escalate trade tensions may go some way to improving the current situation, with steps like the US-UK tariff deal going some way to improving confidence over the coming months. Furthermore, the government clearly setting out its strategic store will also help to boost momentum as more promised public works are greenlit. Fewer companies went out of business in England and Wales last month than a year earlier, according to official figures. The Insolvency Service said 2,053 companies were declared insolvent in April, 5% lower than in April last year, but 3% higher than in March 2025. Company insolvencies over the past 12 months have been slightly lower than in 2023, when the annual number hit a 30-year high, but have remained high compared to historical levels. In April, there were 379 compulsory liquidations – the highest monthly number since September 2014 – 1,544 creditors’ voluntary liquidations (CVLs), 105 administrations, 24 company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and one receivership appointment. The number of CVLs was similar to both March and the 2024 monthly average. Administrations were lower than in March, while CVAs were higher. One in 190 companies on the Companies House register entered insolvency between 1 May 2024 and 30 April 2025, a rate of 52.5 per 10,000 companies. This was down from the 57.0 per 10,000 companies that entered insolvency in the 12 months ending 30 April 2024. While the insolvency rate has increased since the lows seen in 2020 and 2021, it remains much lower than the peak of 113.1 per 10,000 companies seen during the 2008-09 financial crisis and recession. This is because the number of companies on the effective register has more than doubled over this period. Jo Hewitt, a senior managing director in the corporate finance & restructuring segment at FTI Consulting, said: The number of compulsory liquidations was 24% higher than March 2025, and remained significantly higher than the 2024 monthly average, suggesting that the climate remains challenging for businesses. Whilst corporate insolvency rates showed a slight increase of 3% compared to March 2025, it is too early to tell if businesses in England and Wales will be resilient to the recent market volatility and tariff uncertainty as the full impact on companies and their supply chains will take a while to play out. Although this month’s interest rate cut may provide a welcome reprieve for over leveraged borrowers, we anticipate that external headwinds, such the rise in employer’s National Insurance Contributions and falling oil prices, together with the continued geopolitical uncertainty will drive financial distress in certain sectors over the coming months. European stock markets are pushing cautiously higher, following modest gains in Asia. The UK’s FTSE 100 index has advanced 45 points to 8,745, a 0.5% gain, while Germany’s Dax is 0.25% ahead, France’s CAC edged up 0.1% and Italy’s FTSE MiB added nearly 0.5%. Oil prices have fallen slightly, with Brent crude down by 0.26% to $65.37 a barrel. In currency markets, sterling has gained 0.1% to $1.3373 against the dollar. The dollar is generally on the backfoot amid ongoing concerns over the US economy, and has lost 0.2% against a basket of major currencies. JP Morgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned last night that investors were being too complacent as markets shook off news that the US has lost its last triple-A credit rating amid fresh concern over the federal government’s burgeoning debt pile. Credit ratings agency Moody’s dealt a blow to Washington on Friday when it stripped the US of its top-notch rating,downgradingthe world’s largest economy by one notch to AA1 and become becoming the last of the big three agencies to drop its triple-A rating for the US. The announcement unnerved markets on Monday morning, but stock markets had recovered by the end of the day. Speaking at JP Morgan’s annual investor day meeting in New York, Dimon warned against complacency. “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think [they can],” he said. Dimon said he saw an “extraordinary amount of complacency” and added that he believes the possibility of stagflation – a recession with rising prices – was far higher than investors believe. Moody’s downgrade came asDonald Trumpstruggles to pushhis “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill through Congress, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising. More on Australia’s interest rate cut, the second reduction this year – partly designed to protect indebted households from Trump’s tariffs, which have spooked consumers and businesses, and created the potential for a protracted trade war. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s governor,Michele Bullock, said inflation was coming down, and the jobs market was robust, but characterised the global backdrop as a “complete rollercoaster”. Hundreds of former post office operators will be compensated by thePost Officeafter it accidentally leaked their names and addresses last June. The Post Office has confirmed that individual payouts will be capped at £5,000, although higher claims may still be pursued. It comes almost a year after 555 victims of theHorizon IT scandalhad their personal details publishedon the Post Office’s corporate website. The Post Office said victims would receive £5,000 or £3,500 depending on whether the address published was current. In a statement, it said: We have written to all named individuals either directly, or via their solicitors. If there are any individuals whose name was impacted by last year’s breach, but who have not received information about the payment for some reason, they can contact us or ask their solicitors if they have legal representation. The law firmFreethssaid that 348 clients, out of the total 420 it represented, who had their data breached had already received payment. Freeths said it had been told most of those affected would receive a “significant interim compensation payment”.",

    "title": "Defeated Romanian ultranationalist ‘will ask court to annul election’",
    "article_text": "The defeated ultranationalist candidate in Romania’s presidential election rerun has said he will ask the country’s top court to annul the vote on the same grounds – foreign interference – that led to the original ballot being cancelled last year. George Simion, who wasdefeated in Sunday’s runoffby the liberal mayor of Bucharest,Nicuşor Dan, said on Tuesday he would ask the constitutional court to void the ballot “for the same reasons they annulled the elections” last year. The election, which Dan won by a margin of 53.6% to 46.4%, was the second time the vote had been held. The first, last November, was cancelled by the court after the first round amid allegations of campaign financing violations and a “massive” Russian interference campaign. The winner of the annulled vote, far-right firebrand Călin Georgescu, was barred from standing again and is under formal investigation on counts including misreporting campaign spending, illegal use of digital technology and promoting fascist groups. He denies any wrongdoing. “Just as Călin Georgescu was removed and the elections were annulled, we will challenge the election of Nicușor Dan for exactly the same reasons,” Simion, an EU-critical, Trump-admiring former soccer ultra,said in a statementto local media. “Why? Because there was vote buying,” said Simion, who formally conceded to Dan on Sunday night after first claiming to have won. “Because dead people voted on 18 May, and no calculation in the world can show us over 11.5 million Romanians voted.” Simion has repeatedly alleged electoral fraud without providing evidence. His belated decision to contest the election’s outcome, while unlikely to succeed, will prolong the political uncertainty in Romania, which is under a caretaker government. The ultranationalist, whose supporters carried out a parallel count at some polling stations, said votes were “correctly counted” but “international observers” had seen “foreign interference” and “social media and algorithms have been manipulated”. He claimed there was “irrefutable evidence” of meddling by France, Moldova and others in “an orchestrated effort to manipulate institutions, direct media narratives and impose a result that does not reflect the sovereign will of the Romanian people”. Simion referenced a suggestion by the founder of the Telegram messaging app,Pavel Durov, that Parishad asked it to “silence conservative voices” in Romania. France has “categorically rejected” what it called “completely unfounded allegations”. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Russian-born Durov, who also has French nationality, is beinginvestigated by Francein connection with alleged criminal activity on the app, including child abuse images and drug trafficking. Telegram has said it abides by EU law and denies the platform facilitates illegal activities. The far-right candidate said he had congratulated Dan on election night because “I love Romania, the Romanian people, and I never want to see bloodshed.” The count may have been correct, he said, “but before and during it, there was manipulation”. He acknowledged there was “little chance that my request to the court will pass”, but said he was “appealing to all Romanians of good faith to … demand the cancellation of this masquerade”. He would provide those who wished with a template, he said.",

    "title": "EU to lift economic sanctions on Syria to aid recovery of war-torn country",
    "article_text": "The EU has agreed to lift economic sanctions onSyriain an effort to help the war-torn country recover after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. After the decision by EU foreign ministers on Tuesday, the EU’s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, wrote on X: “We want to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria.” The move comes one week after Donald Trump announced that all US sanctions on Syria would be lifted, after he met the Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa,and told the former jihadist he had an “enormous opportunity”. Speaking before the decision was formally approved, Kallas told reporters there had been some “very intense discussions” about lifting sanctions. She said: “There are worries about whether the [Syrian] government is going [in] the right direction. But I think we don’t have a choice. We … either give them the possibility to stabilise the country or we don’t do that,” suggesting that failure to lift the sanctions could push Syria down a path similar to Afghanistan. After the Taliban returned to power in August 2021,Afghanistan’s economy collapsedas the country’s central bank assets remained frozen, leaving ordinary people facing huge price increases for basic goods such as flour, rice and oil. The EU decision came as the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, said Syria could be weeks away from another civil war of “epic proportions”, as he called for support to the transitional leadership. He told a US Senate hearing: “It is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they’re facing, are maybe weeks – not many months – away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.” The EU dismissed suggestions its decision was a response to US policy. Just weeks after Sharaa’s forces ousted the Assad regime, the EU in February suspended sanctions targeting Syria’s energy and transport industries and eased restrictions on four banks and an airline company in an attempt to get more money flowing through the financial system. Some member states argued those measures were not sufficient to stabilise the Syrian economy. But EU officials have been concerned about an upsurge in violence, with deadly clashes between Syrian security services and fighters loyal to the Assad regime. In March,more than 1,000 people, including 754 civilians, were killedduring two days of clashes between security forces and fighters loyal to the former regime, according to an independent monitoring group. Last month,at least 16 people diedafter an attack on a security checkpoint by unknown gunmen and an attack on a Druze-majority suburb in Damascus. Relations between the Syrian government and the Druze community, an Arab religious minority of about 500,000 people, are already tense over negotiations about a future Syrian state. The EU has called on Syria’s government to ensure a “peaceful and inclusive transition”. Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said in a written statement: “TheEuropean Unionwants to make a fresh start with Syria … but we also expect an inclusive policy within the country that includes all population groups and religious groups.”",

    "article_text": "Ukrainian president posts on social media after Putin refuses to agree to a ceasefire in phone call with Trump. This live blog is closed President Volodymyr ZelenskyyaccusedRussiaof “trying to buy time” to “continue war”. “It is obvious thatRussiais trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation,” Zelenskyy said in a post on social media on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reports. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Zelenskyy saidUkrainehad no doubt the war must end at the negotiating table, but there must be clear and realistic proposals on the table, and called for more international sanctions pressure on Russia. He said he had spoken to Finnish President Alexander Stubb and that he would speak to more allies later on Tuesday. This blog is now closing. Here are a few of the day’s developments: President Volodymyr ZelenskyyaccusedRussiaof “trying to buy time” to “continue war”, a day after USPresident Donald Trumpdiscussed the war with RussianPresident Vladimir Putinin a two-hour phone call. TheEuropean Unionhas adopted new sanctions againstRussiaover the war inUkraine, focusing on Moscow’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers, human rights violations and hybrid threats, the EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. TheUKgovernment has announced100 new sanctions on Russiaacross Russian military, energy, financial sectors and those conducting “Putin’s information war against Ukraine”. Kaja Kallascalled for theUnited Statesto take “strong action” againstRussiaif Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire inUkraine. European CommissionPresidentUrsula von der Leyensaid that even thoughEuropehas just adopted its 17th package of sanctions onRussia,an 18th package is being prepared with further “hard-hitting” measures, Reuters reports. Russianforeign ministry spokeswomanMaria Zakharovasaid on Tuesday thatUkraineneeds to decide whether or not it will cooperate in discussing a memorandum ahead of a future peace accord that Moscow has proposed, Reuters reports. Ukrainianforeign ministerAndriy Sybihahas called on theGroup of Seven advanced economiesto reduce its price cap onRussianseaborne oil to $30 per barrel. The current G7 price cap is $60 per barrel. Germanyis still counting on theUSto pile more pressure onRussiafor an immediate ceasefire in its war onUkraine, Berlin said.“We have repeatedly made it clear that we expect one thing fromRussia- an immediate ceasefire without preconditions,” German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said. Germandefence ministerBoris Pistoriushas accused PresidentVladimir Putinof not really being interested in peace inUkraine, saying the Russian leader was only “playing for time” in talks with theUnited States. Russiahas accusedNatoof carrying out what it called aggressive actions in theBaltic Seathat impeded the freedom of shipping after Estonia tried and failed to seize a tanker.

Russiahas lost 975,800 troops inUkrainesince the beginning of its full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported on 20 May. This number includes 1,030 Russian casualties over the past day. Ukraine’smilitary said it has launched another investigation into the “Anne of Kyiv” brigade, trained inFrance, after a media report alleged financial misconduct among some commanders, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Chinasaid it backs “direct dialogue” betweenRussiaandUkraine, after US President Donald Trump announced the two would “immediately” start peace talks after he spoke withVladimir Putin. Volodymyr Zelenskyyhasposted on XthankingUrsula von der Leyenand “the entireEU” for the 17th sanctions package, calling it a “step in the right direction”. Zelenskyy added: It is important to impose tough restrictions on Russia’s tanker fleet, which serves to finance killings, as well as on all the schemes Russia uses to build up its military industry. The more pressure there is on Russia, the more incentives Moscow will have to move toward genuine peace. Ursula and I also discussed preparations for the EU’s 18th sanctions package. Russian oil, energy trade infrastructure, banks, and financial schemes — these are the areas that hurt Russia the most, and therefore contribute the most to peace. I thank everyone who advocates for tougher sanctions and makes strong decisions. We also discussed in detail yesterday’s conversation with President Trump and our joint diplomatic work with partners. Europe must be on board, and we are coordinating every step as closely as possible. European CommissionPresidentUrsula von der Leyensaid that even thoughEuropehas just adopted its 17th package of sanctions onRussia,an 18th package is being prepared with further “hard-hitting” measures, Reuters reports. After a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, sheposted on X: It’s time to intensify the pressure on Russia to bring about the ceasefire. Ukraine’smilitary said it has launched another investigation into the scandal-hit “Anne of Kyiv” brigade, trained inFrance, after a media report alleged financial misconduct among some commanders, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The unit - officially Ukraine’s 155th Mechanised Brigade - was supposed to be a flagship fighting force for Ukraine’s army, announced by French President Emmanuel Macron as a symbol of tight cooperation between Kyiv and Paris. But it has been plagued by scandals, including reports of equipment shortages, low morale and soldiers abandoning the unit en masse while undergoing training in France. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s land forces confirmed on Tuesday to AFP that a fresh investigation had been launched into the unit, but declined to elaborate further. Russiahas accusedNatoof carrying out what it called aggressive actions in theBaltic Seathat impeded the freedom of shipping after Estonia tried and failed to seize a tanker. Estonia said on Thursday last week that Moscow had briefly sent a fighter jet into Nato airspace over the Baltic Sea during an attempt to stop a Russian-bound oil tanker thought to be part of a “shadow fleet” defying Western sanctions on Moscow. Reuters reports that when asked about the matter at her weekly news briefing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was closely monitoring events in the Baltic and would react to what she called illegal actions by Nato vessels if they caused risks. ThreeGerman-Russiandual citizens have gone on trial inMunichaccused of spying on behalf of theKremlinand planning attacks on critical military infrastructure and industry. The alleged spies are said to have found codewords for military goods and gathered confidential information about an oil refinery in Bavaria and a US military training area near the town of Grafenwöhr in the east of the state. The men are also said to have made plans to carry out bomb attacks on buildings and infrastructure used to supportUkraine. The suspected ringleader, identified only as Dieter S in line with German privacy rules, is accused of coordinating a plot with the specific aim of undermining Germany’s support forUkrainethrough acts of sabotage. He is on trial alongside Alexander J and Alex D, who are suspected of having supported his actions working at the behest of a foreign intelligence service. The trio were arrested in April 2024 by Bavarian police close to the town of Bayreuth.

The current G7 price cap is $60 per barrel. “The oil price cap, from our point of view, our position, (the) reasonable price cap (is) 30 dollars,” Sybiha, who was speaking in English, told reporters in Brussels, Reuters reports. Germanyis still counting on the US to pile more pressure onRussiafor an immediate ceasefire in its war onUkraine, Berlin said on Tuesday. “We have repeatedly made it clear that we expect one thing fromRussia- an immediate ceasefire without preconditions,” German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said on the sidelines of a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels. “It is sobering to see that Russia has not taken this step, and we will have to react. We also expect our US allies not to tolerate this.” He added that there was a lot of readiness both in the European Union and in the United States to consider more sanctions on Moscow, but did not give any details regarding what additional sanctions might look like, Reuters reports. Here’s a little more detail from Reuters on Zakharova’s comments. Putin, after a call with PresidentDonald Trump, has previously said Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum about a future peace accord, and that efforts to end the war in Ukraine were on the right track. Putin said discussions would include the principles of a settlement and the timing and definitions of a possible ceasefire – including its timeframe. On Tuesday, Zakharova tells reporters she hopesUkrainetakes what she calls a constructive position in relation to possible talks for the sake of its own “self-preservation”. She adds: Now, accordingly, the ball is in Kyiv’s court. On newly announced European Union sanctions, Zakharova says Russia will never bow to ultimatums from anyone, claiming it’s clearEuropewanted to rearm Ukraine to continue the war. Russianforeign ministry spokeswomanMaria ZakharovasaysUkraineneeds to decide whether or not it will cooperate in discussing a memorandum ahead of a future peace accord Moscow has proposed, Reuters reports. In her weekly briefing, Zakharova claims Ukraine’s European allies have sought, but failed, to prevent the resumption of direct dialogue with Russia. Referring to the latest EU sanctions announcement, Zakharova saysRussia“never responds to ultimatums”. TheUKandEuropehave announced major sanctions against Russia as it became clear that Monday’s call between Donald Trump andVladimir Putinhad failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow. The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accused Russia of “trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation”. The UK said its sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia’s military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin’s invasion of Ukraine”. “Putin has so far not put in place the full, unconditional ceasefire that President Trump has called for, and which President Zelenskyy endorsed over two months ago,” the Foreign Office said. Shortly afterwards the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the EU had approved sanctions targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of about 200 vessels and that more sanctions were in the pipeline.

    "title": "Gran Canaria migrant centre closed after allegations of child abuse",
    "article_text": "A court in the Canary Islands has ordered the closure of a centre for unaccompanied migrant children, citing allegations that include physical abuse, hate crimes and threats. Police entered the centre on the outskirts of Las Palmas on Monday where 43 children were being housed. A court on the island – the first in Spain to specialise in violence against children and adolescents –saidit had asked police to carry out the raid “in light of the extensive evidence and testimony” of alleged crimes taking place in the centre. At least nine employees were detained for several hours and officials said further arrests had not been ruled out. Few other details were provided as the court said it had ordered the investigation to be carried out in secret. The court said regional authorities had been notified to ensure they could “take the necessary measures to ensure the wellbeing and protection” of the children housed at the centre. In recent years there has been arise in numbersof people turning to the treacherous Canary Islands route, one of the mostdangerous crossingsinto Europe, setting off in unstable vessels that are often unfit to face the fierce currents of the Atlantic. The surge in arrivals has included thousands of unaccompanied children, and officials in the Canary Islands have repeatedly said the region is overwhelmed. In March the region, which at the time boreresponsibility for about 37%of the unaccompanied children who had arrived in Spain, told Spain’s supreme court that more than 1,000 unaccompanied children were living in overcrowded conditions and were without access to adequate resources. A recent investigation by Amnesty International highlightedseveral other issueswith the islands’ network of more than 80 centres for unaccompanied children, including a lack of staff with proper training, with “nightclub bouncers” in some cases hired to staff the centres. It said it had documented allegations of abuse including excessive punishments that had forced children into isolation or deprived them of food. Virginia Álvarez, of Amnesty,said: “These situations are unacceptable. Let’s remember that we’re talking about children who often arrive in very vulnerable situations.” She said many of the children had fled human rights violations or were survivors of violence and trauma, and all of them were now grappling with uncertainty and anxiety about their future. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion For more than a year, Spanish politics has beenbeset by wranglingover who exactly is responsible for these children, pitting the regional government in the Canary Islands against the central government. Earlier this year, the Spanish central government announced amandatory programmethat would force regions across the country to help take in these children, setting off tensions with some of the regions led by the conservative People’s party. After releasing its investigation in March, Amnesty said the blame lay with various administrations, from the Canary Islands officials who had carried out28 inspectionsof children’s centres in the span of five years, to the central government and the regions that were refusing to act in solidarity. Esteban Beltrán, the director of Amnesty International Spain,said: “Failures in the protection system in the Canary Islands are a shared responsibility. They continue to pass the buck to one another and, as a result, children remain without adequate protection.”",

    "title": "EU to review trade relations with Israel over ‘untenable’ situation in Gaza, says top diplomat – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed. You can read our latest reports here: Here is a summary of today’s developments: The UK suspended trade negotiations with Israel over its Gaza blockade,the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy,told parliament on Tuesday. He said the Israeli ambassador had been summoned. The UK’s prime minister,Keir Starmer,described the situation in Gaza as “horrific” and “utterly intolerable”. It comes after the UK, France and Canada on Monday issued their strongest condemnation yet of the way Israel is conducting its war on Gaza and repeated calls for a ceasefire. Israel said external pressure will not change its course after the UK paused free trade talks over the war in Gaza and levelled new sanctions on settlers in the occupied West Bank.“External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction,” an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday. The European Union has agreed to review its trade agreement with Israel over alleged human rights abuses in Gaza,the EU’s top diplomat,Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. The decision comes almost 15 months after Irish and Spanish leaders called on the European Commission’s chief,Ursula von der Leyen,to make such a move. The change comes after a proposal from the Netherlands last week gained widespread support amid growing alarm about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank. No humanitarian aid has been distributed yet in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, according to aspokesperson for the United Nations, Stéphane Dujarric. Separately, Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that oversees civil affairs in thePalestinian territories, claimed 93 UN aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday. As many as 14,000 babies in Gaza could die in 48 hours if aid does not reach them in time, the UN’s humanitarian chief,Tom Fletcher,warned. “I want to save as many as these 14,000 babies as we can in the next 48 hours,” he told the BBC. Fletcher said five trucks of aid went into Gaza yesterday but described this as a “drop in the ocean”. A UN spokesman later provided more detail, saying: “We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification] has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.” At least 87 Palestinians were killed and more than 290 injured by Israeli attacks in Gaza over the past 24 hours,Gaza’s health ministry said on Tuesday. At least 53,573 Palestinian people have been killed and 121,688 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the ministry said. Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, the Nuseirat refugee camp, the Jabalia refugee camp and the Bureij refugee camp were among the places targeted in deadly Israeli strikes on Tuesday, according to reports. Benjamin Netanyahu ordered part of his country’s delegation negotiating a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Doha to return to Israel,according to Israeli media reports. Separately, Qatar’s prime ministerSheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thanisaid Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza had undermined peace efforts. “This irresponsible, aggressive behaviour undermines any potential chance for peace,” the Qatari leader said. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said Washington has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting Palestinians who want to move voluntarily. Rubio was testifying before the Senate foreign relations committee on Tuesday on Tuesday, when a pro-Palestine protester disrupted the hearing. Australia joined 22 other nations in condemning Israel over its decision to allow limited aid into Gaza while announcing a military expansion to “take control” of the besieged strip.23 countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, urged Israel not to politicise humanitarian aid for the starving population. The Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli airstrike injured nine people in a drone attack on the coastal Tyre district in the south of the country.Three people are now in “critical condition”, the ministry said, adding that two children were among the injured. Footage fromGazashows thousands of people scrambling to get food outside a soup kitchen while only five aid trucks have been allowed into Gaza after an 11-week blockade. The UN says 14,000 babies will die in the next 48 hours if the aid does not reach them in time. This comes after mounting international pressure. Israel has said it will allow a further 100 trucks into Gaza, but this is only a fifth of what was arriving into Gaza before the war. As he suspended trade negotiations withIsrael, the UK foreign secretary also imposed sanctions on a further three Israeli settlers and four entities on the West Bank, including veteran settler extremist Daniella Weiss, head of the Nachala movement, who featured in Louis Theroux’s recent documentary, The Settlers. Other individuals targeted were Zohar Sabah, an Israeli who the US imposed sanctions on in November. It was from the Zohar Zabah farm, that settlers, some of them minors, set out to attack the principal of a Palestinian school in the grounds of the school. When contacted by phone, Weiss shrugged off the sanctions, which she attacked as “childish” and claimed they would not affect her personally or the broader settler movement. “My husband ordered tickets already for an around the world tour, without including Britain,” she said. “It is not mature, it is not serious. If it were a child doing it I could say that the child doesn’t understand. “Britain knows, the (British) government knows, that we were attacked, and if it were up to the Israeli government we wouldn’t have started any war. “But as we were attacked and as there are intentions to continue attacks, so we fight. And we will have the upper hand.” The landmark decision by theEUto review its trade association deal withIsraelcomes almost 15 months afterIrishandSpanishleaders called on the European Commission’s chief,Ursula von der Leyen, to make such a move. With the humanitarian crisis inGazadeepening, other countries piled on the pressure including theNetherlandswith the Dutch-led initiative to review the EU-Israel Association Agreement, a trade accord signed in 2000, discussed today by foreign affairs ministers. Ireland’s deputy prime ministerSimon Harriswelcomed the move: Since then, the situation has become immeasurably worse, with catastrophic consequences for the civilian population and a real risk of famine. Today, a clear majority of Member States agreed on the need to send a strong signal to Israel to reverse course, to halt its military operations and to lift the blockade on lifesaving aid. Britain’s arms export licences toIsraelwill remain under review, Downing Street said, after the UK announced a suspension of negotiations over a new free trade deal. Asked if the UK had considered banning further arms export licences to Israel, a No 10 spokesperson said: I think our longstanding answer to that is we always keep such arrangements under review. Asked if the UK prime minister,Keir Starmer,believes a genocide is taking place inGaza, the spokesperson said: I think we’ve been clear on that in the past, as has the prime minister that any judgments as to whether genocide has occurred is a matter for a court, rather than for governments or non-judicial bodies. TheEUhas launched a review of its relationship withIsrael,citing the “untenable” situation inGaza. For more than a year, the EU has faced calls to reassess its relationship with Israel, but only a handful of countries, such asIrelandandSpainsupported this move. That changed after a proposal fromthe Netherlandslast week gained widespread support amid growing alarm about the dire humanitarian situation inGazaand theWest Bank, as well as the Israeli government decision that only private contractors, rather than the UN and humanitarian organisations, should supply aid to the strip. Dutch foreign ministerCasper Veldkampsaid Israel’s aid blockade was a violation of its obligations under international humanitarian law and therefore the EU-Israel agreement, which includes provisions to respect human rights. TheEuropean Unionhas agreed to review its trade agreement withIsraelover alleged human rights abuses in Gaza, the EU’s top diplomat,Kaja Kallas, said on Tuesday. Kallas said a “strong majority” of EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels backed the move in a bid to pressure Israel. She told reporters: What it tells is that the countries see that the situation in Gaza is untenable, and what we want is to really help the people, and what we want is to unblock the humanitarian aid so that it will reach the people. The situation in the Palestinian territory is “catastrophic”, she said, adding: The aid that Israel has allowed in is of course welcomed, but it’s a drop in the ocean. Aid must flow immediately, without obstruction and at scale, because this is what is needed. Benjamin Netanyahuhas ordered part of his country’s delegation negotiating a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Doha to return toIsrael,according to Israeli media reports. A small group from the negotiating team will remain in Qatar, according to the reports. The Times of Israel, citing Walla news site, reports that Netanyahu believes that the Israeli team has exhausted efforts in light of the lack of progress in the talks. No humanitarian aid has been distributed yet in theGaza Strip, according to a spokesperson for theUnited Nations,Stéphane Dujarric, on Tuesday. Reuters quotes Dujarric as saying: Today, one of our teams waited several hours for the Israeli green light to access the Kerem Shalom area and collect the nutrition supplies. Unfortunately, they were not able to bring those supplies into our warehouse. It is approaching 8pm inGaza CityandTel Aviv. Here is a summary of today’s developments: The UK has suspended trade negotiations with Israel over its Gaza blockade, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, told parliament on Tuesday.He said the Israeli ambassador had been summoned. UK prime minister Keir Starmer described the situation in Gaza as “horrific” and “utterly intolerable”. It comes after the UK, France and Canada, yesterday issued their strongest condemnation yet of the wayIsraelis conducting its war on Gaza and repeated calls for a ceasefire.

Fletcher said five trucks of aid went into Gaza yesterday but described this as a “drop in the ocean”. EU foreign ministers will discuss plans to review the bloc’s relationship with Israel, amid growing alarm about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Gaza’s health ministry said 87 people were killed by Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours and 290 were injured.“There are still a number of victims under the rubble and on the roads, the ambulance and civil defense teams cannot reach them,” it added in itspost on Telegram. Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, the Nuseirat refugee camp, the Jabalia refugee camp and the Bureij refugee camp were among the places targeted in deadly Israeli strikes, according to reports on Tuesday. Qatar’s prime minister said Israel’s continuing assault on Gaza had undermined peace efforts.Speaking at Qatar’s economic forum, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said: “This irresponsible, aggressive behaviour undermines any potential chance for peace.” The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said that the “siege on Gaza” could be stopped “if there is a political will”.Philippe Lazzarini, Unrwa’s commissioner general, said: “I think we are out of words to try to describe the hell and the horror people are going through.” Lazzarini said US president Donald Trump had the unique power to force Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “change the situation” in Gaza. Australia has joined 22 other nations in condemningIsraelover its decision to allow limited aid into Gaza while announcing a military expansion to “take control” of the besieged strip.In a statement on Tuesday morning Australian time, 23 countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, urgedIsraelnot to politicise humanitarian aid for the starving population. Sweden’s top diplomat said on Tuesday that the Nordic country would work within the EU to push for sanctions against certain Israeli ministers over Israel’s treatment of civilian Palestinians in Gaza.Sweden’s foreign minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said the sanctions should target “[Israeli] ministers who are pushing an illegal settlement policy and actively opposing a future two-state solution”. But she insisted that Sweden was a “friend of Israel”. US secretary of state Marco Rubio said on Tuesday that the US has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said that Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting Palestinians who want to move voluntarily. Rubio, was testifying before the Senate foreign relations committee, when on Tuesday, a pro-Palestine protester disrupted the hearing. Israeli authorities said on Tuesday that they had arrested two citizens suspected of carrying out “intelligence-gathering missions” at Iran’s behest near the defence minister’s home. The arrests are the latest in a spate of cases in whichIsraelhas charged its own citizens with spying for the country’s arch-foe since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that nuclear talks with the United States were unlikely to yield any results. “We don’t think it will lead to any outcome. We don’t know what will happen,” said Khamenei during a speech, adding that denying Iran’s right to enrich uranium was “a big mistake”. The Lebanese health ministry said earlier today that an Israeli airstrike injured nine people in a drone attack on the coastal Tyre district in the south of the country.Three people are now in “critical condition”, the ministry said, adding that two children were among the injured. Syria’s foreign minister said on Tuesday that the lifting of sanctions on his country shows an “international will” to support his country, after EU countries agreed to end most of its sanctions. Asaad al-Shaibani said “the Syrian people today have a very important and historic opportunity to rebuild their country”.",

    "title": "UK suspends trade talks with Israel and attacks ‘repellent’ extremism",
    "article_text": "UK-Israeli relations have plunged to their worst state for decades after the British foreign secretary,David Lammy, suspended negotiations over a new free trade deal, saying Israel’s cabinet ministers’ calls to “purify Gaza” by expelling Palestinians were repellent, monstrous and extremist. He also said wider talks about a future bilateral strategic roadmap withIsraelwere being reviewed. Lammy condemned Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access to starving Palestinians and said Israel’s treatment of Palestinians was “an affront to the values of the British people” and “incompatible with the principles that underpin the UK-Israeli bilateral relationship”. At the same time, EU foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, decided to review the bloc’s trade agreement with Israel after a request from the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp. Seventeen of the 27 states backed the move. The EU is Israel’s biggest trading partner, accounting for 32% of Israel’s total trade in goods in 2024. Lammy, unleashing language he has not used since the latestGazaconflict began, said the further planned major military incursion into Gaza by the Israel Defense Forces was “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counterproductive”. As the foreign secretary made his opening remarks in the Commons, backbenchers shouted “genocide”. Sounding genuinely outraged with the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Lammy said: “We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. Netanyahu’s government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.” Israel’s foreign ministry accused the UK of having an anti-Israel obsession. Responding to the suspension of trade talks, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said: “If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy – that is its own prerogative.” He said the sanctions in relation to the West Bank were “unjustified and regrettable”. And he added: “The British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago. “External pressure will not divert Israel from its path in defending its existence and security against enemies who seek its destruction.” Lammy told MPs: “Yesterday, minister [Bezalel] Smotrich even spoke of Israeli forces ‘cleansing’ Gaza, ‘destroying what’s left’, of resident Palestinians ‘being relocated to third countries’. We must call this what it is. It is extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous.” He added that the Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, was being summoned to hear British demands that the latest assault on Gaza be halted. Lammy said Israel had suffered a “heinous attack” on 7 October 2023 and that the UK government backed Israel’s right to defend itself. But the military escalation in Gaza was “morally unjustifiable, it’s wholly disproportionate, it’s utterly, utterly counterproductive – whatever Israeli ministers claim, this is not the way to bring the hostages safely home”. Israel has held back aid, saying it was being stolen by Hamas and claimed the renewed assault was necessary to wipe out the terrorists and release the remaining hostages. But Lammy said Israel would not secure the release of the hostages by creating a humanitarian catastrophe. He said: “Civilians in Gaza facing starvation, homelessness, trauma, desperate for this war to end, now confront renewed bombardment, new displacement and new suffering. And the remaining hostages kept apart from their loved ones by Hamas for almost 600 days are now at heightened risk from the war around them. “They are going to take control of the strip and will allow just enough to prevent hunger. Fewer than 10 trucks entered Gaza yesterday. The UN and WHO have issued stark warnings of the threat of starvation hanging over the heads of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. This is abominable.” He warned that the Israeli government was damaging the country’s global reputation. “They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world. Undermining the interests of the Israeli people. And damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world. I find this deeply painful, as a lifelong friend of Israel and a believer in the values expressed in its declaration of independence.” But many Labour backbenchers in the Commons found a gulf between Lammy’s rhetoric and the government’s actions limited to a symbolic suspending of talks on a free trade deal. Backbenchers including many Tories called for a tightening of controls of UK arms exports to Israel, recognition of the state of Palestine at a UN conference next month and a full ban on Israeli trade. Lammy said further concrete action would be considered but in conjunction with allies. The Conservative former minister Kit Malthouse said Lammy’s “anger and the outrage” was “appreciated by us all”, but added: “He knows as well as I do that the Israelis couldn’t give a damn what he says in this chamber.” He added: “Does the frontbench need us to beg for the lives of those Palestinian children before they’ll trigger this concrete action, whatever it might be?” Lammy said it was “wrong” of Malthouse to claim that “Israelis couldn’t give a fig what [was] said from this frontbench”, adding that the government announced further sanctions “because of the position of this Netanyahu government and the language that we see from these ministers”. He also imposed sanctions on a further three Israeli settlers and four entities on the West Bank, including the veteran settler extremist Daniella Weiss, the head of the Nachala movement, who featured in Louis Theroux’s recent documentary,The Settlers. Other individuals targeted were Zohar Sabah, an Israeli who the US imposed sanctions on in November. It was from the Zohar Zabah farm that settlers, some of them minors, set out to attack the principal of a Palestinian school in the grounds of the school. When contacted by phone, Weiss shrugged off the sanctions, which she attacked as “childish” and claimed they would not affect her personally or the broader settler movement. “My husband ordered tickets already for an around the world tour, without including Britain,” she said. “It is not mature, it is not serious. If it were a child doing it I could say that the child doesn’t understand. “Britain knows, the [British] government knows, that we were attacked, and if it were up to the Israeli government we wouldn’t have started any war. “But as we were attacked and as there are intentions to continue attacks, so we fight. And we will have the upper hand.” However, Lammy again held back from imposing sanctions on two Israeli cabinet ministers, the finance minister, Smotrich, and the interior minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, although he said some of their language would be kept under review. Smotrich said this week: “Just as we levelled Rafah, we will level all of Gaza.” Lammy said there was a UN plan ready to deliver aid at scale with more than 9,000 trucks at the border. He called on Netanyahu to immediately end the blockade and allow aid in. Sanctions were also imposed on Libi Construction and Infrastructure Ltd, Harel Libi and Coco’s Farm Outpost, and Neria’s Farm Outpost, including “persons residing in the outpost, for involvement in human rights abuses”. Earlier Keir Starmer said Britain “cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve” and that levels of suffering there were “utterly intolerable”. “The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is totally and utterly inadequate,” he told MPs. “So we must coordinate our response, because this war has gone on for far too long. We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve.”",

    "title": "Palestinian paracyclist who lost leg in 2014 airstrike killed in Gaza",
    "article_text": "A Palestinian cyclist who lost his leg in an Israeli airstrike more than a decade ago was killed by another missile attack this week, after spending his life trying to defy his disability. Ahmed al-Dali, 33, was a member ofthe Gaza Sunbirds, a paracycling team formed in 2020. He was also a keen para-footballer. “Ahmed’s death is really saddening. We don’t want him to be just another number. His whole life, trying to compete, trying to get into sports, was because he didn’t want to be another number, another one who lost his leg. Now we have to continue in his honour,” said Karim Ali, co-founder of theGazaSunbirds. Ali said Dali had suffered more than most since the Israeli airstrike in 2014 in which he lost a leg. He was declared dead after the strike and placed in a morgue before anyone realised he was still alive. He had to juggle his love for sport with the reality of providing a living for his wife and four children. He did not receive disability benefit from the government but earned a meagre living as a bike mechanic before the war. During the Israeli assault on Gaza afterthe attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023he was displaced from his home and had to rely on the help of others. He was killed on Monday in an attack on the city of Khan Younis, which Israel has ordered Palestinians to leave amid an intensified offensive over recent days that killed 85 Palestinians on Tuesday. Palestinian media reported up to 30 airstrikes in Khan Younis on the morning Dali was killed. Israel has vowed to press on with its offensive and take complete control of Gaza, despite criticism this week from allies, with the UK saying it would suspend trade negotiations with Israel. Ali said Dali’s troubles before his death were typical of many in the Gaza Sunbirds community. “Their lives for almost two years now have been an unimaginable hell. The majority of the team cannot find food, they are sick with skin diseases, with rashes, there’s no medicine for them or their family. Their prosthetics are damaged and cannot be serviced.” He added: “Ahmed loved cycling, he always loved cycling, he always had the best intentions but life put pressure on him as a person.” Flavia Cappellini, an Italian film-maker who spent time with Dali while making a documentary about the cycling team, described him as “somehow shy and exuberant at the same time”. She said Dali was committed to his family but sometimes struggled with the challenges he faced as a disabled man in Gaza trying to find employment. “How do you work in a place that doesn’t provide chances to people with disabilities? That tormented hm, especially in regards to his sports endeavours. That reality hit him so hard,” she said. “He would cycle with his jeans on as he didn’t have any other clothes but that didn’t prevent him from experiencing freedom while on a bike. “You could feel he was doing his best to come back from his injury trauma when he lost his leg in 2014. He wanted to succeed in sport as in life, but all the odds were against him.” Over the past 16 months, the Sunbirds have distributed $450,000 (£336,000) worth of aid across the Gaza Strip.",

    "title": "UK suspends trade talks with Israel as Lammy calls Gaza blockade ‘morally wrong’ and ‘unjustifiable’ – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Foreign secretary tells parliament that the Israeli government’s ‘egregious actions and rhetoric’ are isolating the country from its friends and partners. This live blog is closed The foreign secretary has told parliament the UK has suspended trade negotiations with Israel over its Gaza blockade. David Lammy said the Israeli ambassador had been summoned. The UK has suspended trade deal negotiations with Israelin protest at Benjamin Netanyahu’s government’s blockade of humanitarian aid entering Gaza David Lammy, the foreign secretary, described the blockade as “morally wrong”, “unjustifiable” and an “affront to the values of the British people” Earlier the prime minister,Keir Starmer, said “we’re horrified by the escalation from Israel” in the region and reiterated calls for a ceasefire, hostage release, and the delivery of humanitarian aid Lammy said the Conservative frontbench was “refusing to confront the appalling reality of what is happening in Gaza and what the Netanyahu government is doing”. Starmervisited a branch of Lidl with chancellorRachel Reevesin the afternoon to promote what they say are the merits of the country’s new trade partnership with the EU In the Commons,Starmerheralded a “hat-trick of deals” with India, the US and the EU, telling MPs they will protect thousands of jobs and save businesses hundreds of millions of pounds Opposition leaderKemi Badenochdescribed it as a “bad deal” and an “own goal” claimed that “when Labour negotiates, Britain loses” UK-Israeli relations have plunged to their worst state for decades after the British foreign secretary,David Lammy, suspended negotiations over a new free trade deal saying Israel’s cabinet ministers’ calls to “purify Gaza” by expelling Palestinians were repellant, monstrous and extremist, writesPatrick WintourandEmma Graham-Harrison. He also said wider talks about a future bilateral strategic roadmap withIsraelwere also being reviewed. Lammy condemned Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of aid trucks access to starving Palestinians and said Israel’s treatment of Palestinians was “an affront to the values of the British people” and “incompatible with the principles that underpin the UK-Israeli bilateral relationship”. Unleashing language he has not used since the latestGazaconflict began, Lammy said the further planned major military incursion into Gaza by the Israeli Defense Forces was “morally unjustifiable, wholly disproportionate and utterly counter-productive”. Sounding genuinely outraged with the government of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Lammy said: “We are now entering a dark new phase in this conflict. Netanyahu’s government is planning to drive Gazans from their homes into a corner of the Strip to the south and permit them a fraction of the aid that they need.” Israel’s foreign ministry accused the UK of having an anti-Israel obsession. Responding to the suspension of trade talks, Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein said: “If, due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations, the British government is willing to harm the British economy – that is its own prerogative.” The leader of the largest union for civil servants has warned the government to invest in public services or pay the price at the ballot box. Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) general secretary Fran Heathcote told delegates at its annual conference in Brighton that ministers must stop attacks on the Civil Service. She said: “Although the Prime Minister has scrapped Tory plans to slash 66,000 Civil Service jobs, there are still too many threats to jobs in many areas of government – and we will be fighting to defend jobs, and indeed to expand the Civil Service where we can make that case. “We have to take on this false divide that has been brought up again recently – between the back office and the front line. “Whether it’s in the NHS, the police, the courts or the core Civil Service – the front line cannot do its job without the back office. “If you cut the back office, you damage the front line.” The Road Haulage Association has welcomed today’s announcement of a new Common Sanitary and Phytosanitary Area, which promises to ease food import and export processes between the UK and EU by reducing costs and delays for cross-border goods movements. RHA managing director, Richard Smith, said: “The initial news coming out of the summit will be welcomed by businesses, specifically those operating in Northern Ireland, as if implemented, these changes will potentially reduce friction and enable smoother trade between GB and NI and within the UK internal market. While more technical details are still emerging, these initial changes are welcome.” However, the RHA said it is concerned over other Windsor Framework specific regulations, citing ongoing lack of clarity and real-time communication in a range of areas. “We again urge ministers to recognise the significant ongoing impact on the Northern Ireland supply chain” added Smith. Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that Israel will “take control” of all of Gaza, as three key allies attacked his “egregious” escalation of the military campaign and blockade on humanitarian aid, writesEmma Graham-HarrisonandQuique Kierszenbaumin Jerusalem. Britain, France andCanadaattacked Israel’s expansion of its war as disproportionate, described conditions in Gaza as “intolerable” and threatened a “concrete” response if Israel’s campaign continues. Earlier that day, Israel’s military declared an entire city a combat zone, airstrikes killed more than 60 people, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said Israel’s army would “wipe out” what remains of Palestinian Gaza. “We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the three allied governments said in a statement on Monday. Conservative MP Mark Pritchard said he welcomes the new sanctions against Israel, adding he hopes the government will “keep those under review and take further measures if necessary”. He said: “Is it not now increasingly clear that the Israeli prime minister has misled the US president over allowing aid back into Gaza? Ten trucks is a perverse and pathetic token.” Here isDavid Lammyin parliament earlier challenging his shadow foreign secretaryPriti Patelafter he said the Conservative frontbench was “refusing to confront the appalling reality of what is happening in Gaza and what the Netanyahu government is doing.” The UK’s foreign secretary, announcing in parliament that the UK was to suspend talks with Israel on a new trade deal, summon the Israeli ambassador, and impose more sanctions on the occupied West Bank settler movement, said Benjamin Netanyahu’s blockade of aid reaching people in Gaza was an “affront to the values of the British people.” Israel has blocked the entry of medical, food and fuel supplies into Gaza since the start of March, and launched a renewed military offensive. David Lammy said the offensive was not the way to bring remaining hostages home, called for Israel to end the blockade of aid and condemned what he called “extremism” in some sections of Israel’s government. “We cannot stand by in the face of this new deterioration. It is incompatible with the principles that underpin our bilateral relationship,” Lammy told MPs. “Frankly, it’s an affront to the values of the British people. Therefore, today, I’m announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new free trade agreement.” Earlier the prime minister,Keir Starmer, also commented on the situation, saying: I want to put on record today that we’re horrified by the escalation from Israel. We repeat our demand for a ceasefire as the only way to free the hostages, we repeat our opposition to settlements in the West Bank, and we repeat our demand to massively scale up humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Downing Street said arms export licences to Israel would remain under review when asked if the UK could ban more arms going to the country, PA Media reports. Asked if the UK had considered banning further arms export licences to Israel, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “I think our longstanding answer to that is we always keep such arrangements under review.” The prime minister and the chancellor were not in parliament during that debate on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, as they have been out on a visit to Lidl to try to promote what they describe as the benefits of the recently announced trade deal with the EU. PA Media reports that speaking in a backroom of the shop with Lidl staff,Rachel Reevessaid: I recognise the cost-of-living pressures that people have been under the last few years. You will know that, and your families and you will know that, from your customers as well, that they haven’t all gone away and there is still more that we need to do. I want you to know that in every action that we take as a Government our priority is to improve the living standards of ordinary working people, and the trade deals that we have secured with the US, with India, and now the EU, are all with that front of mind. Keir Starmertold broadcasters “We are in Lidl because the deal that we struck yesterday will mean lower prices in our supermarkets. Shelves like this. That is really good news for customers of Lidl, for the staff of Lidl, and for all of those involved in food and agriculture. “There is a real buzz. I have just been with the staff. They are very pleased because they know for their customers, for their families, it makes a real difference.” Incidentally, just rowing back slightly, before the debate on Israel and the Occupoed Palestinian Territories, right at the end of the UK-EU trade deal session, Conservative MPMark Francoisraised a point of order, claiming that the prime ministerKeir Starmerearlier may have “misled the house”. He said Starmer was “guilty of sophistry at best, and potentially something worse,” and was reading out sections of a document about trade dispute mechanisms. The deputy speak had little truck with it, telling Francois “I thank the Hon gentleman for his point of order, which he will know was not a point of order, and not a matter for the chair, but he has put it on the record.” Prime minister Keir Starmer then said “I won’t descend into silly language like he did,” in response, and the deputy speaker brought that session to a close. Conservative MPsMark PritchardandKit Malthouseboth raised points of oder, seeking further votes or debates on the issue in the near future, “on the basis that this situation is so dire and so acute,” Malthouse said. The debate after the foreign secretary’s statement has ended.David Lammyconcluded it by saying: I’ve not been able to answer all the questions in the hour-and-a-half that I’ve been on my feet, but I hope that our friends in Israel have seen the strength of feeling across the House today. The Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives has again raised the question of the UK’s recognition of a Palestinian state as part of the government’s stated support for a two-state solution. Andrew Georgesaid to foreign secretaryDavid Lammy: Although it is long overdue, I warmly welcome the sentiment behind the government’s announcement today. [I and some other MPs] visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories last month, and what we saw there was absolutely shocking. Others have described it as apartheid. I think it’s actually worse than that. Now, the foreign secretary has said that the question of the recognition of the Palestinian State is one which was stuck in a process. But can he not, at least today, accept that, that he can recognise the right of Palestinians to statehood and democracy? Lammy suggested it would not be an effective tactic, telling George: What we’re discussing with France, as a member of the UN security council, a permanent member, is how we can actually affect things on the ground. He will recognise that others have recognised the Palestinian statehood, [but] that we would not be having this debate if it had affected things on the ground. As the country’s chief diplomat, I stand by the seriousness of actually making a decision that might bring about change on the ground, Here is a clip ofDavid Lammyearlier in parliament announcing the suspension of trade talks with Israel and calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to end Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza. Three of the indpendent MPs have spoken during this debate on the foreign secretary’s statement on “Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” Jeremy Corbynasked about the supply of arms from UK to the Israel. David Lammy said: He asked me a similar question a few weeks ago, and I gave him the answer – that we suspended ourselves. That was a sober decision I made. They’re not being given to Israel for use in Gaza at this time. Zarah Sultana, currently independent MP for Coventry South as she is suspended fromLabour, asked the foreign secretary how he could sleep at night. In a terse exchange, she said: Children are starving. Families have been wiped out. Hospitals destroyed. Yet the government in court claims that there is no evidence Israel targets civilians. The foreign secretary is personally responsible and refuses to ban all arms sales to this genocidal state. So like many across Britain, I have to ask the foreign secretary, how do you sleep at night? She had quoted some figures which she said were export licences granted to Israel. Lammy said: Well, the honourable lady has raised figures that I don’t recognise. She’s raised, once again, the issue of arms sales to Israel. I banned arm sales that could be used in Gaza. He then accused her of being “keen on clickbait.” Shockat Adam, the independent MP for Leicester South, said he wished the trade deal talks suspension applied more broadly, telling the foreign secretary: I, too, cautiously welcome the foreign secretary’s passion and his statement, albeit a little bit late for 51,000 Palestinians, but nonetheless I welcome on his statement. The foreign secretary talks about the suspensions of negotiations on new trade deals. Would a suspension not be more effective on existing trade deals? And if indeed, the foreign secretary believes the behavior of the Israeli government is abominable, can I ask why a government minister parted with the Israelis just last week, while 370 Gaza were massacred and the world was mourning for them? Does that not undermine trust in the UK’s role in this conflict? Kemi Badenochhas posted a clip of her earlier exchange withKeir Starmer. She has accompanied the video with this message: “Listen to Labour laugh when I say the public want honesty from government. That says it all.” She seems to have missed the point thatLabourMPs weren’t laughing at the idea that government should be honest, or that is what the public wants, they were laughing at the idea of being lectured on honesty by someone who had served in the previous Conservative administration. Listen to Labour laugh when I say the public want honesty from government. That says it all.They can’t negotiate. They concede before talks even begin — then pretend tiny gains are historic victories.Gave away UK territory in Chagos. Settled for scraps in US and India deals.…pic.twitter.com/65wdAjpXi9 In response to an MP saying it was Hamas, not Israel, holding up a ceasefire deal in Gaza,David Lammyhas said the UK “must speak up” about Israel’s blockade of the territory. The foreign secretary said: I don’t think I’ve been at this dispatch box on the six occasions that statements have been made on this subject, when I have not condemned Hamas, [when] I have not condemned what they did on October the seventh, [when] I have not condemned those that are keeping hostages. And let me be clear, I actually believe Hamas are holding hostage the Palestinian people. But just as you can hold that, you can also hold in your heart and in your mind that it is morally reprehensible to continue this blockade to reduce 400 humanitarian aid points to four this is impossible. It’s intolerable, and of course, the United Kingdom must speak up against it. I suspect video clips of David Lammy saying, as he did, “I have not condemned Hamas, I have not condemned what they did on 7 October, I have not condemned those that are keeping hostages,” will be widely shared without the preceeding context, and he may come to regret having phrased it this way.",

    "title": "Australia demands Israel allow aid into Gaza, stating ‘the population faces starvation’ in joint statement",
    "article_text": "Australia has joined 22 other nations in condemningIsraelover its decision to allow limited aid into Gaza while announcing a military expansion to “take control” of the besieged strip. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his troopswere “making progress” on taking control of Gazaafter Israel’s military had earlier declared a central city a combat zone and killed more than 60 people in airstrikes, while a senior minister said Israel’s army would “wipe out” what remains of Palestinian Gaza. The escalation comes as those inGazaface a looming famine following Israel’s 11-week blockade of food, fuel and aid supplies from entering the territory. In a statement on Tuesday morning Australian time, 23 countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, urged Israel not to politicise humanitarian aid for the starving population. About nine aid trucks were reportedly allowed into Gaza after the nearly three-month siege, but the UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned it was a mere “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed”. The joint statement acknowledged “indications of a limited restart of aid” but implored Israel to uphold humanitarian principles by allowing the full resumption of aid and for aid groups to be able to work independently and impartially. “Food, medicines and essential supplies are exhausted. The population faces starvation. Gaza’s people must receive the aid they desperately need,” the countries said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Netanyahu’s plan for aid distribution in Gaza was yet to be announced, but the Israel-backed and US-led Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was expected to distribute food through militarised compounds. “Advanced discussions”suggested heads of households would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg with several days’ worth of food and basic hygiene items like soap for their families. There would be no provision for those too sick or weakened by famine to walk long distances across Gaza’s ruined landscape with heavy loads. The UN hasalready raised concernsabout GHF’s capacity to deliver enough aid to the territory’s population. The 23 countries raised concerns about the GHF proposal, stating existing aid groups already had the “logistical capacity, expertise and operational coverage to deliver assistance across Gaza to those who need it most”. “The UN has raised concerns that the proposed model cannot deliver aid effectively, at the speed and scale required. It places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the UN and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,” the joint statement read. “Humanitarian aid should never be politicised and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change.” Australia joined the joint donor statement overnight but not aseparate statement signedby Canada, the UK and France warning Israel against expanding its military campaign in Gaza, threatening “further action”, including targeted sanctions. “The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable. Yesterday’s announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is wholly inadequate,” the three countries said, marking a change in tone from the UK and Canada in particular, which have broadly backed Israel’s war after the 7 October Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “Israel suffered a heinous attack on October 7. We have always supported Israel’s right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate. “We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.” Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right critic of any negotiated end to the war, defended Netanyahu’s decision to let in “basic” food aid, saying it would allow Israel to keep its military in Gaza for a campaign of destruction and displacement. “Now we conquer, cleanse and stay – until Hamas is destroyed,”he told a news conference. “Along the way, what remains of the strip is also being wiped out. “As part of the war, the IDF is moving the population out of combat zones … The population will reach the south of the strip, and from there, with God’s help, move to third countries underPresident [Donald] Trump’s plan.” An Australian government spokesperson said the “abhorrent comments” by the Netanyahu government were “unacceptable”, adding Australia had consistently opposed the military expansion by Israel in Gaza, “just as we have been clear that forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would breach international law”. “Abhorrent comments by members of the Netanyahu government and the ongoing denial of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population are unacceptable,” they said. “The statement released by Australia and 22 other countries demands the immediate and full resumption of aid to Gaza. “Australia continues to work with our partners to press for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and the protection of civilians.” The total toll from the war inside Gaza has reached 53,486, most of them civilians. At least 121,034 Palestinian people have been injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update.",

    "title": "Uneasy India-Pakistan ceasefire holds but is a return to war inevitable?",
    "article_text": "Against the odds, the ceasefire that followed India and Pakistan’s almost-war has held; fragile, uneasy but still unbroken. Yet in the aftermath of four days of cross-border drones and missile strikes – themost technologically advancedconflict either side has ever engaged in – the question remains: what now? While both India and Pakistanhave claimed victory, some experts fear that a return to hostilities is almost inevitable. There is a sense among analysts and diplomats that Delhi has not emerged from the conflict as triumphant as it had hoped, leaving little room for further de-escalation or political engagement. In a speech last week, India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, insistedthat the military offensive against Pakistani terror groups, named Operation Sindhoor, was still continuing and that the ceasefire was simply a pause. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s army, after going through a period of reputational decline, is once again the country’s most revered institution – proving that nothing works better for the fortunes of Pakistan’s generals than an altercation with India. “India has made it clear they are still on a state of alert,” said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for south Asia at the Chatham House thinktank. He was sceptical that India’s missile strikes into Pakistan had done much to deter any future militant attacks, which India’s defence minister said would be taken as an “act of war”. “With the hyper-nationalist rhetoric we are still seeing from both sides, it seems like there’s limited space for any lasting rapprochement,” said Bajpaee. While India is seen to have achieved some tactical victories – successfully targeting known militant bases in Pakistan, firing targeted missiles into Rawalpindi, the heart of Pakistan’s military and largely rebuffing Pakistani missiles – the strategic wins have been more elusive. Instead, India is now grappling with some more uncomfortable outcomes. As noted by Pratap Bhanu Mehta, an Indian political scientist, in hisIndian Express column, the armed conflict has “no decisive victory and no clear political end simply reinstates the India-Pakistan hyphenation” – a reference to an age-old tendency to lump the two countries together as a singular quarrelling entity on the international stage. In recent years, as India soared ahead of Pakistan and positioned itself as a global economic and geopolitical superpower, there was a feeling in the corridors of New Delhi that they had broken free of the hyphenation burden. However, recent events showed that perceptions, particularly in the US, had not changed much. Among diplomats and observers, the view was that India had been left on the back foot in the critical battle over narrative.The deep-rooted instinct of the Modi government to tightly control the flow of information (Modi has not done an in-person press conference in 10 years) meant that as Operation Sindhoor was launched, their accounts of the operation were limited to a few brief, highly choreographed press conferences led by civil servants. In Pakistan meanwhile, ministers were at the end of the phone and on TV news shows non-stop, briefing the world constantly on the Pakistani version of events, such as claims that Pakistan had downed five Indian military jets. The Modi government has still not publicly responded to the allegation, but instead put pressure on Indian news outlets to avoid any mention of the alleged downed planes. Amid vast information gaps left by the Indian government an unprecedented amount of misinformation and disinformation proliferated. False claims fuelled an insatiable appetite for war among the Indian public. As a result, on 10 May, whenDonald Trumpabruptly announced a ceasefire before India or Pakistan had a chance, it was met with a widespread reaction of betrayal and anger in India. Many could not understand why the government would agree to a ceasefire, let alone one that seemed to have been imposed by the US. The fury among the hyper-nationalist far right – Modi’s political base and where much of the disinformation originated – was particularly potent and the clamour for a return to war has still not entirely dissipated. Trump’s boastful claims of brokering the ceasefire have been a source of frustration to New Delhi. While he joins a long line of US presidents who have been drawn into disputes between the neighbours, it is historically done far more discreetly and largely on terms favourable to India. This time, India was so infuriated at Trump’s version of events, including that coercion over trade led both sides to lay down arms, that it openly repudiated several of the president’s statements. Trump’s involvement has also resulted in another strategic upset for India: the re-internationalisation of the Kashmir issue. India’s immovable position is that its dispute with Pakistan over the region, whichdates back to 1947, is a purely internal issue that should have no outside interference or third-party negotiation. But in flagrant disregard for this, Trump offered, post-ceasefire, to mediate between the two countries to find a “solution”. Pakistan leapt at the offer; in India it was met with stony silence. The Indian political strategist Brahma Chellaney accused Trump of “playing right into the hands of Pakistan which has long weaponised theKashmirissue to justify its export of terror”. Much remains up in the air between the two sides. The land border between the countries is still closed and both sides are still denying visas. Perhaps most critically, the Indus River treaty, which ensures Pakistan gets a vital supply of river water from India, remainssuspended by New Delhi. But while among the political class in Islamabad there is optimistic chatter of post-ceasefire talks in the Gulf or London – where even Kashmir could be on the table – New Delhi has avoided the subject. “The dilemma is that this war does not compel negotiations. Nor is it likely to build even a modicum of trust that can allow a political negotiation,” wrote Mehta. On a deeper, existential level, analysts say there remains little incentive on either side to de-escalate. In India, anti-Pakistan fervour has only driven up support for Modi and helped his strongman Hindu nationalist government win elections. In Pakistan, the ever-present threat of India has long been used to justify the dominating role of the military in running the country. Bajpaee is among those who has a pessimistic view of any suggestion of post-conflict political dialogue between the two countries, calling that a “dead end” as both sides are “essentially talking past each other”. “It seems very unlikely that we’re going to see any sort of credible peace process,” he said. “Frankly, at this point I would say it’s not a question of if, but when we will see a resumption of some sort of military hostilities between both countries.”",

    "title": "Watchdog calls for action on children’s care case delays in England and Wales",
    "article_text": "The proportion of children inEnglandand Wales subject to care proceedings who are having to wait more than a year to have their case resolved has increased more than 17-fold in the last seven years, a watchdog has found. The average duration of proceedings brought by local authorities to protect a child from harm (known as public law cases) was 36 weeks last year, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). In 2014 the government set a time limit of 26 weeks but it has never been met. In areport published on Wednesday, the NAO says the proportion of children waiting more than a year for a public law case to be resolved increased from 0.7% in January 2017 to 12% in December last year. The figures equate to approximately 70 and 1,200 children respectively. The watchdog is urging the government to do more to tackle delays that can mean children waiting longer for permanent care and living or contact arrangements, increasing risk of harm, anxiety, instability and disrupted friendships or education. Including private law cases, which involve parental disputes such as living or contact arrangements for their child, there were more than 4,000 children in England andWalesin family court proceedings lasting two years in December 2024. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: “Too many children are suffering as a result of delays to family court proceedings, which are currently still far too long. The longer a case remains unresolved, the more likely it is that there are further delays, increasing the risk of harm to children and driving up public costs. “Responsibilities for family justice are fragmented, with no single body responsible for overall performance. Government has neither the right data to fully understand the causes or impacts of delays, nor does it have an assessment of the capacity required to manage the system efficiently.” In December, nearly two-thirds of the 4,000 cases that had been open for 100 weeks or longer were in London and the south-east. London had an average duration of 53 weeks for cases brought by local authorities and 70 weeks for cases brought by parents. Wales performed best, averaging 24 weeks and 18 weeks respectively. Where there were longer delays, this reflected issues such as lower judicial capacity in those areas, the NAO said. There is no government time limit for private law cases, which took 41 weeks on average last year. The watchdog said the impact of delays on costs was significant, as evidence and assessments needed to be updated. Average spending on legal aid for a case brought by a local authority doubled between 2018 and 2022 from approximately £6,000 to about £12,000 – an annual increase of £314m in legal aid spending. Family courts have recovered much better thancrown courtsafter the Covid-19 pandemic, with 47,662 family court cases outstanding (37,541 of them private law cases), down by more than a quarter since August 2021. But Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Many cases still take too long to complete and further action is needed to remove the barriers to a more efficient system, including poor-quality data and fragmented decision-making.” A government spokesperson said it had inherited a justice system in crisis, adding: “We are working hard to improve their experience in the family courts further by expanding the successful pathfinder pilot, which has already reduced case times by 11 weeks, and investing £500m in early intervention. Cases are now moving faster.”",

    "title": "Review of student suicides in England dodged ‘real issues’, say bereaved parents",
    "article_text": "A review of student suicides inEnglanddodged “the real issues” with universities, the parents of a student who killed herself before a class presentation have said. The national review of higher education student suicide deaths, commissioned by the Department for Education, heard that families suffered “distressing experiences” at the hands of university administrators, and concluded that universities owed a “duty of candour” to relatives, including greater transparency and involvement. Prof Sir Louis Appleby, director of thenational confidential inquiry into suicide and safety in mental health, which conducted the review, said: “The main aim of this national review is to improve learning from these tragic incidents to help prevent future deaths. “We found an excellent response from universities to this national review and, on such a sensitive issue, this is a welcome sign for prevention. “However, the families we spoke to provided moving accounts of feeling excluded from the process of finding out what happened to their loved ones, and some had a perception the university was evasive and reluctant to answer important and painful questions.” But Robert Abrahart, the father of Natasha Abrahart, a physics student at the University of Bristol who had chronic anxiety and killed herself in 2018, said the review “doesn’t tell us anything we didn’t already know” regarding untrained staff and poor communication, and failed to tackle underlying issues of accountability. “Universities are not set up to take responsibility for students in distress,” he said. “The way higher education is run – on paper and in practice – means no one is clearly in charge when a student is struggling. That’s why decisive action is often too late or doesn’t happen at all. “This review points out the cracks but ignores the broken system underneath. We don’t need more reports that dodge the real issue. “We need change. We need a legal duty of care in higher education before more young lives are lost.” Robert Abrahart and wife Maggie are among the founders ofForThe100, a group of bereaved parents campaigning for universities to have a statutory duty of care towards students. The review of serious incident reports, including 79 suspected suicide deaths and 25 incidents of non-fatal self-harm in the 2023-24 academic year, found that mental ill-health was identified in nearly half of the cases, while more than a third mentioned academic problems or pressures. About one in four of the students were in their first year of undergraduate studies. Dr Cathryn Rodway of the University of Manchester, one of the review’s lead authors, said: “We suggest mental health awareness and suicide prevention training should be available for all staff in student-facing roles, and include recognising and responding to risk and neurodiversity.” Debbie Laycock, head of policy at Samaritans, said: “Students face a range of pressures during their time at university, and it’s vital that their mental health and wellbeing are prioritised alongside their academic studies. “Universities must take meaningful steps to create a culture of care and ensure the right support is in place. “A crucial first step is making sure staff who work directly with students are trained in suicide prevention, so they’re equipped to recognise warning signs and potentially save a life.” Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “For too long, families have been left with unanswered questions and denied the transparency they deserve. This must change. “We are committed to working with universities, experts and students to turn the findings of this review into real, lasting improvements.” In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

    "title": "Brain tumour diagnosis could be made within hours, say researchers",
    "article_text": "A new method for diagnosing brain tumours could cut the time patients wait for treatments by weeks to hours and raise the possibility of novel types of therapy, researchers have said. According to the Brain Tumour Charity, about740,000 people around the worldare diagnosed with a brain tumour each year, around half of which are non-cancerous. Once a brain tumour is found, a sample is taken during surgery and cells are immediately studied under a microscope by pathologists, who can often identify the type of tumour. However, genetic testing helps to make or confirm the diagnosis. “Almost all of the samples will go for further testing anyway. But for some of them it will be absolutely crucial, because you won’t know what you’re looking at,” said Prof Matthew Loose, a co-author of the research from the University of Nottingham. Loose noted that in the UK there could be a lag of eight weeks or longer between surgery and the full results of genetic tests, delaying the confirmation of a diagnosis and hence treatment such as chemotherapy. Writing in the journalNeuro-Oncology, Loose and colleagues report how they harnessed what is known as nanopore technology to cut this timeframe. The approach is based on devices that contain membranes featuring hundreds to thousands of tiny pores, each of which has an electric current passing through it. When DNA approaches a pore it is “unzipped” into single strands; as a strand passes through the pore it disrupts the electric current. Crucially, the different building blocks of DNA – and modifications to them – disrupt the current in characteristic ways, allowing the DNA to be “read”, or sequenced. These sequences are then compared against those relating to different types of brain tumours, using a software program built by the team. Loose said the process costs about £400 per sample – on a par with current genetic testing. The researchers first trialled the approach on 30 samples that had previously been extracted from patients, before using it on 50 samples at the time they were removed. They said 24 (80%) and 45 (90%) of these samples respectively were fully and correctly classified by the new approach after 24 hours, a success rate on a par with traditional genetic testing methods. However, 38 (76%) of the 50 samples that were prospectively collected were confidently classified within one hour, meaning the time from sample removal to surgeons having the results could be as little as two hours. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion While Loose said the main goal was to make sure the information is available when the patient is next discussed by their medical team, typically in the same week, he said the rapid results could also reveal whether more aggressive surgery is needed while the patient is already in theatre, or if surgery is likely to offer little benefit. And there are other possibilities. “If you could identify, as we think we might be able to, the specific tumour type fast enough, and drugs were available that could be administered during surgery directly to the tumour area, then you have opened up a whole new class of potential treatment options,” he said. In addition, he said, rapid diagnoses could help ensure patients are recruited into relevant clinical trials for new treatments as quickly as possible. Dr Matt Williams, a consultant oncologist at Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, who was not involved in the work, said while faster diagnoses were welcome and reduced the period of uncertainty for patients, the main question was how the new technology could be used to change care. “At the moment [intra-operative treatments] don’t really exist, although several groups are working on it ,” he said. “But if [we] want to unlock these approaches, we need to be able to make those diagnoses in the operating theatre to then be able to deploy these treatments.”",

    "title": "Trump rolls out Golden Dome missile defense project and appoints leader",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpannounced on Tuesday that his administration will move forward with developing the so-called “Golden Dome” missile defense system that he envisions will protect the United States from possible foreign strikes using ground and space-based weapons. Flanked by the US defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, in the Oval Office, Trump also said that he wanted the project to be operational before he left office. He added that Republicans had agreed to allocate $25bn in initial funding and Canada had expressed an interest in taking part. “Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space,” Trump said, “forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.” What exactly the Golden Dome will look like remains unclear. Trump has not yet decided which of three options proposed by the defense department he wants to pursue. Pentagon officials recently drafted three proposals – small, medium and large – for Trump to consider. The proposals all broadly combine ground-based missile interceptors currently used by theUS militarywith more ambitious and hi-tech systems to build a space-based defense program. The option that Trump chooses will determine its timeline and cost. The $25bn coming from Republicans’ budget bill is only set to cover initial development costs. The final price tag could exceed $540bn over the next two decades, according to the congressional budget office. Trump said on Tuesday evening that he had settled on “architecture” for the project and suggested the total cost of putting it into service would reach $175bn, but gave no specifics. Gen Michael Guetlein of the USSpaceForce will oversee implementation of the project, Trump said. The selection of Guetlein, the vice-chief of space operations, means the elevation of a four-star general widely seen at the Pentagon to be competent and deeply experienced in missile defense systems and procurement. The project is expected to end up largely as a partnership with major defense contractors, including Elon Musk’sSpaceX, given it has the capacity to manufacture rockets to launch military payloads into orbit and satellites that can deliver next-generation surveillance and targeting tools. It will also rely on companies that manufacture ordnance currently used by theUS military. The project’s baseline capabilities are set to depend on existing systems including the Thaad and Aegis Ashore systems made by Lockheed Martin and Patriot surface-to-air missiles made by Raytheon. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Golden Dome came into existence because Trump believes that the US should have a missile defense program to track and kill missiles headed towards domestic US targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other strategic foreign adversaries, similar to Israel’s “Iron Dome” program. Shortly after he took office again in January, Trumpsigned an executive orderdirecting the Pentagon to develop proposals for a “next-generation missile defense shield” in order to upgrade the US’s missile defense capabilities, which he noted had not materially changed in 40 years. The order came as the defense department has become more concerned about the threat of long-range strikes from strategic adversaries. Last week, the Defense Intelligence Agency released an assessment that said China has about 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Russia has 350 and North Korea has a handful. Initially, the White House had named the options for a space-based missile defense system “Moonshot Plus” and “Moonshot Plus Plus”. They were later renamed by Hegseth to be called silver, gold and platinum-dome options based on the three tiers, two former Pentagon officials said.",

    "title": "FDA says it will limit access to Covid-19 boosters for Americans under 65",
    "article_text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Tuesday that it will limit access to seasonal Covid-19 boosters for healthy Americans under 65 without clear evidence of clinical benefit – a shift, critics say, that will make access difficult for people who are not high risk but want to be vaccinated against the disease. Top officials at the FDA outlined a new framework for approving Covid-19 vaccines, saying that the US would make the boosters available for Americans over the age of 65 and for adults and children above the age of 6 months with at least one condition that increases their risk of severe Covid-19. The newly installed FDA commissioner Marty Makary andVinay Prasad, the controversial director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, laid out the new guidelines in a commentary piece published in theNew England Journal of Medicine. They wrote that manufacturers would have to conduct randomized, controlled clinical trials before updated vaccines would receive approval for healthier people. Elsewhere in the piece, the officials argued that the US is an outlier among countries in Europe and other high-income countries where Covid-19 boosters are recommended only for older adults and people at high risk. They estimate that more than 100 million Americans will still qualify for the annual shots under the new terms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists manyconditionsthat make a person higher risk for getting very sick from Covid, including obesity, diabetes, asthma or chronic lung disease as well as a compromised immune system, pregnancy and disability. Makary, appointed by Donald Trump, and Prasad are both vocal critics of pandemic-era policies and of the government’s response to Covid-19. The agency is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is now run byRobert F Kennedy Jr, a long-time vaccine skeptic who has been slashing the department as part of the White House’s effort to downsize the federal government. “Although the rapid development of multiple Covid-19 vaccines in 2020 represents a major scientific, medical, and regulatory accomplishment, the benefit of repeat dosing – particularly among low-risk persons who may have previously received multiple doses of Covid-19 vaccines, had multiple Covid-19 infections, or both – is uncertain,” Makary and Prasad wrote. “The American people, along with many health care providers, remain unconvinced.” The American universal access policy, they contend, was based on the assumption that “the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations” – a view they say the agency now explicitly rejects. Since becoming the country’s top health official in February, Kennedy has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government’s handling of Covid shots, including Makary and Prasad. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday’s policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts. Health experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly Covid vaccination or whether they should be recommended only for people at increased risk. Prior to this announcement, the FDA had hinted that changes were coming. Last week, the agency granted approval of Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine but with restrictions that reflect its new guidelines. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Makary and Prasad said they expect the FDA will approve the boosters for adults over the age of 65 years “on the basis of immunogenicity” – whether the vaccine produces a robust antibody response. But for lower-risk groups, the FDA will now require what the authors describe as “robust, gold-standard data” from drugmakers before approval is granted. Critics say the new guidelines will limit access for people who want the booster, including parents and their children. And some experts have raised questions about how the new framework will be applied. “Is the pharmacist going to determine if you’re in a high-risk group?” asked Dr Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphiatoldthe Associated Press. “The only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.” In June, an influential panel of advisers to the CDC is scheduled to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups. The FDA’s announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel’s job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people. Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than 47,000 Americans died from Covid-related causes last year. The virus was the underlying cause of two-thirds of those deaths and was a contributing factor for the rest. Among the dead were 231 children whose deaths were deemed Covid-related, 134 of them where the virus was the direct cause – numbers similar to yearly pediatric deaths from the flu.",

    "title": "US judge indicates deportations to South Sudan likely violated court order",
    "article_text": "A United States judge has rebuked the administration of President Donald Trump, saying that reports of deportations to South Sudan appear to violate his previous court order. On Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts, US District Court Judge Brian Murphy held a virtual hearing to weigh an emergency motion on behalf of deported migrants reportedly on board a flight to South Sudan. He asked lawyers for the Trump administration to identify where the migrants were. He also indicated that he could ask for the flight to be turned around and called for the pilots to be made aware of his court order. “Based on what I have been told, this seems like it may be contempt,” Judge Murphy told Elianis Perez, a lawyer for the Trump Justice Department. Perez responded to Murphy’s requests for the plane’s whereabouts by saying the Department of Homeland Security had deemed such information “classified”. Perez also indicated that the Trump administration did not consider itself in violation of Murphy’s previous court order. In a recent annual report, the US Department of State accused South Sudan of “significant human rights issues”, including torture and extrajudicial killings. But the Trump administration has been looking abroad for destinations to send undocumented immigrants currently detained in the US, particularly those whose home countries will not accept them. In Tuesday’s hearing, Judge Murphy said the flight to South Sudan appeared to violate a preliminary injunction he issued on April 18, which prohibited migrants from being deported to third-party countries that were not their own. That injunction required the Trump administration to give the migrants an adequate opportunity to appeal their removal. The migrants, Judge Murphy ruled, were simply seeking “an opportunity to explain why such a deportation will likely result in their persecution, torture, and/or death”. He cited the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees the right to due process: in other words, a fair hearing in the US court system. Earlier this month, on May 7, lawyers for the migrants had indicated that their clients were slated to be sent to Libya, another country with significant human rights concerns. Judge Murphy, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, ruled that such a deportation would be in violation of his injunction. In Tuesday’s emergency court filing, the lawyers for those migrants emphasised how close a call that incident was. The migrants in question were already on a bus, sitting on the tarmac of an airport, when they were ordered to be returned. The emergency motion identifies the migrants only by their initials and countries of origin, Myanmar and Vietnam among them. But it explains what allegedly happened to them over the last 24 hours and seeks immediate action from the court. The lawyers allege that one migrant from Myanmar, called NM in the court filings, received a notice of removal on Monday. It identified the destination as South Africa. Within 10 minutes, the court filing said the email was recalled by its sender. A couple of hours later, a new notice of removal was allegedly sent, this time naming South Sudan as the destination. In both instances, NM refused to sign the document. Lawyers in the emergency petition indicate that NM has “limited English proficiency” and was not provided a translator to understand the English-language document. While one of NM’s lawyers stated her intention to meet with him on Tuesday morning, by the time their appointment time came, she was informed he had already been removed from his detention facility, en route to South Sudan. The emergency filing includes a copy of an email sent to the lawyers from a family member of those deported. “I believe my husband [name redacted] and 10 other individuals that were sent to Port Isabel Detention Center in Los Fresnos, TX were deported to South Africa or Sudan,” the email begins. “This is not right! I fear my husband and his group, which consist of people from Laos, Thailand, Pakistan, Korea, and Mexico are being sent to South Africa or Sudan against their will. Please help! They cannot be allowed to do this.”",

    "title": "Venezuela frees US citizen in latest exchange with Trump administration",
    "article_text": "A United States citizen has been transferred to the US after being held for nearly six months in Venezuela. The family of US Air Force veteran Joseph St Clair confirmed his release on Tuesday, following his detention in November of last year. “This news came suddenly, and we are still processing it, but we are overwhelmed with joy and gratitude,” St Clair’s parents, Scott and Patti, said in a statement. US President Donald Trump’s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, later explained on social media that he had met with Venezuelan officials on the Caribbean island of Antigua to negotiate the release. Grenell credited St Clair’s freedom to Trump’s “America First” political platform. “Joe St. Clair is back in America,” hewrote. “I met Venezuelan officials in a neutral country today to negotiate an America First strategy. This is only possible because [Trump] puts Americans first. ” Citing anonymous sources familiar with the negotiations, the Reuters news agency reported that Grenell discussed St Clair’s case on Tuesday with Jorge Rodriguez, the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly and an ally of President Nicolas Maduro. Reuters and another news agency, Bloomberg, both reported that a deal was struck to extend a licence for the US oil company Chevron to operate in Venezuela by 60 days. The Trump administration had previously announced it was revoking the licence in February, on the basis that Venezuela had not upheld its commitment to fair elections. The licence was due to end on May 27. Any extension will likely need the approval of the US Department of State and the US Treasury. The South American country relies on oil as the pillar of its economy. But since the mid-2010s, Venezuela has experienced an economic crisis that has pushed even basic supplies like food and medicine beyond what some families can afford. That, combined with alleged political repression, has prompted an exodus of nearly 7.9 million people out of Venezuela, according to the United Nations. In 2023, Venezuela committed to electoral reforms under the Barbados Agreement, a deal that the US applauded. Then-US President Joe Biden loosened restrictions on Venezuela’s oil industry in the aftermath of the agreement. But Venezuela’s presidential election on July 28, 2024 was widely criticised for its lack of transparency. While Maduro and his allies claimed he had won a third term, the electoral authorities did not provide any proof of his victory. Instead, the opposition coalition published voting tallies it said proved that its candidate had won by a landslide. That prompted widespread protests and a deadly crackdown from law enforcement. During his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021, Trump had pursued a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Maduro’s government, even offering a $15m bounty for information that led to the Venezuelan leader’s arrest. But critics have pointed out that Trump may need Venezuela’s cooperation to carry out his goal of “mass deportation” during his second term. Since returning to office in January, Trump has signalled a willingness to negotiate with Maduro. In late January, he even sent Grenell tomeet with Maduroin person in the capital of Caracas. Part of Grenell’s directive was to ensure all detained Americans in the country were returned home. As Grenell left the country, he revealed he was returning with six Americans who had previously been imprisoned in Venezuela. In March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio estimated that nine Americans remained in Venezuela’s custody. Venezuela, for its part, has started toaccept deportation flightsfrom the US, although in the past it has refused to accept migrants removed from the US. St Clair’s family has said that the military veteran was a language specialist who was seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in South America.",

    "title": "Trump says US will put weapons in space as part of ‘Golden Dome’ plan",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –United States President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have laid out their clearest plan yet for the “Golden Dome” missile defence programme, which would include puttingweapons in spacefor the first time. Speaking from the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he had “officially selected an architecture” for the system, designed to take down “hypersonic missiles, ballistic missiles and advanced cruise missiles”. “I promised the American people that I would build a cutting-edge missile defence shield to protect our homeland from the threat of foreign missile attack,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The Golden Dome system, he added, would include “space-based sensors and interceptors”. “ Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they’re launched from space,” Trump continued. “We will have the best system ever built.” The announcement comes just less than four months after Trump signed anexecutive orderkicking off the programme’s development. General Michael Guetlein – who currently serves as the vice chief of space operations at Space Force, a branch of the US military – is slated to manage the programme. Speaking at the event, Hegseth hailed the plan as a “game changer” and a “generational investment in security of America and Americans”. The White House did not immediately release further details about the missile defence system, and the Pentagon is reportedly still working out its capabilities and requirements. The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this month that the space-based components of the Golden Dome alone could cost as much as$542bnover the next 20 years. It noted that a high number of sensors and interceptors would be needed for a space-based system to be effective, particularly as foreign militaries like North Korea’s grow more sophisticated. But on Tuesday, Trump outlined a much lower price tag and timeline. “It should be fully operational before the end of my term. So, we’ll have it done in about three years,” Trump said. He estimated the total cost to add up to about $175bn, adding that he planned to use existing defence capabilities to build the system. But the funding for the programme has so far not been secured. At Tuesday’s news conference, Trump confirmed that he was seeking $25bn for the system in atax cut billcurrently moving through Congress, although that sum could be cut amid ongoing negotiations. There is likely to be some variation in the total cost of the project. The Associated Press news agency, for example, cited an unnamed government official as saying that Trump had been given three versions of the plan, described as “medium”, “high” and “extra high”. Those tiers corresponded to how many satellites, sensors and interceptors would be put in space as part of the programme. The news agency reported that Trump chose the “high” version, which has an initial cost ranging between $30bn and $100bn. As he explained his plans for the Golden Dome on Tuesday, Trump cited several inspirations, including Israel’s “Iron Dome” missile defence system, which is funded in part by the US. He also pointed to the work of a fellow Republican, the late President Ronald Reagan, who served in the White House during the Cold War in the 1980s. As part of his Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983, Reagan had proposed a barrier to nuclear weapons that included space-based technology. “ We will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland,” Trump said. But questions have persisted over the viability of a space-based defence system, its price, and whether it could ignite a new arms race. Democrats have also questioned the possible involvement of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is a frontrunner among the technology companies seeking to build key components of the system. A group of 42 Democratic lawmakers have called for a probe into Musk’s role in the bidding process, pointing to his position as a special adviser to Trump and his substantial campaign donations to the president. “If Mr. Musk were to exercise improper influence over the Golden Dome contract, it would be another exampleof a disturbing pattern of Mr. Musk flouting conflict of interest rules,” the Democrats wrote in aletter, calling for the probe. On Tuesday, Trump did not directly respond to a question about which companies would be involved in the Golden Dome. Instead, he highlighted that the system would boost industries in states like Alaska, Indiana, Florida and Georgia. He added, “Canada has called us, and they want to be a part of it. So we’ll be talking to them.”",

    "title": "Uganda confirms military trials for civilians despite Supreme Court ruling",
    "article_text": "Uganda’sparliament has passed a controversial bill authorising military tribunals for civilians, drawing condemnation from opposition figures and rights groups, who accuse the government of trying to silence opponents, which it denies. The practice has long been used in Uganda, but was struck down by the country’s top court in January. The Supreme Court had ruled that the military tribunals lacked legal competence to try civilians and failed to meet fair trial standards. Despite that ruling, lawmakers moved ahead Tuesday with the legislation, which permits civilians to be tried in military courts. “Today, you proved you are fearless patriots! Uganda will remember your courage and commitment,” said General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, head of the military and son of President Yoweri Museveni, in a post on X. Earlier this month, Kainerugaba said that he was holding a missing opposition activist in hisbasementand threatened violence against him, after the man’s party said he was abducted. Museveni’s government has frequently defended military trials as necessary for national security amid concerns about armed opposition and alleged threats to state stability. Military spokesperson Chris Magezi said the legislation would “deal decisively with armed violent criminals, deter the formation of militant political groups that seek to subvert democratic processes, and ensure national security is bound on a firm foundational base”. But critics say the move is part of a broader pattern of repression. “There’s no legal basis to provide for the trial of civilians in the military court,” opposition MP Jonathan Odur told parliament during debate on the bill. He described the legislation as “shallow, unreasonable and unconstitutional”. Uganda has for years used military courts to prosecute opposition politicians and government critics. In 2018, pop star-turned-opposition-leader Bobi Wine was charged in a military court with illegal possession of firearms. The charges were later dropped. Kizza Besigye, a veteran opposition figure who has challenged Museveni in multiple elections, was arrested in Kenya last year and returned to Uganda to face a military tribunal. Following the Supreme Court’s January ruling, his trial was moved to a civilian court. His party, the People’s Front for Freedom (PFF), has denounced the charges as politically motivated. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has previously criticised Uganda’s military courts for failing to meet international standards of judicial independence and fairness. Oryem Nyeko, senior Africa researcher atHRW,said earlier this year: “The Ugandan authorities have for years misused military courts to crack down on opponents and critics”.",

    "title": "EU to sustain Radio Free Europe with emergency funding after Trump cuts",
    "article_text": "The European Union plans to step in to help save longtime media outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after United States President Donald Trump’s administration abruptly stopped funding it. The bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, told reporters after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday that 5.5 million euros ($6.2m) will be provided to “support the vital work of Radio Free Europe”. “It’s short-term emergency funding designed as a safety net for the independent journalism,” she added. Trump suspended all funding for RFE/RL in March along withother US broadcasters, including Voice of America, to slash government spending. Critics of the administration said the cuts are also politically motivated and part of a push to control and curb news media that do not hew to its outlook. Trump earlier this month signed an executive order slashing federal subsidies to two US public broadcasters,PBS and NPR, accusing them of biased reporting and spreading “left-wing” propaganda. Lawyers for RFE/RL, which has been operating for 75 years, secured an order last month from a US federal judge for the Trump administration to restore $12m that was appropriated by Congress. The money has not been sent so far as lawyers said the service will have to shut down in June without the funding. Kallas said on Tuesday that the EU funding would not cover the work of the outlet across the globe but would focus on interests closer to the agenda of the bloc. “So our focus should be really to help Radio Free Europe to work and function in those countries that are in our neighbourhood and that are very much dependent on news coming from outside,” she said. The EU’s top diplomat said she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for “strategic areas” where it can help as Washingtoncuts life-saving foreign aid. The outlet’s corporate headquarters are in Washington, DC, and its journalistic headquarters are based in the Czech Republic. The service has aired programmes in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East and has more than 1,700 staff.

    "title": "What is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, and why has it been criticised?",
    "article_text": "The United States says a new Israeli-approved organisation – the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – is the key to resolving the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, but it already is receiving its fair share of criticism. The GHF says it is going to start operations before the end of May. United Nations officials and humanitarian groups say it will not have the ability to deal with the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza as a result of Israel’s two-month-long blockade. Instead, the aid groups that have been working in Gaza point out that they have the capacity to bring in food and other humanitarian supplies – if only Israel would let them. So what is the GHF, and why is the situation in Gaza so desperate? Here’s everything you need to know: Officially independent, the GHF is an Israeli- and US-backed body that plans to distribute aid in the Gaza Strip. One in five people in Gaza currentlyface starvationdue to the Israeli blockade of food and aid while 93 percent are experiencing acute food shortages, according to a UN-backed assessment released last week. Under increasing international pressure to allow in aid, Israel has sought to find a solution that it says prevents aid from falling into the hands of the Palestinian group Hamas. Humanitarian organisations say the vast majority of food and other supplies reaches Gaza’s civilian population and is not diverted to fighters. The GHF will be overseen by Jake Wood, a US military veteran who ran Team Rubicon, an organisation that distributed humanitarian aid during natural disasters. Through the GHF, Palestinians in Gaza would receive a “basic amount of food”. The initial plan was announced last Wednesday with a timeline of about two weeks before it was up and running. It’s still unclear how the GHF will be funded, but the foundation says it will set up “secure distribution sites” to feed 1.2 million people in Gaza before expanding to feed every Palestinian in the territory. It says it will coordinate with the Israeli military while security would be provided by private military contractors. The GHF initiative has been widely panned by aid groups and the UN. The UN and humanitarian aid agencies say they already have the means to distribute desperately needed aid and alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. The GHF, on the other hand, is seen by critics as a way of politicising aid and not having the experience or capacity to bring aid to more than two million people. The GHF “restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet”, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. “It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.” The UN and aid groups say the GHF plan violates basic humanitarian principles. “We are concerned by the proposed aid mechanism for Gaza and are deeply worried that it will not allow for humanitarian aid to be distributed in a manner consistent with core humanitarian principles of impartiality, humanity, and independence,” a statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. “The ICRC cannot work under any mechanism that doesn’t allow us to uphold the principles and our modalities of work.” Eleven humanitarian and human rights organisations signed astatementin which they “unequivocally reject the establishment” of the GHF, calling it: “A project led by politically connected Western security and military figures, coordinated in tandem with the Israeli government, and launched while the people of Gaza remain under total siege. It lacks any Palestinian involvement in its design or implementation.” That lack of Palestinian involvement, coupled with Israel’s approval for the project and the planned presence of the Israeli military “on the perimeter” of the distribution sites, according to US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, raises Palestinian suspicions that the establishment of the GHF will give even more power to Israel over aid distribution in Gaza. Israel is blocking it. Israel began preventing the entry of all food and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza on March 2 during a ceasefire, which it unilaterally broke on March 18. Even before the blockade, Israel restricted the amount of aid that could come in, and some Israeli protesters alsoblocked and destroyed aid. The situation has reached dire levels with the World Food Programme saying 70,000 children need urgent treatment for “acute malnutrition”. The UN said the GHF wouldweaponise aidby threatening the mass displacement of Palestinians. Initial aid distribution sites would operate only out of southern and central Gaza, which the UN warned could lead to the displacement of Palestinians in northern Gaza as they are forced to move south for food and other aid. “Humanitarian aid should not be politicized nor militarized,” the ICRC statement said. “This erodes the neutrality required to ensure assistance is delivered based solely on need, not political or military agendas.” The initiative has also been labelled by many in the humanitarian sector as insufficient. “Even if implemented, the plan’s proposed aid volumes fall short of the immense scale of needs in Gaza,” according to the ICRC. “The level of need right now is overwhelming, and aid needs to be allowed to enter immediately and without impediment.” Gaza currently has 400 distribution points, and the ability and know-how to distribute aid effectively exists. With only a few distribution points under the GHF, people may be forced to walk long distances and carry heavy rations. “The Problem is Not Logistics,” the statement from the 11 humanitarian groups read. “It Is Intentional Starvation.” Enough. We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded access to starving civilians in Gaza. We have a plan. We have thousands of trucks of food at the border. Let us in. Let us work.https://t.co/J55f8shIEUpic.twitter.com/bTmcAMbG0e — Tom Fletcher (@UNReliefChief)May 16, 2025 People with disabilities or who are injured would struggle to navigate the terrain and reach distribution points. The roads in Gaza have been badly damaged over the past 19 months of war, and theintensity of Israel’s latest military operation in Gazais only making things more difficult for Palestinians there. Furthermore, the GHF’s assertions that it is independent and transparent have been criticised by aid groups. “Despite branding itself as ‘independent’ and ‘transparent,’ the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would be wholly dependent on Israeli coordination and operates via Israeli-controlled entry points, primarily the Port of Ashdod and the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing,” the statement by the 11 aid groups read. While Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch’s associate director for the Middle East and North Africa, didn’t comment specifically on the GHF, she said allowing “a basic amount of food” into the Gaza Strip was “complicity in using starvation as a method of warfare”.",

    "title": "Marco Rubio suggests US ‘engagement’ led to limited aid entering Gaza",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Top United States diplomatMarco Rubiohas suggested his country’s “engagement” is what led Israel to allow a limited amount of aid into Gaza after a months-long blockade on food, medicine and other basic supplies. At a Senate committee hearing on Tuesday, Democrat Jeff Merkley pressed Rubio, a Republican, about his stance on Israel’s blockade, which spurred fears of imminent famine in the Palestinian territory. The secretary of state replied that the US is happy to see humanitarian assistance start to enter the territory. “Ultimately, I don’t think you would have seen the events of the last couple days without our engagement and the engagement of others,” Rubio said. Israel allowed several aid trucks toenter Gazaon Monday, and United Nations officials have said that around 100 more were cleared to reach the territory on Tuesday. But that quantity still represents a fraction of the daily needs of Gaza’s population, which numbers over2.1 million people. “Israel remains a strong ally. We’re supportive,” Rubio continued. “We understand why for their security Hamas cannot exist. We are also very happy to see that they have allowed aid to begin to flow, and we hope that that will continue.” Several Western countries, including close partners of Israel, have recently decried the Israeli siege on Gaza. On Monday, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada said in ajoint statementthat they were “horrified” by Israel’s military escalations in Gaza and its blockade on humanitarian aid. They threatened to pursue “concrete actions” like sanctions if Israel continued to expand its military assault. The administration of US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has remained staunchly pro-Israel, but experts say recent moves from the White House signal a growing gap between the US and Israel. For example, Trump did not include Israel as a stop in his recent trip tothe Middle East. He has also initiated diplomatic talks with Iran and declared a ceasefire with Yemen’s Houthi group — both of which are adversaries of Israel in the region. The Houthis, for instance, continue to launch missiles and drones at Israel in a show of support for the Palestinians in Gaza. Still, over the past three months, the US has refused to directly criticise Israel’s decision to prevent food and medicine from reaching Gaza. But last week, at a stop in the United Arab Emirates, Trump indicated he wanted to get the situation in Gaza “taken care of”. “A lot of people are starving. There’s a lot of bad things going on,” he said. Also last week, in an interview with the BBC, Rubio said he was “troubled” by the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher also told the BBC on Tuesday that as many as 14,000 children in Gaza are atrisk of dyingin the next 48 hours if food does not reach them. Last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuedarrest warrantsfor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant over possible war crimes in Gaza, including the use of starvation as a method of war. On Sunday, Netanyahu said Israel would only allow a “basic quantity of food” into the Palestinian territory to stave off international pressure. “Our best friends in the world – senators I know as strong supporters of Israel – have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,” he said, according to the publication Haaretz. The Gaza Government Media Office said on Tuesday that at least 58 Palestinians have died of malnutrition over the past 80 days. At Tuesday’s Senate hearing, Rubio appeared to acknowledge that more aid needs to reach the Palestinians in Gaza. “I understand your point that it’s not in sufficient amounts,” Rubio told Merkley. “But we were pleased to see that decision was made.”",

    "article_text": "As Israel expands its operations in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are again being forced from their homes. Israel’s prime minister has promised to seize all of the strip – something Palestinian commentators have long been saying. Benjamin Netanyahu added the ultimate result of this will be the “forcible expulsion of Palestinians” from Gaza. While partially lifting a blockade of the strip that’s now in its third month, he said he’s doing so only to appease his supporters in the United States. So what does this mean for the future of Gaza and for the Palestinians suffering displacement, starvation and the constant threat of death?

    "title": "Sudan’s army declares Khartoum state ‘completely free’ of paramilitary RSF",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s army has announced it has cleared the state of Khartoum of rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after weeks of intensive battles, with the civil war now in its third year. The General Command of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) said in a statement on Tuesday that the state – which comprises the capital Khartoum, its twin city Omdurman, and the city of Khartoum North (Bahri) – is now “completely free of rebels”. “We also renew our pledge to our people to continue our efforts until every inch of our country is liberated of every rebel, traitor, and agent,” said the SAF, headed by Sudan’s de facto leader, GeneralAbdel Fattah al-Burhan. This comes after Sudan’s armysecured a number of victoriesin battles in and around the capital in March, including the recapturing of the presidential palace and major urban centres that culminated in taking back the Khartoum airport from the RSF, headed by General Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo. In late March, al-Burhan had declared“Khartoum is free”hours after the recapture of the key airport, although smaller battles were ongoing with RSF militias in pockets around the state. Reporting from Khartoum, Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan said intense battles raged in recent days in southern Omdurman’s Salha area, which was the last remaining major RSF stronghold and home to one of the group’s largest military bases. “The army had been making gradual advances in the Salha area in the past few days until it was able to take control of the area completely from the RSF in the early hours of Tuesday morning,” she said. “The army also said it was able to recover weapons and ammunitions that were used by the paramilitary, including drones and jamming systems.” After more than two years of devastating civil war that has graduallyattracted foreign funding and weapons, control of Sudan remains torn between the two generals and their allies. The SAF dominates the north and the east – including the smallest state by area, but most populous, Khartoum – along with some central areas, while the RSF holds most of western Sudan, including most of Darfur. Where the RSF has been forced back on the ground, it has been trying to inflict damage with drone strikes, including those that have targeted energy infrastructure in both Khartoum andPort Sudan. Fighting has also been ongoing in el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state in western Sudan, as well as some key supply lines in Kordofan. More than 12 million people have been forcibly displaced by the war so far, with tens of thousands killed and many exposed toethnicity-based violence.",

    "title": "‘Blatant political attack’: US lawmaker charged over ICE centre standoff",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –United States Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer after a standoff at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in early May. On Tuesday, Democrats denounced the charge as an attempt by the administration of Republican President Donald Trump to silence his political rivals for speaking out against hisdeportation campaign. In a post on the social media platform X, Democratic Representative Gil Cisneros blasted the administration for having “gone after judges, prosecutors, and now, Members of Congress” in its attempts to stifle dissent. “The charges against Rep McIver are a blatant political attack and an attempt to prohibit Members of Congress from conducting oversight,” Cisneroswrote. The charge wasannouncedon Monday evening, with federal prosecutor Alina Habba —Trump’s former personal lawyer — accusing McIver of having “assaulted, impeded, and interfered” with law enforcement. “The conduct cannot be overlooked,” Habba wrote in a statement. “It is my constitutional obligation to ensure that our federal law enforcement is protected when executing their duties.” The criminal charge stemmed from an incident on May 9, when McIver joined two other members of Congress for an oversight tour of Delaney Hall, a privately run immigration detentionfacility in Newark, New Jersey. The visit devolved into afracasinvolving elected officials, protesters and federal law enforcement agents. The mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, wasarrestedat the scene for alleged trespassing. In Monday’s statement, Habba announced the charge against Baraka has since been dropped “for the sake of moving forward”. But his arrests likewise spurred outcry over possible political motives. Late on Monday, McIver responded to the charges against her with astatementof her own, saying she and other members of Congress were “fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities” when they visited the detention centre. McIver accused ICE agents at the scene of creating an “unnecessary and unsafe confrontation”. She added that the charges against her “mischaracterise and distort my actions”. “The charges against me are purely political,” McIver wrote. Top Democrats also remained defiant in the face of the Trump administration’s accusations, saying they would continue their oversight duties at immigration facilities like Delaney Hall. “The criminal charge against Congresswoman LaMonica McIver is extreme, morally bankrupt and lacks any basis in law or fact,” Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives said in a jointstatement. They underscored that they have a right as Congress members to show up at federal facilities unannounced for inspections. The charges against McIver, they argued, are a “blatant attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate Congress and interfere with our ability to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch”. In a separate statement, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said the criminal charge was a “dangerous precedent” that “reveals the increasingly authoritarian nature of this administration”. “Representative McIver has our full support, and we will do everything in our power to help fight this outrageous threat to our constitutional system,” they said. Democrats have denounced the Trump administration’s push for “mass deportation” as violating constitutional and human rights. As part of that push, the Trump White House has sought to expand the use of private detention centres to house the growing number of people arrested for deportation. Mayor Baraka, in particular, has repeatedly protested the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall for opening without the proper permits and approvals. Its operator, The GEO Group, has denied any violations. The facility became operational in early May, under a 15-year agreement made with ICE.",

    "title": "UK, France, Canada warn Israel of sanctions: Is opinion shifting on Gaza?",
    "article_text": "The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Canada have “strongly opposed” the expansion of Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, threatening to “take concrete actions” if Israel does not cease its onslaught and lift restrictions on aid supply to the Palestinian enclave. In a statement released on Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said they also oppose settlement expansions in the occupied West Bank. Settler violence has surged in the occupied West Bank as the world’s focus has remained on Gaza. Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and thousands displaced in Israeli raids. The statement comes weeks after the Netherlands urged the European Union (EU) to review a trade agreement with Israel as the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has intensified its bombardment of Gaza amid an aid blockade in place since March 2. Western countries backed Israel’s right to self-defence when Netanyahu’s government launched a devastating offensive in Gaza on October 7, 2023. That offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians and turned vast swathes of Gaza into rubble. On Tuesday, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that Israel has the right to defend itself, but its current actions go beyond proportionate self-defence. So what steps might Western countries take against Israel, and has Israel’s latest Gaza onslaught forced them to change their position? Here is what you need to know: The countries’ three leaders criticised Israel’s renewed Gaza offensive, while describing the “human suffering” of Palestinians in the coastal enclave as “intolerable”. They also said that Israel’s announcement of letting some aid in was “wholly inadequate”. “If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response,” the leaders’ statement said. “The Israeli Government’s denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law. “We condemn the abhorrent language used recently by members of the Israeli Government, threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate. Permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law.” The three Western leaders said that while they supported Israel’s right to defend itself following Hamas’s attack on October 7, “this escalation is wholly disproportionate”. “We will not stand by while the Netanyahu Government pursues these egregious actions,” they said. On Tuesday, the UK announced it would suspend trade talks with Israel over the Gaza war. It alsoimposed sanctionson settlers and organisations backing violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Israel’s conduct in its war on Gaza and the government’s support for illegal settlements is “damaging our relationship with your government”, said British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. My joint statement with@EmmanuelMacronand@MarkJCarneyon the situation in Gaza and the West Bank.pic.twitter.com/76vYpB42xf — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer)May 20, 2025 Amid intense international pressure, Israeli authorities on Monday cleared nine aid trucks to enter Gaza, where harsh restrictions onfood and aidhave sparked accusations that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war. However, the United Nations’ relief chief Tom Fletcher called the entry of the trucks a “drop in the ocean”, adding that “significantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza”. Fletcher on Tuesday warned that 14,000 Palestinian babies were at risk of dying in the next 48 hours if aid doesn’t reach them – a figure he called “utterly chilling”. Somehalf a million people in Gaza, or one in five Palestinians, are facing starvation due to the Israeli blockade. Starving Palestinians have resorted to eating animal feed and flour mixed with sand, highlighting acute suffering among the 2.3 million people in Gaza. The UN humanitarian office’s spokesman Jens Laerke said on Tuesday that about 100 more trucks have been approved by Israel to enter Gaza. Shifting their focus to the occupied West Bank, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada said they opposed all attempts to expand Israeli settlements, as they are “illegal and undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and the security of both Israelis and Palestinians”. “We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions,” they said. Yara Hawari, co-director of Al-Shabaka, the Palestinian Policy Network, says the statement by the UK, Canada, and France is “reflective of states wanting to backtrack and try and cover up their complicity”, highlighting that the situation in Gaza is the “worst that it has ever been” and that “the genocide is reaching new levels of cruelty and inhumaneness”. “They can point to the statement and say, you know, well, we did … stand up against it,” Hawari told Al Jazeera, adding that none have stopped arms sales to Israel. Hawari specifically referenced the UK’s role, saying it was “particularly complicit in this”. “There are reports coming out every day on how many weapons have been transferred from the UK to Israel over the course of the last 19 months,” she said. Sweden’s Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said on Tuesday that her country will push for EU sanctions against Israeli ministers because of insufficient steps to protect civilians in Gaza. “Since we do not see a clear improvement for the civilians in Gaza, we need to raise the tone further. We will therefore now also push for EU sanctions against individual Israeli ministers,” Stenergard said in a statement. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot demanded that Israel’s “blind violence” and blockade of humanitarian assistance must come to an end. On Monday, 24 countries, overwhelmingly European ones, issued ajoint statementsaying Israel’s decision to allow a “limited restart” of aid operations in Gaza must be followed by a complete resumption of unfettered humanitarian assistance. It was signed by the foreign ministers of countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile, the European Union’s top diplomat, Kallas, has decided to order a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, a free trade deal between the two regions. Kallas told Al Jazeera that the Netherlands earlier this month had sought review of the Association Agreement, particularly Article 2 – which states that both parties must respect human rights. The move has been backed by other member states, including Belgium, France, Portugal and Sweden. Robert Patman, a professor of international relations at the University of Otago in New Zealand, says the recent criticism emanating from Western capitals was in part due to public pressure. “I think there’s a sense that in liberal democracies, they can’t ultimately be indifferent to public concern about the situation … I think another factor is a perception among many countries that [US President Donald] Trump himself is getting impatient with the Netanyahu government,” he told Al Jazeera. Patman explained that with many countries in the Global South having experienced colonialism before, they were quicker than the West to condemn Israel’s actions. “They have a history of having to struggle for their own political self-determination, and given that experience, they can empathise with the Palestinians who’ve been denied the right,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday criticised Carney, Macron and Starmer following their joint statement. “By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on 7 October while inviting more such atrocities,” he posted on X. By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more… — Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu)May 19, 2025 Meanwhile, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich lashed out at the three leaders, saying his country “will not bow its head before this moral hypocrisy, antisemitism, and one-sidedness”. In a post on X, Smotrich accused the three countries of “morally aligning themselves with a terrorist organisation”. In particular, Smotrich took issue with the three countries saying they are “committed to recognising a Palestinian state”. “They have gone so far as to seek to reward terrorism by granting it a state,” he said. Netanyahu’s government and his far-right coalition partners have been vocal against the realisation of a sovereign Palestinian state despite broad international support for the so-called two-state solution. This major ground offensive, launched by Israel on the Gaza Strip on Sunday, came after days of intense bombardment that killed hundreds of Palestinians. Since Sunday, more than 200 people have been killed in a relentless wave of strikes. Major hospitals, including the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, have been renderednonoperationalafter attacks by Israeli forces. Medical professionals said it could lead to the deaths of thousands of sick and wounded people. With the backing of Israel’s lethal air force, the operation is targeting both southern and northern Gaza. The Israeli military said the offensive was launched to expand “operational control” in the Gaza Strip. Israel says its campaign also aims to free the remaining captives held in Gaza and defeat Hamas. However, Netanyahu has been repeatedly criticised by segments of Israeli society, including captives’ families, for failing to prioritise their return. He has also rejected Hamas’s offers to end the war and free the captives. Andreas Krieg, senior lecturer at the School of Security Studies at King’s College London, said that the threats from the UK, France and Canada against Israel set a precedent for other Western governments to emulate. “While it will not have a direct impact on Israel’s behaviour on the ground, it widens the boundaries of discourse internationally and makes it easier for other governments to openly stand against Israeli atrocities,” he told Al Jazeera. “Key to a change of behaviour in Israel, however, remains the United States,” he said. The US supplies the bulk of arms to Israel as well as providing diplomatic cover at the United Nations. “Yet, there is a tangible erosion of consensus at play internationally as to the perception of Israel, which taints Israel increasingly as a rogue actor,” Krieg said. Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, told Al Jazeera that the “number one” thing the three countries could do was impose an arms embargo on Israel. “The UK has taken some measures to suspend some arms exports. It’s not enough. It has got to be full and comprehensive,” he said. Zomlot also said that the states should act to ensure that “war criminals” were “held accountable”. “They must absolutely support our efforts at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice,” he said. Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant face ICC arrest warrant for war crimes, but some European nations have said that they won’t arrest them. Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, questioned how the threatened sanctions would be targeted. “Targeting whom? You need to impose sanctions on the state. It’s not about the prime minister. This is the entire government enterprise,” she told Al Jazeera. Krieg from King’s College London says the reputational damage will affect Israel far beyond the current war in Gaza. “It will be difficult to build consensus in the future around the narrative that Israel is an ‘ally’ because it is ‘the only democracy in the Middle East’,” he told Al Jazeera.",

    "title": "Foreign journalists must not abandon their Palestinian colleagues in Gaza",
    "article_text": "When Israel announced on May 5 its intention to permanently reoccupy Gaza, it did not merely declare a new phase of military domination. The expansionist state also signalled an intensification of its campaign of erasure and systematic silencing. This move should sound an alarm for every newsroom and journalist around the globe. This is not just a territorial occupation, but a war on truth. And in that war, Palestinian journalists are among the first to be targeted. The staggering toll of media workers killed in Gaza speaks for itself. Onerecent reportstates that more journalists have been killed in Gaza than in the two world wars, the wars in Afghanistan, the former Yugoslavia and Vietnam combined. It is the deadliest conflict for media professionals ever recorded. According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, at least 222 journalists have been killed. The Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU) summed up this deplorable state of affairs by stating that “Israel is the greatest killer of journalists in modern history.” This is not just the consequence of war. This is a strategy. This is a media blackout enforced through bloodshed and sealed borders. Just on Sunday, one of the bloodiest days in recent months, the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF)killedhusband and wife journalists Khaled Abu Seif and Nour Qandil along with their little daughter in Deir el-Balah. They also murdered photographer Aziz al-Hajjar and his wife and children in northern Gaza and journalist Abdul Rahman al-Abadlah in southern Gaza. An Israeli strike on a tent in the “safe zone” of al-Mawasi killed Ahmed al-Zinati and his wife and two young children. On Thursday, two journalists –Hassan SammourandAhmed al-Halou– were killed in two Israeli attacks. Two days earlier, an Israeli drone targeted journalist Hassan Eslaih in the barely functioning Nassar Medical Complex in Khan Younis. Eslaih was recovering from injuries sustained when the IOF bombed a media tent on April 7. In the attack, Eslaih’s colleague Hilmi al-Faqaawi was burned to death. On April 17, Fatima Hassouna, a prominent photojournalist whose life during the genocide became the subject of a documentary, was targeted and killed in her home along with 10 members of her family. A day earlier, she had found out that the film would be screened at the Cannes Film Festival. On May 7, when more than 100 people were killed in a single day, journalists Yehya Subeih and Noor al-Din Abdu were also targeted. Yehya’s first child, a baby girl, had been born that very morning. He had left home to get supplies for his wife and never returned. His daughter will grow up marking her birthday on the same day her father was killed. Abdu was covering an Israeli massacre at a school in Gaza City when he was killed. Apart from his journalistic work, he was also documenting the devastating loss of his own extended family. On May 6, he sent the name and photo of yet another victim to add to the list he and his uncle Rami Abdo, founder of the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, were keeping. A day later, he was added to it himself. These are just a few of the many assassinations Israel has carried out in its pursuit of a media blackout in Gaza. There are also many more cases of journalists who have survived but the trauma has silenced them. Among them is my relative Rami Abu Shammala. Rami’s family home stood only a few blocks from the ruins of my in-laws’ home in Hay al-Amal in Khan Younis – or what remains of what was once a vibrant, living neighbourhood. On May 4, a day after we marked World Press Freedom Day, an Israeli strike destroyed Rami’s home, killing his sister-in-law Nisreen and sending six children to the emergency department of the Nasser Medical Complex. Rami was not home and survived, but he fell into a state of grief so deep he could no longer bear witness. Just two days earlier, journalist Norhan al-Madhoun lost her brother, Rizq, a photographer, in an Israeli air strike targeting a community kitchen he was volunteering in. He and five of the kitchen workers were murdered in an instant. In October, the family lost father Ahmed Khalil al-Madhoun when he was killed while delivering water and then another brother Haitham, who was killed the very next day. Following Rizq’s killing, Norhan posted on social media the following: “With a heart that cracks from so much loss, I mourn you today, my beloved brother and my irreplaceable rib. … Those who knew him know that he was a homeland of generosity, a haven of compassion, and a constant voice for courage and truth. But I, who have always found refuge in the word, in writing as a career, find myself helpless before the enormity of loss.” This is what silencing a journalist looks like – not just the destruction of cameras and press vests, but the destruction of families, homes and futures. Grief and shock may silence even more than intimidation. All of this bloodshed targeting Gaza’s journalists has been happening at a time when Israel is supposedly carrying out “limited operations”. We can only imagine what will happen as its genocidal army moves in to reoccupy the strip. The world must no longer turn a blind eye. Palestinian journalists’ survival and freedom to report demand urgent, global action. Foreign journalists cannot continue to stay silent about Israel’s refusal to allow them to report freely from Gaza. Embedding with the IOF and being shown only what it wants the media to see must be publicly rejected. Without international media access, Gaza will continue to be a closed theatre of war, a place where crimes can continue unseen. In Gaza, the absence of cameras will be as deadly as the bombs exported from the United States. Now is the time for journalists, editors and news organisations to demand access – not only as a professional right but also as a moral imperative. Until this access is granted, newspapers and cable news networks should routinely remind readers and viewers that their journalists are denied entry by Israel. This is not just about solidarity with Palestinian journalists. It is about defending the very essence of journalism: the right to bear witness, to document the stories that those in power would rather keep hidden. It is crucial to take a stance now as we are seeing a global trend of press freedom retreat, accelerated by the silencing of Gaza. The number of countries that genuinely uphold a free and vibrant news media is steadily shrinking. Simultaneously, the technological promise of social media to be a force for democratic change – once seen in the Arab Spring – has all but vanished. Now is the time to enter Gaza. The international media must act – not later, not when the killing stops, not when permission is granted by Israel – but now. What is required is a global demand for access, for accountability, and for the protection of those who dare to speak. This is the moment. We must not miss it.

    "title": "Musk commits to staying Tesla CEO for another five years",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk has said he is committed to staying on as Tesla’s CEO for at least another five years, weeks after the electric vehicle maker’s chair dismissed reports that the board had approached executive search firms about finding his successor. Having reasonable control of Tesla was the most important factor in staying on as head of the company, Musk said on Tuesday at an economic forum in Qatar. “Yes, no doubt about that at all,” Musk said in response to a question on whether he planned to stick around as Tesla CEO. Earlier this month, Tesla chair Robyn Denholm denied a Wall Street Journal report that said board members had reached out to several executive search firms to find a replacement for Musk. Musk, who spoke by video at the event in Qatar, said that Tesla hadalready turned around salesand demand was strong in regions apart from Europe, where the company has faced protests over his political views. Tesla sales have also slumped in the United States, where there was a nine percent drop in the first three months of 2025, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. That was largely driven by Musk’s political involvement, including leading the US Department of Government Efficiency, which made significant cuts across the federal workforce. As a result, protests ensued andboycottsofMusk-connectedbusinesses unfolded. Tesla reported a 13 percent drop in first-quarter deliveries. The Tesla chief has said there has been a turnaround. “We’re now back over a trillion dollars in market cap, so clearly, the market is aware of the situation, so it’s already turned around,” Musk said. Tesla currently has a market capitalization of $1.08 trillion. Musk also referred to Chancellor Kathaleen St Jude McCormick, a Delaware judge whostopped a $56bn pay package for Musk, as an “activist who is cosplaying a judge in a Halloween costume”. Yet he acknowledged his Tesla pay was a part of his consideration about staying with the carmaker, though he also wanted “sufficient voting control” so he “cannot be ousted by activist investors”. “It’s not a money thing, it’s a reasonable control thing over the future of the company, especially if we’re building millions, potentially billions of humanoid robots,” he added. This comes asthe billionaire said he will spend“a lot less” in political contributions, after pumping $270m into Donald Trump’s successful 2024 US presidential bid. “In terms of political spending, I’m going to do a lot less in the future,” Musk said, adding that he does not “currently see a reason” to do more. As of 11am Eastern time (15:00 GMT) Tesla’s stock was up 1.13 percent higher than when the market opened. The stock is down 15 percent for the year. Musk also weighed in on the future of the internet service provider Starlink, which he operates. He said that the company might go public at some point in the future, but that there was no rush. Starlink has expanded rapidly worldwide to operate in more than 70 countries, with a strong focus on further growth in emerging markets such as India. South Africa’s government plans to offer a workaround of local Black ownership laws to allow Starlink to operate in the country, according to the news agency Bloomberg, which cited three people familiar with the discussions. The offer would come at a “last-minute” meeting planned for Tuesday night between South African officials and Musk or his representatives, Bloomberg said. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa and a delegation of government officials arrived in Washington on Monday in a bid to reset strained ties with the US.",

    "title": "Thousands of Gaza’s children face imminent death under Israeli siege: UN",
    "article_text": "Thousands of children in Gaza are at risk of imminent death after a nearly three-month total Israeli blockade on the besieged enclave,which has spread famine, the United Nations relief chief warns. That has put 14,000 babies at risk of dying in the next 48 hours, Tom Fletcher said in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday. “We need to flood the Gaza Strip with humanitarian aid,” the UN’s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said, describing the situation as “chilling”. All food, medicine and other life-saving aid had been blocked by Israel from entering Gaza beginning on March 2. As of Monday, a trickle of aid was authorised to enter for the first time since then but was not immediately distributed. Addressing the European Humanitarian Forum in Brussels on Tuesday, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said relief organisations have run out of words to describe thehorrors unfolding in Gazaat Israel’s hands. “But the worst in all this is that we are confronted with a situation: If there is political will, the war can stop. The siege being imposed on Gaza can be lifted,” Lazzarini said. Since early March, at least 57 children are reported to havedied from malnutrition. A UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessment says more than 93 percent of children in Gaza, or about 930,000, are at risk of famine UNRWA Director of Health Akihiro Seita added on Tuesday that the situation is getting “exponentially” worse and may soon arrive at a point that is “beyond our control”. Israel told the UN on Tuesday that it would allow the entry of 100 trucks carrying humanitarian aid, a day after it said it allowed only nine aid trucks into the enclave for the first time in more than 80 days. But UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said no humanitarian aid has been distributed yet, despite more supplies being dropped off on the Palestinian side of the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing. The Israeli moves have been roundly slammed for fulfilling only a “drop in the ocean” of the humanitarian needs in Gaza, which has been largely reduced to rubble by Israeli air strikes andground operations, which were expanded at the weekend. Israeli attacks continue to kill dozens of Palestinians, including many children, each day while what’s left of infrastructure and aid supplies are being destroyed. The municipality of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza announced on Tuesday that a major well, the last remaining source of drinking water in the area, was destroyed along with its generator in an Israeli strike. This comes as more than 100,000 Palestinians have been driven out of their homes and shelters in the past several days alone, according to the UN, and have nowhere safe to go as theyface famine. The Israeli army on Tuesday bombed the Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis as well, hitting life-saving medical supplies and causing widespread destruction across the hospital’s different facilities, including oxygen lines and a laboratory. “In northern Gaza, the Indonesian Hospital is under siege by the Israeli military with patients unable to enter or get out,” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said, reporting from Deir el-Balah. “Aside from the Nasser and Indonesian hospitals, two other major hospitals in Gaza, the European and al-Awda, have been bombed and largely put out of service in the past few days,” she added. Tess Ingram, a UNICEF communications manager, explained to Al Jazeera why ascheme hatched by the United States and Israelto take control of aid distribution in Gaza was unacceptable for the international community. She said the UN and its international partners had 400 distribution points all over Gaza to help Palestinians whereas now only a “handful” of militarised points in southern Gaza will be used under the US-Israel plan. “This would mean that people would have to walk a long way to collect a packet that weighs up to 25kg [55lb] and then walk back again,” she said. Speaking on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised that only a “minimal” amount of aid will be allowed into Gaza for diplomatic and political reasons as international pressure and condemnation is directed at him and his government. His far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said allowing any aid into Gaza while some Israeli captives taken during the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023, are still held inside the enclave is “a grave mistake hindering our victory”. As the Israeli military and government continue to promise to “defeat” Hamas, devastating military strikes on the Palestinian territory have intensified. The Israeli army said on Tuesday afternoon that it attacked 100 targets in Gaza in the preceding 24 hours, claiming they were all “terrorist” targets. At least 53,573 Palestinians have been killed and 121,688 wounded since the start of the war, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.",

Apple kicked it off the App Store nearly five years ago. byJay Peters Fortniteis once again available on the iOS App Store in the US,according to Epic Games. You can get it fromthe App Store here. Epic says it has returned to the Epic Games Store and AltStore as well. Apple kickedFortniteoff the App Storenearly five years agoafter Epic Games added its own in-app payment system to the game, which violated Apple’s rules. But after a major court ruling inEpic Games v. Applethatforced Appleto not take fees from purchases made outside of apps, the game is available to play on US iPhones once again. Shortly after the big ruling hit,CEO Tim Sweeney saidthat Epic planned to bring backFortniteto iOS in the US. He also made a “peace proposal:” “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll returnFortniteto the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.“ On May 9th, itsubmitted the app to Apple. Ahead of that, Sweeney said that Epic would useits Sweden developer accountto submit the game to the US App Store. Late last week, Epic said that Apple had blockedFortnite’sreturn tothe App Store, and the game also became unavailable on other alternative app stores in the EU. However, Apple said that it had “asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impactFortnitein other geographies” and that “we did not take any action to remove the live version ofFortnitefrom alternative distribution marketplaces.” Epic asked the judge in theEpic v. Applecase to order Apple toreview itsFortnitesubmissionon May 16th. Yesterday, the judge saidin a filingthat Apple is “fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,” and that if a resolution wasn’t reached, the Apple official who “is personally responsible for ensuring compliance” would have to appear at a hearing next Tuesday. However, shortly afterFortnitereturned to the App Store on Tuesday, Epic and Applefiled a joint noticesaying that they have “resolved all issues” from Epic’s May 16th filing. Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic also recently rolled out a new promotion to encourage players touse its payment systems: if you use Epic’s system inFortnite,Rocket League, orFall Guyson PC, iOS, Android, and the web, the company will give you 20 percent back in Epic Rewards that can be used for other purchases in its games or on the Epic Games Store. In the iOS version ofFortnitethat was released on Tuesday, the app shows you that 20 percent bonus when you pick which payment system you want to use to buy V-Bucks. The company launched a newStar Wars-themed seasonforFortniteon May 2nd. If you get the app from the App Store, it will be a small initial download, and after you actually open the app, it will download the rest of the game. For a colleague, that additional download was 12.95GB. Update, May 20th: Added details of Epic and Apple’s joint notice.

The outlet said online that the articles were not approved or created by the newsroom. byMia Sato The May 18th issue of theChicago Sun-Timesfeatures dozens of pages of recommended summer activities: new trends, outdoor activities, and books to read. But some of the recommendations point to fake, AI-generated books, and other articles quote and cite people that don’t appear to exist. Alongside actual books likeCall Me By Your Nameby André Aciman, a summer reading list features fake titles by real authors. Min Jin Lee is a real, lauded novelist — but “Nightshade Market,” “a riveting tale set in Seoul’s underground economy,” isn’t one of her works. Rebecca Makkai, a Chicago local, is credited for a fake book called “Boiling Point” that the article claims is about a climate scientist whose teenage daughter turns on her. In a post on Bluesky, theSun-Timessaid it was “looking into how this made it into print,” noting that it wasn’t editorial content and wasn’t created or approved by the newsroom. Victor Lim, senior director of audience development, added in an email toThe Vergethat “it is unacceptable for any content we provide to our readers to be inaccurate,” saying more information will be provided soon. It’s not clear if the content is sponsored — the cover page for the section bears theSun-Timeslogo and simply calls it “Your guide to the best of summer.” Ina statementpublished to the newspaper’s website, theSun-Timessaid the section was “licensed from a national content partner,” which404 Mediaidentifiedas media conglomerate Hearst. TheSun-Timessaid it was removing the section from digital editions and updating its policies so that third-party content meets the paper’s standards and is more clearly identified. The book list appears without a byline, but a writer named Marco Buscaglia is credited for other pieces in the summer guide. Buscaglia’s byline appears on a story about hammock culture in the US that quotes several experts and publications, some of whom do not appear to be real. It references a 2023Outsidemagazine article by Brianna Madia, a real author and blogger, that I was unable to find. The piece also cites an “outdoor industry market analysis” by Eagles Nest Outfitters that I was unable to find online. Also quoted is “Dr. Jennifer Campos, professor of leisure studies at the University of Colorado,” who does not appear to exist. Buscaglia did not immediately respond to a request for comment butadmitted to404 Mediathat he uses AI “for background at times” and always checks the material. “This time, I did not and I can’t believe I missed it because it’s so obvious. No excuses,” he told404. “On me 100 percent and I’m completely embarrassed.” Another uncredited article titled “Summer food trends” features similar seemingly nonexistent experts, including a “Dr. Catherine Furst, food anthropologist at Cornell University.” Padma Lakshmi is also attributed in the piece for a quote she doesn’t appear to have said. News outlets have repeatedly run AI-generated content next to their actual journalism, often blaming the issue on third-party content creators. High-profile incidents of AI-generated content atGannettandSports Illustratedraised questions about the editorial process, and in both cases,a third-party marketing firmwas behind the AI sludge. Newsrooms’ defense is typically that they had nothing to do with the content — but the appearance of AI-generated work alongside real reporting and writing by human staffers damages trust all the same.

    "title": "Google’s Gemini AI is coming to Chrome",
    "article_text": "Google’s AI assistant will be able to help you while you browse. Google’s AI assistant will be able to help you while you browse. byJay Peters Google is adding its Gemini AI assistant to Chrome, the company announced at Google I/O on Tuesday. Initially, Gemini will be able to “clarify complex information on any webpage you’re reading or summarize information,” according toa blog postfrom Google Labs and Gemini VP Josh Woodward. Google envisions that Gemini in Chrome will later “work across multiple tabs and navigate websites on your behalf.” I saw a demo during a briefing ahead of Tuesday’s announcement. In Chrome, you’ll see a little sparkle icon in the top right corner. Click that and a Gemini chatbot window will open — it’s a floating UI that you can move and resize. From there, you can ask questions about the website. In the demo, Charmaine D’Silva, a director of product management on the Chrome team, opened a page for a sleeping bag at REI and clicked on a suggested Gemini prompt to list the bag’s key features. Gemini read the entire page and listed a quick summary of the bag. D’Silva then asked if the sleeping bag was a good option for camping in Maine, and Gemini in Chrome responded by pulling information from the REI page and the web. After that, D’Silva went to a shopping page on another retailer’s website for a different sleeping bag and asked Gemini to compare the two sleeping bags. Gemini did that and included a comparison table. You’ll initially be able to keep a conversation going with Gemini as you navigate from tab to tab. But “later in the year,” Gemini in Chrome will let you select multiple tabs at once and ask a question about all of them. D’Silva also showed a demo of a feature that will be available in the future: using Gemini to navigate websites. In the demo, D’Silva pulled up Gemini Live in Chrome to help navigate a recipe site. D’Silva asked Gemini to scroll to the ingredients, and the AI zipped to that part of the page. It also responded when D’Silva asked for help converting the required amount of sugar from cups to grams. In Google’s selected demos, Gemini in Chrome seems like it could occasionally be useful, especially with comparison tables or in-the-moment ingredient conversions. I’d rather just read the website or do my own research instead of reading Gemini’s AI summaries, especially since AI canhallucinate incorrect information. Gemini in Chrome is launching on Wednesday. It will initially release on Windows and macOS in early access to users 18 or older who use English as their language. It will be available to people who subscribe to Google’s AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions or users of Chrome’s beta, canary, and dev channels, Parisa Tabriz, Google’s VP and GM of Chrome, said in the briefing. As for bringing Gemini to mobile Chrome, “it’s an area that we’ll think about,” Tabriz says, but right now, the company is “very focused on desktop.” Correction, May 20th: Gemini in Chrome can keep a conversation going as you move from tab to tab; it doesn’t only work across two tabs, as we initially reported.

    "title": "We tried on Google’s prototype AI smart glasses",
    "article_text": "The eternal problem with smart glasses is you’ve got to see it to believe it. The eternal problem with smart glasses is you’ve got to see it to believe it. byVictoria Song Photography by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Here in sunny Mountain View, California, I am sequestered in a teeny-tiny box. Outside, there’s a long line of tech journalists, and we are all here for one thing: to try outProject Moohan and Google’s Android XR smart glasses prototypes. (The Project Mariner booth is maybe 10 feet away and remarkably empty.) While nothing was going to steal AI’s spotlight at this year’s keynote — 95 mentions! — Android XR has been generating a lot of buzz on the ground. But the demos we got to see here were notably shorter, with more guardrails, thanwhat I got to see back in December. Probably because, unlike a few months ago, there are cameras everywhere and these are “risky” demos. First up is Project Moohan. Not much has changed since I first slipped on the headset. It’s still an Android-flavored Apple Vision Pro, albeit much lighter and more comfortable to wear. Like Oculus headsets, there’s a dial in the back that lets you adjust the fit. If you press the top button, it brings up Gemini. You can ask Gemini to do things, because thatiswhat AI assistants are here for. Specifically, I ask it to take me to my old college stomping grounds in Tokyo in Google Maps without having to open the Google Maps app. Natural language and context, baby. But that’s a demo I’ve gotten before. The “new” thing Google has to show me today is spatialized video. As in, you can now get 3D depth in a regular old video you’ve filmed without any special equipment. (Never mind that the example video I’m shown is most certainly filmed by someone with an eye for enhancing dramatic perspectives.) Because of the clamoring crowd outside, I’m then given a quick run-through of Google’s prototype Android XR glasses. Emphasis on prototype. They’re simple; it’s actually hard to spot the camera in the frame and the discreet display in the right lens. When I slip them on, I can see a tiny translucent screen showing the time and weather. If I press the temple, it brings up — you guessed it — Gemini. I’m prompted to ask Gemini to identify one of two paintings in front of me. At first, it fails because I’m too far away. (Remember, these demos arerisky.) I ask it to compare the two paintings, and it tells me some obvious conclusions. The one on the right uses brighter colors, and the one on the left is more muted and subdued. On a nearby shelf, there are a few travel guidebooks. I tell Gemini a lie — that I’m not an outdoorsy type, so which book would be the best for planning a trip to Japan? It picks one. I’m then prompted to take a photo with the glasses. I do, and a little preview pops up on the display. Nowthat’ssomething the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses can’t do — and arguably, one of the Meta glasses’ biggest weaknesses for the content creators that make up a huge chunk of its audience. The addition of the display lets you frame your images. It’s less likely that you’ll tilt your head for an accidental Dutch angle or have the perfect shot ruined by your ill-fated late-night decision to get curtain bangs. These are the safest demos Google can do. Though I don’t have video or photo evidence, the things I saw behind closed doors in December were a more convincing example of why someone might want this tech. There were prototypes with not one, buttwobuilt-in displays, so you could have a more expansive view. I got to try the live AI translation. The whole “Gemini can identify things in your surroundings and remember things for you” demo felt personalized, proactive, powerful, and pretty dang creepy. But those demos were on tightly controlled guardrails — and at this point in Google’s story of smart glasses redemption, it can’t afford a throng of tech journalists all saying, “Hey, this stuff? It doesn’t work.” Meta is the name that Google hasn’t said aloud with Android XR, but you can feel its presence loom here at the Shoreline. You can see it in the way Google announcedstylish eyewear brands like Gentle Monster and Warby Parker as partnersin the consumer glasses that will launch… sometime, later. This is Google’s answer to Meta’s partnership with EssilorLuxottica and Ray-Ban. You can also see it in the way Google is positioning AI as the killer app for headsets and smart glasses. Meta, for its part, has been preaching the same for months — and why shouldn’t it?It’s already sold 2 million unitsof the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The problem is, even though Google let us take photo and video this time, it is so freakin’ hard to convey why Silicon Valley is so gung-ho on smart glasses. I’ve said it time and time again.You have to see it to believe it. Renders and video capture don’t cut it. Even then, even if, in the limited time we have, we could frame the camerajust soand give you a glimpse into what I see when I’m wearing these things — it just wouldn’t be the same.

    "article_text": "Just like its books, Editions games will look great on a shelf. Just like its books, Editions games will look great on a shelf. byCameron Faulkner Editions is the name of a new game publishing label launched byLost in Cult, the same company known for making gorgeous books about video games, likeOuter Wilds: Design Works.The new label’s aim is to preserve indie games, including some that haven’t been released on physical media before, and to celebrate their artistic contributions to the medium by including plenty of extra goodies. Notably, Lost in Cult is working with DoesItPlay? to validate its titles before they’re released. The group specializes in game preservation, ensuring that games can be run from the physical media they’re stored on without the need for a download or an internet connection. The focus on elegantly preserving these titles is similar to what we’ve seen from Limited Run Games, while Editions’ focus on indie games reminds me of the Criterion Collection’s approach. Each game included in the Editions lineup will come with a fold-out poster, a sticker, a numbered authenticity card, a 40-page essay and developer interview, and gorgeous cover art, along with the game itself. The first three games to launch under the label includeImmortality,The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow, andThank Goodness You’re Here. Editions plans to announce a new game every month, starting in July. Each of the three games isavailable to preorderthrough the Lost in Cult site starting at £59.99, with the option to choose between Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 editions when applicable. PS5 owners can opt to buy the entire first run of Editions games at a discounted price, containingImmortalityandThank Goodness You’re Here, and they’ll get a third (as of yet, unannounced) Editions title when it launches in July. Lost in Cult is asking for patience with shipments, which may take up to six months. But if they’re as good as the books, the wait will be worth it.

    "title": "The FDA is making it more difficult for Americans to get vaccinated for covid",
    "article_text": "The agency is changing its policy on covid-19 vaccines, placing more scrutiny on vaccines for people considered to be at lower risk of severe illness.﻿ The agency is changing its policy on covid-19 vaccines, placing more scrutiny on vaccines for people considered to be at lower risk of severe illness.﻿ byJustine Calma The Trump administration is working to limit access to covid booster shots by creating more regulatory hoops for companies developing vaccines for “healthy persons.” The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it’s only prioritizing covid vaccine approvals for adults older than 65 and others over the age of 6 months who have at least one “risk factor” for a severe case of covid-19. “The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk,” FDA officials write incommentarylaying out their plans in theNew England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). The move comes asnotorious antivax crusader Robert F. Kennedy reshapesthe US Department of Health and Human Services, recentlypushing out the FDA’s top vaccine officialandthousands of other federal health workers. Some public health experts are already voicing skepticism over whether the FDA’s new guidance for covid boosters will reap any benefits. “This is overly restrictive and will deny many people who want to be vaccinated a vaccine.” “This is overly restrictive and will deny many people who want to be vaccinated a vaccine,” Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University, said in anemail to theNew York Times. “The only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available,” Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist, virologist, and professor of pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,toldTheAssociated Press. The FDA says it will require more data from additional clinical trials before approvals can be granted for covid-19 vaccines being developed for peoplenotconsidered to be at heightened risk from severe sickness. It says 100 to 200 million Americans will still have annual access to covid vaccines after its policy change. That would be less than 60 percent of the US population. Last week, the agencyapproved the Novavax covid-19 vaccinefor only older adults and people at higher risk from the disease. “We simply don’t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,” theNEJMcommentary says. But previous CDC studies have shown that getting a booster can help prevent mild to moderate cases of covid up to six months after getting the shot regardless of whether a person is at higher risk or not, Offit tellsTheAssociated Press. And even if someone does get sick, being vaccinated can make the illness shorter and less severe and reduce the risk of developing long covid,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of covid-19-associated hospitalizations was71.2 per 100,000people during the 2024–25 season, according to the CDC — although hospitalshaven’t been requiredto report covid-related hospital admissions to HHS since May of last year. Vaccines are an important safeguardfor people with a weakened immune system. The FDA’s new directive raises questions about whether people considered healthy will be able to get vaccinated if they want to protect someone close to them who’s at greater risk. In theNEJMarticle, the FDA notes that covid booster uptake has been low in the US, with less than a quarter of people getting the shot each year. “There may even be a ripple effect: public trust in vaccination in general has declined,” it says. Kennedy, meanwhile, has a long history of spreadingdisinformation about vaccines, advocacy for whichhe has been paid hundreds of thousands of dollarsandprofited from during the covid pandemic. “It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Peter Marks, former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) that regulates vaccines, wrote in aresignation letterin March.

    "title": "The 15 biggest announcements at Google I/O 2025",
    "article_text": "Google’s AI-heavy keynote featured updates across its apps and AI models. Google’s AI-heavy keynote featured updates across its apps and AI models. byEmma Roth Google just wrapped up its big keynote at I/O 2025. As expected, it was full of AI-related announcements, ranging from updates across Google’s image and video generation models to new features in Search and Gmail. But there were some surprises, too, like a new AI filmmaking app and an update to Project Starline. If you didn’t catch the event live, you can check out everything you missed in the roundup below. Google has announced that it’s rolling out AI Mode, a new tab that lets you search the web using the company’s Gemini AI chatbot, to all users in the US starting this week. Google will test new features in AI Mode this summer, such as deep search and a way to generate charts for finance and sports queries. It’s also rolling out the ability to shop in AI Mode in the “coming months.” Project Starline, whichbegan as a 3D video chat booth, is taking a big step forward. It’s becoming Google Beam and will soon launch inside an HP-branded device with a light field display and six cameras to create a 3D image of the person you’re chatting with on a video call. Companies like Deloitte, Duolingo, and Salesforce have already said that they will add HP’s Google Beam devices to their offices. Google has announced Imagen 4, the latest version of its AI text-to-image generator, which the company says is better at generating text and offers the ability to export images in more formats, like square and landscape. Its next-gen AI video generator, Veo 3, will let you generate video and sound together, while Veo 2 now comes with tools like camera controls and object removal. In addition to updating its AI models, Google is launching a new AI filmmaking app called Flow. The tool uses Veo, Imagen, and Gemini to create eight-second AI-generated video clips based on text prompts and / or images. It also comes with scene-builder tools to stitch clips together and create longer AI videos. The experimental Deep Think mode is meant for complex queries related to math and coding. It’s capable of considering “multiple hypotheses before responding” and will only be available to trusted testers first. Google has also made its Gemini 2.5 Flash model available to everyone on its Gemini app and is bringing improvements to the cost-efficient model in Google AI Studioahead of a wider rollout. Xreal and Google are teaming up on Project Aura, a new pair of smart glasses that use the Android XR platform for mixed-reality devices. We don’t know much about the glasses just yet, but they’ll come with Gemini integration and a large field-of-view, along with what appears to be built-in cameras and microphones. Google is also partnering withSamsung, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parkerto create other Android XR smart glasses, as well. Project Astra could already use your phone’s camera to “see” the objects around you, but the latest prototype will let it complete tasks on your behalf, even if you don’t explicitly ask it to. The model can choose to speak based on what it’s seeing, such as pointing out a mistake on your homework. Google is building its AI assistant into Chrome. Starting on May 21st, Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will be able to select the Gemini button in Chrome to clarify or summarize information across webpages and navigate sites on their behalf. Google plans on letting Gemini work across multiple tabs at once later this year. Google is rolling out a new “AI Ultra” subscription that offers access to the company’s most advanced AI models and higher usage limits across apps like Gemini, NotebookLM, Flow, and more. The subscription also includes early access to Gemini in Chrome and Project Mariner,which can now complete up to 10 tasks at once. Speaking of Project Astra, Google is launching Search Live, a feature that incorporates capabilities from the AI assistant. By selecting the new “Live” icon in AI Mode or Lens, you can talk back and forth with Search while showing what’s on your camera. After makingGemini Live’s screensharing feature freefor all Android users last month, Google has announced that iOS users will be able to access it for free, as well. Google has revealed Stitch, a new AI-powered tool that can generate interfaces using selected themes and a description. You can also incorporate wireframes, rough sketches, and screenshots of other UI designs to guide Stitch’s output. The experiment is currently available on Google Labs. Google Meet is launching a new feature that translates your speech into your conversation partner’s preferred language in near real-time. The feature only supports English and Spanish for now. It’s rolling out in beta to Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. Gmail’s smart reply feature, which uses AI to suggest replies to your emails, will now use information from your inbox and Google Drive to prewrite responses that sound more like you. The feature will also take your recipient’s tone into account, allowing it to suggest more formal responses in a conversation with your boss, for example. Gmail’s upgraded smart replies will be available in English on the web, iOS, and Android when it launches through Google Labs in July. Google is testing a new feature that lets you upload a full-length photo of yourself to see how shirts, pants, dresses, or skirts might look on you. It uses an AI model that “understands the human body and nuances of clothing.” Google will also soon let you shop in AI Mode, as well as use an “agentic checkout” feature that can purchase products on your behalf. If Chrome detects that your password’s been compromised, Google says the browser will soon be able to “generate a strong replacement” and automatically update it on supported websites. The feature launches later this year, and Google says that it will always ask for consent before changing your passwords.

    "title": "FTC v. Meta: The antitrust battle over WhatsApp and Instagram",
    "article_text": "byLauren FeinerandAlex Heath The long-awaited antitrust trial between Meta and the Federal Trade Commission kicked off on April 14th. Over about two months, DC District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg is hearing arguments about whether then-Facebook illegally monopolized the market for “personal social networking services” through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC first brought the case in late 2020. While it was initially thrown out by the judge, he let an amended version move forward after the government beefed up details about why it thinks Meta is a monopoly. This phase of the trial will help the judge determine if Meta is liable for breaking antitrust law. If he finds that to be true, he’ll later rule on how those harms should be remedied. The FTC is pushing for Instagram and WhatsApp should be spun off. This is the third US trial seeking to break up Big Tech in recent years, following the Justice Department’s two separate cases against Googleover its searchandad tech businesses. Read below for all of our updates on the FTC v. Meta case. Lauren Feiner The FTC demonstrates that Instagram hit 200 million monthly active users, and launched its video and messaging features all before migrating from AWS to Meta’s internal infrastructure. Meta has used its infrastructure improvements for Instagram to defend against the FTC’s claims that its acquisition was anticompetitive. Shortway also concedes on cross-examination that his start date at Instagram was technically a few days after the acquisition closed, and a lot of the early issues he mentioned were ones he heard from speaking with co-founder Mike Krieger during the hiring process. Lauren Feiner Prior to the acquisition, Shortway testifies that infrastructure was one of the “major causes of our pain” and the AWS hardware Instagram relied on “was not able to handle the workloads that we were throwing at them.” The small startup also didn’t have anyone on staff with expertise in fighting spam or conducting content moderation. The acquisition changed some of that within days, he says. Lauren Feiner Meta production engineering director Nicholas Shortway, who worked as an infrastructure engineer at Instagram prior to the acquisition, is now testifying about what it was like keeping the app running in the early days. “Everything was on fire,” he says, and since so few people on the team knew how to get the app back up and running during outages or other crises, Shortway recalls carrying a computer with him wherever he went, and fixing Instagram from grocery stores and movie theatres. Lauren Feiner Those would have been worth $4 billion today, FTC attorney Noel Miller says. “Please don’t say that,” Acton responds, laughing. “After taxes, it’s two.” Acton departed in 2017 before his stocks vested, shortly after a disagreement with then-Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who wanted to put advertising on WhatsApp. Lauren Feiner Acton charges that despite his opposition, Meta ultimately followed through with a business version of WhatsApp that he says diluted its end-to-end encryption. He emphasizes that the launch happened after he’d left the company. Lauren Feiner That’s the message a WhatsApp employee relayed in November 2014, after it became a part of Facebook. “Overall, Facebook would first like to push WhatsApp in countries where its obvious that WhatsApp is or can be the leader,” the employee wrote to WhatsApp’s founders. “There was some reservation in countries where Messenger is the leader (and WhatsApp has less reach/engagement but where lies greater opportunity).” Lauren Feiner The FTC shows a series of emails between Acton and and a potential job candidate in the two months before WhatsApp’s deal with Facebook was announced. The candidate, whose name was redacted in the public document, identified himself as a senior member of Facebook’s finance team and reached out to pitch himself as a chief financial officer for the startup. Acton agreed to take the meeting and after coordinated meetings with other team members and asked for references. The exchange suggests WhatsApp had plans to build a sustainable business absent a deal. But before any hiring took place, Facebook bought WhatsApp, and it no longer needed its own financial leader. Lauren Feiner On cross examination, Acton testifies that the startup added group messaging, video sharing, profile pictures, and many other features prior to the 2014 acquisition. While he and co-founder Jan Koum vehemently resisted making WhatsApp into a social media platform, the FTC seems to be suggesting that it was far from a static product limited solely to text messaging, absent Meta’s ownership. Lauren Feiner Acton testifies that the startup had already broken even on the roughly $8 million it raised and had only begun charging its $1 per year subscription in seven countries, meaning there was plenty of room to grow. As its pricing power grew, he theorizes, WhatsApp could have eventually bumped the price to $5 or $10 per year. While the FTC has theorized that WhatsApp likely would have had to run ads eventually to satisfy investors — with or without Meta — Meta says the founders had no interest or need to shift to an ad model without the acquisition. Lauren Feiner Acton says the messaging app company had talked with Google about a potential acquisition back in 2011, but the startup decided against it. At one point, Google founder Larry Page had asked to be given the opportunity to bid on the app if they were eventually open to selling, Acton testifies. But WhatsApp never went back to Google to solicit an offer once Meta agreed to buy it for about $19 billion in 2014, he says, adding that Google was not as good of a fit at the time. Lauren Feiner Acton reinforces a notion we’ve heard about the WhatsApp founders throughout trial: that they had absolutely no interest in building an ad-supported product or a social media feed. He testifies he wanted to focus on building the communications product and limiting distractions. “We had no ambition to build Facebook-like functionality like a feed,” he testifies. That’s why he wrote this infamous note in the early days of WhatsApp as a reminder of its guiding principles. Lauren Feiner Before Meta bought it, WhatsApp was moving toward a model where users would pay $1 per year for the messaging service after a free first year. Though the company was cashflow positive in early 2014, WhatsApp didn’t spend money on marketing in the US, since the wide availability of cheap or free messaging there at the time would have made it a “waste of money,” Acton says. Lauren Feiner That’s the message from Meta’s next witness, Catherine Tucker, an MIT management and marketing professor with expertise in digital monetization strategies. Tucker argues it’s important to account for this kind of competition because it’s the crux of how Meta makes money. Lauren Feiner Government attorney Mitchell London points out that List’s “natural experiment” about how consumers behaved when India banned TikTok leaves out some potentially important context. He notes that 58 other apps, including popular messaging and social app WeChat, were banned alongside TikTok — meaning there were fewer alternative apps for consumers to turn to. List says TikTok made up the vast majority of usage prior to the app bans. But London also points to a Meta document that says, “In emerging markets, especially India, Facebook often serves a completely different purpose.” Lauren Feiner On cross examination, the FTC interrogates List’s finding that Google Chrome is the top app users go to when they’re incentivized to spend less time on Facebook. List says he didn’t focus on the app as much as YouTube and TikTok since “it’s a little like off-device time has an infinite number of things you can do.” The FTC seems to be suggesting that this is exactly the point — and why evaluating Facebook’s relevant competitors based on where users shift their time is an imperfect measure. Lauren Feiner Had the two never merged, List testifies that each company would have likely given in more to advertiser demand for more ads, not less, as the FTC has claimed. He says that over the long run, advertiser-side incentives would win out over incentivizing user engagement if the two remained separate, since one platform couldn’t recoup lower revenue from the other. He claims this is “the direct opposite result” from what the FTC’s expert found. Lauren Feiner List uses the “natural experiment” that booted 200 million TikTok users from the app to argue that consumers see it as a fitting substitute for Meta’s apps. Within about two weeks of the ban, he says, Facebook and Instagram saw 20 percent increases in time spent on their apps. This means, according to his analysis, that TikTok should be considered a relevant competitor to Meta. Lauren Feiner In List’s experiment, Instagram users who were incentivized to reduce their usage of the app diverted their time to YouTube more than other apps he tracked. The video app saw an 18.9 percent diversion rate, while Snapchat, which the FTC says Instagram directly competes with, sees a 2.2 percent diversion rate. Facebook users incentivized to lower their usage diverted the greatest share of their time to Google Chrome at a rate of 9.3 percent. Lauren Feiner List makes this argument using a pricing experiment he ran where he paid a treatment group $4 for each hour they reduced their usage of Facebook and Instagram. The FTC has argued these apps have unique features that users greatly value to help them connect with friends and family. But List found that participants decreased their usage of Facebook and Instagram’s friends and family features about as much as all its other features – showing users don’t particularly value those features more than other ones the apps have to offer. Lauren Feiner University of Chicago professor John List, who previously served as chief economist at Uber and Lyft, is now on the stand to try to dismantle the FTC’s market definition of personal social networking services, and dispute its claim that “friends and family sharing” is a core use case for Facebook and Instagram. He tells the court thatMeWe, a small competitor in the market Meta allegedly monopolizes, is “economically inconsequential.” Adi Robertson Meta hasfiled a motionfor judgment on the antitrust case it’scurrently fighting in court. The motion argues that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has failed to produce any evidence that Meta unlawfully monopolized part of the social networking market, something the government argues it did through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The filing was submitted this evening, shortly after the FTC rested its case in a protracted trial before DC District Court Judge James Boasberg. “After five weeks of trial, it is clear that the FTC has failed to meet the legal standard required under antitrust law,” said Meta spokesperson Christopher Sgro. “Regardless, we will present our case to show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram competes with TikTok (and YouTube and X and many other apps). The FTC spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars bringing a weak case with a market definition that ignores reality.” Lauren Feiner Alison testifies that he’s concerned about short-form video content being “commoditized,” since creators can post across many different apps. Still, he sees building Reels as a huge engineering undertaking and investment that was existential for the future of the business.“If we didn’t invest in Reels, then long term, our entire business was probably going to go down significantly,” he says. “We were really believing that this was going to be the future of our business.” Lauren Feiner As the app grew early in the pandemic, Alison says, “we were very surprised by how much time people were spending on TikTok.” Meta found that number was roughly 120 minutes per user, per day. Lauren Feiner When Matheson points out that Facebook still prompts users to log in or sign up to connect with friends, family, and people they know, Alison cautions that “just because something is on our website doesn’t mean that it’s completely up to date,” since they’re working to update how they describe the brand. He adds during cross-examination that “people are coming to Facebook for several other things besides friends” and it’s in the middle of an evolutions of how to describe the app. Lauren Feiner Matheson describes at a high level a publicly-redacted experiment from a 2021 presentation. Facebook found the experiment increased the amount of original content users shared to their feeds, but time spent on the app went down. Matheson says this would be bad for Facebook because if users see all their friends’ posts and don’t come back, it can’t serve them as many ads. Alison says that the number of times a day users opened the app also declined, as did its “meaningful social interaction” score — so another interpretation is that users would miss content they care even more about, like that from a support group.

    "title": "RFK Jr. tells farmers, GOP not to worry about his report targeting pesticides",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 20, 2025 / 7:23 PM EDT/ CBS News Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals likeglyphosatethat he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S. \"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\" The White Housein Februarytasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children. Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday. \"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\" Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use. \"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy. Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup — made from the chemical glyphosate — was causing cancer. \"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebookpost. During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedypledgedto get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating. He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as hestumped in support ofPresident Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe. \"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September oflast year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\" One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers,Calley Means— whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post — said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\" \"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\" Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release. Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines. \"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week. The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals. Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS. For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Programpublished results in 2023suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international expertspreviously suspectedit might cause cancer. Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study publishedin 2022found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children. Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced. The last round of published sampling by the FDAin 2022found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections. Alexander Tin is a digital reporter for CBS News based in the Washington, D.C. bureau.

    "title": "Trump announces $25 billion for \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 20, 2025 / 5:06 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— President Trump on Tuesday announced his administration has selected the architectural design for a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the United States from foreign threats. The president also saidthe budget packageRepublicans are currently ironing out on Capitol Hill will include an initial $25 billion to begin construction on the missile defense system. Mr. Trump said the project's total cost will be about $175 billion, although it could be much more. Congress hasn't yet funded any of the project, although Mr. Trump told reporters he thinks it'll be easy to fund on Capitol Hill. \"Today, I'm pleased to announce that we have officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system that will deploy next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors,\" the president announced in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Mr. Trump said the project should be \"fully operational before the end of my term,\" which would be before January 2029. The president said the system will be built in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia and Indiana, and involve multiple, yet-to-be-selected American defense and technology companies. Canada wants to be involved in the project, the president said, adding that the U.S. wants to help Canada as it can. \"Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" he said. \"And we will have the best system ever built.\" The president told reporters that he suggested a comprehensive new missile defense system to U.S. military leaders, and they agreed, not the other way around. \"I suggested it and they all said, 'We love the idea, sir.' That's the way it's gotta be, right? But they want it. And they wanted it badly once it was suggested.\" The president has for months expressed a desire for a defense system like Israel's. In hisMarch joint addressto Congress, the president requested funding for the system. \"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\" A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade. The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems. Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein ofIsrael's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict. \"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles — which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight — will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfullytested ballistic missileswith sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\" The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035.Keeping Iranfrom becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies. The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S. Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.

    "title": "How climate change is increasing complication risks for pregnant women",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 20, 2025 / 12:20 PM EDT/ CBS News Early season heat wavesgripping thecentral and southern United Statesare bringing attention to the health dangers of high temperatures during pregnancy. Whileextreme heatcan be dangerous for anybody, pregnant women are particularly at risk — and according toa reportreleased last week, climate change is making things worse. The analysis, from the nonprofit Climate Central, found that climate change nearly doubled the average number of \"pregnancy heat-risk days\" — extremely hot days linked to an increased risk of preterm birth —in the U.S. from 2020 to 2024. \"These are the days when pregnant women are at increased risk for a number of different complications — soheat stroke, heat exhaustion,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Tuesday. \"If you have these kinds of symptoms in a pregnant woman, it's even more concerning, because you can have other complications like preterm birth.\" Heat can have such an impact because pregnancy puts major stress on the heart. \"You're more likely to get dehydrated during pregnancy. You have an increase in your blood volume during pregnancy, and so being dehydrated, being exposed to extra heat, you're working that much harder to keep yourself and your baby cool,\" Gounder said. While it's important to be aware of temperatures throughout an entire pregnancy, Gounder said it's especially important during the third trimester, which can be hardest on the body. It's also when the risk of extreme heat causes the most number of complications, she added. Finding ways to stay cool should also be top of mind, Gounder said, especially as resources related to heat safety are being cut. \"You're going to have to stay on top of this a whole lot more, because some of the surveillance that was being done byNOAA(the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), by theCDC, is now being cut by theTrump administration,\" Gounder said. \"That is part of their job — to do the surveillance and let people know and to have those cooling centers open and ready to welcome people.\" In February, more than 800 employees weredismissed from NOAA, the nation's primary hub for weather and climate information that is considered the authority on forecasting, storm tracking and climate monitoring. The job cuts were part of a federal cost-cutting initiative by the Trump administration and theElon Musk-ledDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Also under the DOGE initiative were cuts to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including large agencies like the CDC, the nation's public health agency, which is responsible for protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats, tracking health trends and developing health and safety guidelines. To help stay cool, Gounder suggests not over-exerting yourself on hot days, finding a shady place to take breaks when outside and seeking spaces like a public library if you need to cool down further.

    "title": "Vance looks to cultivate a relationship with the pope as a new diplomatic partner for the U.S.",
    "article_text": "ROME — Vice PresidentJD Vanceshuffled between presidents and prime ministers this week, tending to complicated relationships with U.S. allies and puzzling over two wars. But it was his meeting Monday with newly installedPope Leo XIVthat could prove to be most consequential on the world stage, Vance said in an interview with NBC News. As his SUV limo sped to the airport here at the end of a three-day trip centered around the first U.S.-born pontiff’s inaugural Mass, Vance spoke of Leo as a key potential partner inPresident Donald Trump’s effortsto broker peace between Russia and Ukraine and in other conflict areas. “We talked a lot about what’s going on in Israel and Gaza. We talked a lot about the Russia-Ukraine situation,” Vance said of the nearly hourlong audience he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had with Leo. “It’s hard to predict the future, but I do think that not just the pope, but the entire Vatican, has expressed a desire to be really helpful and to work together on facilitating, hopefully, a peace deal coming together in Russia and Ukraine.” Vance, who is Catholic, said he found the pope to be “extremely sweet.” He described their conversation as substantive — a promising sign given how Leo had, in his previous service as a cardinal,signaled disapprovalof Trump administration immigration policies. Hours after the audience, Trump issued asocial media postsuggesting Leo could be helpful in the Russia-Ukraine talks. “We have an American pope of the world’s largest single religion — a guy who doesn’t have an army, but who I think has an incredible amount of capacity to convene and to influence, not just Europe, but, really, the entire world,” said Vance, riding in the backseat alongside second lady Usha Vance as their motorcade delivered them to Air Force Two for their return to Washington. “I hope it’s the beginning of a very good relationship, because I think he does care a lot about peace,” he added. “If there is a single most productive thing [from the trip], my hope is that it will be that the relationship between us and the Vatican leads to a lot fewer people getting killed and a lot less humanitarian disaster.” In a statement, the Vaticanacknowledged“an exchange of views on some current international issues, during which hope was expressed that humanitarian law and international law be respected in areas of conflict and that there be a negotiated solution between the parties involved.” This week’s diplomatic efforts underscore the large foreign policy role Vance has carved out in Trump’s administration. Trump has shown alimited appetite for travelin his second term. The president’s recently completed Middle East visit washis first major overseas tripand only his second when counting his attendance last month at Pope Francis’ funeral, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Vance, who met briefly with Francis  the day before his death, has now been to Italy twice as vice president. He has alsovisited India, represented the White House at conferences inParisandMunichandtouched down in Greenlandto reinforce Trump’s interest in annexing the island from Denmark. And the White House nearly sent Vance from Rome on a last-minute mission to Israel — whichTrump skippedon last week’s tour — but said the logistics could not be worked out in time. “I don’t think there’s a particularly deliberate strategy of him traveling less or me traveling more,” Vance said, weighing his globetrotting against Trump’s. “I just think it’s kind of the way it’s fallen.” But Vance acknowledged that he has been given a broad portfolio and wide latitude. “I definitely think the president has a lot of trust in me, and I’m honored by it, and I think it makes me a more effective vice president,” Vance said. “A lot of people always asked me between the election and the inauguration: What would my role be? I would always say … I think it’ll be being an extra set of eyes and ears for the president, doing the things that he thinks that I need to do, and that’s largely how it’s worked out.” There was plenty for Vance to do in Rome. After Sunday’s Mass, he and Rubio hosted Zelenskyy at the U.S. ambassador’s residence here. AFebruary clashbetween Vance and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office seemed like a distant memory when the vice president’s office released a statement about “their shared goal of ending the bloodshed” and a photo of the two leaders smiling. From the Zelenskyy meeting, Vance hustled to Chigi Palace, where Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had brokered a meeting between Vance and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The sitdown was framed as an opportunity for constructive dialogue at a time when Trump’s tariffs andVance’s adversarial posturetoward European leaders have rattled the Continent. “Obviously, the president has had some pretty tough words — I guess I have, too, pretty tough words for Europe — about the importance of opening their markets, but also the importance of doing more burden-sharing in defense,” Vance said in the interview. “And I would say that one leader that both of us have consistently found is a really helpful bridge between the United States and Europe is Meloni.” Meloni, like Trump and Vance, is known for her far-right politics. Vance observed that she has two qualities that he believes make her a strong diplomatic partner. “The first is that she’s a very, very good listener. So if you have two people who really disagree on something, she tries to understand where both of them are coming from, and she’s perceptive and insightful enough that she actually understands it,” he said. “The second thing is, she’s extraordinarily direct. She actually reminds me a little bit of Usha in that way, where she can deliver an extraordinarily direct message without coming across as offensive. That’s just a skill, right? There’s a skill in actually being direct with somebody but not raising their guard.” Vance also met Sunday with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and with British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He said his discussions with Carney centered on trade policy,a major issuebetween the U.S. and Canada. Diplomacy to this degree wasn’t originally on the agenda for Vance’s return to Rome. “When we first started sketching out the trip, I thought, oh, this is kind of nice. We’ll go to the papal Mass, Usha and I will have lunch afterwards, and just kind of take it easy on Sunday and fly home Sunday night or Monday,” Vance, who had just finished a leisurely lunch with the second lady, said before clarifying that he looks for opportunities to “do as much as I possibly can” on taxpayer-funded trips overseas. “It was a very personally rewarding trip,” he added. “Once you’re here and there are all these other world leaders here, you might as well try to try to sit down with them and talk to them.” Vance’s expansive role has placed him alongside Rubio, the administration’s chief diplomat, as a face of Trump’s foreign policy. The president stoked speculation of a 2028 rivalry between the two earlier this month when, inan interviewon NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” he suggested both as potential successors. At the time, allies of both Vance and Rubiodismissed any notionof competition or friction. Vance did so himself Monday, mentioning a recent conversation with a political consultant. “I can just feel it — the media is going to start telling some story of me versus Marco or me having a rivalry with Marco,” Vance recalled telling the consultant. “Most of the time,” Vance said, “I don’t give a s--- about this stuff. I don’t even think that much about it.” He and Rubio, Vance added, talk five times a day — “on a light day.” If there’s a call Vance knows Rubio will be on, he said, he knows he can skip the call and catch up with him later. “That’s the level of trust and confidence that I have in Marco,” Vance said. “My attitude is, if I do end up running in 2028, I’m not entitled to it,” he continued. “But I really think that Marco and I can get a lot done together over the next few years. That’s how I think about our friendship and our relationship. And I would be shocked if he thought about it any differently.”",

    "title": "Judge orders Trump admin to 'maintain custody' of migrants deported to war-torn South Sudan",
    "article_text": "For thesecond time in less than two weeks, immigration lawyers have gone to federal court to try and stop the Trump administration from deporting a small group of immigrants from the United States to a war-torn country not their own. Immigration attorneys told the court that at least two of their clients, from Myanmar and Vietnam, were deported Tuesday morning to South Sudan in violation of a court order, and they demanded their return. “The Court should further restrain all flights carrying class members to South Sudan or any other third country,” the attorneys said. At an emergency hearing Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy told the Trump administration to “maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country.” This, the judge wrote in a court order, is to “ensure the practical feasibility of return” if the removals are found to have been unlawful. A further hearing on the matter is scheduled for Wednesday, where the judge has asked the Trump administration to identify those being removed, the type of notice those individuals received and opportunities they had to “raise a fear-based claim” before their removal to a third country. (A fear-based claim is generally one in which an individual expresses fear of harm like persecution or torture should they be deported.) The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and NBC News was not able to independently verify that a deportation flight to South Sudan had occurred. AState Department travel advisorywarns Americans not to go to South Sudan “due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict” and notes that in March, because of the situation there, the department “ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees from South Sudan.” Both of the immigrants alleged to have been sent to South Sudan on Tuesday were the subjects of final removal orders allowing the government to deport them to their countries of origin, according to court filings. In their filing, the attorneys included an email from the wife of a Vietnamese immigrant who said she believed her husband and at least 10 other people were deported to South Sudan on Tuesday morning. She said the immigrants had refused to sign forms facilitating their deportations to a country not their own. The woman, whose name was redacted in the filing, wrote to her husband’s attorneys, “The order of removal signed by a judge is to deport my husband back to his country of origin, Vietnam, not to any other third country.” The Trump administration had tried to send a group of immigrants to Libya this month. The immigrants were from countries like the Philippines, Vietnam and Laos, according to an emergency motion their lawyers filed at the time. That flight wasstopped after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order. The judge said the immigrants needed to be given notice and the chance to raise concerns about possible torture or persecution. The attempt to stop or reverse the deportations to South Sudan is before the same judge. The immigration attorneys believe at least one of the people the Trump administration had tried to send to Libya was sent to South Sudan. Efforts to reach the South Sudanese government for comment were not successful.",

    "title": "What's next for Venezuelans after Supreme Court allows Trump to revoke protected status?",
    "article_text": "A two-paragraph Supreme Court order is upending the lives of some 350,000 Venezuelan migrants who have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. with special legal protection from deportation. The court’s order Monday allows the Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status from the group of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans as a legal case on the matter continues. Attorneys representing the TPS holders said the Supreme Court’s brief order raises questions, including exactly when the 350,000 Venezuelans will lose their legal protections. Here’s what we know about the order and what comes next in the case. The Supreme Court order directly affects a group of some 350,000 Venezuelans who were granted Temporary Protected Status in 2023 by then-President Joe Biden for humanitarian reasons. Biden extended the protections for the group in January, allowing them to retain their legal status until October 2026. The Trump administration has been targeting both undocumented immigrants and those protected under legal programs in service of its goal of enacting mass deportations. President Donald Trump has sought to undo a series of protections granted during the Biden administration, including TPS. Shortly after Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to cancel the Biden administration’s TPS extension, saying that it was “contrary to the national interest” to continue the protections. Seven Venezuelan TPS holders and the National TPS Alliance sued the Trump administration, arguing that Noem’s order violated legal procedures and was racially discriminatory. In March, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal protections while the case played out. The administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene. Monday’s order means that the 350,000 Venezuelans can now lose their protected status while the case continues to play out in court. “This is the largest de-documentation, or loss of legal status, for any group of people in the history of the country,” Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California working on the case, told NBC News. “It’s really devastating and has an extraordinary effect.” Temporary Protected Status is granted to immigrants in the United States who can’t return to their home countries because of natural disasters or political upheaval. It does not provide a path to citizenship. The Biden administration in March 2021 said because of political instability in the country, Venezuelans were eligible for the federal program, which has existed since 1990 to provide humanitarian relief to people from countries reeling from war, natural disasters or other catastrophes. People granted TPS have legal status in the U.S. and can get work authorization for up to 18 months, subject to extensions. Without that protection, those immigrants are subject to deportation but can seek other avenues for remaining in the U.S., such as claiming asylum. Attorneys in the case said the group of 350,000 Venezuelans are now at risk of deportation and in limbo. Ahilan Arulanantham, one of the lawyers representing Venezuelan plaintiffs, said while the order means the 350,000 Venezuelans are going to lose their TPS status and work authorization, the court’s order did not give a specific timing for the loss of the protected status. “It could be right now or it could be a week from now, or it could be some other time that’s unclear,” he said during a news conference Monday held after the Supreme Court’s order. “It’s in the hands of the government to clarify what the order means and how they interpret it,” he said, adding that the legal team could challenge that interpretation in the ongoing court case. Arulanantham said what also remained unclear was the motivation or reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s order. “We just don’t know, because they haven’t explained why,” he said. MacLean said during the news conference that the district court has requested a status report on May 26 about the significance of the order, as well as a hearing on May 29 where both parties “will be discussing and analyzing what it means.” While the order only directly affects the group of Venezuelan TPS holders who became eligible in 2023, the attorneys said the Supreme Court’s order did not bode well for other TPS holders as their cases continue to play out in court. The decision is a “win for the American people and the safety of our communities,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Monday. “The Trump administration is re-instituting integrity into our immigration system to keep our homeland and its people safe,” she added. The Trump administration on Tuesday declined to comment on how it interpreted the Supreme Court’s order and the timing for Venezuelans' loss of TPS protections. The Department of Homeland Security stated on its website that it “has every intention of ending Venezuela TPS under the 2023 designation as soon as it obtains relief from the court order.” “The litigation continues,” said Jessica Bansal, an attorney with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. “The Supreme Court’s order leaves it open for the litigation to continue without the protection for the people who are affected by the secretary’s decision.” “But again, the case now continues under the shadow of an unexplained two-paragraph order with an unclear impact,” Bansal said. “We will continue to fight because we know that we are in the right, both morally and legally.” MacLean told NBC News the legal team will press forward with its arguments that Noem’s order to terminate the TPS protections is “contrary to law and unconstitutionally motivated by racism.” Oral arguments in the case were scheduled to be held in July. “So unless that is advanced, that means that there is a period of two months at least where Venezuelan TPS holders will be at risk,” she said. MacLean said that if they succeeded in court, it would “return protections for the Venezuelan TPS holders” as well as provide additional protections for 250,000 Venezuelan TPS holders who were granted their status in 2021, as well as some 500,000 Haitian TPS holders. Currently, TPS for Venezuelans who became eligible in 2021 would end in September. The administration would likely appeal that decision. If the judge ordered against the plaintiffs, their attorneys would also appeal that decision, MacLean said. “There are going to be additional legal battles that play out. The issue now for us is how quickly we can get back into court to try to return protections to the TPS holders who are at risk today or very soon,” she said. The attorneys said they would also pursue other forms of immigration protection for the plaintiffs in the case, including tens of thousands of members of the National TPS Alliance who were affected by Noem’s decision. They also encouraged other Venezuelan TPS holders to stay informed on the case and pursue if there are other forms of immigration protection they may be eligible for.",

    "title": "Fewer people are flying out of Newark airport than at this time last year",
    "article_text": "For some travelers, Newark Liberty International Airport has become a no-fly zone. With passengers spooked by reports of harried air traffic controllers' losing radio and radar contact with planes and dismayed by the resulting massive flight delays, the average daily number of travelers flying out of Newark, New Jersey, has dropped by as much as 20% compared with this time last year, from around 72,983 during the second week of May 2024 to 58,496 last week, according to Transportation Security Administration data reviewed by NBC News. Meanwhile, New York's LaGuardia Airport experienced a 16% increase in the average daily number of travelers during the same period, from 36,367 in 2024 to 42,037 this year, the data shows. And New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport has had a slight increase in the average number of daily travelers, from 96,392 in 2024 to 97,061 this year in the second week of May, according to the data. The Federal Aviation Administration predicts higher-than-usual volume of flights for the Memorial Day weekend, with a peak of about 54,000 flights Thursday. \"We’re expecting flight numbers to grow week by week throughout the summer, with the peak at the end of July and six more 54,000+ flight days before the end of August,\" the FAA said in a statement. \"Thursdays will be the busiest day of the week.\" But at Newark, the FAA has proposed reducing the number of arrivals and departures after air traffic communication issues caused controllers to lose radio and radar contact with the planes they were guiding for 90 seconds on April 28. There is “a structure of how many flights can leave per hour. We have a delayed flight schedule of takeoffs,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said,ReutersreportedTuesday. “You are going to see a reduction.” That reduction came by way ofan interim orderthat takes effect Tuesday: Until construction of Runway 4-Left/22-Right is complete, the maximum hourly rate will be 28 arrivals and 28 departures, the FAA said. Daily construction will end June 15 but will continue on Saturdays through the end of the year. Outside of the construction period, 34 hourly arrivals and departures will be allowed until Oct. 25. “Our goal is to relieve the substantial inconvenience to the traveling public from excessive flight delays due to construction, staffing challenges, and recent equipment issues, which magnify as they spread through the National Airspace System,” acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said in a statement. The agency added that arrival and departure limits could be adjusted higher or lower, depending on conditions. United Airlines, which has a hub at Newark, would be the most affected, Duffy said. \"They're the biggest player at Newark,\" he said. United Airlines said in a statement that \"reducing the number of flights scheduled at Newark will help ensure that we can safely and reliably operate the flights that remain on the schedule.\" Earlier this month, itvoluntarily cut 35round-tripflightsper day from Newark,where, in addition to a shortage of controllers, ongoing runway construction has contributed to flight delays. \"We are confident that the decisive steps taken by Sec. Duffy, including his leadership on matching the airport’s capacity to its operational limitations, will have it back operating reliably for the benefit of our customers,\" United said. Since Duffy announced last week that the FAA and the major airlines weretalking about reducingthe number of flights in and out of Newark, the percentage of flight cancellations has dropped significantly. For most of last week, Newark’s share of nationwide flight cancellations had been hovering between 35% and 60%, according to FlightAware data. But on Friday, the number of cancellations was at 15%, and it dropped to 9% on Saturday. While Duffy has said no planes were ever in any danger of colliding or crashing when the controllers' radio and radar went down on April 28, several of the controllers working that day went on trauma leave, further reducing the already depleted ranks of controllers available to work the crowded skies over New Jersey. There should be 38 certified controllers serving Newark, the FAA has said. Currently, there are only 22. Mishaps continue to plague the aging system. The controllers for Newark, who are actually based in Philadelphia, lost radio frequencies with the planes they guide for 2 seconds at around 11:35 a.m. Monday. No planes were in danger of colliding, and the FAA said it is investigating. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said Tuesday in an interview that \"it's absolutely safe to fly.\" But when he was asked whether it is likely to be a summer of travel woes at Newark airport, Daniels said that \"I think the focus has to be on it getting better soon\" and that the shortage of air traffic controllers is a nationwide problem. “Right now we operate a system with 10,800 hard-working American men and women,” Daniels said. “But we should be having 14,663 staff that very system.” Many of the controllers are working six-day weeks and 10-hour shifts, he said. \"Morale is low right now when you’re dealing with the pressure and scrutiny that’s going on in the aviation system right now, with low staffing in every one of your facilities,\" Daniels said. Last month,Duffy said he expected the FAAto meet its goal of graduating 2,000 new air traffic controllers this year but warned the chronic shortage of controllers would take years to fix. But he has also gotten bipartisan pushback from lawmakers who noted that the April snafu happened not long after theTrump administration fired hundredsof FAA workers, including maintenance mechanics, aeronautical information staff members and environmental protection specialists, in its effort to shrink the federal government.",

    "article_text": "Call it the “Kermencement” at the University of Maryland, where the graduation stage Thursday night will feature a froggy favorite: Kermit the Frog, delivering what will be his first commencement address in nearly 30 years. “I’m so humbled by it,” Kermit said. “I’m kind of taking this seriously — as seriously as a singing, dancing frog can take anything.” Maryland knows Muppets well: Their creator, Jim Henson, earned his degree there in 1960, majoring in home economics. He and his wife, Jane, met on campus in a freshman puppetry class. Henson is honored with a statue at the university’s College Park campus, alongside his amphibian sidekick. Kermit’s message to grads this year? Take the proverbial “leap” into opportunity and remember that this big step into adulthood doesn’t mean leaving behind their inner children. “Maybe we’re at our best when we allow ourselves to continue to grow and learn something new every day,” Kermit said. “I kind of hope these graduates keep that sophisticated childlike sense of curiosity and imagination and innovation as they travel down their paths.”",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A formerJan. 6 defendantwho was arrested after he showed up at former President Barack Obama’s home in 2023 was convicted Tuesday of illegal possession of guns and ammunition. Taylor Taranto, who was apprehended while he was livestreaming video near Obama’s house in Washington, D.C., was also found guilty of a false information and hoaxes charge related to a video he streamed a day earlier claiming he was on a “one-way mission” to blow up the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Maryland. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled on the case following a bench trial that got underway last week. Taranto's attorney, Carmen Hernandez, blasted the verdict. “I think it’s a terrible outcome under a statute that is overbroad and violates the First Amendment,” Hernandez told NBC News. “Mr. Taranto is an honorably discharged, disabled veteran with no prior convictions, no history of violent conduct. He’s been convicted of having made a bad joke with absolutely no evidence that he intended to carry out any criminal conduct.” Taranto had posted about appearing outside Obama’s residence the same day in June 2023 that Trump shared a screenshot on social media that included what he said was Obama’s Washington address. Prosecutors said Taranto reposted what Trump had shared and then posted about being outside Obama’s home, writing, “We got these losers surrounded!” Investigators said they found two guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Taranto's van, along with a machete, when he was arrested. Prosecutors alleged that Taranto repeatedly said that he was trying to get a “shot” and that he wanted to get a “good angle on a shot.” Online sleuths first identified Taranto as a Jan. 6 participant in 2021. He was one of the roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants President Donald Trump pardoned on the first day of his second term in office. Ryan J. Reilly reported from Washington and Zoë Richards from New York.",

    "article_text": "Jason Sudeikis once shared a childhood memory of his famous uncle,“Cheers” star George Wendt, taking him on a terrifying drive in a new BMW through the twisty roads of Los Angeles’ famed Laurel Canyon neighborhood. Sudeikis recalled the story in September 2017 while speaking toThe A.V. Clubon the red carpet of the “Second City’s Roast Of George Wendt” event he hosted in honor of his uncle, who died Tuesday at age 76. “We all went out to California to visit and George had just gotten a new car ... It was a badass BMW with, like, manual drive, which I’d never seen before, you know, I was pretty young,” Sudeikis, who grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, began as Wendt stood beside him smiling. “He took me and my dad for a ride,” Sudeikis, continued as Wendt burst out laughing. “My dad sat shotgun. I was in the back all by myself. This is not when you needed, you know, mandatory seatbelts. “He drove us through Laurel Canyon,” Sudeikis said, motioning with his arm to indicate the neighborhood’s hilly terrain. Though Wendt had driven the roads “hundreds and thousands of times,” Sudeikis and and his father were scared for their lives. “He had my dad holding onto (the car) like nothing you’ve ever seen,” Sudeikis said, now also laughing. “And I’m just like sliding around the background just because the seats were brand new.” “I hold that memory very fondly,” the former “Saturday Night Live” star concluded. Wendt earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for his performance as the beer-loving Norm Peterson on “Cheers,” which aired from 1982 to 1993. In 2024, Wendt reunited with fellow “Cheers” cast membersTed Danson, Rhea Perlman, Kelsey Grammer and John Ratzenberger at the 75th Annual Emmy Awards. Wendt reprised the role of Norm on the short-lived “Cheers” spinoff “The Tortellis” and again on the more successful spin-off “Frasier.” He also briefly starred in his own CBS sitcom, “The George Wendt Show.” Wendt died at home in his sleep, his family confirmed in a statement through his publicist. “George was a doting family man, a well-loved friend and confidant to all of those lucky enough to have known him,” the statement said. “He will be missed forever.”",

    "title": "Sarah Silverman recalls her dad telling her how he believed her brother actually died",
    "article_text": "Sarah Silverman is going public for the first time with the shocking story her father told her about her only brother’s death. In a new interview withRolling Stone, thecomedian and actor, 54, said she and her siblings grew up believing Jeffrey died as an infant because of a crib accident. All that changed when Silverman’s dad, Donald Silverman, told her in 2022 that he believed Jeffrey died after his paternal grandfather, Max, shook him in a violent rage. “The story was that something happened with the crib, and Jeffrey’s little body slid and he got suffocated. But if you look back, there was never a lawsuit with the crib company or anything,” Sarah Silverman told the publication. The former “Sarah Silverman Program” star said her father told her the truth three years ago after he heard her recount Jeffrey’s death in her autobiographical off-Broadway musical“The Bedwetter,”which was based on her bestselling 2010 memoir of the same name. The elder Silverman came backstage and told his daughter that Jeffrey’s grandparents were babysitting him while he and Silverman’s mom, Beth, were on vacation. “My dad says, ‘I always felt that he was crying or something, and my dad shook him,’” Silverman recalled. “‘He shook him in a rage and killed him.’” “As soon as he said it, it was like, ‘Of course, that’s what happened,’” Silverman recalled. “His mother always stood by her husband. She watched him beat the s--- out of her son. I couldn’t ask my mom, because she was dead.” Silverman described her father’s childhood as “heartbreaking” because of her grandfather’s abuse. “His dad beat the s--- out of him every day, just mercilessly. He had a younger brother who wasn’t touched. His father made the kids call him Mr. Silverman,” she said. During a 2022 visit to TODAY, Silverman said her “Bedwetter” musical revisited the challenges of her own childhood — which included struggles with anxiety and bedwetting — and their impact on her parents and her three sisters. “I’m the youngest so I was kind of the joy. I made my family laugh,” she said, adding that her musical “takes place in the ‘80s” when she was 10. “The Bedwetter,” she added, is about “a kid who is happy-go-lucky but falls apart, and the family kind of falls apart.” Silverman’s new Netflix special,“Sarah Silverman:PostMortem,” premiering May 20, explores how she’s processed the death of her father, her mother and her step-mother, Janice, according toVariety.",

    "title": "House Democrats will introduce legislation to 'save NOAA'",
    "article_text": "House Democrats plan to introduce legislation overnight that would prevent further Trump administration cuts to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funding or staffing after severe storms across the country drew attention to staffing cuts in National Weather Service field offices. The measure, which will be offered as an amendment to theRepublican budget reconciliation bill, would also block NOAA from being dissolved, from having its work transferred to other federal agencies and from having its website or datasets degraded, according to a copy of the amendment reviewed by NBC News. Democratic Reps. Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Eric Sorensen of Illinois, Joe Neguse of Colorado and Wesley Bell of Missouri plan to introduce the amendment as soon as early Wednesday. The bill highlights congressional concern aboutNational Weather Service staffing levelsafter the Trump administration fired probationary workers and offered early retirement to veteran employees. Short-staffed weather forecast offices dealt with a severe thunderstorm and tornado outbreak over the weekend, during which at least 28 people died in the Midwest and the South. “Hurricane season is just days away, and extreme weather is only intensifying. It’s not the time to put NOAA at risk,” Moskowitz, the former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said in an emailed statement. Sorensen, the only meteorologist in Congress, added: “As a meteorologist who has covered severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, I know how important it is that National Weather Service offices are fully staffed around the clock. This amendment Congressman Moskowitz and I introduced with our colleagues will help protect NOAA from any more reckless cuts by this Administration and keep our communities safe.” The amendment does not have a likely path to success with Republicans in control of the House. The Trump administration’s initial budget request wouldslash more than $1.5 billion from NOAA, a move that all living former directors of the National Weather Service warned couldlead to unnecessary deaths. The National Weather Service has been scrambling to fill staffing holes this spring. Last week, NOAA opened a “period of reassignment,” asking for 76 meteorologists to transfer into critical roles left empty after cuts. At least eight of the country’s 122 weather forecasting offices — including those in Sacramento, California; Goodland, Kansas; and Jackson, Kentucky — are no longer able to operate overnight, or they plan to cut overnight operations within the next month and a half, said Tom Fahy, legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization. Fahy said that many forecast offices are dealing with significant staffing shortages and that 52 out of the country’s 122 weather forecast offices have staffing vacancy rates above 20%. The National Weather Service declined to provide more information about staffing levels across its weather forecasting offices. “The National Weather Service continues to meet its core mission of providing life-saving forecasts, warnings, and decision support services to the public, our partners and stakeholders,” Kim Doster, NOAA’s communications director, said in an emailed statement. “In the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.” The short-staffed Jackson, Kentucky, forecasting office was tested last weekend as dangerous storms roared across the state. Fahy said in an interview Monday that staffers worked overtime to respond to the “all hands on deck” situation, which was predicted days in advance. “We had a long lead time with a supercell that we were able to monitor,” Fahy said, adding that severe events could surprise in the future. “A strong thunderstorm can produce a tornado or multiple tornadoes, and those are the events you haven’t had an opportunity to anticipate.” Outside meteorologists said forecasters in Jackson and at other offices performed well during a violent weekend, but they worried that the strain could catch up to a patchwork staff. “The tornado warnings have been really good in this outbreak,” said Chris Vagasky, a meteorologist and research program manager for Wisconet, a network of weather stations across Wisconsin, but he added that it remains to be seen whether strain on the staff will manifest with time. “How do forecasters recover from that physically, mentally and emotionally, and is that going to impact warning performance?” he said. Vagasky said warning times for the tornadoes forecast by the Jackson office were issued more than 15 minutes in advance, which is better than average. Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University, said that it is difficult to assess the effects of short staffing but that it is possible that researchers will identify a reduction in forecast quality over time because the weather service is releasingfewer weather balloonsand has fewer meteorologists. “It’s really hard to judge a performance based on one significant event,” Gensini said. “We should expect a degradation in performance with fewer and fewer people, but quantifying it will be hard.”",

    "article_text": "By Lydia Calitri Chicks mill around a stall at the First State Animal Center and SPCA on Friday in Camden, Del. They are among 12,000 chicks that were left abandoned in a U.S. Postal Service truck for three days.Mingson Lau/APhide caption A Delaware animal shelter is working to find new homes for thousands of chicks that were left abandoned in a U.S. Postal Service truck for three days. Delaware's Department of Agriculturesaid itreceived a call earlier this month from USPS saying the Postal Service had an \"undeliverable box of baby birds.\" About 12,000 chicks had been shipped from the Pennsylvania-based Freedom Ranger Hatchery to farms across the country. State agricultural officials say that when they found the chicks at a USPS distribution center in Delaware, around 4,000 were dead. The more than 8,000 that survived were taken to the First State Animal Center and SPCA in Camden, Del., and were put up for adoption on May 13, the shelter said in asocial media post. In the same post, the shelter says that the chicks were left without food, water or temperature control. The shelter did not respond to NPR's emails or phone calls, but the Associated Press reports thatonly a few hundred chickshave been adopted. Freedom Ranger Hatchery says it hasn't gotten clear answers from USPS about the situation. In a statement, USPS said, \"We are aware that there are unfortunate rare instances where loss of life occurs with this type of shipment.\" It added that it is working directly with the hatcheries, carriers involved and delivery operations experts to prevent such incidents in the future. Freedom Ranger Hatchery told the AP it cannot take the chicks back due to biosecurity concerns. In an email to NPR, the hatchery said that this was a routine shipment that never reached its destination due to a USPS error. \"This loss has compounding effects with the many small family farms across America that were counting on these birds,\" the hatchery said. Boxes of live poultry must be \"properly ventilated, of proper construction and strength to bear safe transport in the mail,\" according toUSPS' website. USPS guidelines require that hatcheries ensure that all packaging requirements are met so that poultry can be delivered within 72 hours of hatching. Although USPS has been shipping live animals for over 100 years, some animal rights groups like PETA say it's not safe enough for them to travel by mail. In a statement in 2020, PETA President Ingrid Newkirksaidchicks are vulnerable \"when they're sent through the mail on long, terrifying journeys without food or water.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

So many Texans have fled to New Mexico's capital that some folks are calling it \"Austin West\".Adria Malcolm/for NPRhide caption SANTA FE, N.M. — The sun is sinking behind the Jemez Mountains as a group of Texas expats gathers with their pint glasses inside a Santa Fe brewpub to consider the state they abandoned, and the state they now call home. \"I was very proud to be a Texan and never really thought we'd leave, but the political climate became so conservative it felt oppressive to me,\" says Nancy Fuka, a certified quilt judge. Her husband, Kent, a retired venture capitalist, adds, \"You couldn't pay us enough to move back to Texas at this point. The emphasis of fundamental religion just grew and grew.\" Kent and Nancy Fuka pose for a portrait inside Nuckolls Brewing Company in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \"You couldn't pay us enough to move back to Texas at this point,\" says Kent.Adria Malcolm/for NPRhide caption Another couple chimes in. \"Politically, I wasn't that aware of how blue New Mexico was until I moved here,\" says Donovan Kolbly, a software developer. \"I look at New Mexico, which is a poor, rural state — sorry, I'm gonna get teary,\" says his partner, Stephanie Bonzek, a family nurse practitioner, choking up a bit, \"but they keep trying to do the right thing!\" Stephanie Bonzek and partner Donovan Kolby pose for a portrait inside Nuckolls Brewing Company in Santa Fe on April 9. Bonzek says they moved to New Mexico because the state is \"trying to do the right thing.\"Adria Malcolm for NPRhide caption In polarized America, people are sorting themselves. Conservatives are fleeing California, for instance, for Idaho and Texas. And some Texas liberals are looking for an exit. The Land of Enchantment has quietly become a blue refuge in the MAGA red West. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a diminutive, firebrand Democrat now in her second and last term, has particularly welcomed refugees from Texas: women seeking abortions, families wanting to protect trans children, doctors seeking a freer medical environment, and disconsolate liberals. \"People are seeking out states in the West where the skies are incredibly blue,\" says Grisham, 65, in an interview in her Santa Fe office. \"We've got four seasons, friendly people,free college, free universal pre-K. ... And we're going to be a safe haven for reproductive health for women and their families all across America.\" So many Lone Star liberals are fleeing extreme summer heat, big-city sprawl and Texas MAGA-style politics that some folks have started calling Santa Fe \"Austin West\". According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2022 and '23, more Texans moved to New Mexico—almost 34,000—than from any other state. The official Texas response — meh. Last summer, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, reacted to Gov. Grisham trying to lure Texas  doctors to New Mexico: \"People and businesses vote with their feet, and continually they are choosing to move to Texas more than any other state in the country.\" Indeed, 34,000 Texas exiles over two years is a drop in the bucket compared to the50,000 peoplewho move to Texas every month. And in the spirit of don't-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out, a few years ago there was abillboardin the Texas panhandle beside the interstate heading into New Mexico: \"Liberals, Please continue on I-40 until you have left our GREAT STATE OF TEXAS.\" New Mexico government is deep blue, which is unusual for a rural state dependent on oil and gas, farming and cattle. And, from the governor, to the congressional delegation, to the state legislature, women dominate elective office. In fact, New Mexico has the largest female legislative majority in the country. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has earmarked state money for two abortion clinics, poses for a portrait in her office inside the New Mexico State Capitol, also known as the Roundhouse, in Santa Fe.Adria Malcolm/for NPRhide caption New Mexico has passed some of the strongest laws in the nation toguaranteeadults and children access to gender-affirming care, to protect LGBTQ+ individuals and to enshrine legal abortion. In fact, Grisham isusing state fundsto build two reproductive health care clinics that will perform abortions. One is in Las Cruces, a short drive from the Texas border. \"Everyone has the freedom to choose the health care that's right for them, and we don't interfere,\" Grisham says. \"We're not going to tell doctors who they can and cannot see. We're not going to tell you where you can and cannot live, who you will or will not be in love with. Those freedoms exist in this state and I stand firmly and squarely behind that.\" But as the saying goes: Poor New Mexico. So far from heaven, so close to Texas. The exterior of the New Mexico State Capitol, in Santa Fe.Adria Malcolm/for NPRhide caption Its archconservative neighbor to the east, run by Republican men, hasoutlawed abortionby allowing private citizens to sue abortion providers,militarized its southern border,banned booksandforbidden gender-affirming carefor minors, and is considering araft of anti-trans bills. \"Gov. Grisham has reveled in the fact that we are a more Democratic state than Texas,\" says Fred Nathan, executive director ofThink New Mexico, a Santa Fe nonprofit. \"I think she fits our state in the same way Gov. Greg Abbott fits Texas, and there seems to be quite a rivalry there.\" Last August,Grisham boldly advertisedin major Texas cities to convince Texas OB-GYNs to relocate to New Mexico to be able to practice freely. \"This ain't Texas,\" she tweeted. State officials say there've only been a handful of takers because of the high cost of medical malpractice insurance in New Mexico. Fred Nathan Jr., the founder and executive director of Think New Mexico, poses for a portrait outside his office in Santa Fe. He says Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham \"has reveled in the fact that we are more Democratic state than Texas.\"Adria Malcolm/for NPRhide caption In September, when Abbott ordered the Texas National Guard to install razor wire along the Rio Grande facing New Mexico,Grisham shot back: \"Gov. Abbott seems to be pushing to make Texas its own country without regard for his neighbors.\" New Mexico has become an abortion sanctuary state in the interior West, along with Colorado, which also votes Democratic. In 2023,70%of women who got abortions in New Mexico came from Texas. \"Yea, I went to Albuquerque today because Texas did outlaw abortion,\" says 25-year-old America, a dog groomer from Dallas, in a phone interview, who asked to omit her last name because of privacy concerns. She drove 10 hours with her partner to an abortion clinic in New Mexico's largest city. Nonprofits helped with transportation and the procedure. America says she has a 10-year-old daughter, already lives below the poverty line, and cannot afford another mouth to feed. \"Texas lawmakers would never care to hear this,\" says America, \"but I am a woman of Texas and it isn't fair that I can't get health care in my state that I have lived in for my whole entire life.\" Dr. Eve Espey, distinguished professor of OB-GYN at the University of New Mexico, says her state wants to be a refuge for women from red states.John Burnett/for NPRhide caption \"We want to strike a balance between making sure that we're taking care of our own peoples' needs, and also being a refuge for people from Texas and Oklahoma,\" says Dr. Eve Espey, distinguished professor in the Department of OB-GYN at the University of New Mexico. New Mexico is also known asone of the most queer-friendlyplaces in the country. \"New Mexico is unique,\" says Rachelle Vega. The nurse practitioner moved from Austin to Santa Fe four years ago, in part, she says, to live in a more welcoming environment for her two adult trans children. \"There's this sense of live and let live that is pervasive.\" All this is happening in a state where the Catholic Church — which officially rejects abortion and transgenderism — is a powerful element of New Mexico's identity. \"We're a Catholic state. I'm Catholic,\" says Rep. Teresa Leger-Fernandez, the congresswoman from Northern New Mexico. \"But what we say here is that a health care decision is something you will make in consultation with your own faith, your ownfamiliaand your own doctor.\" Rep. Teresa Leger-Fernandez, who represents northern New Mexico, says that even in a Catholic state like theirs, health care decisions should be a private matter.John Burnett/for NPRhide caption State Sen. Antonio \"Moe\" Maestas is a veteran Democrat and an 11th-generation New Mexican. He likes to point out that Santa Fe was already a European settlement when the Mayflower pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. \"Individual rights are very important to New Mexicans, like, don't tell me how to live,\" Maestas says. \"You have to understand we were the farthest outpost of the Spanish Empire. You came to New Mexico to be left alone. So that sentiment resonates today.\" New Mexico's appeal is much broader than access to abortion. The state is renowned for cooler summers, cultural richness, high-desert vistas, vast stretches of public land, legal recreational pot and the aforementioned live-and-let-live attitude. While the arrival of so many politically committed newcomers may not be impressive numerically, they can make a difference in a lightly populated state like New Mexico, says Moe Maestas. \"No question. It's been a 20-year influx of white liberals moving to New Mexico because, why not?\" says Maestas. \"You're either lucky enough to be born here, like myself, or you're smart enough to move here.\" Locals complain about newly arrived Texans and Californians driving up real estate prices in Santa Fe and Taos. \"A lot of the people who move here quickly become involved in the community, they're wonderful volunteers in our non-profits,\" says Rep. Leger-Fernandez, \"but the impact on the cost of housing stock is something we need to address.\" Maestas says many Anglo liberals who move to New Mexico — the nation'smost heavily Hispanic state— are more progressive than the average Democrat. \"I'm very grateful to all the liberal elements who've moved to New Mexico,\" he says, \"but they have to understand Chicanos like myself, we became Democrats not because we're ideologically left, but because our parents were Democrats. And so there is those tensions within the local politics.\" His observation was borne out one recent Saturday in a visit to the Socorro Farmers Market, about an hour south of Albuquerque. \"My dad was a Democrat so I'm a Democrat, what can I say?\" says Loretta Taylor, who was selling homegrown apples and yard eggs. Though she's a diehard Democrat, Taylor is not happy about the governor using state funds to build abortion clinics. \"That is rubbing me very bad about New Mexico,\" she continues. \"One's already built in Las Cruces and she's planned one up north, right? No, I don't support the abortion part of the Democratic thing.\" The New Mexico legislature has been dominated by Democrats for most of the last 80 years. But how long the blue Land of Enchantment will stay that way is anybody's guess. Last November Kamala Harris easily carried New Mexico, but DonaldTrump has gained groundin the last three presidential elections, including in \"Little Texas.\" That's what they call the barren, southeastern corner of the state thatshares the oil-rich Permian Basinwith West Texas. Republican state Sen. Jim Townsend is from the city of Artesia, which celebrates wildcatters and roughnecks the way Santa Fe does Spaniards and Pueblo Indians. Does he wish his state were more like Texas? \"I really wish New Mexico would continue to be New Mexico,\" he replies, over a salad at the Wellhead restaurant. \"And it is not abortion centers. It is not taking away Second Amendment rights. It is not higher taxes.\" Townsend thinks that the Trump bump is not a fluke and that Democrats in state office are a lot more liberal than most of their constituents. \"There may be some progressives moving into Santa Fe. I had a buddy that used to call it 40 square miles surrounded by reality. And that's really what most people in New Mexico look at Santa Fe.\" The Texas/New Mexico political feud does not extend to economics. New Mexico relies on Texas skiers for tourism dollars, and on Texas companies and oilfield workers for much of its oil and gas production. Protesters (left to right) Celia Hulton, David Receconi, Richard Folks and Carol Norris demonstrate outside the New Mexico State Capitol in Santa Fe on April 9.

The ringleader is Carol Norris, a psychotherapist and longtime activist who says she fled Dallas decades ago. \"Rights are being eviscerated nationwide, but Texas is at the vanguard,\" Norris says, as she and some friends pack up their signs and bullhorns. If Texans want to relocate, as she did, she says, \"I absolutely understand that sentiment, as long as the Texans can honor and respect where they are.\" In other words, Norris adds, \"Don't let them Texas our New Mexico, dammit.\"",

    "title": "In Florida, Venezuelans worry about the potential loss of temporary protected status",
    "article_text": "By Greg Allen The U.S. Supreme Court order ending temporary protected status — TPS — worries Florida's Venezuelan community and what it might mean for possible deportations of 350,000 Venezuelans living in the United States.Raul Arboleda/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption DORAL, Fla. — Venezuelans living in the U.S. are shocked and devastated by aU.S. Supreme Court decisionhanded down Monday. It immediately strips Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. A legal fight over the Trump administration order ending TPS is now playing out in lower courts. But Venezuelans living in Florida are worried they may be deported back to a country mired in economic and political turmoil. Cecilia Gonzalez Herrera came to the U.S. from Venezuela with her parents eight years ago after her family faced political persecution from the administration of authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro. \"Both of my parents were very vocal against the Maduro regime. My dad was an attorney. My mom was a political science specialist.\" Gonzalez is one of the plaintiffs who challenged an order issued in January by the Trump administration ending TPS for about 350,000 Venezuelans. A U.S. District judge in San Francisco put theorder on holdwhile he heard the case and an appeals court agreed with that decision. TPS is a federal program that protects people from countries ravaged by war or natural disasters from deportation, and grants them work permits. It wascreated in the 1990s,to offer assistance to Salvadorans fleeing El Salvador's civil war. Currently, nearly a million people from 17 countries have TPS. According to theDepartment of Homeland Security, Venezuelans have received TPS due to \"the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.\" Maca Iglesias (R) joins with others to support a resolution in favor of reinstating temporary protected status for Venezuelans on February 13, 2025 in Miami, Fla. In early February, President Trump's administration revoked temporary protected status for around 350,000 Venezuelans who fled the country and immigrated to the United States.Joe Raedle/Getty Imageshide caption In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court intervened, stripping TPS immediately from a group of Venezuelans whose status expired in April. For those people, Adelys Ferro, executive director of theVenezuelan-American Caucussays, there may be immediate consequences. She says, \"Because of that, their work permits that are linked to their TPS are expired. Because of that, their driver's licenses are also expired, unless they have some other immigration benefit.\" Florida is home to the largest population of Venezuelans in the U.S., a group that has grown dramatically in recent decades as people fled the regimes of authoritarian presidents Hugo Chávez and Maduro. Gonzalez lives in central Florida and is part of a group of some 250,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protected status expires in September. Along with her parents, she applied for political asylum when she arrived in the U.S. If she loses TPS, she says she and many other Venezuelans will press their case for asylum. \"Which…means that we will be in this limbo,\" she says. \"We have been waiting eight years…waiting for an interview to be called. Which is a reality for many other Venezuelans who have also filed for political asylum.\" In its court filings, the Trump administration says TPS is no longer needed for Venezuelans because economic and political conditions have improved there. Ferro says that's simply not true. And she says atravel advisoryissued just last week by the U.S. State Department confirms it. She says, \"Secretary of State Marco Rubio, through his department, published a travel warning for U.S. citizens going to Venezuela and being in Venezuela and asked them to leave the country immediately.\" The advisory warns, \"Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure,\" adding, \"Do not travel to Venezuela for any reason.\" Trump carriedFlorida and Miami-Dade Countyin the November election with help from Venezuelan-Americans and other Hispanic voters. Gonzalez says there is some remorse among Venezuelan-Americans who voted for Trump, some of whom now see his decision to lift TPS as a betrayal. It's a reminder, she says, that elections matter. \"During the campaign,\" she says, \"Trump was very open about his plans for immigration, including Venezuelans. Some Venezuelans who supported him may now look surprised and be like, 'I didn't know he meant us,' or 'I didn't (think) he was going to come for us.' Well, he meant it. And he's doing it.\" Despite its impact on Florida's large Venezuelan community, reaction to the Supreme Court order and Trump's push to lift TPS has been muted among Republican elected officials in the state. Maria Elvira Salazar, a member of Congress from Miami who has positioned herself as an advocate of Venezuelans and a Trump supporter said she was\"deeply disappointed\" with the court's decision.

    "article_text": "Andrew Limbong Author Banu Mushtaq (left) and translator Deepa Bhasthi won this year's International Booker Prize, for the bookHeart Lamp.Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Imageshide caption The writer and advocate Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi have won this year's International Booker Prize for their bookHeart Lamp. The book is the first short story collection to win the prize, which awards the best fiction translated into English. \"Heart Lampis something genuinely new for English readers,\" wrote Max Porter, chair of the judges, in a statement announcing the win. \"It speaks of women's lives, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power and oppression.\" The book collects 12 short stories written by Mushtaq between 1990 and 2023. They tell the stories of girls and women in Muslim communities in southern India navigating caste and class. In one story, a woman is jealous of the relationship between her husband and his mother. In another, a woman deals with her son's painful circumcision. Mushtaq, a lawyer and advocate for women's rights, wrote in a statement that the stories were inspired by daily incidents that happened to women all around her. \"I witness [this] day to day, in my daily life, because so many women come to me. They have brought all the problems with them. They seek relief. But some of the women, they don't know why they are suffering.\" Heart Lampis the first prize winner to be translated from Kannada, a language spoken mostly in southern India.In an interview withScroll.in, translator Deepa Bhasthi explained that her approach to translation isn't to turn the language into \"proper\" English. Instead, \"the aim is to introduce the reader to new words, in this case, Kannada or to new thoughts that come loaded with the hum of another language. I call it translating with an accent,\" she said. \"So the English inHeart Lampis an English with a very deliberate Kannada hum to it.\" The judges for this year's prize had to whittle the list down from 154 books submitted by publishers. The prize comes with £50,000 (about $66,000), split equally between the author and translator. Other books that were shortlisted for the prize includeOn the Calculation of Volume I,  Small Boat, Under the Eye of the Big Bird, PerfectionandA Leopard-Skin Hat.

    "title": "Judge questions government lawyers over alleged deportations to South Sudan",
    "article_text": "By Ximena Bustillo , Scott Neuman A United States Air Force Boeing C-17 used for deportation flights is pictured at Biggs Army Airfield in Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas on February 13, 2025.Justin Hamel/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption A federal judge in Massachusetts questioned the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday about whether it had deported any migrants toSouth Sudan. The judge, Brian Murphy, had in April barred any deportations of migrants from the U.S. to countries other than their own, unless they're given sufficient time to contest their deportations, and a notice in their native language. But lawyers for at least one migrant, originally from Vietnam and known by the initials T.T.P in the court case, alleged he was on his way to South Sudan in Africa, the world's youngest country. The lawyers spoke during an emergency remote hearing Murphy called on Tuesday evening. They argued that their Vietnamese client was given less than 24 hours' notice of his removal, and had no ability to contest it in his native language. If those facts are true, \"that leaves me in the uncomfortable position that this person is on their way to South Sudan in violation to my court order,\" Murphy said during Tuesday's hearing. Murphy ordered DHS to keep in its custody anyone deported to South Sudan or any other a third country at least until the next hearing in the case, \"to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful,\" Murphy wrote in a brief order late Tuesday. \"While the Court leaves the practicalities of compliance to Defendants' discretion, Defendants have ensured, and the Court expects, that class members will be treated humanely,\" he added. Lawyers from DHS and the Department of Justice said during the hearing that the destination of the plane carrying T.T.P. was classified. It wasn't immediately clear who else was on the plane, their nationalities, or how DHS can keep people in custody after they're removed to another country. DHS didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment after the judge's order. South Sudan endured a long civil war that killed more than 50,000 people until a fragile peace halted the fighting in 2018. Even so, political instability persists and clashes between rebels and the government continue. Many,including the United Nations, worry about the prospect of the country tipping into civil war again. The Trump administration has been negotiating with other countries willing to take in people deported from the U.S. Earlier in May, the administration had sought tosend migrants to Libya, despite concerns from human rights groups about the violence there and the country's notorious human rights record. Murphy had earlier weighed in to specify that his April order barred deportations there, too. The issue of whether the U.S. still has custody over migrants deported to other countries has come up in other immigration court hearings, highlighting the limits of judicial authority. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, for example, was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador despite an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country because of credible fears he'd be persecuted there. But once he arrived in El Salvador, the Trump administration has asserted he's no longer under U.S. custody and it has no power to bring him back. Government lawyers at Tuesday's hearing said the people deported had final removal orders, and that the removals followed court orders. They also said some of those removed were accused of serious crimes. They also argued that if a person doesn't express fear of being deported to a particular country within 24 hours, then the government has the right to deport them there. Immigration attorneys had earlier on Tuesday asked Murphy to block an alleged Trump administration move to deport migrants to a third country, in this case South Sudan, and to immediately order the return of any migrants deported, according to a courtfiling. Migrants from Myanmar, Vietnam and other countries who do not have legal status to remain in the U.S. received notices on Monday that they would be deported, their lawyers said. When lawyers representing detainees sought to contact them on Tuesday, officials at the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas said that at least one person, originally from Myanmar, had already been removed to South Sudan, according to a declaration from their attorney. Government lawyers disputed that and said he was on his way to his home country. \"Plaintiffs ask this Court for an immediate order ordering the immediate return of any class members removed to South Sudan,\" according to documents filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. The attorneys also asked the government not to deport migrants to any country which isn't their country of origin unless they get proper written notice and enough time to contest their deportation. They argued that the Trump administration's actions to deport their clients also violate the judicial order barring deportations to such third countries without adequate due process. Third countries taking in migrants from the U.S. include El Salvador and Mexico. The Department of Homeland Security deported more than 200 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador earlier this year. It argued that some of the men were members of theTren de Aragua gangand could be deported using theAlien Enemies Act, an obscure wartime law that allows for quick removals. The Trump administration has also paid El Salvador $6 million to house them. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Maurilio left Guatemala over twenty years ago and is a pastor at an Evangelical Church, supporting his wife and five children.Lexi Para for NPRhide caption If you live out by the Little Manatee River, in the swamplands south of Tampa, Florida you probably know the name Maurilio Ambrocio. He's an Evangelical Pastor at a local church, he's lived here for 20 years. He also owns a landscaping business, tending the lawns and yards in the neighboring city of Fort Myers. And a few weeks ago, he was detained in President Trump's massive immigration crackdown, which Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has promised to fully partner with - in facthe's pledgedto make the statethe leadon the government's deportation campaign. The Trump administrationsaysthe Florida deportations are a preview of what is to come across the U.S: large scale operations inclose partnership with locallaw enforcement. News about Pastor Maurilio's detention spread fast. \"We were helping a neighbor and he said: 'did you hear?' \" says Ambrocio's next door neighbor, Greg Johns. \"Maurilio got deported.\" Churchgoers, the majority from Central America, walk into the Evangelical church that the Ambrosia Gonzalez family run, Sunday, May 11, 2025, in Tampa, Florida.Lexi Parra for NPRhide caption Children run through the field after church service lets out, Sunday, May 11, 2025, in Tampa, Florida.Lexi Parra for NPRhide caption Johns says he was beside himself. His eyes water as he recalls when Hurricane Milton hit last year. Ambrocio checked in on him immediately. \"Do you need propane?\" he asked. \"Do you need water? What do you need? That's the type of neighbor [he is]. This man is a part of the neighborhood.\" Like many in this small rural community, Johns voted for President Trump last November. In fact, he did so at Ambrocio's church, which doubles as a polling station.\"I did.\" He hesitates. \"Because I was not happy with the direction the country was going.\" He says he was hoping migrants in the country without papers and with criminal records would be targeted. But he says he never expected a pillar of the community like Maurilio Ambrocio would be taken away.  \"You're gonna take you know a community leader, a Pastor, a hard working man… What, did you need a number that day?\" That day was April 18th. Ambrocio had gone in for one of his mandatory check-ins with immigration agents: he has a form of legal protection called astay of removal. That means although he entered the U.S. unlawfully he is allowed to remain, as long as he meets with immigration officials at least once a year. They ask him if he's still employed and check that he hasn't committed any crimes. Every year for the last ten years or so, Ambrocio has attended these interviews and been approved. But on April 18th, he was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. NPR reached out to ICE to ask why Ambrocio was detained this time around. In an email a spokesperson responded that he was in the U.S. illegally, but did not answer questions or clarify: why now? Ashley Ambrocio Gonzalez cries as she speaks with her dad, Maurilio, who is in detention, in Tampa, Florida.

There is, however, another way to read that number: 415 people were arrested that weekend who had no existing criminal conviction or arrest. For the Ambrocio family, the Pastor's detention has been catastrophic. \"For my kids, it's like the world ended,\" Ambrocio's wife, Marleny says. They have five children, all U.S. citizens, ages 12 to 19. Marleny herself has been consumed by grief. As she fries an egg for breakfast, she says she dreams about her husband most every night.

And she works as a hostess at a restaurant. \"I try to get as many hours as I can in work you know, and get some extra money to buy groceries,\" she says during the walk.  She says she feels increasingly overwhelmed, but only allows herself to break down in private. \"In the car.

From around the room, women list husbands and sons who have recently been detainedby ICE or the Florida Highway Patrol, which Governor DeSantisrecently announcedwill be playing a greater role in enforcing immigration.Most were arrested on their way to work. A few of the men cry silently. Outside the rain is starting to come down, the air feels dense, and dewey flushed faces look anxiously toward the Pastor. He tells them he wrestled with what to say today. \"God\", he starts, \"God will often break your heart. But let me tell you something else: God never shows up late.\" M. prays next to a U.S. flag during church service, Sunday, May 11, 2025, in Tampa, Florida.

    "title": "Trump unveils ambitious and expensive plans for 'Golden Dome' missile defense",
    "article_text": "Geoff Brumfiel President Trump speaks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on May 20, 2025, announcing plans for the \"Golden Dome,\" a national ballistic and cruise missile defense system.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious plan to shield America from missile attack by buildingwhat he describes as a \"Golden Dome.\" \"Once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Trump's budget and timeline for the project are ambitious. He told reporters he hoped to have it done \"before the end of my term.\" The system would cost around $175 billion, the president said, with $25 billion to start construction in next year's budget. A key part of the Trump plan is to place both missile-sensing and missile-destroying satellites into orbit above the Earth. The constellation would likely involve thousands of small satellites capable of attacking a missile in the moments after it launches from its submarine or silo. Such a vast network of satellites would have been unthinkable just a few years ago, but it now seems at least theoretically within reach. Elon Musk's company SpaceX has been using low-cost rockets to launch a constellation of internet-transmitting satellites known as Starlink. SpaceX says the Starlink system currently has around 7,000 satellites in orbit, a scale that is comparable to most estimates of what a limited space-based missile defense capability would require. \"The overall Golden Dome effort is long overdue,\" says Tom Karako, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Karako concedes that space-based interception of incoming missiles is a \"wicked hard problem,\" but he says the reality is that the next large war will likely be fought partially above Earth's atmosphere. Given that reality, he thinks Golden Dome's capabilities will provide the U.S. with a robust defense that could also be used for anti-satellite warfare if needed. \"There's a need to contend with a whole lot of things that are in space and going through space,\" he says. Space-based missile defense has been a dream of politicians for decades. In 1983, Ronald Reaganannounced plansfor a system to intercept missiles from the then-Soviet Union. \"I know this is a formidable task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century,\" Reagan said at the time. \"It will take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts.\" In the end, the Soviet Union collapsed before anything approaching Reagan's vision could be realized, but missile defenses have progressed. U.S. Patriot missiles have worked for decades to intercept shorter-range missiles, and the U.S. now has several systems capable of intercepting medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. It also has a small number of interceptors capable of hitting ICBMs during the middle of their flight. That capability is aimed squarely at nuclear upstart North Korea. Other countries, namely Israel and Ukraine, have used missile defenses to protect themselves from attack in recent years. The U.S. military has ground- and sea-based missile defense systems. The Golden Dome would expand their reach into space.Leah Garton/U.S. Missile Defense Agencyhide caption But intercepting Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles in large numbers remains a far more difficult problem. ICBMs launch from deep inside enemy territory and scream back to Earth at hypersonic speeds, making them nearly impossible to hit at the end of their flight. They can also deploy decoys that can fool interceptors. The best time to hit them is as they're just launching from their silos, but doing so requires an extremely quick response by space-based interceptors. Thousands of interceptors must be launched in order to ensure that one is passing above a missile when it launches. Whether the technology has, in fact, arrived is far from clear. An orbital system would be complex, costly and ultimately vulnerable to counterattack, warns Laura Grego, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group skeptical of missile defense development. Grego says that a network like Golden Dome could be defeated by clustering launches to overwhelm the system, or by attacking the satellites themselves. The U.S. has recently accused Russia of studying how to place nuclear warheads in orbit. Such a warhead could knock out large sections of any Golden Dome system in space. And the threats facing the U.S. are more diverse than ever. Arecent reportfrom the Defense Intelligence Agency showed that Golden Dome would also have to contend with new and emerging threats like cruise missiles, hypersonic missiles that can skim the edge of space and weapons known as Fractional Orbital Bombardment Systems, which can launch, glide through part of an orbit around the Earth and then attack from any direction. The overall price of Golden Dome is far from certain. While the president says it could be done for $175 billion over three years, arecent estimatefrom the Congressional Budget Office put the cost at between $161-$542 billion over two decades. Separately, Sen. Tim Sheehy, R-Mont., who is heading a \"Golden Dome caucus,\" recently told a crowd that, \"It will likely cost in the trillions if and when Golden Dome is completed,\"according toSpace News. Given the potential high costs, Grego hopes that Congress will take a careful look before giving the Trump administration money to pursue the system. The road to missile defense \"is littered with programs that were started and abandoned after some number of years,\" Grego says. \"I would say ask the hard questions at the beginning, before you go down this road.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

There's been a political backlash in India after the Trump administration deported dozens of Indian migrants who were in the U.S. without legal status. This comes after the U.S. had announced 26 percent tariffs on India, which are currently suspended. Those events have changed Indian's perceptions of what they had thought was a cozy relationship with the U.S. and have cause a headache for the Indian prime minister.

    "title": "A stricter FDA policy for COVID vaccines could limit future access",
    "article_text": "Rob Stein The Food and Drug Administration is taking a new approach to evaluating and approving COVID vaccines.Deb Cohn-Orbach/Universal Images Group Editorial/Getty Imageshide caption The Food and Drug Administration is taking a new approach to COVID-19 vaccines that would prioritize immunizations for people at highest risk for serious complications from the disease but could make it harder for many other people to get the shots. The new strategy would continue the current vaccine approval process for people ages 65 and older and younger people with health problems that put them at high risk, according to anarticlepublished Tuesday inThe New England Journal of Medicine.But the FDA will now require vaccine manufacturers to conduct additional large studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines for children and younger healthy adults. \"We have launched down this multiyear campaign of booster after booster after booster and distrust of the American public. And we do not have gold-standard science to support this for average-risk, low-risk Americans,\" Dr.Vinay Prasad, the new director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said during a briefing to explain the new policy. The federal health officials say the steps will bring the U.S. in line with the approach that other high-income countries take towards the vaccines and are necessary to restore trust in the vaccines. For consumers the changes could mean that annual boosters wouldn't be automatically recommended for everyone. Instead, they would be aimed at older people and younger people with health risks. For other adults and children additional studies would have to show the benefits of vaccination outweigh risks. From 100 million to 200 million Americans would be eligible for COVID vaccines under the new approach, according to an estimate cited in the journal article. That's a change from the current approach, which recommends vaccines for almost everyone. \"The FDA's new Covid-19 philosophy represents a balance of regulatory flexibility and a commitment to gold-standard science,\" wrote Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr.Martin Makary, in the journal article. \"The FDA will approve vaccines for high-risk persons and, at the same time, demand robust, gold-standard data on persons at low risk.\" The move was welcomed by some independent public health experts. \"I find it refreshing to see the clarity in these guidelines,\" says Rick Bright, a former federal vaccine official. \"The FDA is signaling a major departure from the one-size-fits-all approach that's largely defined the U.S. vaccination policy until now. Not everyone is at equal risk and public policy should reflect that reality.\" But critics say the new requirements bypass the usual input from independent outside advisers and are unnecessary given the overwhelming evidence that COVID vaccines are safe and effective. They also worry the regulatory move sends the misleading message that the vaccines have not been adequately evaluated and that it would limit the availability of the vaccines because insurers would no longer pay for the shots for everyone. \"Secretary Kennedy had made it clear that he would never take vaccines away from anyone,\"Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said in an interview with NPR, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the FDA. \"This violates that in every way possible\" because if insurance companies won't pay for the vaccine many people simply won't be able to afford it.\" Others also note that the new approach doesn't take other issues into account, such as the fact that even younger, healthier people can get long COVID and that immunization can reduce that risk. \"That's very important because long COVID occurs in all age groups and even children and therefore I think COVID vaccines should be made available to all age groups,\" says Dr.Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Others at low risk themselves may want to get vaccinated to protect other people, such as older family members and those with weak immune systems, Hotez says. Many experts also argue that it would be unethical to perform a clinical study that involves giving some people a placebo instead of a vaccine, given that the virus can be a major threat to anyone and COVID vaccines have been shown to be effective. \"I don't think it's ethical, given that we have a vaccine that works, given that we know thatSARS-CoV2continues to circulate and cause hospitalizations and death, and there's no group that has no risk,\" says Dr.Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the University of Pennsylvania. But Prasad argues that more evidence is needed to prove that additional vaccinations would provide a benefit to most young, healthy people. \"The truth is that for many Americans we simply do not know the answer to whether or they should be getting a seventh or eighth or ninth or 10th COVID-19 booster,\" Prasad says. Later this week an independentFDA advisory committee will meet to discussthe composition of new COVID boosters for next fall and winter. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "How 3D printing is personalizing health care",
    "article_text": "Prosthetics are becoming increasing affordable and accessible thanks to 3D printers. Three-dimensional printing is transforming medical care, letting the health care field shift from mass-produced solutions to customized treatments tailored to each patient’s needs. For instance, researchers are developing 3D-printedprosthetic handsspecifically designed for children, made with lightweight materials and adaptable control systems. These continuing advancements in 3D-printed prosthetics demonstrate their increasing affordability and accessibility. Success stories like this one in personalized prosthetics highlight the benefits of 3D printing, in which a model of an object produced with computer-aided design software is transferred to a 3D printer and constructed layer by layer. We are abiomedical engineerand achemistwho work with 3D printing. We study how this rapidly evolving technology provides new options not just for prosthetics but for implants, surgical planning, drug manufacturing, and other health care needs. The ability of 3D printing to make precisely shaped objects in a wide range of materials has led to, for example, custom replacement joints and custom-dosage, multidrug pills. Three-dimensional printing in health care started in the 1980s with scientists using technologies such asstereolithographyto create prototypes layer by layer. Stereolithography uses a computer-controlled laser beam to solidify a liquid material into specific 3D shapes. The medical field quickly saw the potential of this technology to create implants and prosthetics designed specifically for each patient. One of the first applications was creating tissue scaffolds, which are structures that support cell growth. Researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital combined these scaffolds with patients’ own cells to buildreplacement bladders. The patients remained healthy for years after receiving their implants, demonstrating that 3D-printed structures could become durable body parts. As technology progressed, the focus shifted to bioprinting, which uses living cells to create working anatomical structures. In 2013, Organovo created the world’sfirst 3D-bioprinted liver tissue, opening up exciting possibilities for creating organs and tissues for transplantation. But while significant advances have been made in bioprinting, creating full, functional organs such as livers for transplantation remains experimental.Current researchfocuses on developing smaller, simpler tissues and refining bioprinting techniques to improve cell viability and functionality. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between laboratory success and clinical application, with the ultimate goal of providing viable organ replacements for patients in need. Three-dimensional printing already has revolutionized the creation of prosthetics. It allows prosthetics makers to produce affordable custom-made devices that fit the patient perfectly. They can tailor prosthetic hands and limbs to each individual and easily replace them as a child grows. Three-dimensionally printed implants, such as hip replacements andspine implants, offer a more precise fit, which can improve how well they integrate with the body. Traditional implants often come only in standard shapes and sizes. Some patients have received customtitanium facial implantsafter accidents. Others had portions of their skulls replaced with3D-printed implants. Additionally, 3D printing is making significant strides in dentistry. Companies such as Invisalign use 3D printing to createcustom-fit aligners for teeth straightening, demonstrating the ability to personalize dental care. Scientists are also exploring new materials for 3D printing, such asself-healing bioglassthat might replace damaged cartilage. Moreover, researchers are developing4D printing, which creates objects that can change shape over time, potentially leading to medical devices that can adapt to the body’s needs. For example, researchers are working on3D-printed stentsthat can respond to changes in blood flow. These stents are designed to expand or contract as needed, reducing the risk of blockage and improving long-term patient outcomes. Three-dimensionally printed anatomical models often help surgeons understand complex cases and improve surgical outcomes. These models, created from medical images such as X-rays and CT scans, allow surgeons to practice procedures before operating. For instance, a 3D-printed model of a child’s heart enables surgeons tosimulate complex surgeries. This approach can lead to shorter operating times, fewer complications, and lower costs. In the pharmaceutical industry, drugmakers can three-dimensionally printpersonalized drug dosages and delivery systems. The ability to precisely layer each component of a drug means that they can make medicines with the exact dose needed for each patient. The 3D-printedanti-epileptic drug Spritamwas approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2015 to deliver very high dosages of its active ingredient. Drug production systems that use 3D printing are finding homes outside pharmaceutical factories. The drugs potentially can be made and delivered bycommunity pharmacies. Hospitals are starting to use 3D printing to make medicine on-site, allowing for personalized treatment plans based on factors such as the patient’s age and health. However, it’s important to note that regulations for 3D-printed drugs are still being developed. One concern is that postprinting processing may affect the stability of drug ingredients. It’s also important to establish clear guidelines and decide where 3D printing should take place – whether in pharmacies, hospitals or even at home. Additionally, pharmacists will need rigorous training in these new systems. Despite the extraordinarily rapid progress overall in 3D printing for health care, major challenges and opportunities remain. Among them is the need to develop better ways to ensure the quality and safety of 3D-printed medical products. Affordability and accessibility also remain significant concerns. Long-term safety concerns regarding implant materials, such as potentialbiocompatibility issuesand the release of nanoparticles, require rigorous testing and validation. While 3D printing has the potential to reduce manufacturing costs, the initial investment in equipment and materials can be a barrier for many health care providers and patients, especially inunderserved communities. Furthermore, the lack ofstandardized workflowsand trained personnel can limit the widespread adoption of 3D printing in clinical settings, hindering access for those who could benefit most. On the bright side, artificial intelligence techniques that can effectively leverage vast amounts of highly detailed medical data are likely to prove critical in developing improved 3D-printed medical products. Specifically, AI algorithms can analyze patient-specific data to optimize the design and fabrication of 3D-printed implants and prosthetics. For instance, implant makers can useAI-driven image analysisto create highly accurate 3D models from CT scans and MRIs that they can use to design customized implants. Furthermore,machine learning algorithmscan predict the long-term performance and potential failure points of 3D-printed prosthetics, allowing prosthetics designers to optimize for improved durability and patient safety. Three-dimensional printing continues to break boundaries, including the boundary of the body itself. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have developed a technique that uses ultrasound to turn a liquid injected into the bodyinto a gel in 3D shapes. The method could be used one day for delivering drugs or replacing tissue. Overall, the field is moving quickly toward personalized treatment plans that are closely adapted to each patient’s unique needs and preferences, made possible by the precision and flexibility of 3D printing.

    "title": "Self-hosting is having a moment. Ethan Sholly knows why.",
    "article_text": "We interview Ethan Sholly of the selfh.st podcast/newsleter/directory. Self-hosting is having a moment, even if it's hard to define exactly what it is. It's a niche that goes beyond regular computing devices and networks but falls short of afull-on home lab. (Most home labs involve self-hosting, but not all self-hosting makes for a home lab.) It adds privacy, providesDRM-free alternatives, and reduces advertising. It's often touted as a way to get more out of your network-attached storage (NAS), but it's much more than just backup and media streaming. Is self-hosting just running services on your network for which most people rely on cloud companies? Broadly, yes. But take a look at theselfh.stsite/podcast/newsletter, ther/selfhosted subreddit, and all the GitHub project pages that link to one another, and you'll also find things that no cloud provider offers. Ethan Sholly, proprietor of the selfh.st site,newsletter, and occasionalpodcast, recently walked me through the current state of self-hosting, and he shared some of the findings from his surveys of those people doing all that small-scale server administration. Sholly works in finance, not tech, but he was a computer science minor with just enough knowledge to get Plex working on a desktop PC for his friends and family. \"I'd get a call or text: 'Can you turn your desktop on—it's movie night,'\" Sholly said. He gradually expanded to building his own tower server with 10 terabyte drives. Once he had his media-serving needs covered, the question inevitably became \"What else can I self-host?\" He dug in, wandered around, and found himself with tons of bookmarked GitHub repos and project pages. Sholly, a self-professed \"old-school RSS junkie,\" wanted one place to find the most commonly recommended apps and news about their changes and updates. It didn't exist, so he assembled it, coded it, andshared it. He also started writing about the scene in his newsletter, which has more personality and punch than you'd expect from someone in a largely open source, DIY-minded hobby. AfterPlex increased subscription pricesand changed its business model in March, Sholly wrote in his newsletter that, while there were valid concerns about privacy and future directions, it would be a good time to note something else: The majority of people don't donate to a single self-hosted project. Among roughly3,700 responses from the self-hosting community in 2024(nearly double the 2023 returns), 60 percent said \"no\" to the question \"Have you donated to a self-hosted project in the last year?\" This is despite Plex being in third place for respondents' favorite self-hosted application, behind Jellyfin and Home Assistant. Sholly's surveys provide many other insights into this sub-section of a niche community, and they likely give him a perspective on what people are interested in. He can give the developers of the self-hosted, AI-capable photo toolImmichagood-natured ribbingaboutshipping a new mascotbefore other much-requested features. He knows them, for one thing, and his readers should sense the gratefulness coming through. Given this familiarity, I had a few big questions for Sholly about the self-hosted scene. First up: What is the difference between \"home lab\" and \"self-hosting\"? Home labs, Sholly suggested, are much more focused on hardware and networking. Home labs are often something people do in their professional lives and bring home with them. Self-hosting is something you could technically do on a laptop you keep running in a closet, Sholly said. What gave rise to self-hosting's relative recent popularity? That led Sholly to a few answers, many of them directly relating to the corporate cloud services people typically use instead of self-hosting: Finally, there's the elephant in any self-hosting discussion: piracy. Sholly doesn't shy away from it as a driver of self-hosting (see the \"*arr Stack\" in the chart below, \"arr\" as in goofy pirate speak). \"Look at the questions asked by the newcomers to the scene on any subreddit or forum, look at what they're asking about: It's their 'media files' and how to handle them,\" he said. Sholly self-hosts a whole bunch of services, but not everything. \"It's not the end-goal, and we need to push on companies to fix the way they host their services,\" he said. \"Convenience shouldn't be an add-on; privacy shouldn't be a value-add. A lot of services people are self-hosting, they might gladly pay for if companies gave them more organization and control.\" Feel free to share your own journey with self-hosting, and how it's going, in the comments.

    "title": "Gemini 2.5 is leaving preview just in time for Google’s new $250 AI subscription",
    "article_text": "Gemini 2.5 is rolling out everywhere, and you can pay Google $250 per month for more of it. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—Google rolled outearly versions of Gemini 2.5earlier this year. Marking a significant improvement over the 2.0 branch. For the first time, Google's chatbot felt competitive with the likes of ChatGPT, but it's been \"experimental\" and later \"preview\" since then. At I/O 2025, Google announced general availability for Gemini 2.5, and these models will soon be integrated with Chrome. There's also a fancy new subscription plan to get the most from Google's AI. You probably won't like the pricing, though. Even though Gemini 2.5 was revealed a few months ago, the older 2.0 Flash has been the default model all this time. Now that 2.5 is finally ready, the 2.5 Flash model will be swapped in as the new default. This model has built-in simulated reasoning, so its outputs are much more reliable than 2.0 Flash. Google saysthe release version of 2.5 Flash is better at reasoning, coding, and multimodality, but it uses 20–30 percent fewer tokens than the preview version. This edition is now live in Vertex AI, AI Studio, and the Gemini app. It will be made the default model in early June. Likewise, the Pro model is shedding its preview title, and it's getting some new goodies to celebrate. Recent updates have solidified the model's lead on the LM Arena leaderboard, which still means something to Google despite therecent drama—yes, AI benchmarking drama is a thing now. It's also getting a capability called Deep Think, which lets the model consider multiple hypotheses for every query. This apparently makes it incredibly good at math and coding. Google plans to do a little more testing on this feature before making it widely available. Both 2.5 models have adjustable thinking budgets when used in Vertex AI and via the API, and now the models will also include summaries of the \"thinking\" process for each output. This makes a little progress toward making generative AI less overwhelmingly expensive to run. Gemini 2.5 Pro will also appear in some of Google's dev products, including Gemini Code Assist. Gemini Live, previously known as Project Astra, started to appear on mobile devices over the last few months. Initially, you needed to have a Gemini subscription or a Pixel phone to access Gemini Live, but now it's coming to all Android and iOS devices immediately. Google demoed a future \"agentic\" capability in the Gemini app that can actually control your phone, search the web for files, open apps, and make calls. It's perhaps a little aspirational, just like the Astra demo from last year. The version of Gemini Live we got wasn't as good, but as a glimpse of the future, it was impressive. There are also some developments in Chrome, and you guessed it, it's getting Gemini. It's not dissimilar from what you get in Edge with Copilot. There's a little Gemini icon in the corner of the browser, which you can click to access Google's chatbot. You can ask it about the pages you're browsing, have it summarize those pages, and ask follow-up questions. Since launching Gemini, Google has only had a single $20 monthly plan for AI features. That plan granted you access to the Pro models and early versions of Google's upcoming AI. At I/O, Google is catching up to AI firms like OpenAI, which have offered sky-high AI plans. Google's newGoogle AI Ultra planwill cost $250 per month, more than the $200 plan for ChatGPT Pro. So what does your $250 get you every month? You'll get all the models included with the basic plan with much higher usage limits. If you're using video and image generation, for instance, you won't bump against any limits. Plus, Ultra comes with the newest and most expensive models. For example, Ultra subs will get immediate access to Gemini in Chrome, as well as a new agentic model capable of computer use in the Gemini API (Project Mariner). That's probably still not worth it for most Gemini users, but Google is offering a deal right now. Ultra subscribers will get a 50 percent discount for the first three months, but $125 is still a tough sell for AI. It's available in the US today and will come to other regions soon. Google previewed what could be an important advancement in generative AI for the future. Most of the text and code-based outputs you've seen are generated from beginning to end, token by token. Its large language model (LLM) Diffusion works a bit differently for image generation, but Google is now experimenting with Gemini Diffusion. Diffusion models create images by starting with random noise and then denoise it to create what you asked for. Gemini Diffusion works similarly,generating entire blocks of tokensat the same time. The model can therefore work much faster, and it can check its work as it goes to make the final output more accurate than comparable LLMs. Google says Gemini Diffusion is 2.5 times faster than Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, which is its fastest standard model, while also producing much better results. Google claimsGemini Diffusion is capable of previously unheard-of accuracy in complex math and coding. However, it's not being released right away like many of the other I/O Gemini features. Google DeepMind is accepting applications to test it, but it may be a while before the model exits the experimental stage. Even though I/O was wall-to-wall Gemini, Google still has much, much more AI in store. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump’s trade war risks splintering the Internet, experts warn",
    "article_text": "Trump urged to rethink trade policy to block attacks on digital services. In sparking his global trade war, Donald Trump seems to have maintained a glaring blind spot when it comes to protecting one of America's greatest trade advantages: the export of digital services. Experts have warned that the consequences for Silicon Valley could be far-reaching. In areportreleased Tuesday, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, Allianz Trade, shared results of a survey of 4,500 firms worldwide, designed \"to capture the impact of the escalation of trade tensions.\" Amid other key findings, the group warned that the US's fixation on the country's trillion-dollar goods deficit risks rocking \"the fastest-growing segment of global trade,\" America's \"invisible exports\" of financial and digital services. Tracking these exports is challenging, as many services are provided through foreign affiliates, the report noted, but recent estimates \"reveal a large digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion for the US, spread across categories like digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services.\" According to Allianz Trade, \"the scale of this hidden trade is immense.\" These \"hidden\" exports have \"far\" outpaced \"the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, their report said, but because of how these services are delivered, \"this trade goes uncounted in traditional statistics.\" If Trump doesn't \"rethink trade policy and narratives\" soon to start tracking all this trade more closely, he risks undermining this trade advantage—which Allianz Trade noted \"is underpinned by America’s innovative firms and massive data infrastructure\"—at a time when he's in trade talks with most of the world and could be leveraging that advantage. \"US digital exports now represent a significant share of world trade (about 3.6 percent of all global trade, and growing fast),\" Allianz Trade reported. \"These 'invisible' exports boost US trade revenues without filling any container ships, underscoring a new reality: routers and data centers are as strategically important as ports and factories in sustaining US leadership.\" Without a pivot, Trump'scurrent trade tactics—requiring all countries impacted by reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal before July 8, while acknowledging that there won't be time to meet with every country—could even threaten US dominance as \"the world’s digital content and tech services hub,\" Allianz Trade suggested. US trade partners are already \"looking into tariffs or taxes on digital services as a retaliation tool that could cause pain to the US,\" the report warned. And other experts agreed that if such countermeasures become permanent fixtures in global trade, it could significantly hurt the US tech industry, perhaps even splintering the Internet, as companies are forced to customize services according to where different users are located. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and executive director of the DiploFoundation who has monitored the Internet's impact on global trade for more than 20 years,warnedin an April blog that this could have a \"more profound impact\" on the US than other retaliatory measures. \"If the escalation of trade tensions moves into the digital realm, it could have far-reaching consequences for Silicon Valley giants and the digital economy worldwide,\" Kurbalija wrote. The threat of retaliatory tariffs hitting the digital services industry has loomed large since European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenconfirmed to the Financial Timeslast month that she was proactively developing such countermeasures if Trump's trade talks with the European Union failed. Those measures could potentially include \"a tax on digital advertising revenues that would hit tech groups such as Amazon, Google and Facebook,\" the FT reported. But perhaps most alarmingly, they may also include \"tariffs on the services trade between the US and the EU.\" Unlike the digital sales tax—which could be imposed differently by EU member states to significantly hurt tech giants' ad revenues in various regions—the tariff would be applied across a single EU-wide market. Kurbalija suggested that the problem goes beyond the EU. Trump's aggressive tariffs on goods have handed \"the EU and others both moral and tactical pretexts to fast-track digital taxes\" as countermeasures, Kurbalija wrote. He's also given foreign governments an appealing narrative of \"reclaiming revenue from foreign tech 'free riders,'\" Kurbalija wrote, while perhaps accelerating the broader \"use of digital service taxes as a diplomatic tool\" to \"pressure the US into balanced negotiations.\" For tech companies, the taxes risk escalating trade tensions, potentially perpetuating the atmosphere of uncertainty that, Allianz Trade reported, has US firms scrambling to secure reliable, affordable supply chains. In anop-eddiscussing potential harms to US tech firms and startups, the CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, Neal K. Shah, warned that \"tariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.\" At the furthest extreme, the \"digital trade war threatens to splinter the Internet’s integrated infrastructure,\" Kurbalija warned, fragmenting the Internet in a way that could \"undermine decades of gradual development of technological interconnectedness.\" Imagine, Shah suggested, that on top of increased hardware costs, tech companies also incurred costs of providing services for \"parallel digital universes with incompatible standards.\" Users traveling to different locations might find that platforms have \"different features, prices, and capabilities,\" he said. \"For startups and industry innovators,\" Shah predicted, \"fragmentation means higher compliance costs, reduced market access, and slower growth.\" Such a world also risks ending \"the era of globally scalable digital platforms,\" decreasing investor interest in tech, and reducing the global GDP \"by up to 5 percent over the next decade as digital trade barriers multiply,\" Shah said. And if digital services tariffs become a permanent fixture of global trade, Shah suggested that it could, in the long term, undermine American tech dominance, including in fields critical to national security, like artificial intelligence. \"Trump’s tariffs may dominate today’s headlines, but the silent war over digital services will define tomorrow’s economy,\" Kurbalija wrote. Trump has responded to threats of digital services taxes with threats of more tariffs, arguing that \"only America should be allowed to tax American firms,\" Reutersreported. In February, Trump issued amemocalling for research into the best responsive measures to counter threats of digital service taxes, including threatening more tariffs. It's worth asking if Trump's tactics are workingthe way he intends, if the US plans to keep up the outdated trade strategy. Allianz Trade's survey found that many US firms—rather than moving their operations into the US, as Trump has demanded—are instead rerouting supply chains through \"emerging trade hubs\" like Southeast Asia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Latin American countries where tariff rates are currently lower. Likely even more frustrating to Trump, however, is a finding that 50 percent of US firms surveyed confirmed they are considering increasing investments in China, in response to the US abruptly shifting tariffs tactics. Only 8 percent said they’re considering decreasing Chinese investments. It's unclear if tech companies will be adequately shielded by the US threat of tariffs as the potential default countermeasure to digital services taxes or tariffs. Perhaps Trump's memo will surface more novel tactics that interest the administration. But Allianz Trade suggested that Trump may be stuck in the past with a trade strategy focused too much on goods at a time when the tech industry needs more modern tactics to keep America's edge in global markets. \"An economy adept at producing globally demanded services—from cloud software to financial engineering—is less reliant on physical supply chains and less vulnerable to commodity swings,\" Allianz Trade reported. \"The US edge in digital and financial services is not just an anecdote in the trade ledger; it has become a structural advantage.\" Trump's trade math so far has been criticized by economists as a\"trillion-dollar tariff disappointment\"that at times imposed baffling tariff rates thatappeared to be generated by chatbots. But part of the trade math moving forward will also likely be deducing if nations threatening digital services taxes or tariffs can actually follow through on those threats. Bertin Martens, a senior fellow at a European economics-focused think tank called Bruegel,broke downin April how practical it could be for the EU to attack digital platforms, noting, \"there is a question of whether such retaliation is even feasible.\" The EU could possibly use a law known as the Anti-Coercion Regulation—which grants officials authority to lob countermeasures when facing \"foreign economic coercion\"—to impose digital services tariffs. But \"platforms with substantive presence in the EU cannot be the target of trade measures\" under that law, Martens noted. That could create a carveout for the biggest tech giants who have operations in the EU, Martens suggested, but only if those operations are deemed \"substantive,\" a term that the law does not clearly define. To make that determination, officials would need \"detailed information on the locations or nationalities\" of all the users that platforms bring together, including buyers, sellers, advertisers and other parties, Martens said. This makes digital services platforms \"particularly difficult to target,\" he suggested. And lawmakers could risk backlash if \"any arbitrary decision to invoke\" the law risks \"imposing a tax on EU users without retaliatory effect on the US.\" While tech companies will have to wait for the trade war to play out—likely planning to increase prices, Allianz Trade found, rather than bear the brunt of new costs—Shah suggested that there could be one clear winner if Trump doesn't reprioritize shielding digital services exports in the way that experts recommend. \"A surprising potential consequence of digital tariffs could be the accelerated development and adoption of open-source technologies,\" Shah wrote. \"As proprietary digital products and services become subject to cross-border tariffs, open-source alternatives—which can be freely shared, modified, and distributed—may gain significant advantages.\" If costs get too high, Shah suggested that even tech giants might \"increasingly turn to open-source solutions that can be locally deployed without triggering tariff thresholds.\" Such a shift could potentially \"profoundly affect the competitive landscape in areas like cloud infrastructure, AI frameworks, and enterprise software,\" Shah wrote. In that imagined future where open source alternatives rule the world, Shah said that targeting digital imports by tariff systems could become ineffective, \"inadvertently driving adoption toward open-source alternatives that generate less economic leverage.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "FCC chairman celebrates court loss in case over Biden-era diversity rule",
    "article_text": "5th Circuit: FCC can't force broadcasters to report race and gender of employees. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr celebrated an FCC court loss yesterday after a ruling that struck down Biden-era diversity reporting requirements that Carr voted against while Democrats were in charge. \"An appellate court just struck down the Biden FCC's 2024 decision to force broadcasters to post race and gender scorecards,\" Carrwrote. \"As I said in my dissent back then, the FCC's 2024 decision was an unlawful effort to pressure businesses into discriminating based on race & gender.\" The FCC mandate was challenged in court by National Religious Broadcasters, a group for Christian TV and radio broadcasters and the American Family Association. They sued in the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, where a three-judge panel yesterdayruledunanimously against the FCC. The FCC order struck down by the court required broadcasters to file an annual form with race, ethnicity, and gender data for employees within specified job categories. \"The Federal Communications Commission issued an order requiring most television and radio broadcasters to compile employment-demographics data and to disclose the data to the FCC, which the agency will then post on its website on a broadcaster-identifiable basis,\" the 5th Circuit court said. The FCC's February 2024orderrevived a data-collection requirement that was previously enforced from 1970 to 2001. The FCCsuspendedthe data collection in 2001 after court rulings limiting how the commission could use the data, though the data collection itself had not been found to be unconstitutional. Led by then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the FCC last year said that reviving the data collection would serve the public interest by helping the agency \"report on and analyze employment trends in the broadcast sector and also to compare trends across other sectors regulated by the Commission.\" But the FCC's public-interest authority isn't enough to justify the rule, the 5th Circuit judges found. \"The FCC undoubtedly has broad authority to act in the public interest,\" the ruling said. \"That authority, however, must be linked 'to a distinct grant of authority' contained in its statutes. The FCC has not shown that it is authorized to require broadcasters to file employment-demographics data or to analyze industry employment trends, so it cannot fall back on 'public interest' to fill the gap.\" The Biden-era FCC also cited Section 334(a) of the Communications Act, which was approved by Congress in 1992 and said that \"except as specifically provided in this section, the Commission shall not revise the regulations concerning equal employment opportunity as in effect on September 1, 1992 as such regulations apply to television broadcast station licensees and permittees; or the forms used by such licensees and permittees to report pertinent employment data to the Commission.\" The 5th Circuit disagreed that this section gives the FCC authority to resume the data collection. \"While § 334(a) explicitly mentions the collection of employment data, it is not an affirmative grant of authority; indeed, it is a restriction on the FCC's power,\" and does not \"grant any authority to the FCC to collect this data,\" the court said. Additionally, \"to the extent that Congress ratified anything, it expressly tethered the FCC's authority to collect Form 395-B to the equal employment opportunity regulations that are no longer in effect,\" the ruling said. The Biden-era FCC order said that \"workforce diversity is critical to the ability of broadcast stations both to compete with one another and to effectively serve local communities across the country,\" but that \"the lack of industry-wide employment data over the last 22 years makes it difficult to measure the extent of any such progress\" toward increasing diversity in the broadcasting industry workforce. \"Our ability to collect and access Form 395-B data is critical because it will allow for analysis and understanding of the broadcast industry workforce, as well as the preparation of reports to Congress about the same,\" the FCC argued. The Department of Justiceinformed the courtin January that the US has a different position on the data collection now. The Trump DOJ said that \"much of the Federal Communications Commission's data collection through Form 395-B is mandated by statute,\" but that other parts of the data collection are not statutorily required and are inconsistent with Trump's executive orders. The Carr-led FCC alsofiled a court briefsaying it no longer defends a portion of the order that \"updated Form 395-B to include the collection of non-binary gender information.\" Carrendedthe FCC's promotion of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives immediately after Trump promoted him to the chairmanship. Carr has pushed companies regulated by the FCC to do the same, resulting in Verizon and T-Mobiledropping DEI programsin order to secure approval for mergers that required the FCC's sign-off.

    "title": "Under RFK Jr., COVID shots will only be available to people 65+, high-risk groups",
    "article_text": "FDA will require big, pricy trials for approvals for healthy kids and adults <65. Under the control of anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Food and Drug Administration is unilaterally terminating universal access to seasonal COVID-19 vaccines; instead, only people who are age 65 years and older and people with underlying conditions that put them at risk of severe COVID-19 will have access to seasonal boosters moving forward. The move was laid out ina commentary article published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, written by Trump administration FDA Commissioner Martin Makary and the agency's new top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad. The article lays out a new framework for approving seasonal COVID-19 vaccines, as well as a rationale for the change—which was made without input from independent advisory committees for the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Normally, the FDA's VRBPAC (Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee) and the CDC's ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) would publicly review, evaluate, and discuss vaccine approvals and recommendations. Typically, the FDA's scope focuses on licensure decisions, made with strong influence from VRBPAC, while the CDC's ACIP is principally responsible for influencing the CDC's more nuanced recommendations on usage, such as for specific age or risk groups. These recommendations shape clinical practice and, importantly, health insurance coverage. Makary and Prasad appear to have foregone those norms, even thoughVRBPAC is set to meet this Thursday to discuss COVID-19 vaccinesfor the upcoming season. In the commentary, Markary and Prasad puzzlingly argue that the previous universal access to COVID-19 vaccines was patronizing to Americans. They describe the country's approach to COVID boosters as a \"one-size-fits-all\" and write that \"the US policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view.\" Previously, the seasonally updated vaccines were available to anyone age 6 months and up. Further, people age 65 and older and those at high risk were able to get two or more shots, based on their risk. So, while Makary and Prasad ostensibly reject the view of Americans as being too unsophisticated to understand risk-based usage, the pair are installing restrictions to force their own idea of risk-based usage. Even more puzzlingly, in an April meeting of ACIP, the expert advisors expressed clear support for shifting from universal recommendations for COVID-19 boosters to recommendations based on risk. Specifically, advisors were supportive of urging boosters for people age 65 and older and people who are at risk of severe COVID-19—the same restrictions that Makary and Prasad are forcing. The two regulators do not mention this in their NEJM commentary. ACIP would also likely recommend a primary series of seasonally matched COVID-19 vaccines for very young children who have not been previously exposed to the virus or vaccinated. ACIP will meet again in June, but without a permissive license from the FDA, ACIP's recommendations for risk-based usage of this season's COVID-19 shots are virtually irrelevant. And they cannot recommend usage in groups that the FDA licensure does not cover. It's unclear if a primary series for young children will be available and, if so, how that will be handled moving forward. Under Makary and Prasad's new framework, seasonally updated COVID-19 vaccines can continue to be approved annually using only immunology studies—but the approvals will only be for people age 65 and over and people who are at high risk. These immunology studies look at antibody responses to boosters, which offer a shorthand for efficacy in updated vaccines that have already been through rigorous safety and efficacy trials. This is how seasonal flu shots are approved each year and how COVID boosters have been approved for all people age 6 months and up—until now. Moving forward, if a vaccine maker wants to have their COVID-19 vaccine also approved for use in healthy children and healthy adults under age 65, they will have to conduct large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. These may need to include tens of thousands of participants, especially with high levels of immunity in the population now. These trials can easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and they can take many months to complete. The requirement for such trials will make it difficult, if not impossible, for drug makers to conduct them each year and within a timeframe that will allow for seasonal shots to complete the trial, get regulatory approval, and be produced at scale in time for the start of the respiratory virus season. Makary and Prasad did not provide any data analysis or evidence-based reasoning for why additional trials would be needed to continue seasonal approvals. In fact, the commentary had a total of only eight references, including an opinion piece Makary published in Newsweek and a New York Times article. \"We simply don’t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had COVID-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\" they argue in their commentary. Their new framework does not make any mention of what will happen if a more dangerous SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges. It also made no mention of vaccine usage in people who are in close contact with high-risk groups, such as ICU nurses or family members of immunocompromised people. Another lingering question from the framework is how easy it will be for people deemed at high risk to get access to seasonal shots. Makary and Prasad lay out a long list of conditions that would put people at risk of severe COVID-19 and therefore make them eligible for a seasonal booster. The list includes: obesity; asthma; lung diseases; HIV; diabetes; pregnancy; gestational diabetes; heart conditions; use of corticosteroids; dementia; physical inactivity; mental health conditions, including depression; and smoking, current or former. The FDA leaders estimate that between 100 million and 200 million Americans will fit into the category of being at high risk. It's unclear what such a large group of Americans will need to do to establish eligibility every year. In all, the FDA's move to restrict and hinder access to seasonal COVID-19 vaccines is in line with Kennedy's influential anti-vaccine advocacy work. In 2021, prior to taking the role of the country's top health official, Kennedy and the anti-vaccine organization he founded, Children's Health Defense,petitioned the FDA to revoke authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from issuing any approvals. Ironically, Makary and Prasad blame the country's COVID-19 policies for helping to erode Americans' trust in vaccines broadly. \"There may even be a ripple effect: public trust in vaccination in general has declined, resulting in a reluctance to vaccinate that is affecting even vital immunization programs such as that for measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccination, which has been clearly established as safe and highly effective,\" the two write, including the most full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccine the Trump administration has issued yet. Kennedy continues to spread misinformation about the vaccine, including the false and debunked idea that it causes autism. \"Against this context, the Food and Drug Administration seeks to provide guidance and foster evidence generation,\" Makary and Prasad write.

    "title": "Windows 11’s most important new feature is post-quantum cryptography. Here’s why.",
    "article_text": "For the first time, new quantum-safe algorithms can be invoked using standard Windows APIs. Microsoft is updating Windows 11 with a set of new encryption algorithms that can withstand future attacks from quantum computers in a move aimed at jump-starting what’s likely to be the most formidable and important technology transition in modern history. Computers that are based on the physics of quantum mechanics don’t yet exist outside of sophisticated labs, but it’s well-established science that they eventually will. Instead of processing data in the binary state of zeros and ones, quantum computers run on qubits, which encompass myriad states all at once. This new capability promises to bring about new discoveries of unprecedented scale in a host of fields, including metallurgy, chemistry, drug discovery, and financial modeling. One of the most disruptive changes quantum computing will bring is the breaking of some of the most common forms of encryption, specifically, the RSA cryptosystem and those based on elliptic curves. These systems are the workhorses that banks, governments, and online services around the world have relied on for more than four decades to keep their most sensitive data confidential. RSA and elliptic curve encryption keys securing web connections would require millions of years to be cracked using today’s computers. A quantum computer could crack the same keys in a matter of hours or minutes. At Microsoft’s BUILD 2025 conference on Monday, the companyannouncedthe availability of quantum-resistant algorithms toSymCrypt, the core cryptographic code library in Windows. The updated library is available inBuild 27852 and higherversions of Windows 11. Additionally, Microsoft has updatedSymCrypt-OpenSSL, its open source project that allows the widely used OpenSSL library to use SymCrypt for cryptographic operations. Monday’s update bundles new post-quantum computing algorithms selected by the US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in itsyearslong driveto find replacements for RSA and elliptic-curve cryptosystems. The new algorithms are the latest to be added to the list ofFIPS, a NIST-endorsed list of standards for ensuring guaranteed levels of security and interoperability. Inclusion in Windows allows developers to invoke the new PQC algorithms using a set of programming interfaces Microsoft calls Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). “Making the new FIPS-standard PQC algorithms available to developers in Insider builds via the standard CNG APIs is a good first step by Windows and exactly what third-party developers writing Windows apps need in order to start migrating and testing their own code to PQC,” Brian LaMacchia, a cryptography engineer who oversaw Microsoft's post-quantum transition from 2015 to 2022 and now works at Farcaster Consulting Group, wrote in an email. He added that Microsoft had revealed previously that it had begun work integrating the algorithms into SymCrypt, “but this is the first announcement about that work showing up in a beta ('Insider') build of Windows.” The new algorithms are known as ML-KEM and ML-DSA, short for \"Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism” and \"Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm,” respectively. ML-KEM provides a means for securely transmitting encryption key material, and ML-DSA allows for the creation of digital signatures. These algorithms were previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium but took on their new names once they progressed far enough through NIST’s PQC program. The strength of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography is based on mathematical problems that are simple to solve in one direction and nearly impossible to solve in the other. RSA, for example, relies on the difficulty of factoring extremely large numbers, while elliptic curve cryptography rests on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem. For decades now, cryptographers have known that the same problems are trivial to solve with a sufficiently large quantum computer. The mathematical problems underpinning PQC algorithms are different and, so far, have not been shown to be easily broken using either classical or quantum computing. LaMacchia warns, however, that the same math that makes ML-KEM and ML-DSA quantum resistant also causes the encryption keys they derive to be three or more times bigger than their RSA and elliptic curve counterparts. On top of that, these larger keys must also be accompanied by RSA and the elliptic-curve keys they are meant to replace, since for the foreseeable future NIST is advising a hybrid approach that uses both the newer and older cryptosystems as a hedge in case the newer ones have vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered. Estimates for the fall of RSA and Elliptic Curve cryptography vary wildly, with some experts saying it's still two or more decades away. Other experts warn it will happen as soon as by 2035. In either case, the scale, cost, and difficulty of transitioning away from these now-ubiquitous algorithms will be unprecedented. Among the challenges: the significantly larger key sizes have the potential to introduce all sorts of errors into software, which could have catastrophic consequences if not discovered early in the revision process. “One of the things I warned folks inside Microsoft very early on was you better start testing to make sure that if I triple the size of the keys that you're currently using that that actually flows through the software stack and that a developer hasn’t put a fixed allocation somewhere that’s going to block you,” he said in an interview. “You always find stuff like that.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "But AI-generated content made without the SynthID toolkit remains difficult to detect. Last year, Googleopen-sourced its SynthID AI watermarking system, allowing other developers access to a toolkit for imperceptibly marking content as AI-generated. Now, Google is rolling out a web-based portal to let people easily test if a piece of media has been watermarked with SynthID. After uploading a piece of media to the SynthID Detector, users will get back results that \"highlight which parts of the content are more likely to have been watermarked,\" Google said. That watermarked, AI-generated content should remain detectable by the portal \"even when the content is shared or undergoes a range of transformations,\" the company said. The detector will be available to beta testers starting today, and Google says journalists, media professionals, and researchers canapply for a waitlistto get access themselves. To start, users will be able to upload images and audio to the portal for verification, but Google says video and text detection will be added in the coming weeks. Detectors that claim to identify AI-generated content on an \"ad hoc\" basis haveprovento beextremely unreliableinreal-world scenarios, making this kind of watermarking an important tool inthe battle to detect deepfakesand other content made with the help of AI.

That includes content generated by Google models such asGemini,Imagen,Lyria, andVeo, as well as videos generated byNvidia's Cosmos World Foundation Model. Of course, that still leaves hundreds of billions of pieces of AI-generated content that are not watermarked with SynthID and therefore will not be detectable using Google's new portal.

    "title": "Trump admin lifts hold on offshore wind farm, doesn’t explain why",
    "article_text": "Reasons for the hold were never backed up, and nobody's explaining why it ended. On Monday, the developer of a large offshore wind farm being built off the coast of New York announced that the federal government had lifted a hold it hadplaced on the projectroughly a month ago. The entire process has been shrouded in mystery. The government never fully enunciated its justification for the hold and hasn't yet commented on the fact that it had been lifted, although there is some hint that it was coupled to a reconsideration of a cancelled natural gas pipeline. Empire Windis a large project being built off the southeast shore of Long Island by Equinor, a Norwegian energy company. The first of two phases, Empire Wind 1, will have an 800 MW capacity and has already received permitting and environmental approval. Equinor had started construction of the foundations for the towers that would hold the wind turbines and onshore facilities that would support this and future offshore projects. All that changed in mid-April when Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum announced via a social media post that the approval for Empire Wind had been rushed and his department would be reviewing it. AFox News articlepublished a few days later suggests that a review by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \"found the Empire Wind approval process relied on rushed, outdated, and incomplete scientific and environmental analysis.\" But nobody else has indicated that any such report exists, despite requests from the press. Meanwhile, Equinor was given no indication of how long the project would be on hold, even as it took on large expenses due to its idled workers and equipment. On Monday, however, the company announced that thehold had been liftedand construction would resume. But as with the hold itself, the reasons for its end remain mysterious. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Managementpage for the projectwas only updated witha new letteron Tuesday. That letter indicates a review of its approval is ongoing, but construction can resume during the review. The Department of the Interior has not addressed the change and has not responded to a request for comment.A postby Interior Secretary Burgum doesn't mention Empire Wind but does suggest the governor of New York will approve a pipeline: \"I am encouraged by Governor Hochul’s comments about her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity.\" That suggests there was a deal that allowed Empire Wind to resume construction in return for a pipeline for fossil fuels. The New York Timessuggeststhat this is a reference to the proposed Constitution Pipeline, which was planned to move natural gas from Pennsylvania to eastern New York but was cancelled in 2020 due to state opposition. However, Governor Kathy Hochul has not commented about a willingness to move forward with any pipelines. Instead,Hochul's statementon Empire Wind is very vague, saying that she \"reaffirmed that New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.\" So while it's good news that construction on Empire Wind has restarted, the whole process has been problematic, driven by apparently arbitrary decisions that the government has refused to justify.

    "title": "Adobe to automatically move subscribers to pricier, AI-focused tier in June",
    "article_text": "Monthly fees for multi-app subscribers to rise by up to 16.7 percent. Subscribers to Adobe’s multi-app subscription plan, Creative Cloud All Apps, will be charged more starting on June 17 to accommodate for new generative AI features. Adobe’s announcement, spotted byMakeUseOf,says the change will affect North American subscribers to the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, which Adobe is renaming Creative Cloud Pro. Starting on June 17, Adobe will automatically renew Creative Cloud All Apps subscribers into the Creative Cloud Pro subscription, which will be $70 per month for individuals who commit to an annual plan, up from $60 for Creative Cloud All Apps. Annual plans for students and teachers plans are moving from $35/month to $40/month, and annual teams pricing will go from $90/month to $100/month. Monthly (non-annual) subscriptions are also increasing, from $90 to $105. Further, in an apparent attempt to push generative AI users to more expensive subscriptions, as of June 17, Adobe will give new single-app subscribers just 25 generative AI credits instead of the current 500. Subscribers can opt to move down to a new multi-app plan called Creative Cloud Standard, which is $55/month for annual subscribers and $82.49/month for monthly subscribers. However, this tier limits access to mobile and web app features, and subscribers can't use premium generative AI features. Adobe's announcement explained the higher prices by saying that the subscription tier “includes all the core applications and new AI capabilities that power the way people create today, and its price reflects that innovation, as well as our ongoing commitment to deliver the future of creative tools.” Like today's Creative Cloud All Apps plan, Creative Cloud Pro will include Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Lightroom, and access to Adobe’s web and mobile apps. AI features include unlimited usage of image and vector features in Adobe apps, including Generative Fill in Photoshop, Generative Remove in Lightroom, Generative Shape Fill in Illustrator, and 4K video generation with Generative Extend in Premiere Pro. Subscribers are also paying for access toAdobe’s FireflyAI image synthesis generator app, which includes theFirefly Video Modelfor text-to-video generation. Firefly also has a public beta called Firefly Boards for making collaborative moodboards using Firefly or other AI models that Adobe has partnered with, including OpenAI and Google’s Imagen 3 and Veo 2. Creative Cloud Pro subscriptions include 4,000 monthly generative credits, whichallow usersto make up to 40 five-second videos or translate as many as 14 minutes of video and audio. By automatically forcing customers onto a more expensive plan, Adobe risks upsetting, disrupting, and confusing customers, even though the company is emailing customers about the change. The changes also give credence to fears that many customers had when Adobe started incorporating generative AI into its offerings. One Reddit user, MikeyPx96, lamentedthe updates, noting: So if you like the current \"all apps\" plan it’s going to cost $10 more… because AI. Or you can downgrade to the cheaper \"Standard\" plan but lose access to features we’ve had the whole time like full access to the iPad/iPhone Apps. Also, 25 credits in the standard plan is not nearly enough since your AI features don’t always give great results on the first try. I cancelled Adobe and moved to DaVinci and Affinity 6 months ago and I don’t regret it at all. Adobe never ceases to \"create\" new ways to nickel and dime their customers. Another Redditor, Bmorgan1983, commented, “This is dumb. I don't need more AI in my life.\" Adobe isn’t the only creative software company seeking to use generative AI to pull more money from customers. Last year, Canva announced new AI capabilities that led to300 percent price hikesfor some business customers. After customer backlash, Canva partially relented in October by allowing teams users to add up to four users for free instead of charging them per user. Like Canva, Adobe is trying to introduce new features and be part of the generative AI boom while maintaining interest from creative customers, who are often long-time users who may not be interested in many of these added capabilities. For now, it seems that the former is being prioritized. After we published this article, Adobe updated its support page to say that new customers will be able to subscribe to Creative Cloud Standard. Previously, its support page stated that \"only existing customers can switch.\" We've updated this article accordingly.

    "title": "Chicago Sun-Times prints summer reading list full of fake books",
    "article_text": "Reading list in advertorial supplement contains 66% made up books by real authors. On Sunday, the Chicago Sun-Times published an advertorial summer reading list containing at least 10 fake books attributed to real authors, according to multiple reports on social media. The newspaper's uncredited \"Summer reading list for 2025\" supplement recommended titles including \"Tidewater Dreams\" by Isabel Allende and \"The Last Algorithm\" by Andy Weir—books that don't exist and were created out of thin air by an AI system. The creator of the list, Marco Buscaglia,confirmed to 404 Mediathat he used AI to generate the content. \"I do use AI for background at times but always check out the material first. This time, I did not and I can't believe I missed it because it's so obvious. No excuses,\" Buscaglia said. \"On me 100 percent and I'm completely embarrassed.\" A check by Ars Technica shows that only five of the fifteen recommended books in the list actually exist, with the remainder being fabricated titles falsely attributed to well-known authors. AI assistants such as ChatGPT are well-known for creating plausible-sounding errors known asconfabulations, especially when lacking detailed information on a particular topic. The problem affects everything fromAI search resultsto lawyersciting fake cases. On Tuesday morning, the Chicago Sun-Timesaddressedthe controversy on Bluesky. \"We are looking into how this made it into print as we speak,\" the official publication account wrote. \"It is not editorial content and was not created by, or approved by, the Sun-Times newsroom. We value your trust in our reporting and take this very seriously. More info will be provided soon.\" In the supplement, the books listed by authors Isabel Allende, Andy Weir, Brit Bennett, Taylor Jenkins Reid, Min Jin Lee, Percival Everett, Delia Owens, Rumaan Alam, Rebecca Makkai, and Maggie O’Farrell are confabulated, while books listed by authors Françoise Sagan, Ray Bradbury, Jess Walter, André Aciman, and Ian McEwan are real. All of the authors are real people. Novelist Rachael King initiallycalled attentionto the error on Bluesky Tuesday morning. \"The Chicago Sun-Times obviously gets ChatGPT to write a 'summer reads' feature almost entirely made up of real authors but completely fake books. What are we coming to?\" King wrote. So far, community reaction to the list has been largely negative online, but others have expressed sympathy for the publication. Freelance journalist Joshua J. Friedmannotedon Bluesky that the reading list was \"part of a ~60-page summer supplement\" published on May 18, suggesting it might be \"transparent filler\" possibly created by \"the lone freelancer apparently saddled with producing it.\" The reading list appeared in a 64-page supplement called \"Heat Index,\" which was a promotional section not specific to Chicago. Buscaglia told 404 Media the content was meant to be \"generic and national\" and would be inserted into newspapers around the country. \"We never get a list of where things ran,\" he said. The publication error comes two months after the Chicago Sun-Timeslost 20 percent of its staffthrough a buyout program. In March, the newspaper's nonprofit owner, Chicago Public Media, announced that 30 Sun-Times employees—including 23 from the newsroom—had accepted buyout offers amid financial struggles. A March report on the buyout in the Sun-Times described the staff reduction as \"the most drastic the oft-imperiled Sun-Times has faced in several years.\" The departures included columnists, editorial writers, and editors with decades of experience. Melissa Bell, CEO of Chicago Public Media, stated at the time that the exits would save the company $4.2 million annually. The company offered buyouts as it prepared for an expected expiration of grant support at the end of 2026. Even with those pressures in the media, one Reddit userexpressed disapprovalof the apparent use of AI in the newspaper, even in a supplement that might not have been produced by staff. \"As a subscriber, I am livid! What is the point of subscribing to a hard copy paper if they are just going to include AI slop too!?\" wrote Reddit user xxxlovelit, who shared the reading list. \"The Sun Times needs to answer for this, and there should be a reporter fired.\" This article was updated on May 20, 2025 at 11:02 AM to include information on Marco Buscaglia from 404 Media.

    "title": "Universal releases one last Jurassic World Rebirth trailer",
    "article_text": "\"We put ourselves in a place we don't belong. Survival is a long shot.\" Jurassic World Rebirthis coming to theaters for the Fourth of July weekend, and Universal Pictures has released one final trailer to whet audience appetites for the film. Aspreviously reported, this is the fourth installment in theJurassic Worldseries and seventh film overall in the franchise spawned by 1993'sJurassic Park. This time around, Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali step into the leading roles since the film is meant to be a fresh start for the franchise—although it does feature a return to the original research facility. Gareth Edwards—who directed 2014'sGodzilla—signed on to direct a script penned by David Koepp, who wrote the scripts forJurassic ParkandThe Lost World(1997). Per the official premise: Five years after the events ofJurassic World Dominion, the planet’s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures across land, sea, and air within that tropical biosphere hold, in their DNA, the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind. Johansson plays skilled covert operations expert Zora Bennett, contracted to lead a skilled team on a top-secret mission to secure the genetic material. When Zora’s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded on a forbidden island that had once housed an undisclosed research facility for Jurassic Park. There, in a terrain populated by dinosaurs of vastly different species, they come face-to-face with a sinister, shocking discovery that has been hidden from the world for decades. The cast also includes Rupert Friend as pharmaceutical rep Martin Krebs; Jonathan Bailey as paleontologist Henry Loomis; Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Reuben Delgado, whose family is shipwrecked; Luna Blaise as Reuben's older daughter; David Iacano as Reuben's son; Audrina Miranda as Reuben's younger daughter; and Bechir Sylvain as one of Zora's team members. Ed Skrein and Philippine Velge will also appear in as-yet-undisclosed roles. The first trailer dropped in February, serving primarily as a means of introducing the basic premise and the main characters—and playing up the return to where it all started: the original Jurassic Park. It's been fairly isolated because, as one character says, \"No one's dumb enough to go where we're going.\" But anything for science and the benefit of humanity, right? Even if it means trying to steal DNA from a pterosaur egg (possiblyQuetzalcoatlus northropi)before the angry mother—aka \"a flying carnivore the size of an F-16\"—returns. In fact, the island is home to \"the worst of the worst,\" i.e., the most dangerous of the cloned dinosaurs, including the infamous raptors and a new aquatic dinosaur species, themosasaur. Some of the same footage and expository dialogue appear in this latest trailer, which honestly gives away much of the movie—although how many fresh twists could there be after so many decades? You know by now what you're getting with this franchise. The trailer opens with a laboratory emergency in which a worker in a hazmat suit is fatally trapped inside an isolation chamber with what looks like a hungry T-rex. The poor dude pleads with his colleague to open the door before being eaten. The rest of the trailer consists of our intrepid team—and the unfortunate shipwrecked family—dealing with various species of very dangerous dinosaurs, with ScarJo leading the way on the action. (But pro tip: maybe don't put a baby dinosaur in your backpack, m'kay?) One assumes there will be several casualties and many narrow escapes before the survivors emerge with the much-needed DNA samples. And of course, there are plenty of stunning panoramic shots of this amazing world and the fantastic creatures in it. Jurassic World Rebirthhits theaters on July 2, 2025.

    "title": "2025 Hyundai Ioniq 9 first drive: Efficient, for a big one",
    "article_text": "Hyundai's biggest EV is designed for American roads and built in Georgia. SAVANNAH, Georgia—Hyundai's massive new Metaplant factory in Georgia is actually painted a subtle shade of green, not white, but you'd need someone to point that out to you. It's a shining example of the latest in car manufacturing—bright lights and white walls inside, knee-saving wooden floors on the production line, recaptured waste energy and solar—you name it. Hyundai even uses dog-like robots to check some welds. The vast facility is responsible for North American production ofthe electric Ioniq 5and, now, the all-new Ioniq 9 SUV as well. That Hyundai would make a three-row SUV with its class-leading electric powertrain was a no-brainer. The E-GMP platform, with its 800 V powertrain, was designed for medium to large EVs, after all. In 2021it debuted the Seven concept, which explored the idea of a living room on wheels. I'm not sure why the nameplate skipped a couple of digits, but the production Ioniq 9 tries to keep as true to that theme as possible within the confines of real life. Although they look quite different from one another, a common design language called \"parametric pixels\" ties together the Ioniq 9 with its smaller siblings theIoniq 5 SUVandIoniq 6 sedan. Creases catch the light even with the matte-gold paint of our test car, like the line ahead of the rear wheels that calls back to the collar on a traditional Korean garment. As ever, there are some other wonderful names for the design language: my favorite is \"aerosthetic lounge,\" but when you look at the images, also think of words like \"teutonic,\" \"boat tail,\" and \"integrated.\" When you hear the shape was inspired by a pebble, it makes sense that the drag coefficient is a slippery 0.27. At 199.2 inches (5,060 mm) the Ioniq 9 is couple of inches longer than the gas-powered Hyundai Palisade, but the EV's more space-efficient powertrain means the Ioniq 9 offers 9 inches (230 mm) more wheelbase, which translates into more room on the inside. The primary beneficiaries of that are whoever sits in the middle row, especially if the Ioniq 9 is in the six-seat configuration, which swaps the middle bench for a pair of captains' chairs. These even get ventilation, like the front seats. Space all the way in the back is average for the breed. There's more headroom thana Rivian R1S, but less legroom, and like most three-row SUVs, that third row is really for small children or occasional use. There's no acoustic glass back there, so its a much noisier place to sit, and the space is better utilized as cargo volume. If you need to put two adults in a third row and it must be electric,the Volkswagen ID. Buzzis your best bet, or at least it was until someone noticed the rear bench was too wide for just two seatbelts,sparkling a recall. But I digress. Seven adults could get up to a lot of work in one of these things. That's how many 100 W USB-C ports Hyundai has included, three up front then two for each of the other rows, although by my maths it would be hard to sap more than a couple of miles of range by simultaneously recharging 16-inch MacBook Pros on a road trip. For gadgets needing alternating current, the Ioniq 9 can provide 120 V V2L and is also capable of powering a home (V2H) or even returning energy to the grid (V2G), although those two will require a Hyundai bidirectional charger. With the electrons flowing from grid to car via a level 2 AC charger, expect to take about 9 hours and 40 minutes to charge from 10–100 percent at 11 kW. For best results DC fast charging, seek out a 350 kW fast charger. You'll need the includedCCS1 adapter, but you'll charge from 10–80 percent in 24 minutes. The adapter is required because the Ioniq 9 is one of the few non-Tesla EVs to leave the factory with the NACS charging port. Using a Tesla Supercharger to charge an Ioniq 9 doesn't just put more money in Elon Musk's coffers, though, it also takes a while—41 minutes in total. Only the $58,995 Ioniq 9 S is available with a rear-wheel drive powertrain. In this case, one with 215 hp (160 kW) and 258 lb-ft (350 Nm) and a range of 325 miles (539 km) from the 110.3 kWh (gross) battery pack. All other trims feature twin motor all-wheel drive, but you give up little in the way of range. The $62,765 SE and $68,320 SEL offer a combined 303 hp (226 kW) and 446 lb-ft (605 Nm) and 320 miles (515 km) of range, and the $71,250 Performance Limited, $74,990 Performance Calligraphy, and $76,490 Performance Calligraphy Design use a more powerful front motor to generate a total of 442 hp (315 kW) and 516 lb-ft (700 Nm), and a range of 311 miles (500 km). While a short first drive is not the best place to evaluate an EV's range efficiency, driven day to day in Eco mode, I wouldn't be surprised if you were able to easily exceed 3 miles/kWh (20.7 kWh/100 km). Other drive modes include Normal, which uses the front motor much more often and therefore is markedly quicker than Eco; Sport, which has quite a lot of initial throttle tip-in and will head-toss your passengers if you have any; Terrain, first seen onthe Ioniq 5 XRT;and Snow. The ride is quite firm on surface streets but less so at highway speeds over seams and expansion gaps. As you start to corner faster you can expect to encounter understeer, but since this is a three-row SUV weighing between 5,507-6,008 lbs (2,498-2,725 kg), one has to wonder what else was expected. At sensible speeds, it's easy to see out of and place it on the road, and if you're stuck in a tailback with a couple of grumpy children in the back, it's a calming enough environment to keep you from being over-stressed. Hyundai has wisely priced the Ioniq 9 between the relatedKia EV9(which also uses the E-GMP platform) and EVs from premium OEMs like the Volvo EX90, Mercedes EQS SUV, or the aforementioned Rivian.

    "title": "Zero-click searches: Google’s AI tools are the culmination of its hubris",
    "article_text": "Google's first year with AI search was a wild ride. It will get wilder. Google is constantly making changes to its search rankings, but not all updates are equal. Every few months, the company bundles up changes into a larger \"core update.\" These updates make rapid and profound changes to search, so website operators watch them closely. TheMarch 2024 updatewas unique. It was one of Google's largest core updates ever, and it took over a month to fully roll out. Nothing has felt quite the same since. Whether the update was good or bad depends on who you ask—and maybe who you are. It's common for websites to see traffic changes after a core update, but the impact of the March 2024 update marked a seismic shift. Google says the update aimed to address spam and AI-generated content in a meaningful way. Still, many publishers say they saw clicks on legitimate sites evaporate, while others have had to cope with unprecedented volatility in their traffic. Because Google owns almost the entire search market, changes in its algorithm can move the Internet itself. In hindsight, the March 2024 update looks like the first major Google algorithm update forthe AI era. Not only did it (supposedly) veer away from ranking AI-authored content online, but it also laid the groundwork for Google's ambitious—and often annoying—desire to fuse AI with search. A year ago, this ambition surfaced with AI Overviews, but now the company is taking an even more audacious route, layering in a new chat-based answer service called \"AI Mode.\" Both of these technologies do at least two things: They aim to keep you on Google properties longer, and they remix publisher content without always giving prominent citations. Smaller publishers appear to have borne the brunt of the changes caused by these updates. \"Google got all this flak for crushing the small publishers, and it's true that when they make these changes, they do crush a lot of publishers,\" saysJim Yu, CEO of enterprise SEO platform BrightEdge. Yu explains that Google is the only search engine likely to surface niche content in the first place, and there are bound to be changes to sites at the fringes during a major core update. Google's own view on the impact of the March 2024 update is unsurprisingly positive. The company said it was hoping to reduce the appearance of unhelpful content in its search engine results pages (SERPs) by 40 percent. After the update, the company claimed an actual reduction ofcloser to 45 percent. But does it feel like Google’s results have improved by that much? Most people don't think so. What causes this disconnect? According toMichael King, founder of SEO firm iPullRank, we're not speaking the same language as Google. \"Google's internal success metrics differ from user perceptions,\" he says. \"Google measures user satisfaction through quantifiable metrics, while external observers rely on subjective experiences.\" Google evaluates algorithm changes with various tests, including human search quality testers and running A/B tests on live searches. But more than anything else, success is about thetotal number of searches(5trillionof them per year). Google often makes this number a centerpiece of its business updates to show investors that it can still grow. However, using searchquantityto measurequalityhas obvious problems. For instance, more engagement with a search engine might mean that quality hasdecreased, so people try new queries (e.g., the old trick of adding \"Reddit\" to the end of your search string). In other words, people could be searching more because they don't like the results. Jim Yu suggests that Google is moving fast and breaking things, but it may not be as bad as we think. \"I think they rolled things out faster because they had to move a lot faster than they've historically had to move, and it ends up that they do make some real mistakes,\" says Yu. \"[Google] is held to a higher standard, but by and large, I think their search quality is improving.\" According to King, Google's current search behavior still favors big names, but other sites have started to see a rebound. \"Larger brands are performing better in the top three positions, while lesser-known websites have gained ground in positions 4 through 10,\" says King. \"Although some websites have indeed lost traffic due to reduced organic visibility, the bigger issue seems tied to increased usage of AI Overviews\"—and now the launch of AI Mode. Yes, the specter of AI hangs over every SERP. The unhelpful vibe many people now get from Google searches, regardless of the internal metrics the company may use, may come from a fundamental shift in how Google surfaces information in the age of AI. In 2025, you can't talk about Google's changes to search without acknowledging the AI-generated elephant in the room. As it wrapped up that hefty core update in March 2024, Google alsoannounced a major expansion of AI in search, moving the \"Search Generative Experience\" out of labs and onto Google.com. The feature was dubbed \"AI Overviews.\" The AI Overview box has been a fixture on Google's search results page ever since its debut a year ago. The feature uses the same foundational AI model as Google's Gemini chatbot to formulate answers to your search queries by ingesting the top 100 (!) search results. It sits at the top of the page, pushing so-calledblue linkcontent even farther down below the ads and knowledge graph content. It doesn't launch on every query, and sometimes it answers questions you didn't ask—or even hallucinates a totally wrong answer. And it's not without some irony that Google's laudable decision to de-rank synthetic AI slop comes at the same time that Google heavily promotes its own AI-generated content right at the top of SERPs. What is Google getting for all of this AI work? More eyeballs, it would seem. \"AI is driving more engagement than ever before on Google,\" says Yu. BrightEdge data shows that impressions on Google are up nearly 50 percent since AI Overviews launched. Many of the opinions you hear about AI Overviews online are strongly negative, but that doesn't mean people aren't paying attention to the feature. In its Q1 2025 earnings report, Google announced that AI Overviews is being \"used\" by 1.5 billion people every month. (Since you can't easily opt in or opt out of AI Overviews, this \"usage\" claim should be taken with a grain of salt.) Interestingly, the impact of AI Overviews has varied across the web. In October 2024, Google was so pleased with AI Overviews that it expanded them to appear in more queries. And as AI crept into more queries, publishers saw a corresponding traffic drop. Yu estimates this drop to be around 30 percent on average for those with high AI query coverage. For searches that are less supported in AI Overviews—things like restaurants and financial services—the traffic change has been negligible. And there are always exceptions. Yu suggests that some large businesses with high AI Overview query coverage have seen much smaller drops in traffic because they rank extremely well as both AI citations and organic results. Lower traffic isn't the end of the world for some businesses. Last May, AI Overviews were largely absent from B2B queries, but that turned around in a big way in recent months. BrightEdge estimates that 70 percent of B2B searches now have AI answers, which has reduced traffic for many companies. Yu doesn't think it's all bad, though. \"People don't click through as much—they engage a lot more on the AI—but when they do click, the conversion rate for the business goes up,\" Yu says. In theory, serious buyers click and window shoppers don't. But the Internet is not a giant mall that exists only for shoppers. It is, first and foremost, a place to share and find information, and AI Overviews have hit some purveyors of information quite hard. At launch, AI Overviews were heavily focused on \"What is\" and \"How to\" queries. Such \"service content\" is a staple of bloggers and big media alike, and these types of publishers aren't looking for sales conversions—it's traffic that matters. And they're getting less of it because AI Overviews \"helpfully\" repackages and remixes their content, eliminating the need to click through to the site. Some publishers are righteously indignant, asking how it's fair for Google to remix content it doesn't own, and to do so without compensation. But Google's intentions don't end with AI Overviews. Last week, the company started an expanded public test of so-called \"AI Mode,\" right from the front page. AI Mode doesn't even bother with those blue links. It's a chatbot experience that, at present, tries to answer your query without clearly citing sources inline. (On some occasions, it will mention Reddit or Wikipedia.) On the right side of the screen, Google provides a little box with three sites linked, which you can expand to see more options. To the end user, it's utterly unclear if those are \"sources,\" \"recommendations,\" or \"partner deals.\" Perhaps more surprisingly, in our testing, not a single AI Mode \"sites box\" listed a site that ranked on the first page for the same query on a regular search. That is, the links in AI Mode for \"best foods to eat for a cold\" don't overlap at all with the SERP for the same query in Google Search. In fairness, AI Mode is very new, and its behavior will undoubtedly change. But the direction the company is headed seems clear. Google's real goal is to keep you on Google or other Alphabet properties. In 2019, Rand Fishkin noticed that Google’sevolution from search engine to walled gardenwas at a tipping point. At that time—and for the first time—more than half of Google searches resulted in zero click-throughs to other sites. But data did show large numbers of clicks to Google's own properties, like YouTube and Maps. If Google doesn't intend to deliver a \"zero-click\" search experience, you wouldn't know it from historical performance data or the new features the company develops. You also wouldn't know it from the way AI Overviews work. They do cite some of the sources used in building each output, and data suggests people click on those links. But are the citations accurate? Is every source used for constructing an AI Overview cited? We don't really know, as Google is famously opaque about how its search works. We do know that Google uses a customized version of Gemini to support AI Overviews and that Gemini has been trained on billions and billions of webpages. When AI Overviews do cite a source, it's not clear how those sources came to be the ones cited. There's good reason to be suspicious here: AI Overview's output is not great, as witnessed by the numerous hallucinations we all know and love (telling people to eat rocks, for instance). The only thing we know for sure is that Google isn't transparent about any of this. Despite all of that, Google is not slowing down on AI in search. More recent core updates have only solidified this new arrangement with an ever-increasing number of AI-answered queries. The company appears OK with its current accuracy problems, or at the very least, it's comfortable enough to push out AI updates anyway. Google appears to have been caught entirely off guard by the public launch of ChatGPT, and it's now utilizing its search dominance to play catch-up. To make matters even more dicey, Google isn't eventryingto address the biggest issue in all this: The company's quest for zero-click search harms the very content creators upon which the company has built its empire. For its part, Google has been celebrating its AI developments, insisting that content producers don't know what's best for them, refuting any concerns with comments about search volume increases and ever-more-complex search query strings.The changes must be working! Google has been building toward this moment for years. The company started with a list of 10 blue links and nothing else, but little by little, it pushed the links down the page and added more content that keeps people in the Google ecosystem. Way back in 2007, Google added Universal Search, which allowed it to insert content from Google Maps, YouTube, and other services. In 2009, Rich Snippets began displaying more data from search results on SERPs. In 2012, the Knowledge Graph began extracting data from search results to display answers in the search results. Each change kept people on Google longer and reduced click-throughs, all the while pushing the search results down the page. AI Overviews, and especially AI Mode, are the logical outcome of Google's yearslong transformation from an indexer of information to an insular web portal built on scraping content from around the web. Earlier in Google's evolution, the implicit agreement was that websites would allow Google to crawl their pages in exchange for sending them traffic. That relationship has become strained as the company has kept more traffic for itself, reducing click-throughs to websites even as search volume continues to increase. And locking Google out isn't a realistic option when the company controls almost the entire search market. Even when Google has taken a friendlier approach, business concerns could get in the way. During the search antitrust trial,documents showedthat Google initially intended to let sites opt out of being used for AI training for its search-based AI features—but these sites would still be included in search results. The company ultimately canned that idea, leaving site operators with the Pyrrhic choice of participating in the AI \"revolution\" or becoming invisible on the web. Google now competes with, rather than supports, the open web. When many of us look at Google's search results today, the vibe feels off. Maybe it's the AI, maybe it's Google's algorithm, or maybe the Internet just isn't what it once was. Whatever the cause, the shift toward zero-click search that began more than a decade ago was made clear by the March 2024 core update, and it has only accelerated with the launch of AI Mode. Even businesses that have escaped major traffic drops from AI Overviews could soon find that Google's AI-only search can get much more overbearing. The AI slop will continue until morale improves.

    "title": "Tuesday Telescope: Finally, some answers on those Martian streaks",
    "article_text": "Alas, these probably are not reservoirs of life. Welcome to theTuesday Telescope. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light—a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. One of the longest-standing mysteries about Mars has been the presence of dark and light streaks on the rolling hills surrounding Olympus Mons. This week's image, from the European Space Agency, shows some of these streaks captured last October. This massive mountain rises about 22 km above the surface of Mars, more than twice as high as Mount Everest on Earth. It is bordered by hummocky deposits, called aureoles, that were formed by landslides from the mountain. A striking feature of these aureoles is the periodic appearance of bright and dark streaks—sometimes for days and sometimes for years. For decades, scientists have wondered what they might be. The streaks look remarkably like flowing water. Initially, scientists believed these features might be flows of salty water or brine, which remained liquid long enough to travel down the aureole. This offered the tantalizing possibility that life might yet exist on the surface of Mars in these oases. However, it now appears that this is not the case. According tonew research publishedMonday in the journal Nature Communications, these slopes are dry, likely due to layers of fine dust suddenly sliding off steep terrain. To reach this conclusion, the researchers used a machine-learning algorithm to scan and catalog streaks across 86,000 satellite images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. They created a map of 500,000 streaks across the surface of Mars. In doing so, the researchers found no evidence of water. The image in today's post comes from the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and it has been slightly modified to enhance the appearance of the streaks. It looks like art.

    "title": "Kids Around the World Are Still Swallowing Magnets at an Alarming Rate",
    "article_text": "Young children often put things in their mouths that they shouldn’t. Even seemingly harmless objects, such as toys, could have components small enough for a baby to swallowâsuch as magnets. Despite an increase in regulations, thousands of children around the world are still swallowing magnets. In a sweeping international review, researchers from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and UC Davis Health investigated pediatric magnet ingestion reports from around the world alongside their corresponding national policies addressing the issue. Their results indicate that children in the U.S. might be especially vulnerable. While the study was only able to analyze 23% of the world’s countries, the researchers hope that their comparisons will inform regulatory policies moving forward. “This data demonstrates that paediatric magnet ingestion is an international problem that must be addressed,” the researchers wrote in astudypublished today in the journal Injury Prevention. “Every geographic area has different availability of products and types of restrictions in place, yet the problem remains the same: If magnets are accessible to children, some children will inevitably ingest them, leading to a wide range of severe consequences.” Children from around the world, especially under the age of four, are at risk of swallowing small, high-powered magnets found in household items like remotes, toys, and small appliances. While the researchers point out that swallowing a single magnet might not be problematic, swallowing more or swallowing one alongside a metallic object might necessitate invasive medical intervention. To get a better picture of global trends, the team studied papers published between 2002 and 2024 on the prevalence and consequences of children swallowing magnets up to the age of 18. Most of the 96 papers came from Asia, the Middle East, North America, Europe, Chile, Australia, Egypt, and Tunisia. The researchers also assessed any policies regarding magnet production, sales, and use in their countries. The average age of children swallowing magnets was between two and eight years old, and most children overall swallowed magnets from toys or school and office supplies, while at home, in nurseries, or in daycare. Many of the children needed medical interventions. The U.S. represents the highest number of incidents (23,756) though this might be because individuals from the U.S. report such cases more frequently than others. Several countries, including the U.S. and China, saw an increase in reported cases over time. It could also result from more accurate reporting or changes in magnet cost, marketing, availability, or regulations, the researchers say. On the topic of regulatory policies, the team found policies regarding pediatric magnet ingestion in only 10 countries or geopolitical zones: the U.S., Canada, the European Union, the U.K., France, the UAE, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The policies included (few) outright bans of small magnets, limits on magnet strength, and/or labelling regulations. âMany countries still lack national policies aimed at limiting access to small, ingestible magnets, even countries with published incidence of morbidity and mortality from paediatric magnet ingestions,â the researchers explained. In the U.S., regulations keeping high-powered magnets out of the market were overturned in 2016, after which the number of pediatric magnet ingestion reports soared by 444% until 2022 when newâbut still questionableâpolicies came into effect. Overall, the researchers argue that the true number of pediatric magnet ingestions is likely even higher than what they outline in their study, since many incidents that don’t need medical intervention likely go undocumented. And while their study was “limited by information availability,” the bottom line is that children are still swallowing magnets at a high rate. Fortunately, “this data also provides some insight about potential solutions,” the researchers pointed out. “Removal of magnets from the market is linked to a decreased incidence of injuries related to magnet ingestions and thus, such policies should be proposed, promoted and enforced.” children's healthmagnetsregulations Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Dragons at Epic Universe’s Isle of Berk Are Next Level",
    "article_text": "You can now visit the Viking world ofHow to Train Your Dragonand walk among the dragon trainers from the hit DreamWorks Animation franchise. io9 was on hand for opening week’s media preview in advance of this Friday’s first day for the newest theme park to join Universal Orlando’s offerings:Epic Universe. Of the portal realms we have visited so far, the Isle of Berk has probably the most impressive tech when it comes to bringing the fantasy franchise’s main component to life. As Hiccup says, they have dragons, and boy, will they blow you away. View this post on Instagram The first encounter we had when arriving was meeting one of the NightLights, the offspring of the franchise’s hero dragon Toothless and the Lightfury, Pouncer. Gizmodo has written about thosescary-looking robot dogsin the past—and what struck me when the baby dragon walked out on its own (without a person, on all fours, in the scorching humid heat) is that its legs looked to move very similarly to the Boston Dynamics models. The flame-throwing version of the robot style makes a whole lot of sense now—kidding, these don’t breathe fire, but theycould, thoughtheme parks don’t have a good track record with fire breathing dragons, just ask the other guys. But isn’t it so darn cute? We got to see it do a little wiggle and strut with the face of a precious pure little guy who totally wouldn’t hurt us, unlike its military cousins. There’s more dragons throughout the land, which highlight various areas. Near the outdoor dining stations serving Viking fare like grilled meats, veggies, and mac and cheese in bread horns, you get to witness the snow wraith emit its icy blast at unsuspecting passers-by. It’s delightful when it catches people off guard. Then of course dragons are placed in various areas that correspond with their abilities, so you really get a sense of the co-op way they live with the Vikings of Berk. Character meet and greets with the dragon riders from the films such as Hiccup and Astrid also include their winged friends. Meeting Toothless is totally magical because of the seamless tech; various functions of articulation really work within the role they play. When you have your one-on-one moment with a dragon, they react and respond in such a life-like manner, it’s kind of alarming how quickly you let your guard down with the blink of those two big adorable eyes. They make the noises that give you the same cuteness aggression you’d get from a dog or cat. I really thought I needed a dragon’s nod of approval when Toothless sent me off on a high-flying ride on what’s probably my favorite family-friendly thrill coaster, Hiccup’s Winged Gliders. And it being set to John Powell’s movie score, ischef’s kiss. I really felt like I was soaring. So far on this visit, we haven’t gotten a chance to watchThe Untrainable Dragon, the land’s stage show, which is set to feature a flying dragon as part of the production. But if all the other dragons make you feel like you’re right at home in Berk, we’ve got a good feeling about it. I don’t think any other land has gone to the lengths Berk does to incorporate the film’s fantasy creatures in this way. Sure, at lands such asJurassic World-themed ones, there are some creatures beyond the boat raft, and it’s crazy cool to witness their simulated escape or get to meet in scheduled moments with the gentler giants. Berk just takes it to a new level. The dragons don’t just come out like your average characters at any park, they feel like an active part of the land that you can encounter within the story-play of Berk’s immersion. And that’s a high-flying feat. Epic Universe opens this Friday at Universal Studios Orlando. Travel and accommodations were provided for the purposes of this review. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Got Cold Sores? You Might Be at Higher Risk for Alzheimer’s",
    "article_text": "Some common germs might plant the seed for dementia later in life. Research out today has found a link between several infectious diseases, particularly herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1), and a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists at Gilead Sciences conducted the study,publishedTuesday in BMJ Open. They analyzed the medical records of Americans with health insurance, finding that people with Alzheimer’s and related conditions were also more likely to be diagnosed with HSV-1. The findings are the latest to suggest that the prevention and treatment of HSV-1 and similar viruses can be an effective measure against dementia. Alzheimer’s is the most common form ofdementia, affecting roughly 7 million Americans today. Most cases are caused by a complex mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. In recent years, many studies have suggested that certain infections—HSV-1 included—can be part of that equation. HSV-1 is the primary cause of oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores, though most infected people will experience few or no symptoms; it can also cause genital herpes (primarily caused by HSV-2). Not everystudyhas supported this viral link, however, so the authors decided to take a look for themselves, with the help of real-world data. According to lead researcher Luke Liu, this is the first study to use a large database of insurance claims in the U.S. to examine the connection between Alzheimer’s and HSV-1. Knowing Your Alzheimer’s Risk Might Change Your Habits—and Not for the Better Liu and his team compared the health outcomes of nearly 400,000 Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to people without Alzheimer’s who were matched in age, sex, and other factors. Only a small percentage of people with Alzheimer’s had a past HSV-1 diagnosis (a bit under 0.5%), but they still had it more often than controls (about 80% more likely). The researchers then looked at a broader group of people with other forms of dementia related to Alzheimer’s, finding a similar pattern. They additionally found a link between Alzheimer’s and two other herpesviruses, herpes simplex-2 and varicella zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles. Interestingly, they also found that people who took antiviral treatment for their HSV-1 were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than people with HSV-1 who didn’t receive treatment (antivirals can suppress and shorten active outbreaks, though not cure the infection). Observational studies like this one can’t prove a cause-and-effect link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s, but the case for such a connection only appears to be getting stronger. “Exposure to herpesviruses is likely to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia, and antiherpetic medications can be protective against Alzheimer’s and related dementia,” Liu, a virologist at Gilead, told Gizmodo in an email. There remain important questions about this association, including the actual mechanisms involved. Some research has suggested our brain’s immune system producesamyloid betaandtauto defend against herpesvirus infection, for instance (the misfolded forms of these proteins are the key drivers of Alzheimer’s). But there might be more ways that HSV-1 and similar viruses can set off or accelerate the condition. Other factors almost certainly play a role, especially since many people contract HSV-1 in their lifetime but never develop Alzheimer’s. Roughly two-thirds of the world’s population under age 50carriesHSV-1, according to the World Health Organization. The researchers note that the HSV-1/Alzheimer’s link is even stronger in older people, and other research suggests that people carrying the ApoE-ε4 allele—a genetic variant that already increases Alzheimer’s risk—also seem more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. So these viruses are likely one of the many dominos that can fall and eventually lead to Alzheimer’s. The Shingles Vaccine Could Be a Secret Weapon Against Heart Attacks Still, the overall evidence does indicate that people can meaningfully lower their dementia risk by treating or preventing certain infections. Several studies have found a link betweenshingles vaccination and reduced Alzheimer’s, for instance. Clinical trials testing whether antiviral treatments for herpes can lower dementia risk could be warranted, though Liu notes that kind of research will take considerable resources to get off the ground. Research is also ongoing todevelop vaccinesfor HSV-1 and HSV-2—research that might be more worthwhile than currently assumed. “These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpesviruses as a public health priority,” the researchers wrote.

Microplastics could play a hidden role in the relationship between ultra-processed foods and certain neurological disorders, according to new research. New research looks at the emotional and physical repercussions of having your brain scanned for early signs of dementia. The gum is made from bean powder naturally containing a protein that binds to a wide variety of germs, including influenza and the viruses that cause herpes. A new review of clinical trial data finds evidence that GLP-1 drugs can meaningfully reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Vaccinated people's risk of dementia was reduced by 20% over a seven year period, researchers have found. Research announced today is the first of its kind to suggest that anti-amyloid drugs can delay or even stop the progression of symptoms in people with early-onset Alzheimer's.

    "title": "I Waited One Hour to Try Google’s Android XR Smart Glasses and Only Had 90 Seconds With Them",
    "article_text": "Well, that didn’t go well. After enduring two hours of nonstop Gemini AI announcement afterannouncement at Google I/O, I waited one hour in the press lounge to get a chance to try out either a pair ofAndroid XR smart glassesorSamsung’s Project Moohan mixed reality headset. Obviously, I went for the Android XR smart glasses to see how they compare toMeta’s $10,000 Orion conceptandGoogle Glassbefore it. Is Android XR the holy grail of smart glasses we’ve been waiting over a decade for? Unfortunately, Google only let me try them out for 90seconds. I was promised five minutes with the Android XR headset prototype and only had three minutes total, half of which a product rep spent explaining to me how the smart glasses worked. Ninety seconds in, I was told to tap on the right side of the glasses to invoke Gemini. The AI’s star-shaped icon appeared in the right lens (this pair of Android XR glasses only had one tiny transparent display) slightly below its center point. I was instructed to just talk to Gemini. I turned around and looked at a painting hung on the wall and asked it what I was looking at, who painted it, and asked for the art style. Gemini answered confidently; I have no idea if the answers were correct. I looked over at a bookshelf and asked Gemini to tell me the names of the booksâand it did. Then the rep used a phone that was paired to the glasses to load up Google Maps. He told me to look down at my feet, and I saw a small portion of a map; I looked back up, and there Gemini pulled up a turn-by-turn navigation. Then the door in the 10 x 10-foot wooden box I was in slid open, and I was told I was done. The whole thing was incredibly rushed, and honestly, I barely even got to get a sense for how well Gemini worked. The AI constantly spoke over the rep while he was explaining the Android XR demo to me. I’m not sure if it was a false activation or a bug or what. When I asked about the painting and books, I didn’t need to keep tapping on the side of the glassesâGemini kept listening and just switched gears. That part was neat. Compared to Meta’s Orion smart glassesâwhich are also a prototype concept at this stageâthe Android XR glasses don’t even compare. You can see more and do more with Orion and through its waveguide lenses with silicon carbide. Orion runs multiple app windows like Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and even has “holographic” games like aPongÂknockoff that you can play another person wearing their own pair of the AR glasses. Versus Snapchat’s latest AR “Spectacles” and their super narrow field of view, I’d say the Android XR prototype and its singular display might actually be better. If you’re going to have less powerful hardware, lean into its strength(s). As for the smart glasses themselvesâthey felt like any pair of thick sunglasses, and they felt relatively light. They did slide off my nose a bit, but that’s only because I have a flat and wider Asian nose. They didn’t appear to slip off the nose of my friend and Engadget arch-nemesis, Karissa Bell. (I’m just kidding; I love Karissa.) There was no way for me to check battery life in 90 seconds. So that’s my first impression of the first pair of Android XR smart glasses. It’s not a lot, but also not nothing. Part of me is wondering why the hell Google chose to limit demo time like this. My spidey sense tells me that it may not be as far along as it appeared in the I/O keynote demo. What I saw feels like a better version of Google Glass, for sure, with the screen resembling a super-tiny heads-up display that’s located in the center of the right lens instead of above your right eye on Glass. But with only 90 seconds, there’s no way for me to form a firm opinion. I need to see a lot more, and what I saw was not even a sliver of a sliver. Google, you got my numberâcall me!

    "title": "Google’s New AI Mode for Search Cranks Gemini to Max Volume",
    "article_text": "Looks like Google is doubling down on AI-centric search despite a rocky, glue-pizza-marred rollout last year. AtGoogle I/O 2025, the company announced “AI Mode” for search that greatly expands what it started with AI Overviews. According to Google, “AI Mode,” which is available in Labs starting Tuesday, “expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning and thinking and multimodal capabilities.” In plain English, that meansa lotmore Gemini in your search. Specifically, Google says AI Mode will be able to answer “your toughest questions” and can be used to go more in-depth, asking follow-ups and providing “helpful web links.” AI Mode is based on a custom version of Gemini 2.0, according to Google, and uses real-time sources like the Knowledge Graph—Google’s own database of people, places, and things—to pull data as well as (of course) shopping data. In practice, Google says AI Mode can be used to compare products with queries like, “What’s the difference in sleep tracking features between a smart ring, smartwatch, and tracking mat?” or “What happens to your heart rate during deep sleep?” and will conduct research for you by leveraging multiple sources across the web. AI Mode is a total reimagining of Search — an end-to-end AI experience with more advanced reasoning. Early testers have been asking much longer queries, 2-3x the length of traditional searches. AI Mode is rolling out to everyone in the U.S., starting today. 🎉#GoogleIOpic.twitter.com/xGELAnY1tM — Google (@Google)May 20, 2025 This all sounds well and good on the surface, but it’s worth noting that Google’s previous attempts at AI-forward search haven’t exactly worked out as intended. Its AI Overviews were rocky to say the least and ended up peddling straight-up misinformation. In one particularly egregious instance, Google’s AI search even recommended that someone tryputting glue on their pizzato get the cheese to stick. I think I can speak for everyone when I say that’s not really the type of next-gen search prowess we’ve been waiting for. For what it’s worth, Google at least gave some lip service, however indirect, to fixing those problems in its explanation of AI mode. “AI Mode is rooted in our core quality and ranking systems, and we’re also using novel approaches with the model’s reasoning capabilities to improve actuality,” Google said in a statement. “We aim to show an AI-powered response as much as possible, but in cases where we don’t have high confidence in helpfulness and quality, the response will be a set of web search results.” And that’s always kind of the problem with AI search, or sometimes AI in general, isn’t it? We want it to make our lives easier or get us to the truth faster, but we’re not quite at the point of being able to trust it fully yet. Web search, even without generative AI hallucinating facts or trying to serve up glue pizza, is already a messy thing that often falls victim to bias and misinformation, and until those problems are solved (given that theycanbe solved), I’m going to assume AI Mode or any other kind of AI search is going to contend with the same pitfalls. I’m hopeful, though, because web searchdoesneed to get better, and if I can find more reliable, useful information faster with the help of AI, I’ll be the first adopter. So, you’re up, AI Mode!

    "title": "‘The Life of Chuck’ Is the Movie Mike Flanagan Wants to Be Remembered For",
    "article_text": "Filmmaker Mike Flanaganhas already createdquite a legacy for himself. From his films likeDoctor SleepandGerald’s Game,to shows likeThe Fall of the House of Usher, Midnight Mass, andThe Haunting of Hill House, Flanagan has basically become his own brand, especially in the horror genre. And yet, even though he’s also attached to films or shows in the worlds ofThe Exorcist, Carrie,The Dark Tower, andBatman, none of that is what he thinks he’ll be remembered for. No, Flanagan thinks his next movie,The Life of Chuck, is going to be that legacy. Or, at least, that’s what he hopes. “There are very few pieces of work that I imagine will outlive me in a meaningful way,” Flanagan wrote inexcerpts of an essay released on social media. “You always hope they will; we hope that in telling the stories we tell, we are planting a seed that will grow long after we’ve faded away. I have no idea which of these seeds will take root with people, and dwelling on those questions is a path to insanity. I feel a quiet, humble confidence thatThe Life of Chuckwill long outlast us all.” For those who may not be aware,The Life of Chuckis based on a short story by the one and only Stephen King. It tells the story of one man’s life—in this case, Chuck—backwards. Tom Hiddleston plays Chuck in some parts of the movie, and he’s joined by the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Karen Gillan, Jacob Tremblay, and Mark Hamill, among many others. “The Life of Chuckis, at this moment in time, my favorite movie I’ve ever been a part of,” Flanagan, who adapted the screenplay and directs, continues. “I told people going into production that this was the film I wanted to leave in the world for my children. It is so rare to work on something so meaningful, so unique, so distinct, and so earnest. This is a story without a cynical bone in its body. What a rare and beautiful moment of art.” The film won the very prestigious People’s Choice Award at last year’s Toronto Film Festival and is coming to theaters June 6. Plus, I have to say, I agree with Flanagan here. I’ve seenThe Life of Chuckand while it’s a complex thinker of a movie, it’s also rich and absolutely phenomenal. It’s stuck with me weeks after first seeing it. io9 will have a full review and more as we get closer to release, but until then, here’s a new clip from the film that is not only crucial to the movie overall, but will give you a sense of what Flanagan is saying.

Home security is a top priority for any homeowner, but the high cost of professional monitoring and installation can often be a barrier. Traditional security systems with 24/7 surveillance can quickly add up, especially when you factor in monthly fees and long-term contracts. Fortunately, there’s a smarter and more affordable way to protect your home:the Ring Alarm 14-Piece Kit. As of now, this whole house security system is available on Amazonfor just $249, down from its normal price of $329, which is a 24% discount. This sale allows you to secure your whole home at a very decent price point, and with the Memorial Day sales in full swing, there has never been a better time to invest in having your mind at peace. See at Amazon Ring Alarm kit (with 14 pieces) is specifically designed to offer strong protection for two to four-bedroom homes and is perfect for families, renters, or anyone who wishes to improve a security system. This kit is the most comprehensive in the Ring family of products, and itguarantees every point of entry and important location of your home to be secured.

For added security, the kit features two Motion Detectors. These are perfect for hallways, lounges or any room where you want to monitor movement. They’re smart enough to recognize people over pets so false alarms are reduced. The final piece of equipment in the kit is the Range Extender, which will ensure your entire system remains connected, even in bigger homes or houses with extremely thick walls that are often prone to blocking wireless signals. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the Ring Alarm system is the ease with which you can use it:You can monitor all your Ring devices via the easy-to-use Ring app, and you will get alerts in real-time if any sensor is triggered. It also integrates with Alexa so that you can arm and disarm your alarm by using voice commands, if you subscribe to Ring Home Plan.

    "title": "Trump’s ‘Pro Life’ IRS Nominee Reportedly Followed NSFW X Accounts",
    "article_text": "A new report shows that Billy Long, President Trump’s nominee to run the Internal Revenue Serviceâa man who, during his run for Congress, characterized himself as “pro-life”âhas an X account that recently followed a number of NSFW accounts, including some featuring pregnant women. Predictably, the White House has blamed the account’s preoccupation with racy material on a hack. Rolling Stone magazinewrites thatthe X account for Long, a former GOP congressman from Missouri, follows some 8,000 profiles, including several that involve porn or porn-adjacent material. One such account, dubbed “Pregnant Redhead,” is, while not porn, exactly, a prolific poster of tradwife-type content that fetishizes female domesticity. Other accounts Long allegedly followed included more explicit pages featuring naked pregnant women. Some of these accounts are a bizarre hodgepodge of material. For instance, oneaccountthat RS points to does include a number of videos of naked pregnant women. However, it also includes videos of a lot of other stuff, including WWE and sports clips. Other accounts that Long’s account allegedly followed were just your basic, run-of-the-mill porn accounts. RS describes them thusly: …These X accounts might be described as stealth porn. Nothing in the handle or the profile picture identifies the account as NSFW. But the posts are dominated by sexual images of women. One of these accounts has only a single piece of content â a ârepostâ of an adult creator who lists her age as 26 and describes herself as a âbig booty milf.â (MILF is an acronym for a popular porn category involving mothers.) The post caption reads âI fuck back,â and it features a video loop of the adult creator, filmed naked from behind, riding a dildo. Pregnancy has also been a policy position for Long. RS cites anarchived versionof a website for Long’s congressional race, which states: “Billy is 100 percent pro-life. He believes in the sanctity of human life, beginning at conception, and fights to protect the rights of the unborn.” The White House has predictably blamed Long’s NSFW follows on a shadowy conspiracy of nebulous proportions. “This is absolute bullshit and not something the congressman would ever do,â a senior Trump transition official told Gizmodo. âClearly there has been unauthorized access to the account in the 11th hour before his hearing, and we are currently investigating the matter, including reporting it to X.â While a hack of Long’s account seems somewhat fantastical, there are, hypothetically, other potentially innocent explanations for the follows. For instance, the account may have followed profiles that didn’t immediately seem pornographic but which later posted porn. Gizmodo reached out to Long via a DM for more information. It was unclear how to otherwise contact him. Long follows in the footsteps of a long line of congressmen who have been linked to social media accounts that indulge in racy material. Most recently, Mark Robinson, the unsuccessful MAGA gubernatorial candidate for North Carolina, was reportedly linked toa number of porn accounts. Robinson denied affiliation with the accounts. billy longDonald TrumpnsfwPorn Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

Dyson is a premium UK company that has established itself through brilliant engineering, minimalist design, and exceptional reliability. Comparable to Apple in domestic appliances,Dyson products rarely find themselves on offerso any discount of a significant amount is a big story. That is why the deal on the Dyson Purifier Cool TP10 (1st gen) at Amazon is so good: For a limited time,you can have this revolutionary air purifier and fan for just $299 which is a full 30% off its normal price of $429. This is anall-time lowon this model and a special chance to bring Dyson’s legendary performance into your life at a much lower price. See at Amazon ThisDyson product is both purified and cooled, and it employs Dyson’s famous Air Multiplier technology in order to spread purified air uniformly throughout the entire room. As opposed to traditional fans or air purifiers that only exert limited influence on the immediate surroundings, the TP10 sends out a powerful stream of purified air and reaches every corner and helping to create a cleaner and cozier living space for your loved ones. One of the most impressive things about the TP10 is its totally sealed HEPA filter system. Dyson hasdesigned this purifier to stringent HEPA standards which means that it filters 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. Dust, pollen, pet dander and even certain bacteria are all sucked in and trapped, so what comes in, stays in. This is especially useful for allergy patients or anyone worried about indoor air quality. The TP10 also comes equipped with a night mode, which cleans and senses the air under its most silent modes and silences the display so that your sleep won’t be interrupted when your air remains fresh and clean. The Dyson TP10 is also very practical: Its sleek, bladeless design is also pet- and child-friendly for families. The unit moves up to 350 degrees and allows it to spread purified air extensively and efficiently. You may set it to turn off automatically after specified intervals of 1, 2, 4, or 8 hours for convenience and peace of mind, especially if you like to sleep with the fan running. Though the TP10 is not smartphone-compatible, it also comes with a curved, magnetized remote that easily fits onto the machine itself and hence is never out of reach. Given Dysonâs rare approach to discounts, this pre Memorial Day deal is unlikely to last long. See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "ZEUS Is Officially America’s Most Powerful Laser, With 2-Petawatt Blast",
    "article_text": "The ZEUS laser, tucked away (as much as a giant laser can be) at the University of Michigan, just cranked out a pulse that makes it the most powerful laser beam in the country. ZEUS’ peak power topped out at 2 petawatts, or a staggering 2 quadrillion watts, roughly 100 times the entire planet’s power output. Of course, that level of energy is fleeting; the pulse lasts just 25 quintillionths of a second—just enough time for researchers to do some pretty revolutionary science. “This milestone marks the beginning of experiments that move into unexplored territory for American high field science,” said Karl Krushelnick, director of the Gérard Mourou Center for Ultrafast Optical Science, where ZEUS is housed, in a Michiganrelease. ZEUS is short for Zettawatt Equivalent Ultrashort laser pulse System, and its power (at the risk of blasphemy) rivals that of the king of the Greek gods, who famously wields a lightning bolt as a symbol of his power. ZEUS is funded by the National Science Foundation, and scientists from around the world can apply to run experiments there—similar to theLinac Coherent Light Source II(or LCLS-II) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Like LCLS-II—whose domain ranges fromunderstanding photosynthesis and the cores of stars—the applications of ZEUS’ laser range from plasma and quantum physics to medical imaging, particle acceleration, and materials research. “The energy of the individual photons in a pulse from LCLS is about 20,000 times greater than the photons from the ZEUS laser—but the peak power is 100,000 times lower,” Krushelnick told Gizmodo in an email. Krushelnick added that the use cases of ZEUS are manifold, but measuring physics at extreme intensities, the development of new radiation sources, laboratory astrophysics and imaging small-scale materials are a few of its principal scientific uses. Franklin Dollar, a physicist at UC Irvine, will run the first 2-petawatt user experiment, aiming to produce electron beams with energies comparable to those from long particle accelerators. Should he and his team succeed, the electron beam energies will be between 5 and 10 times higher than any beams ZEUS has yet produced. ZEUS will accelerate electrons usingwakefield acceleration, by which electrons essentially surf on plasma to accelerate to extremely high speeds. “The quest for higher peak power lasers enables studies of the fundamental nature of light in the limit of extremely high instantaneous electromagnetic fields,” said Vyacheslav Lukin, program director in the NSF Division of Physics, which oversees the ZEUS project, in an email to Gizmodo. “Just as ocean waves begin to break and foam as they get higher, electromagnetic waves act differently when the light becomes very intense and the electromagnetic field gets extremely strong.” The beam isn’t just powerful—it’s quite large. At its biggest, the laser pulse is one foot (0.3 meters) across and several feet long, according to the Michigan release. But the pulse is ultimately focused down to just 0.8 microns wide, to maximize the number of laser pulses available for experiments on ZEUS. But the big show is set for later this year, when the facility will get a titanium-infused sapphire crystal that will increase the laser’s power to three petawatts. The crystal took nearly five years to manufacture and is about 7 inches (0.18 m) across. ZEUS’ electrons will smash into laser pulses from the opposite direction, increasing the experiment’s pulse to essentially zettawatt-scale in the frame of reference of the particle beam. About 15 months of user experiments have already been conducted on ZEUS’ single petawatt laser, but now the facility is capable of hitting much more powerful energy pulses. With the new and improved laser, the team can better interrogate some of the universe’s most fundamental physics, with implications across the sciences.

Instead of using the Large Hadron Collider to smash atoms together, researchers briefly turned lead into gold by facilitating near-misses. A new measurement finds the universe's teensiest particles weigh no more than one-millionth the mass of an electron. A report published late last month outlines MATHUSLA, a particle detector named for the longest-lived person in the Bible.

    "title": "The 5 Best Disney Rides You Can Only Experience in Japan",
    "article_text": "For theme park enthusiasts, there’s always something wonderful about experiencing a new park.The magic of discovery.The thrill of fresh attractions. And, if you’re a Disney fan, it’s even more exciting simply because there aren’t that many parks. Only six places in the world (as of now) have Disney Parks, so any first-time visit is special—which isexactly what happened to me last monthwhen I went to the Tokyo Disney Resort. Consisting of two separate theme parks,Tokyo DisneylandandDisneySea, Tokyo Disney has many rides we know and love here in the United States. But, as an adult who not only frequents Walt Disney World in Orlando, but is a Magic Key holder at Disneyland, those weren’t why I was most excited. It was the rides I could only ride there in Japan that made me wake up at the crack of dawn, line up, and pay that little extra to ensure I’d get on. Below, here are the five best Disney rides you can only ride in Japan. They’re rides that, I’m happy to say, made the trip worth the visit all by themselves. Like most Disney parks, Tokyo Disneyland has a big, beautiful castle at the center. But this park also has a second castle just for itsBeauty and the Beastride. And, once you ride it, you’ll know why. Sitting in a large teacup, you are whisked away on a trackless system (likeRise of the ResistanceorRatatouille) through the film. The ride vehicles move around elaborate, stunning recreations of scenes from the animated classic with awesome animatronics and all your favorite songs to boot. By the time you get to the end, and Belle and the Beast are dancing together in the ballroom, it truly might bring a tear to your eye. Simply one of the best Disney rides I’ve ever been on, if not the best. At Epcot in Orlando, Florida, there is a very good boat ride themed aroundFrozen. If you’ve ridden it, imagine what that’s like, but three times longer with even more of the story, songs, and characters. Basically, you ride in a boat through theFrozenmovie, combining all the tricks Disney Imagineers have come up with over the years—animatronics, projections, sets, etc. But what’s the best part ofFrozen? “Let It Go,” right? Well, this ride uses three entire rooms to take you through the song, climaxing in some truly epic moments. This isn’t a thrill ride of any kind, but the thrill you get in living in this world for a few minutes makes it incredibly special. Again, the best way to contextualize this ride is to compare it to other, similar rides. So imagine rides such as Universal’sHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey,Transformers: The RideorThe Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, in which you’re in a vehicle on a track that goes between elaborate movie scenes and big, practical sets. That’s this ride and, frankly, it’s better than all of those. It’s an epic retelling of thePeter Panstory with these dynamic technologies and, just when you think the story is over, it keeps going. It’s a rousing experience. Finding Nemohas a huge presence in Disney parks, with rides in both Orlando and Anaheim. But the one in Tokyo is different. ThinkStar Tours, butFinding Nemo, as you get into a “ship” (aka, a sort of movie theater) which is then shrunken down and whisked all through the ocean. Oh, and it’s 4D, so expect to get a little wet. It’s not the newest or most innovative ride, but it’s still really fun. IfJourney to the Center of the Earthwas one minute longer, it would be one of the best rides at the resort. As it stands now, it’s too short to be on that full list but, if you don’t have to wait too long for it, it’s very much worth a spin. You basically take a vehicle through a story where you go to the center of the Earth and, once you encounter a big monster, are zipped away in a pseudo roller coaster moment, including a drop that takes you out of the mountain in the center of the theme park. That part happens a little too quickly but it’s still great, as is everything before it. Of course, those are not the only Tokyo-only rides you find in its Disney parks.Aquatopia, a hovercraft ride, is super fun. 20,000 Leagues Under the Seais a relaxing, beautiful trip, with a nice nostalgic boost from the versions Disney has long since removed from its U.S. parks. Plus, there are exclusive rides based onTangled, Big Hero 6, Monsters Inc.,Winnie the Pooh,and many more. (Full disclosure, we were unable to ride theMonstersandPoohrides, so I was unable to rank them.) Basically, if you are a Disney or theme park fan and you find yourself in Tokyo, be sure to prioritize the rides you can only do there.

    "title": "The original Polish Witcher comics are available in English if you can get past the way Geralt's fringe looks like the mustache of a cartoon walrus who is also a circus ringleader",
    "article_text": "Toss a coin to your Witcher so he can pay for a better haircut. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. Let's get this out of the way right up top. Yes, Geralt has bangs that look like they belong above the lip of an anime mad scientist. I don't know if we can blame this on Poland or the 1990s or just fantasy comic books in general, but it does make for a rough first impression. In 1993, seven years after Andrzej Sapkowski's first Witcher story was published, writer Maciej Parowski and artist Bogusław Polch began adapting Geralt's adventures into comics. Long before the videogames and TV shows, this was the first attempt at adapting The Witcher for a visual medium, so it's not surprising that it's idiosyncratic. It was Polch who turned Sapkowski's red-eyed vrans into lizard-people, a depiction the videogames followed. Some of his other ideas weren't so influential. Geralt's fringe for starters. Polch also has a thing for eyelashes, with his elves in particular having overgrown proliferations of them, like spiderlegs emerging from behind their eyeballs. Other likenesses are spot on, however, and his Yennefer is immediately recognizable. And even at its goofiest the art's kind of charming, in a Métal Hurlant Eurocomic kind of way. Geralt punching a rider off a horse as he somersaults into the saddle is communicated with a pleasing economy, and when sorceresses work magic their hair stands on end and they end up looking uncannily like '70s David Bowie. Among these six chapters are adaptations of four short stories—The Witcher, The Lesser Evil, The Last Wish, and The Bounds of Reason—as well as two more unusual offerings. The first is an expanded version of a short story Sapkowski wrote about Geralt's parents, originally part of a separate fantasy novel he was working on repurposed to provide more material for the suddenly in-demand Geralt of Rivia. The second is a new story based on an outline provided by Sapkowski in which young Geralt undergoes his Witcher trials as the School of the Wolf prepares to face off against its rival School of the Cat in a tournament. Though this story was published last, in this collection the stories are ordered chronologically so it comes second, meaning there's a fair chunk of prequel to get out of the way before the Geralt we're here to read about takes centre stage. There's a lot of added interconnectedness in the stories too, a very comic book thing to do—in this version of events Mousesack's mother was killed by Geralt's father, Yarpen the dwarf was one of Renfri's original band of companions, and a young Dandelion shouted insults at a young Geralt in passing for no particular reason. I'm not sure filling them with crossover cameos adds much to the stories, but you can tell the writer's having fun fitting the puzzle pieces together. The later chapters are the more famous monster-hunting fairytale-parodying stories, which have been told multiple times now, inThe Hexerand Netflix's Witcher series and the more recent Dark Horse comics. While those versions seem like they're in conversation with each other—the Dark Horse versions feeling like they're only evoking the original stories to give Netflix haters something to latch onto, rather than out of any actual desire to do something interesting with them—these early interpretations are figuring things out as they go. It's a version of The Witcher where wizards wear stereotypical conical hats even when they're drunk and acting up, one that's closer to the aesthetics of trad fantasy, which emphasizes the grim-and-gritty elements even further. It makes some bold and colorful choices a modern adaptation wouldn't, and while sometimes that results in a laughable haircut, sometimes the result's a refreshingly skewed take on Sapkowski's original stories.

    "title": "Which version of Nicolas Cage will we get in the Madden movie? Boy, I hope it's the unhinged one",
    "article_text": "Throw in hothead Christian Bale and controversial director David O. Russell, and we'll hopefully see some fireworks in the Madden biopic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've gotten our first look at Nicolas Cage as John Madden in the upcoming movie Madden, and I'm stoked. Not for the story or subject: I don't care much about football, I honestly haven't played much of the Madden games, and I mostly only know John Madden himself from the TV commercials he did for athlete's foot sprays and hardware stores. But Nicolas Cage playing him? Oh, I'm in. Day one, first screening. As long as we get the unhinged version of Nicolas Cage, not the serious actor version, that is. It feels like a toss-up which Cage you'll get when you hire him. It might be a brilliant, layered performance (Leaving Las Vegas, Adaptation, Pig) or an unhinged, scenery-chewingtour-de-what(The Wicker Man, Vampire's Kiss, Face/Off). The question is, which one will show up for Madden? Well, it's a movie about a football coach who spends four years making a videogame—so of course I'm hoping it will be a batshit crazy performance. Otherwise, it could wind up being as dull as Ben Affleck's sneaker movie. The problem with making a movie about Madden is his entire career is a series of wins. He never had a losing season with the Raiders, taking them to the playoffs eight times and winning Oakland's first Super Bowl. He had a successful broadcasting career spanning 30 years. He raised millions for the Special Olympics, he funded college scholarships, and he spoke out in favor of making football safer for players. He seemed, quite honestly, like a heck of a nice guy. A post shared by @nonstop.archived A photo posted by on Do I want to see a movie about a heck of a nice guy who always wins? Hell, no. I want to see a movie about a ranting, screaming, lurching trainwreck barely clinging to sanity. Idemandit. Because Nicolas Cage is playing him. Considering the third-billed actor in Madden is John Mulaney, playing Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, I assume the main conflict for the movie comes in with the development of the first Madden game. In 1984, EA wanted a football star to put their name on it, but Madden wouldn't just take a check in exchange for his stamp of approval. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Instead, he got his huge, meaty hands on every aspect of the game and insisted it be as accurate as possible,reportedly saying\"I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real\" when EA tried to cut corners. Involving Madden in the development of John Madden Football (as it was called then) delayed the game for three whole years. EvenBethesdagot dragged into the development, and wound up suing EA for millions afterwards. There's your drama! That's why I'm hoping we get the unhinged Cage for this movie. I don't want to hear him say the line \"I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real,\" while sitting in a boardroom, I want him to scream it with some \"Not the bees!\" level intensity while he dangles John Mulaney by his ankles off the roof of EA's headquarters. I want him to talk to the game devs with the same tone and expressionhe used in Vampire's Kiss. \"You have to do it. You have to include the dime defense in the in-game playbook.You have to.\" I want this to be his weirdest performance yet. Will it be? Well, Christian Bale is in the movie, too, playing coach Al Davis, and his habit of vulturing awards and nominations for supporting roles (like in The Fighter) might inspire Cage to go big so he's not overshadowed. Madden is also being directed by David O. Russell, known for being a major asshole on set: he almost hada fist-fightwith George Clooney, heverbally abused Lily Tomlin, and left Amy Adams \"just devastated\" on a near-daily basis during American Hustle. The combo of pushy director and award-hogging co-star might be enough to inspire another batshit performance from Nicolas Cage. I sure hope so. If it's one of those grounded, nuanced, deeply captivating performances Cage pulls off when you least expect it, one that elevates the source material to new levels, one that lingers with you long after the film is over… I'll be downright disappointed. Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s. Following a few years as a regular freelancer, PC Gamer hired him in 2014, probably so he'd stop emailing them asking for more work. Chris has a love-hate relationship with survival games and an unhealthy fascination with the inner lives of NPCs. He's also a fan of offbeat simulation games, mods, and ignoring storylines in RPGs so he can make up his own. Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.

Every byte of data that is stored on the cloud (much of it likely containing data obtained by illegal mass surveillance) can and will be used as justification to level cities and exterminate Palestinians.\" The second protest occurred on May 20 during an address being given by Jay Parikh, head of Microsoft's CoreAI: An unidentified Palestinian tech worker interrupted Parikh to say \"My people are suffering\" and call on Microsoft to \"cut ties\" with Israel: \"No Azure for apartheid!

The protests come less than two months after former Microsoft employees Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawalinterrupted the company's 50thanniversary eventto protest its work with the Israeli military in Gaza. They also happened less than a week after Microsoft issued a statement, referenced by Lopez in his company-wide email,absolving itself of any culpabilityin Israel's relentless attacks on Gaza. \"Based on our review, including both our internal assessments and external review, we have found no evidence that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies, or any of our other software, have been used to harm people or that IMOD [Israel's Ministry of Defense] has failed to comply with our terms of service or our AI Code of Conduct,\" Microsoft said in its statement. It is hard to square the claim that IMOD does not use Azure in a way that harms people with the news from Gaza, wheremore than 53,000 peopleare believed to have been killed since Israel's attacks began in October 2023 in response to a Hamas assault on Israel, although some estimates put the death tollmuch higher. Microsoft gave itself a little wiggle room on the 'we investigated ourselves and found no wrongdoing' front: \"It is important to acknowledge that Microsoft does not have visibility into how customers use our software on their own servers or other devices. This is typically the case for on premise software. Nor do we have visibility to the IMOD’s government cloud operations, which are supported through contracts with cloud providers other than Microsoft.

    "title": "Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny represents the design tenants of a bygone era, more often for worse than better. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. There’s a boss fight near the midpoint of Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny that I genuinely did not think I’d be able to get through. Not due to any intended challenge or a jarring difficulty spike, but due to its 2002-ass design: fixed camera angles suddenly switching and changing my directional input mid fight; a huge impassible environmental obstacle just short enough for enemy projectiles to pass over; getting stunlocked by ranged attacks that I can’t even see coming. What is it?A remaster of Capcom’s 2002 samurai hack and slasher Release date:May 22, 2025 Expect to pay:$30 / £25 Developer:Capcom Publisher:Capcom Reviewed on:Radeon RX 7800 XT, Ryzen 5 7600, 32 GB RAM Multiplayer:No Steam Deck:Verified Link:Official site It was the culmination of five or six hours of accumulated jank, gathered up like a Katamari Damacy ball of frustration and pitched directly at my head. Was this good design 23 years ago? I can’t say for certain because I had no experience with Onimusha 2 until now. But I sure as hell can say in 2025 it isn’t. It’s particularly disappointing because, up until that point, I had mostly been enjoying this remaster. I saw a lot of charm in Onimusha 2’s goofy voice acting and stiff combat, artifacts of a bygone era. No camera movement? I remember those days. Unclear combat controls? How quaint! Individually, these elements amount to nothing more than quirks activating my nostalgia glands. Taken all at once—say during a single frustrating boss battle—these outdated foibles make me realize how far we’ve come in the last two-plus decades. Oh, and there’s a counter move in the game—some sword techniques are eternal—but good luck learning the timing for it. The setup for Onimusha 2 is as 2002 as the camera. You control Jubei, the lone survivor of a village massacred by a demon lord, on his quest for vengeance. Along the way he joins forces with a ragtag group of warriors and together they set out to destroy evil. It’s fine. It’s not like I need much of an excuse to go swing a sword, anyway, and this setup gets the job done well enough. But there are some antiquated story elements that had me cringing pretty hard, most of them centered around the lone female protagonist. The first time you see Oyu—during theopening cutsceneof the game—she is nude under a waterfall. The second time you see Oyu, she is being actively sexually harassed by townspeople. From there, Jubei spends a lot of time rescuing her from monsters and other perilous situations. Yet Oyu is framed as a strong warrior-type, a woman who takes no guff, but is in constant need of rescue. This inconsistent characterization felt ugly and left a bad taste in my mouth. As I understand it, the original Onimusha was conceived by developer Capcom as a sort of “samurai Resident Evil,” whichsoundsamazing. I’ve loved that series since the first one. And you can certainly see the influence in the fixed camera angles and progress-gating puzzles. One of the main healing items is even an herb, for crying out loud. But Resident Evil was a deliberately slow-paced horror experience, a structure which was not made to accommodate action-heavy hack and slash combat. There’s an option to play Samurai’s Destiny using old school tank controls, too, but the idea of doing so chills me to the bone in an eldritch way. It’s easy to dunk on a decades-old game for its dated design, but there’s still a lot I liked about Onimusha 2, even if I was unaware there was a block button for the first hour or two. There’s a surprising amount of variety in combat thanks to the weapons Jubei acquires throughout the story. Each comes with a different set of attacks and its own special move. My favorite is the Hyoujin-Yari spear, which can freeze enemies, allowing you to shatter them with standard attacks. You can level up weapons by spending souls Jubei absorbs after defeating monsters, letting you focus on your preferred arms. The game looks great, if a bit sterile thanks to the HD upscaling. Pre-rendered backgrounds tend to age well, as they have here. Environments show off a good deal of creativity and I was always excited to see what medieval Japanese castle or haunted forest I’d be exploring next. The side characters, too, inject a lot of personality into the story. Throughout the campaign, Jubei can gift items to his allies which impacts who joins him on any given mission. You can even control them instead of Jubei if you get tired of him. This came in handy on more than one occasion when I took control of Magoichi, who saunters around with a rifle on his shoulder. Here’s a tip: ranged combat can trivialize some of Onimusha 2’s tougher encounters. The enemy variety is also fun: New monsters are constantly being introduced, and they’ve all got their own attack patterns to learn. But Onimusha 2 likes to throw a ton of them at you all at once, and juggling melee attackers with off-screen ranged attackers had me threatening my PC with a trip to the landfill more than once. In many areas, monsters seemed to respawn indefinitely, too, stopping me from exploring when I wanted to. Combat would've been less frustrating if the default layout of any given stage wasn't “narrow passage and/or pathway,” clogged up the second a single monster appeared in my way. Onimusha 2 boasts more hallway fights than an entire season of Daredevil. At some point it graduated from rote to exasperating. Towards the end I was really yearning for the more wide-open arenas of modern action games. If Capcom is hoping to drum up excitement for the recently announcedOnimusha: Way of the Sword, I can’t imagine this rerelease attracting players new to the series—it didn't work on me. Nostalgia can be powerful enough to help us overlook shortcomings and reconnect with simpler times, when game design was not so wrought with expectation. I understand that you have to adjust your assumptions going into a 23-year-old game, and I gave Onimusha 2 a lot of grace. After all, I cut my teeth on the PS1 and PS2 generation of consoles. But fond memories don’t necessarily translate to modern tastes. Perhaps sometimes, as one special boss fight suggested, the past is better off staying past.

It's been a while since Subnautica 2 first pinged the radar back in 2022, but we know there's a return voyage from developer Unknown Worlds in the works, and it's out sometime this year. We've seen a slow and steady trickle of details on the next dive—teasers from showcases, Discord updates, and even screenshots hidden withintime capsules in the original Subnautica. I played dozens of hours of Subnautica and loved building my undersea base, so I've been anxiously scanning for more on the next journey. But just like adventuring in Subnautica 2, I won't have to explore alone. I've been scavenging the ocean floor for anything and everything on the survival-crafting sequel, whether it be a shrimpy tidbit or a Leviathian-sized lore drop. Subnautica 2 early access begins sometime in 2025, but there's no specific release date yet.Whenever we do make the dive, the sequel's early access period will be available on Steam, Epic Games, and the Windows Store. As for the game's 1.0 launch, Unknown Worlds estimates that Subnautica 2 will be in early access for two or three years. That puts the complete build sometime in 2027 at the earliest. It's quite the wait, but we know Subnautica 2's price will increase at launch, so anyone exploring in early access as the game grows gets a discount. Thefirst Subnautica 2 teaserstirred up more hype for its big ol crabs, but the 2024 Xbox presentation didn't reveal any gameplay footage. This developer vlog dives a little deeper, offering a look at building in the new alien ocean and outlining the exploration game's early access plans. Yes, Subnautica 2 has a multiplayer mode in the works, so those of us too terrified to gaze into the deep sea abyss alone can coordinate in groups of four. Co-op was one of those things everyone wanted in the first game, but only ever existed as aSubnautica mod. There's a whole PC Gamer write-up recallingencounters with Leviathans in Subnauticaas part of our Great Moments in PC Gaming series, and I can't tell you if my giddy terror emphatically agrees or disagrees. But what I can say is, it wouldn't have taken me days to conquer the beginning of Subnautica had I brought a friend to hide behind. There's not much out there about Subnautica 2, but we've gotten a few vague teases around what to expect in the sequel. Unknown Worlds confirmed it's off togreener pasturesbluer oceans on a new alien world, and from how it sounds, there's no planet safe from a disastrously wrong AI: \"You are a pioneer traveling to a distant world, but something is amiss. The ship's AI insists you carry on the mission. This world is too dangerous for humans to survive… Unless you change what it means to be human. What creatures, intelligent or otherwise, await your arrival?\" With regards to the rest of that list, we know about a few more features Unknown Worlds has planned for the Subnautica 2 early access: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford tells anyone worried about an $80 Borderlands 4 pricetag that 'if you're a real fan, you'll make it happen,' reminding us all of the value in choosing not to tweet",
    "article_text": "I simply wouldn't have said that. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite what the daily millions of PR blunders, bad faith readings, knee-jerk hostilities, and people generally posting through it might indicate, choosing not to tweet is often the wiser decision. That wisdom was ignored last week by Gearbox CEO, former magician, andterminal posterRandy Pitchford, who chose of his own volition to tell a Borderlands fan that if theyreallyloved the series they'd be fine paying any hypothetical price increase that comes their way. In the business, we call that a \"bad look.\" The unfortunate episode occurred as part of a conversation on X around avideo published by Nintendo, in which Gearbox employees—including Pitchford—were interviewed about bringing Borderlands 4 to the Switch 2. As we learned in April, the Switch 2 is marching us into another moment of increasing price standards, with Mario Kart Worldlaunching at $80 MSRP. X user@oldgoldsot repliedto Pitchford's quote tweet of the video, saying \"Randy, this game better not be 80 dollars. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag.\" \"A) Not my call,\"Pitchford said, shortly before causing all readers to wince and makeooosounds, \"B) If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen.\" As justification, Pitchford said his local game store made him pay $80 for Starflight on the Sega Genesis, andhewas able to pull that off with Pismo Beach ice cream parlor wages. Nobody liked that. Factually speaking, Pitchford isn't incorrect—not about the cost of Starflight, at least. Games have cost $80 before; hell, the launch retail prices for Neo Geo games ranged from $200 to $300. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Equally true, however, is that telling a bunch of people who are facing continually rising prices when theirwages have been stagnating for decadesthat they need to suck it up is inevitably going to piss those people off. As proof, let's consider the engagement numbers on Pitchford's response: At time of writing, it's earned 1600 replies, almost 900 quotes and retweets, and just 225 likes. It's a rough ratio, and let me tell you, the replies are even rougher. Leading the charge was @oldgoldsot once again, whorepliedwith an eloquent \"Bro you can fuck off randy. 'Real fan' the fuck?\" Elsewhere,user @FaultyOwls notedthat \"in 1991 could also rent a game for a buck, you turnip.\" “If you are a TRUE borderlands fan give me 80 dollars”May 20, 2025 Does Randy Pitchford have sole price-setting power over his company's products? Probably not. But hedoeshave the power not to equate being a \"real\" fan with a willingness to spend more money—something that would be a blatantly manipulative maneuver even if it wasn't on behalf of a game where you'll have to suffer Claptrap's yelling for another half-dozen quests.

    "article_text": "Night School's new project still hasn't been revealed, but at least now it has a director. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After nearly 12 years at Obsidian Entertainment,Avowedgame director Carrie Patel has left the studio to take on a similar position at Night School, the Netflix-owned developer of the Oxenfree games. Patel announced her departure and new role in a very brief message posted onLinkedIn(viaInsider Gaming): \"I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Game Director at Night School: A Netflix Game Studio!\" Night School was founded in 2014 and came to prominence with its acclaimed debut release, the 2016 supernatural adventureOxenfree.Netflix acquired Night Schoolin 2021, and it was a pretty big deal at the time: Night School was Netflix's first studio acquisition, and it seemed set on becoming a player in the games industry—at least in the mid-tier, indie-darling scene. It hasn't really worked out that way, though. In more recent years Netflix appears to have dialed back its gaming ambitions: A new studio aimed at building \"the next big thing in gaming\" wasclosed in October 2024; a month later Netflix's vice president of games Mike Verdu transformed into Netflix'svice president of generative AI in games, and then four months after that he transformed again intoa guy who doesn't work there anymore. There were also layoffs in February 2025 at Night School specifically, although a Netflix rep said at the time that only a small number of employees had been let go and that its broader strategy with the studio, whatever it is, remained unchanged. As for Patel, she's had a long and seemingly enviable career at Obsidian: Prior to serving as director and narrative designer on the very well-received Avowed, she worked as narrative designer on Pillars of Eternity and The Outer Worlds, and narrative design lead (along with Obsidian stalwart Josh Sawyer) on Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Given all that, it might seem a bit odd that Patel would want to make the move from one to the other, and for now we're left to speculate: Netflix has the resources to put a lot of money on the table to attract big-name talent, sure, but it's just as likely that Patel simply wants to get creative with a smaller team. Patel herself hasn't said any more about her reasons for making the move or what she'll be getting up to at Night School, and Netflix confirmed that Patel has joined Night School as a game director but declined to comment further.

    "article_text": "The developers have rebranded and started work on a new original game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After eight years of development, an ambitious Lego Bionicle fangame has been forced to shut down. Bionicle: Masks of Power was months away from having a playable demo, according to an update by developer Team Kanohi, but it had to be cancelled because Lego stepped in to ruin the fun. \"The Lego Group has asked our team to shut down our project in its entirety, and remove Bionicle: Masks of Power from the public eye,\" a statement on thegame's sitereads. The developers say they did everything they could to make sure the project \"was in good standing with the Lego Group\" by filling every mention of it with disclaimers that it was an unofficial game. Masks of Power was even mentioned onLego's official gaming podcast. \"Unfortunately, it seems like the Lego Group's stance on fan-created media has changed,\" Team Kanohi said. \"While we can only speculate as to the exact reason why they have asked us to remove the game at this time, what we suspect is that our project was too easy to mistake for an official product.\" Despite there being a number of official Bionicle games, Google searching for \"Bionicle game\" brings up Masks of Power at the top of the results. \"An average person seeing our game for the first time could easily think that it was an official game at first glance,\" Team Kanohi said, \"And no amount of disclaimers we could put up would be able to change that.\"The demo, which was supposed to be shadow dropped in August, won't see the light of day. However, Team Kanohi has released a full walkthrough video of what it would've included onYouTube. The footage is even more impressive than what wasshown in 2023. Its intricately detailed jungle environments and weighty, almost soulslike combat are extremely impressive for a fangame made with Unreal Engine. It's a huge step up from the janky Bionicle flash games I used to play as a kid. Lego would've been better off hiring them, if you ask me. It won't all be for a waste though. At the close of the statement, the team announced that it will take everything it learned to develop an original game calledProject Rustbound. And with it, the studio has been renamed to Unmasked Games. Unmasked said it won't have anything to share about the new game for a while, but the metallic logo suggests it probably won't be very far off from what it put together in Masks of Power.

    "article_text": "Campfire Cabal was ordered closed in the aftermath of Embracer's implosion, but it never actually happened. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This is a bit of a weird one: Two years after announcing its planned closure in the aftermath of the Embracer Group's $2 billion implosion, Campfire Cabal revealed today that it \"was never shut down\" at all, and that it is in fact working on a new addition to the Expeditions series of historical RPGs. \"If you follow the insider news, you are aware that it’s been a rough couple of years in the game industry,\" the studiowrote. \"Investment dried up, studios shut down, countless developers lost their jobs, and games were cancelled left and right.\" That's putting it mildly. A quick catch-up on how we got here: Campfire Cabal wasfoundedin September 2022 under Embracer's THQ Nordic label to \"focus on high-quality, narrative-driven RPGs.\" But less than a year later a massive investment deal fell through at the last minute, and Embracer's wings were suddenly and brutally clipped: Hundreds of people werelaid off(although none of theexecutives responsible for the mess, of course) and numerous studios closed, including—apparently—Campfire Cabal. \"It is no secret that Embracer Group has recently entered restructuring,\" creative director Jonas Wæverwrote in August 2023. \"As part of this restructuring process, THQ Nordic has been told to close Campfire Cabal. This decision was not related to the work we've been doing at the studio but was made from a purely financial standpoint.\" Wæver said at the time that studio management and THQ Nordic \"have not given up on Campfire Cabal,\" and that \"we are still pursuing our options for finding a good resolution to this situation,\" although to my reading that came off almost entirely as forced optimism, especially given that his announcement was literally entitled \"Studio Closure.\" And yet, here we are. \"Though we did have to say goodbye to many of our colleagues, the studio survived and a compact team continued the project we had started in 2022. At the end of March of 2025, we received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production,\" Campfire Cabal wrote today. \"We are extremely grateful that there were people within the group who fought to keep us alive through the turmoil, and that we can now emerge on the other side with renewed vigour.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "With my 25 year-old Hotmail account the answer is yes, yes I have been pwned. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week saw a fairly typical mini-cycle of bad reporting: an anonymous internet account posted a claim that Steam had been hacked and over 89 million passwords were compromised. The data breach was widely reported, and outlets advised users to do the usual: password changes, enable 2FA, etcetera. Except…it turned out the breach never happened. It could have, of course (it didn't). Large-scale hacks are just a part of contemporary living, and there's no shortage of high-profile examples in any given month. Here in the UK, two of our major high street retailers have recently been the victims of organised hacking, with the Co-Operative's stores having empty shelves for weeks afterwards. Ever since its launch in 2015 the website Have I Been Pwned has offered the invaluable service of letting you check if any of your email addresses have turned up in a data breach, and today sees the official launch ofHave I Been Pwned 2.0. There are some backend changes but, mainly, this overhaul just makes it all look very nice… and has a lot of confetti. Confetti? \"Well, not for everyone, only about half the people who use it will see a celebratory response,\" says site creator and admin Troy Hunt. Yes, you get confetti when you havenotbeen pwned. \"There's a reason why this response is intentionally jovial,\" says Hunt. \"HIBP is a bit playful. It's not a scary place emblazoned with hoodies, padlock icons, and fearmongering about 'the dark web.' Instead, we aim to be more consumable to the masses and provide factual, actionable information without the hyperbole. Confetti guns (yes, there are several, and they're animated) lighten the mood a bit. The alternative is that you get the red response.\" The red response is what you get with your 20 year-old personal accounts that have been in 50 data breaches, but HIBP 2.0 does a much better job of how it now displays the information about how accounts have been compromised (\"we considered a more light-hearted treatment on this page as well,\" adds Hunt, \"but somehow a bit of sad trombone really didn't seem appropriate\"). HIBP had a lot of this same information before, but now it's laid-out in a much more user-friendly timeline showing when data breaches occurred, and you can click through on each one for more information on a given breach, and tailored advice on what you should do about this particular instance. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's way more new functionality, including a dashboard that integrates a lot of the site's existing features, and the debut of reasonably pricedHave I Been Pwned merchandise. I would make a snarky comment here except I'm the type of guy who owns a Windows 95 T-shirt. The full notes on the changes in the site's 2.0 versioncan be read here. Have I Been Pwned is just a very useful website, for peace of mind if nothing else, and now it's easier to use and nicer to look at, with all of the information laid-out much more clearly.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered trainer locations—NPCs for every combat, magic, and stealth skill",
    "article_text": "Here's where to find every skill trainer in Oblivion Remastered, including those fussy Master Trainers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are 21Oblivion Remasteredskills divided into three distinct categories: Combat, Magic, and Stealth. Skills start at level 5 and cap at 100, but Oblivion's hero has an allowance of seven major skills they can prioritize early on. It sounds like a lot, sure, but there's a few ways to quicklylevel Oblivion skills, like enlisting the aid of a trainer. Trainers will raise any of your skill levels as long as you have enough gold, making the teacher NPCs some of the most important people in the game. Whether you're looking to inch closer to level 100 or get a magic skill high enough to cast better spells, Oblivion's skill trainers have you covered. Your seven specialty skills in Oblivion start at level 25, the Apprentice rank, while everything else drops in priority to a minor skill with a much lower starting value. Every skill in Oblivion is divided into five rank milestones that provide unique benefits upon reaching the corresponding level. Oblivion skill ranks: If you don't want to grind XP to level up skills, then Oblivion trainers can boost up to skill points per level. To make the most of the limited opportunities, use trainers to improve your skills that are already at a high level. Trainers can improve any of your skills by one point in exchange for some gold. You can use a trainer to level up a skill five times per level. Some trainers are only available during certain hours, so just skip time if you don't see the training option when speaking to an NPC. Once you fill your XP bar and take a nap to level up, your trainer allowance gets reset. All trainers are divided into three skill categories: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master. Trainer skill names don't exactly line up with the skill categories for players, but they're close. Apprentice level trainers can improve your skills to level 40, and Journeyman trainers can improve your skills to level 70. Only Master trainers can raise skills to the level 100 cap. Master trainers must be unlocked with short side quests before they'll train you. Other trainers don't have any requirements barring a few exceptions (guild-affiliated trainers will only train you after joining the guild). You need a recommendation from a Journeyman trainer in order to unlock the corresponding Master trainer quest. Once you've reached level 70 in a skill and ask a Journeyman trainer for help, they'll add the Master quest to your journal for that skill. Quite a few of the Combat Skill trainers are Fighters Guild members, so they'll only train you if you join up. There's no reason not to, though, since you won't be locked out of any other quests or content by becoming a member. We've organized their respective trainer locations by Oblivion's seven combat skill specialties:Armorer, Athletics, Blade, Block, Blunt, Hand-to-Hand,andHeavy Armor. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Tadrose Helas Bravil Fighters Guild Apprentice Eitar The Dividing Line in Leyawiin Journeyman Rohssan A Fighting Chance in Imperial City Market District Journeyman Rasheda Fire and Steel in Chorrol Master Gin-Wulm Imperial City's Market District To unlock the master Armorer Gin-Wulm, all you have to do is buy and read a book called The Armorer's Challenge. Reading the book unlocks new dialogue that will lead to Gin-Wulm training you. You can buy the book at the First Edition bookshop in the Imperial City Market District. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Uuras Skingrad Apprentice Mahei Leyawiin Journeyman Hauls-Ropes-Faster The Fo'c'sle in Anvil Journeyman Honditar Chorrol Master Rusia Bradus Anvil To unlock the master Athletics trainer Rusia Bradus, you have to discover 30 unique locations on the map. Once you've marked 30 places on your map, she'll train you. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Naspia Cosma Castle Cheydinhal Apprentice Right-Wind Bruma Fighters Guild Journeyman Rhano Anvil Fighters Guild Journeyman Sherina Leyawiin Fighters Guild Master Alix Lencolia Faregyl Inn, south of Imperial City To unlock the master Blade trainer Alix Lencolia, you have to reach a Fame or Infamy level of 20 or higher. Once you've made a name for yourself, Alix will train you. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Huurwen Anvil Fighters Guild Apprentice Fadus Calidius Skingrad Fighters Guild Journeyman Lum gro-Baroth Chorrol Fighters Guild Journeyman Ambroise Canne Skingrad Master Andragil Northern Bravil Before the master Block trainer Andragil will train you, you have to pass a quick blocking test where she beats you senseless to gauge your abilities. If you pass, she'll train your Block skill. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Bugak gro-Bol Leyawiin Apprentice Vigdis Anvil Fighters Guild Journeyman Azzan Anvil Fighters Guild Journeyman Christophe Marane Brina Cross Inn, north of Anvil Master Irene Metrick Imperial City Elven Gardens District To unlock Irene Metrick's services, you need to have killed at least 50 unique human enemies. Once you've passed Irene's personal kill count, she will train you in the art of Blunt weapons. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Nahsi Bravil Fighters Guild Apprentice Rufrius Vincius Anvil Fighters Guild Journeyman Davela Hlaren Imperial Bridge Inn, outside of Bravil Journeyman Ra'qanar Castle Cheydinhal Master Helvius Cecia Bruma To unlock master level Hand-to-Hand training from Helvius Cecia, you have to beat him in a fistfight. Once you get his HP down to half, he'll surrender and offer to upgrade your Hand-to-Hand skill. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Brodras Leyawiin Fighters Guild Apprentice Brumph gra-Gash Bruma Fighters Guild Journeyman Valus Odiil Chorrol Journeyman Vanardo Imperial City Market District Master Pranal The Roxey Inn, northeast of the Imperial City To unlock Pranal's master Heavy Armor training, you have to bring him a silver pitcher and four matching silver glasses to impress the innkeeper he's crushing on. After delivering the goods, Pranal will train you in Heavy Armor during the evenings. Just like the Fighters Guild dominated the combat skill training, the nerds at the Mages Guild own this section. A few of magic trainers won't offer their services until you join the Mages Guild, but you don't need to complete any quests beyond that. Magic trainers account for another seven skills in Oblivion, including:Alchemy, Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Mysticism,andRestoration.

Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Chanel Castle Chorrol Apprentice J'skar Bruma Mages Guild Journeyman Delphine Jend Bravil Mages Guild Journeyman Marc Gulitte Anvil Mages Guild Master Brasla Andaren Wayshrine of Kynareth Brasla Andaren has a ridiculous request before she'll train you in the art of Destruction. She needs a whopping 20 bear pelts for some reason. Bears spawn in the wild quite often, but general stores everywhere carry bear pelts in their inventories, too. Bring Brasla the bear pelts and you'll unlock her training services. Also, novice Destruction mages may encounter a bug at the Cheydinhal Mages Guild when trying to train with an NPC named Trayvond the Redguard. Trayvond does technically offer training services, but the game has his skill value set at 0 so it never works.

She just needs you to equip an Elven Bow. These aren't rare, and you should be able to buy one from a weapon shop if you're far enough in the game to need master Marksman training. Rank Trainer Location Apprentice Foroch Gottshaw Inn Apprentice Mach-Na Mach-Na's Books (Cheydinhal) Journeyman Margarte Leyawiin Journeyman Seed-Neeus Northern Goods and Trade (Chorrol) Journeyman Khafiz Dunbarrow Cove Master Palonirya Divine Elegance (Imperial City Market District) Palonirya won't train you unless you show up with at least 10,000 gold in your pockets. If you're short on cash, just sell some stuff to her and flex your Mercantile abilities. Once you have 10,000 gold, she'll agree to train you.

There are 19 total beggars in the game: five in the Imperial City and two in every other major city. This is retroactive, so any chatting you've done leading up to this point will count. There's no way to check which beggars you've already crossed off the list, though, so a quick tour around the province is the best way to unlock Tandilwe's training services.

    "article_text": "The Rainbow Six Siege X system requirements are here. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Announced in February, Rainbow Six Siege X makes some major changes toUbisoft's venerable team-based shooter, including a move tofree-to-play (kind of)and itsfirst permanent modein a decade. And yes, with 10 years under the bridge it also comes to the table with some new and rather more demanding hardware requirements. Rainbow Six Siege Xisn't quite a sequel, although it is somewhat confusingly described as an \"update to the existing game, to a new game\"—joining the ambiguous ranks of Overwatch 2 and Hunt: Showdown 1896. The bottom line is that along with the various gameplay and monetization changes, there are also significant visual upgrades, and thus hardware upgrades may also be required if you've been white-knuckling it through Siege's OG minimum requirements. To play in the \"new era\" of Rainbow Six Siege, you'll need something a bit beefier: The minimum spec isn't too punishing, and at the risk of revealing myself as a casual I'd say 1080p at 60 fps isfine.The main thing to note here is the varying framerate targets of \"Core Siege\", which is basically the standard 5v5 mode, and \"Dual Front\", the new 6v6 mode that takes place on a bigger map. More serious players are probably going to want to aim a little higher, but even the 1440p/120 fps spec is relatively mid-range for a gaming PC these days—more is always better, but you hopefully won't need to break the bank on a system-wide upgrade in order to get a decent Rainbow Six Siege X experience. Unless, as I said, you're still scraping by on thoseoriginal minimalsfrom 2015: Man, I miss the days when optical drives were part of system requirements.

    "article_text": "Play Doom: The Dark Ages on a PC that's the cat's meow. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hardware capability is one thing, but how a bit of kit looks is just as important to me. Unfortunately, that means I tend to burn my retinas on an awful lot ofvery ugly GPUs. Still, every now and then I'll happen across something I'd be happy to give pride of place in my rig—and if it's cat-themed, then it's simply meant to be. Dave has already pointed out Colorful'sincredible feline-themed Colorfire Meow range, but what made our intrepidComputex 2025reporters stop by their booth this year was the way the company chose to showcase their kitty-cat-kit. Let's pretend you've not taken a good look at the header—which game do you think sucha soft, fluffy PC hardware rangewould leverage to pitch itself to its target audience? A nice cozy farming sim likeStardew Valley? Fashionable gacha gameInfinity Nikki? No, they went withDoom: The Dark Ages. The more I think about it, the more obvious it is that this was the right choice; not only does this prove Colorful's cute hardware can keep up, but it also demonstrates that the company understands its target audiencevery well. Let me explain: On my first point, even the minimumsystem requirements for Doom: The Dark Agesare fairly demanding, so it's an obvious showpiece pick. As for my second point, I was there for the unexpected power couple of theDoomslayer and Isabelle from Animal Crossing. Owing to New Horizons' and Doom: Eternal's shared 2020 release date, Doom fans were evenmodding Isabelle into the game as a helpful companion. In other words,I amthe target audience—not only as a tech journalist, but as a committed PC gamer who contains multitudes. And within those multitudes, I'm both drawn to the gorgeous colourway of Yeston's 'Atlantis' RX 9070 XT graphics card, while also beingutterly repulsed by how the company chose to market it. Pro tip: don't attempt to dunk your GPU in saltwater at home. Also within those multitudes are tastes more elegant than my front-loaded cat obsession may suggest. For example, I've been pining after theJapan-exclusive commemorative 'skeleton' hard drive disc from Buffalo… if for no other reason than longing to smear my fingertips all over its transparent face. Colorful also contains multitudes, additionally announcing a range oflaptops themed after their kitty-cat mascotslast year. Beyond that, there's been little new from the Colorfire Meow range. But you know what they say: while the cat's away, I'm going to go play withthe fake onewe have in the office for some reason.

    "article_text": "The Scimitar kills two birds with one stone for WOW streamers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. MMO gaming mice are a little over the top for all but the most dedicatedFinal Fantasy 14orWorld of Warcraftplayer, yet Corsair has just launched a new one that may have found an even better use for all those buttons. With the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE, you not only get a gaming mouse with 16 programmable buttons but also a reason to hang up thatStream Deck. Shown to us atComputex 2025, but also available on the Corsair website right nowfor $140, the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE has integration with Stream Deck's software. This means you can assign shortcuts for live streaming or recording to your mouse. Though we'd argueyou don'tneeda Stream Deck, they do prove to be useful for dedicated streamers. This mouse feels like a solid middle ground, giving you shortcuts when you're live without taking up the desk space needed for Elgato's little hotkey machine. The best part is that you don't even need a Stream Deck to start making the most of the mouse's software compatibility. Simply pick your shortcuts via theStream Deck software, and away you go. You may be thinking the Stream Deck integration is a bit of a gimmick, but the solid specs of this mouse make it feel, instead, like a cherry on top. The Scimitar Elite Wireless SE gets up to 150 hours of charge using its 2.4 GHz connector, and this figure goes all the way up to 500 hours with the Bluetooth mode on. Both figures are inclusive of RGB being off, with the battery life predictably goingwaaaydown when those lights are turned on. These are pretty great figures, and the Marksman S optical sensor offers 33,000 DPI and 750 IPS, too. Right now, we reckon thebest MMO mouseis theRazer Naga Pro, which offers similar battery life stats, with worse tracking speed and DPI (650 and 20K respectively). Razer sold this for around $10 more back when it launched in 2020, though nowadays, you can pick up the Razer Naga Pro for much cheaper—so, for my money, this is the mouse the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE has to beat. It comes in three different colour variants (Black/Yellow, Gun Metal, and White), and all three look quite pretty despite the twelve extra buttons cluttering up the left-hand side. This does mean it doesn't offer an ambidextrous mode, which is sort of expected with an MMO mouse. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. A neat additional function of the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is that the panel with all twelve buttons can actually slide from left to right, which allows you to noodle with where you want those buttons to sit in order to keep all of them within easy reach. There are definitely enough neat features for the Elite Wireless SE to grab my attention, but whether or not it's a winning choice will be dependent on how it feels. Controlling your stream will only be that much nicer if commands are accompanied by a smooth press and a satisfying click.

    "title": "Stalker remaster reviews crater to 'Mostly Negative' as players lament deleted Soviet monuments, yanked Russian language, and blurry graphics that I didn't notice in 23 hours playing",
    "article_text": "Such is life in the Zone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Reader, you're looking at (an article written by) what might be the first person in history to 100% Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl – Enhanced Edition on PC. GSC Game World properly released its \"fully remastered and optimised\" touch-ups of the original Stalker trilogy—Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat—this morning, free for all owners of the originals, but I used games writer privilege to fully scour the Zone in a 23-hour playthrough over the course of last week. I really like Stalker, what can I say? Colour me surprised, then, that at time of writing the Steam reviews for all three games in the remastered trilogy currently sit at Mostly Negative, while scrolling down to the reviews themselves reveals a sea of angry red. I had no problems in my own playthrough; had players somehow gotten their hands on a different version of the game than I did? Not quite. Take a look at the reviews themselves and you'll see that a lot of the complaints stem from changes GSC made to the games' audio and Soviet-era relics. What has players—especially Russian players—most angry is the removal of the original games' Russian-language audio track. Although the game still has a Russian interface and subtitles, GSC has removed that audio for this re-release (which the studio also did for the collection's console ports last year). \"Iconic Russian voices removed for political reasons,\" laments a review for SoC. \"I'm not from Russia or Ukraine, but I played it on Russian language. And now you use it like instrument of propaganda against Russian speakers,\" reads one for Clear Sky. There's a lot of that kind of thing for all three games, which is perhaps to be expected, but with the console ports also having Russian audio removed, as well as Stalker 2 launching without Russian voiceover, I can't imagine anyone is truly surprised. What is a touch more surprising is that these Enhanced Editions remove bits and pieces of Soviet iconography that are still present in the original games. I can confirm that the monument/sign outside Chornobyl itself, which reads \"ChAES in the name of VI Lenin,\" has been straightforwardly deleted, leaving just the two concrete blocks it used to stand on. This, like the removed Russian audio, is a holdover from the series' console ports, but I confess I wasn't aware of it myself before I played. Given that other Soviet relics, like posters, were also removed in those console ports, it's likely they continue to be absent in the PC remasters, but I can't confirm that myself. I'm unclear as to whether the removal of these things is a personal choice by GSC devs in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, or a response to Ukraine's own laws on decommunization, which forbid particular displays of Soviet and Nazi iconography, and which may have been responsible for acancelled Ukrainian Mortal Kombat releaseback in 2019. I've reached out to the studio to ask about that, and I'll update this piece if I hear back. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anyway, if you were just going to play in English and aren't too fussed about Soviet monuments, is there anything in the negative reviews currently tanking the games that you should care about? Just the one. Aside from the cultural criticisms, many players are complaining of blurry graphics in all three of the Stalker Enhanced Editions, particularly with FSR and antialiasing active. Now, I have to be honest. I've played 23 hours of Shadow of Chornobyl and absolutely none of these complaints are familiar to me. The game looked sharp as a tack on my 1440p monitor, 4K TV, and OLED Steam Deck. Nevertheless, enough people are complaining about it that I don't think you can say they're making it up. Perhaps it's a problem of a particular hardware configuration or maybe I just have low standards, but if you're the kind to be bothered by this sort of thing, it might be worth waiting to play until GSC addresses it. I've asked the studio about this, too, and (say it with me) will update if I hear back. For now, here are some comparison shots I took of Shadow of Chornobyl and Call of Prypiat running on my machine. I'm not on our hardware team (no actually useful skills, you see), so I leave it up to you to decide if they represent an unacceptable level of blur. As for me? I think these are the best versions of Stalker you can play today, even as someone who also misses the Soviet relics. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

    "title": "A titanium-shrouded RTX 5090, outrageous cases, big-screen CPU coolers and more: MSI's Computex 2025 lineup is a cavalcade of exotic hardware and unusual delights",
    "article_text": "Presented by MSI And yours truly has been stumbling all over it. MSI has a tendency to go all out with a wide range of surprising products, prototypes, and exotic hardware each Computex—and this year's show is no exception. Not least because it's currently showing off a titaniumRTX 5090that feels like it'll last until the end of time, among many other weird and wonderful delights. MSI was keen to stress that the RTX 5090 32G Suprim Titanium Edition SOC is merely a prototype for now, an experimentation of material tech that might lead to titanium-shrouded cards of the future. Titanium is something of a wonder material for durability, although for reasons I'm not quite sure of, MSI has decided to colour it gold. Because, err, nothing says titanium like a gold finish. Anyway, it might stand a chance of giving theAsus ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 Dhabab OC Editiona run for its money in the bling stakes, but given titanium's legendary lasting power, it may simply win out in the mega-unobtainable-graphics-card stakes by sheer war of attrition. Moving on to something you'll actually be able to buy very soon, how about the MEG Coreliquid E13 series liquid cooler? It's got a six-inch LCD display that magnetically attaches in either horizontal or vertical orientation to the top of the water block, and makes for something of a showstopping addition to the middle of a PC. Particularly when it's sat inside MSI's mega case, the MEG Maestro 900 series. I'm not lying when I say it nearly made me jump when I first walked into a room with it on display, as it's pretty much the most imposing case I've ever seen in person. Its massive frame supports a three-sided tempered glass window that looks more fishtank-like than any other I've seen, with diamond chamfered edges on the outer, removable pieces. It has lighting (of course) delivered through LED light strips on the top of bottom, which creates a somewhat subtle effect. It's about the only thing subtle about it, though. Not one for the shrinking violets, this, especially when equipped with two internal screens displaying all sorts of flashing information. You can also take out the internal tray to build the main bones of your rig, then position it back in the case in four different orientations. Clever, that. There's no pricing yet, unfortunately, but I'll hazard a guess and say it's not cheap. Call me psychic, if you must. Should the Maestro be a bitmuch,there's always the MAG Pano 130R PZ White, which MSI is using to show off a single MAG Vision Lite 12 display—as opposed to the two used in the Maestro build above. It's a 12.3 inch panel with 1920 x 720 resolution that connects over USB 2.0, either through a pin header or a Type-A port, and comes with a stand so you can position it outside of the case as a separate display entirely. To show off your... no I'm not quite sure what I would use it for, either—although it'd be very sci-fi to have a dedicated screen on your desktop displaying exactly what's going on with your hardware at all times. Or I could display my work Slack messages on it, just to feel an air of superiority over my beloved colleagues. Anyway, hook it in to either case internally, or stand it on your desk and enjoy the view. I like the flexibility on offer here, something MSI seems to be taking into account with many of its components these days. Speaking of all-white components, MSI has also taken the wraps off of three new Mini-ITX motherboards, the B850I, B860I, and B870I Edge TI WiFi range. The B870I comes with three M.2 slots thanks to a five-in-one expansion card that plugs into a socket on the board. I asked to see one plugged in and was pleased to see it didn't reach much above the height of the rear IO box, meaning that you could still cram three NVMe SSDs into a teeny, tiny case without sacrificing precious internal space, should you so wish. Chatting with one of the engineers, I also learned that MSI has to pick the PCB material carefully for white mobos, as \"ultra white\" materials can actually slow down some of the trace paths when implemented incorrectly. The more you know. Oh, and before I forget—how about this for an oddity? MSI is experimenting with designs for a new version of its Cyclone cooling system, complete with built-in screen. I'm kinda in love with the circular airflow layout, as it reminds me of Zalman CPU coolers of old. They were big copper beasties that looked great, but, in my experience, had a tendency to underdeliver on the actual cooling. MSI knows a thing or two about keeping things chill, though, so I'd keep an eye on this one. Coming to a system near you at some point in the future? Perhaps, I'd wager. And to finish things off, how about a couple of super-speedy gaming mice? The MSI Versa 300 wireless and Versa 500 wireless squeakers have been refreshed with 8K polling rates, with the latter getting a Hall effect scroll wheel to boot. Both are ultra-light, ultra-fast, and make me feel every bit of my 37 years. Those fast twitch reflexes have gone, folks. You kids have fun though, ya hear?

    "title": "Former Valve writer Marc Laidlaw says he 'retired too hard', but there's no way he's coming back for Half-Life 3: 'We need new stuff, [not] me going 'Well the G-Man wouldn't do that in my day''",
    "article_text": "\"Definitely the Half-Life part of my life is way behind me.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new episode of Netflix's Love, Death and Robots is based on a short story written back in the 80s by former Valve writer and now professional retireeMarc Laidlaw. Laidlaw left Valve in 2016 but, ina new interview with IGN, wonders whether \"I retired too hard.\" Last year saw the 20th anniversary ofHalf-Life 2, as part of which Valve commissionedan official documentaryfrom NoClip, in which Laidlaw featured. At the time Laidlaw also dug up an old development video on his own YouTube channel. \"I'm like, I'm in the wrong business!\" jokes Laidlaw. \"I should just be leaking information about my old employer.\" Anytime Marc. The Half-Life 2 documentary \"was good for me to just kind of process and put a bow on that stuff, see a bunch of old friends, think about that, the whole thing,\" says Laidlaw. \"I hadn't talked to or seen a lot of those people for a long time. I still stay in touch with a few folks, but they're also not really there anymore. I don't know what's going on there right now, but it was fun to hang out with people and talk it over and it was therapeutic.\" Laidlaw is clear about the fact he has little to do with contemporary Valve, but does execute one amusing industry drive-by. \"When Death Stranding came out, I just was grinding my teeth,\" says Laidlaw. \"Like, does [Kojima] know I'm available? I'd be happy to help do the last polish of dialogue on your script and not wreck anything, but just make it lines that actors would sound better coming out of their mouth.\" As a Hideo Kojima fanboy, I can say with 100% conviction that a Laidlaw script pass would be a huge boon to any Kojima game. But the fact is that, since he \"retired really hard\" and left Valve, Laidlaw hasn't done anything of note in the industry. \"I did kind of expect more interesting offers of stuff to do afterward and was kind of like, 'this is weird: somebody wants me to write their synopsis for their mobile phone laser tag game.' It's like, they don't know what I do. \"I haven't really heard any interesting game offers that seemed right for me. People think of me as, you can come in and write a bunch of stuff for a game. I'm like, 'do you notice how little writing there was in Half-Life?' Sort of the point of it was I hated reading in games.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The interview inevitably circles back round to Half-Life, the mythical number three, and whether Laidlaw would answer the hypothetical call. \"I would not do that,\" says Laidlaw. \"I can definitely say I would not do that. Even when I was there, I started to feel like, 'Oh, now I'm the old guy shooting stuff down.' I think at some point you need to let the people who are the fans and the creators who've come in because of what they learned from you maybe, and let them have that. We need new stuff. We didn't need me going, 'Well, the G-Man wouldn't do that in my day.' And I found I had to restrain myself. People would get enthusiastic about stuff, and I felt like it was becoming a negative force on some of the creative process.\" Laidlaw adds that he hasn't even played Half-Life: Alyx, and re-emphasises that he really doesn't know what Valve's cooking up over there (if anything). \"I haven't played the VR Half-Life: Alyx, so I don't really feel like I can [go back to Half-Life],\" says Laidlaw. \"I don't know what's going on with anything. And it is not really my place. God knows what it's doing in terms of creative process of how to get a great experience that will surprise people. And you have to be right at the edge of what you can do in a moment. And I'm not on that edge anymore. That's not what's interesting to me at this point. So I don't think I'd be good.\" Plus making videogames is just \"so much work.\" Laidlaw says he's \"pretty much done. I mean, maybe not done with games altogether, but definitely the Half-Life part of my life is way behind me.\" I wouldn't ever tempt fate by saying momentum is gathering around the Half-Life series, but the last few years have at least shown Valve being much more comfortable about (and acknowledging) its outstanding legacy. TheHalf-Life 2 documentarycame alongside a polished-up version of the game, and more transparency than ever before about why the planned Half-Life 2: Episode 3 never happened. \"My personal failure was being stumped,\"said Gabe Newell, adding that to finish Episode 3 just to conclude the story would've been \"copping out of [Valve's] obligation to gamers.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "The 14 most underappreciated games of the last year that you shouldn't have ignored",
    "article_text": "Roguelike repair, demonic politics and high-caliber pinball. Here’s some of 2024’s best, once more in the spotlight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Either I’m getting old, or the world is just moving too fast. Even outside of the maelstrom that is current events, videogames are flying past faster than anyone can process them—there’s just not enough time in the day. In any given week, a dozen good or even great games might be released. Chances are a lot of the last year’s best slipped under your radar. Rather than send you scurrying back through a year of reviews and news, here’s a hand-picked assortment of 14 great games from last year that deserve another round in the limelight for an encore, or at least a place on your wishlist for when the next sale rolls around: Released:April 30, 2025Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (738)PC Gamer coverage:88% review(Morgan Park)Peak player count:490$20 on SteamIt's Metal Gear Solid in space. It's Die Hard, but you rescue cats (cats who, subsequently, email you). It's Dishonored with comedy weapons: deodorant, soap suds, sneeze-inducing pepper. I will continue namedropping until you buy Skin Deep, one of our favorites of 2025. As \"Deep-Freeze Insurance Commando\" Nina Pasadena, you methodically eliminate space pirates in a systems-driven environment, manipulating airlocks, soap dispensers, and security cams to clear a path through 16 different spaceships. Like the best immersive sims, it's about creative problem solving rather than gunning your way through (there's a spit button, which can be used to activate triggers from across a room). The movement is buttery, and the deliberate choice to develop the game in the Doom 3 engine gives Skin Deep a unique retro sheen that pervades every corner. Released:December 5th, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (771)PC Gamer coverage:\"A delightfully tactile spaceship repair sim\" (Mollie Taylor)Peak player count:953$20 on Steam If 2022’sFixFoxwas like getting a part-time summer job at a repair shop (in space), then Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop is a game about still doing that job for barely-improved wages after twenty years as the world collapses around you. It’s also very funny, intensely clever and layered with roguelike-like chaos that elevates its central mechanic (fixing strange space machinery under pressure while consulting the operator’s manual) to intense heights. The combination of time pressure and the surprising number of permutations each machine can have keeps things fresh. It’s very clever and there's very little like it. As for why it hadn’t caught on with a broader audience? It’s a bit of an oddball game and hard to really get a feel for without trying it yourself. Launching in the middle of a swarm of early December hits probably didn’t do it many favors. Plus, a stressful, all-too-real work sim that requires players to read and memorize hardware manuals isn’t the easiest pitch. But for those willing to hurl themselves into its abrasive, often-cruel universe there is so much fun to be had here if you’re willing to work for it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Released:November 21st, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (659)PC Gamer coverage:Prototype Impressions(Andy Kelly)Peak player count:336$18 on Steam Starting life as a game-jam project made in just two weeks, then expanded over the course of several years, Loco Motive is one of the best classic point-and-click adventures around, and we’ve had agood fewtopick fromin the past few months alone. It’s a comedic murder mystery set aboard a crowded train full of eccentrics and oddballs, with a twisting story that hops between three playable protagonists. Loco Motive really feels like something Lucasarts would have made back in the '90s, but with higher-quality voice acting, some slightly ruder jokes and less obtuse puzzles. As for why the game hasn’t sold more? Simply put, the genre’s a tough nut to crack. Point-and-click adventures haven’t been in vogue since the '90s. While there have been a couple breakout hits (like the fantasticThere Is No Game: Wrong Dimension), those ones tend to stand outside of the classic formula. Even the recent (and excellent)Sam & Max remastersare hardly flying off the (virtual) shelves. Still, I think Loco Motive might be a good starting point for genre newcomers before they go wading into the deep, dark waters of Sierra and Lucasarts’ backlog. Released:October 24th, 2024Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (7523)PC Gamer coverage:Best FPS 2024 AwardPeak player count:960Free on Steam So many developers carry a torch for the classic arena FPS. The Unreal Tournaments and Quake 3’s of our world still hold nostalgic appeal, but few attempts to revive the genre have been successful. Oddball, mostly-free 1v1 deathmatch arena Straftat seems to have nailed something elusive though. Despite its cold concrete environments and sickly greenish humanoids being an unusual aesthetic, it has asparkto it. Something about its quickfire rounds, huge number of small maps, chaotic arsenal and knockabout casual nature got its teeth into our crew enough to earn our coveted (and highly contested) Best FPS of 2024 award. Unlike a lot of games here, Straftat seems to be an ascendant star, with player counts rising as it adds more maps and weapons to both its free and premium versions, now with over 220 maps at the time of writing and no end in sight. Sure, there aren’t thousands of players online at any given time (yet), but for a 1v1 game, that’s not much of an issue. I hope to see this grimy, brutalist internet fight club grow for years to come. If you’ve not tried it yet, why not? It’s literally free. Released:February 21st, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (800)PC Gamer coverage:80% review(Dominic Tarason)Peak player count:228$15 on Steam, currently on sale You’d think that a new high-speed 3D platformer from the crew of fangame developers and independent speedsters that gave us Sonic Mania would be an easy hit. It seemed like it was going to be, given the reaction to its announcement trailer. Come the final release, it still seemed a sure thing. Despite a few bugs at launch (largely patched up since), it was a great ride, as you can see in my review above. Great art, great music, great ideas and probably the highest penguins-per-capita level design since Antarctica. So why didn’t it catch on? Well, it’s an odd beast of a game, not quite playing like any other 3D platformer, adding a dash of Tony Hawk’s trick-chaining on top of maintaining momentum. Plus, it’s a game that only reveals its true depths on replay, with its level design only really clicking once you’ve truly mastered its technical movement. Lastly, it tragically seems that Penny’s adventure is going to be a one-off. Due to the game underperforming, the studio has effectively disbanded,laying off a significant chunk of the already-small teamafter failing to secure funding for a second title. Released:February 22, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (1,362)PC Gamer coverage:\"I harnessed the power of deceit to conquer hell\" (Jody Macgregor)Peak player count:1,108$40 on Steam Originally released in 2009 and receiving a glossy remake last year, Solium Infernum is still one of the most interesting and distinct grand strategy games of the past few years. It feels deeply inspired by the work ofauthor and artist Wayne Barlowe, famous for his art and novels depicting a surreal, fractured hell fought over endlessly by ambitious demon warlords. While the game’s creature designs aren’t quite as feverishly imaginative as Barlowe’s, it still makes for a compelling hex-based game of positioning, politicking and inevitable backstabbing. As for what held it back from being a prime-time hit, it’s probably the inherent multiplayer focus of a diplomacy-heavy game. While there’s a good chunk of solo content here, the original version put a heavy focus on playing with real humans (in asynchronous play-by-email style to keep things moving at a decent clip). Making deals with real friends and then stabbing them in the back is so much more satisfying than against NPCs, and for that, you need a group all willing to put money down on a full-priced game. Still, even without being a hit, the game is still growing, witha recent anniversary updatebringing a bunch of new content despitethe studio itself officially being \"in hibernation.\" A hellish passion project. Released:October 17th, 2024Steam reviews:Mostly Positive (4303)PC Gamer coverage:82% review(Jonathan Bolding)Peak player count:5,548$30 on Steam MechWarrior 5: Clans is a game I’ve dreamt of since childhood. The universe of BattleTech rendered in the shiniest modern graphics, paired with a high-drama space opera story full of bickering pilots and political weaselry, channeling the spirit of the Wing Commander series. It’s a game I’ve been savouring in bite-sized sessions since it launched, and have had a great time with, but it clearly wasn’t the huge hit that the studio were hoping for,leading to another round of tragic layoffs. It feels like Piranha Games have been trying to kick Charlie Brown’s football. Mechwarrior Online not a breakout hit? The audience say it’s because they want singleplayer. Mechwarrior 5 Mercs’ strongest detractors say they wanted a story-driven mech game, not a sandbox, so the natural next step was Clans. Perhaps the Battletech license is just cursed, consideringthe fate of Harebrained Schemes. But, despite the downsizing, there’s more Clans coming in the form ofa story expansion with power armor and deep space combat, so it’s not all doom and gloom. Hopefully it’s enough to give the game a second wind. Released:November 12th, 2024Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (594)PC Gamer coverage:92% review(Kerry Brunskill)Peak player count:81$20 on Steam The best arcade games can take a minute-long loop and make it last an eternity, and Xenotilt (sequel to 2019’s excellent Demon’s Tilt) is a masterclass at this. Inspired by Naxat’s classic ‘adventure’ pinball games likeDevil’s Crush, Xenotilt is a pure score-attack game wrapped in gorgeous sci-fi pixel art and backed by a banger of an FM synth soundtrack. The whole game is set on a single table split into three main ‘floors’, as you squish aliens and bash robots, slowly making each run last longer than the last and learning the tricks to multiplying your score. If it’s so great, why isn’t Xenotilt better known? Well, in an era where pinball is dominated by monstrous multi-table simulators like Pinball FX and Zaccaria Pinball, a single table is a hard sell. Especially one without Marvel or Williams branding, and nary a ray-traced chrome ball in sight. But oh, what a table it is. It might be a leaner package, but Xenotilt hits different. It should say something that many of the Steam user reviews are from players that have clocked 15+ hours on the game. This isgourmetpinball. Released:December 3rd, 2024Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (2919)PC Gamer coverage:Launch news(Dominic Tarason)Peak player count:1,104$20 on Steam Antonblast was one of the best 2D platformers you could play last year, although it feels like it fell out of a portal from 2002, looking, feeling and sounding like an anarchic Game Boy Advance game based on a raucous late '90s/early 2000s cartoon that never existed. Developed largely in parallel with 2023’s hit Pizza Tower, and taking similar inspirations from the Wario Land series (plus a bit of Crash Bandicoot), it’s chaotic fun, as you smash your way into and then back out of levels in search of angry lad Anton’s booze collection, which has been stolen by an egregiously caked-up Satan. As for why Pizza Tower was a runaway hit with over 60,000 user reviews, while Antonblast is a more modest success? Perhaps just timing—it came later and Pizza Tower had filled that Wario-shaped hole in PC gamers' lives. Also the intentionally low-fi, noisy GBA-styled graphics made for a less screenshot and stream-friendly game. Still, despite not hitting the big leagues it was still a hit in its niche,breaking even within a month of launch. I’m eager to see what Summitsphere brews up next. Released:March 4th, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (2866)PC Gamer coverage:82% review(Maddi Chilton)Peak player count:2,733$35 on Steam Every good historical drama could use a little bit of magic—something I’ve always broadly believed, and found reaffirmed by The Thaumaturge. Early 1900s Poland is an interesting enough period and place to explore in an RPG, full of unpleasant political and social tensions, but it only gets more interesting when the protagonist is a haggard gentleman mage with a checkered past and a Pokémon-like collection of demons to do his bidding. And it looks gorgeous to boot, and while on the shorter side by RPG standards (maybe 15-20 hours), there’s not much padding on its bones. This is a lean, offbeat take on the genre. As for why it flew under the radar, developers Fool’s Theory are a bit of an unknown quantity, and the game’s promise of complex, messy historical politics might have sounded a bit esoteric for some. The game’s combat, while interesting, can feel a bit limited compared to other turn-based RPGs, as you’ve only got one character plus one active summon at a time. But still, the blend of real-world history and vivid, dark fantasy works well. Plus, you might learn a bit along the way. Released:June 18th, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (5639)PC Gamer coverage:86% review(Elie Gould)Peak player count:729$35 on Steam Bafta winnerStill Wakes The Deep only took me an evening to play through, but I’ve been thinking about it for nearly a year. Probably my favourite of The Chinese Room’s games, it’s a first-person horror adventure set aboard a cheaply-run Scottish mining rig in the '80s that has fallen foul of something lurking deep beneath the waves. While there’s a little bit of stealth and some running and jumping, it feels like playing the lead role in a great horror/disaster movie. And as with the very best of creature-feature horror, the monster (an all-consuming, assimilating mass of sub-aquatic biomatter) is simultaneously very real, physically menacing, and also more than a little bit allegorical, giving you plenty of uncomfortable thoughts to turn over in your head long after the credits roll. While I would have loved to see Still Wakes The Deep become a breakout hit, it seems to have done respectably well, plus the Steam user review count only tells half the story. The game debuted on Microsoft’s Game Pass, where I binged its perfectly-paced four hours of story in a single sitting. That kind of length is a hard sell for a mid-priced game as the cost of living creeps ever higher, but I can see this one bringing in a fresh wave of new fans every sales season. Released:July 18th, 2024Steam reviews:Very Positive (1597)PC Gamer coverage:84% review(Maddi Chilton)Peak player count:486$23 on Steam Dungeons Of Hinterberg takes the nostalgic feel of classic Zelda-style adventuring and refines it into something strange and new, with a fresh understanding of the importance of escapism. What if you could just head to a picturesque tourist town to battle goblins, hoard loot and throw around magic spells for a week? It’s a strange concept but one the game really digs deep into, as you hang out with other adventuring vacationers (and locals) between your delves into its surprisingly varied, puzzle-heavy dungeons. As with a few other games in this roundup, Dungeons of Hinterberg was also released on Game Pass, which probably took the edge off its Steam sales figures. But even then, it feels like it has flown under the radar. The game has seen some major updates and improvements since Maddi’s review above, including a comprehensive NG+ mode (complete with tougher combat and some fresh spells to use on the buffed-up monsters), lots of quality-of-life improvements, and most recently a free story expansion with a new playable character. If you missed it the first time round, there’s no time like the present. Released:October 15th, 2024Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (6618)PC Gamer coverage:\"My favourite hidden gem of 2024\" (Shaun Prescott)Peak player count:2,717$25 on Steam I’ll admit to being fashionably late to the party on Drova, but I don’t regret waiting. Now officially complete aftera round of massive content updates, I’m happy to call Drova the rightful heir to Gothic’s crown. It’s a highly reactive, challenging action RPG inspired by celtic myth, with you playing as a hapless villager lost in the mythical realm of the gods. You’re not the only person to fall into this magical, hostile place, and nobody is doing particularly well. In fact, without a lot of practice and preparation, most people can and will kick your arse, take your lunch-money and laugh. Still, the combat is faster and more responsive than even themuch-delayed Gothic 1 remake, making it more accessible than its inspirations, if not anyeasier. I don’t think Drova really had the potential to be a breakout success—even with more accessible overhead-view combat, Gothic-style RPGs are a hard sell—but its very respectable user review count and positive reception highlights that there is a niche here, hungry for more technical, involved action-RPGs. But I can easily see this being a cult hit that people discover and fall in love with for years to come, especially with the changes made post-release. Released:May 9th, 2024Steam reviews:Overwhelmingly Positive (3471)PC Gamer coverage:\"The best sci-fi story I've experienced in years\"(Jess Kinghorn)Peak player count:278$20 on Steam There is very little that can be said about 1000xRESIST that far smarter people haven’t already said. This is one of those once-a-generation critical darlings,recently nominated for a Hugo award. A complex, layered sci-fi story about a dysfunctional clone society at the end of time that’s also a deep musing on Asian diaspora family dynamics. It is high-concept sci-fi about strange creatures from beyond and what humanity might look like after millennia of cultural and linguistic drift, but also about the anxieties and personality flaws of teenagers living under the pressures of their family and society’s expectations. As for why more people haven’t played it, I’d guess part of it is because everything I said above sounds incredibly pretentious. It’s hard not to sound that way talking about it. The game’s stylish but obviously low-budget visuals probably don’t sell it too well either. Plus, its nature as a mostly-linear narrative experience means that the experience of watching a Let’s Play or stream isn’t vastly different from playing it yourself. But thereisa difference, and your choices, however small, always feel important. If you’ve avoided spoilers so far, grab it, dive in and ride it out. There’s nothing quite like it.

    "title": "For this year's Computex, Cooler Master showcases two new PC cases: a fresh look for the legendary Cosmos and a weird-but-cool goldfish bowl 360 Panoramic",
    "article_text": "Buy a Cosmos 2025 and just move in. More space and cheaper than your average apartment. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The annual Computex event is the perfect opportunity for PC hardware vendors to showcase all their latest goods, but sometimes, all you want is more of the same, just with some updates for today's components and styles. That's exactly what Cooler Master has done with its legendary Cosmos PC case—it's just as imposing as ever, but now with a touch more class and finesse. I must admit to never owning a Cooler Master Cosmos PC case, though I always wanted one. It was never the sheer size of the thing that put me off, though, as I much prefer full towers or hulking mid-towers to anything else. The reason why I didn't pick up a Cosmos is simple: I didn't like how it looked, especially at the front.Well, for 2025, Cooler Master must have read my inner thoughts because I really do like this new look. The front reminds me somewhat of Apple's cheese-graterMac Pro,as do some of the interior baffles, but if you're not keen on that look, the Cosmos 2025 also comes in a very classy-looking affair. We don't know what the full specifications for the Cosmos 2025 but it looks like it will be no different from the current Cosmos models one can buy. And by that, I mean you're getting ahugechassis. TheC700Mversion, for example, is 650 x 306 x 651 mm (25.6 x 12.0 x 25.6 inches) in size and can fit 420 mm radiators top and front, along with 280 mm worth of fans on the bottom. As you can see in the pictures, fitting a custom liquid cooling loop is no problem with the Cosmos 2025, but don't worry if you're a fan (pardon the pun) of air cooling, as Cooler Master's design offers baffles to help streamline the interior flow, to maximise the efficiency of such a cooler. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. But if the Cosmos is just too big or just too traditional for you, how about the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic? If your average PC case just doesn't have enough glass for your taste, then this one is about as all-glass as you can realistically get. Cleverly, though, the front glass section can be swapped for what I can only describe as a 'PC wedge', giving you a handy shelf to stick your favourite statuette onto, with spotlights to show it off even more.You might not want to, though, because that wedge also houses a large LCD panel, though it's not clear whether the screen comes with the accessory or if it's a separate purchase. Although I'm not a huge fan of goldfish bowl PC cases, I have to say that the 360 Panoramic, in full-glass mode, looksspectacular. At the moment, I'm currently using a Fractal Design North XL, because its wooden front and big brass power button make me feel all posh and sophisticated (and dear Lord, I am sonotthose things). But the two Cosmos 2025 models have got me in the mood for something even bigger and bolder. Let's hope my wallet agrees. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic.

    "title": "Razer's new super-skinny Blade 14 gaming laptop is a serious threat to my wallet, but I want a GPU with more than 8 GB VRAM for $2,700",
    "article_text": "Help! This is the gaming laptop I've been waiting for but my bank balance definitely won't like it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've lost count of how many gaming laptops I've had over the years. But, somehow, I've lost the love of late. Nothing's really grabbed me. Until now, that is. Razer has just outed itsnew Razer Blade 14 for 2025just in time for theComputex showand I think it's thin-and-light gaming lappy I've been waiting for. There's just one catch. Hold that thought. Like thenewly revised Blade 16, the Blade 14's defining feature is thinness. For 2025, Razer has got the 14 down to 0.62 inches or 15.8 mm thick and 1.63 kg or 3.59 lbs​. The design sticks with Razer's signature minimalist, all-black vibe. Likewise, the unibody milled aluminium engineering remains. And that's a very good thing. Like the new Blade 16, the 14 has dual fans and a vapour chamber, but less of a power bump on the lower surface of the chassis than its larger sibling. The new-for-2025 design and engineering has been enough to earn the Blade 16 the accolade of the \"best gaming laptop I've ever used,\" from our very own Dave James. So, suffice to say expectations are high for this latest Blade 14. Specs wise, Razer has gone with AMD's Strix Point APU, which is a very fine choice for a compact gaming laptop. Specifically, Razer has chosen the 10-coreAMD RyzenAI 9 365 with a Radeon 880M iGPU that sports 12 compute units. Yes, there are more powerful versions of Strix Point with up to 12 CPU cores and 16 graphics CUs. But for gaming in a compact chassis, simply throwing more hardware at the problem isn't always a good idea. Moreover, the iGPU is largely irrelevant because, as you would expect, the Blade 14 gets dedicated Nvidia graphics, albeit there is a catch. At launch, you have a choice between RTX 5060 andRTX 5070GPUs, both with 8 GB of VRAM. The RTX 5070 mobile is a decent GPU, but 8 GB is definitely a little skinny these days. I'd much prefer an RTX 5070 Ti, which gets an upgrade from the GB206 chip in the plain 5070 mobile to the GB205 die and with it a 192-bit memory bus and 12 GB of VRAM. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Razer's engineering has enabled a 100 W (plus 15 W Dynamic Boost) TGP in this compact 14-inch machine, which is the maximum for the RTX 5070. That suggests the chassis ought to be able to cope with the 5070 Ti, which Nvidia offers in configurations from 60 W to 115 W. Along with the CPU and GPU you're getting a 14-inch 2,880 by 1,880 120 Hz OLED display and at minimum 16 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. Note that the RAM is soldered. So, whatever configuration you go for initially, you're stuck with it. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. But what of the sordid matter of money?The starting price is $2,299, which is toppy but not totally outrageous. The problem is that's with the RTX 5060 GPU. Just the upgrade to the RTX 5070 is $400, which is painful. However, that does at least come with another 16 GB of RAM, for a grand total of 32 GB. But you're still looking at a $2,700 RTX 5070 laptop. Of course, if Razer does release an RTX 5070 Ti variant, it'll be more expensive still, likely $3k-plus. But then really nice things tend to cost extra. Part of me hopes the RTX 5070 Ti version never materialises. If it does, it'll be a genuine threat to my bank balance. This is a very attractive gaming lappy after all. Anyway, we hope to have a review of the Blade 14 very soon. So watch this space.

    "title": "'You guys are not Bethesda': During development, The Witcher 3 devs were told by a Walmart rep 'I like you guys, but it's just not gonna happen'",
    "article_text": "\"I made a bet with him … he still kinda owes me that dinner.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Witcher 3 is perhaps one of the most memorable RPGs of its era—we certainly like it—but, like all games, it took a lot of time and money to make. CDPR didn't spin it from the fabric of dreams, and while co-CEO of the studio Michał Nowakowski says the Witcher 2 definitely sold enough to fund the next game, they still had to go around doing pitches and making deals. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. That's per an interview with PC Gamer's own Joshua Wolens, who talked with Nowakowski about the game's 10th anniversary for our Witcher 3 anniversary week. \"A few years back,\" Nowakowski explains, \"Skyrim had launched, and Game of Thrones was picking up on HBO. So every presentation we ran ended up with the words 'Skyrim meets Game of Thrones' … That was a very nice line that landed with everybody who saw it, and they remember that.\" But even the power of a potent elevator pitch couldn't convince some of the industry's pickiest retailers. \"We spent those two years talking to distributors, talking to the manufacturing plants, talking to the retailers. We made a few tours around the US. We went to Arkansas to meet the Walmart people—to Dallas to meet the Gamestop people—and so on and on and on. \"And some of them, especially the ones who were a little bit more experienced, they very much openly said they don't believe [in us].\" Not with any malice, though, Nowakowski is quick to emphasise: \"They liked us, they liked the vision and ambition, but … I still remember there was a guy, he was ex-Gamestop, but he was at Walmart, and we were in the HQ of Walmart, and he said: 'I like you guys, but it's just not gonna happen. You guys are not Bethesda.' \"'You don't have the history of games like that. The last game you made was a very nice game, but it was not that size. Not gonna happen'.\" Oof. Said guy very well might be eating humble pie right now, but we live in a seemingly random and capricious industry—sometimes a hit just comes outta nowhere, defying all conventional wisdom. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Speaking of pie, Nowakowski says he'd made a bet with said rep that's gone un-fulfilled: \"I remember I made a bet with him that if we sold well, I was gonna fly over to Arkansas and he was gonna buy me dinner … That never happened, although I think he kind of still owes me that dinner.\" Still, Nowakowski doesn't bear any grudges, and even he admits that The Witcher 3 was, like a lot of ambitious games, a tough sell. \"He was a super smart guy. And to be honest, I'm not really surprised [he said that] … He was really knowledgeable about the industry. And if I were in his shoes, a very experienced buyer, I maybe would've judged it the same way.\" Mind, we've seen where \"very experienced\" businesspeople havegotten the industry lately, and it's nowhere good. Regardless, CDPR's pitches eventually landed, because you're sitting here and reading this article about one of the decade's most important RPGs—and on its 20th birthday, no less! But it's humbling to remember a time where it was not so, and Geralt's third adventure was but a lonely pitch in an elevator, waiting to be born.

    "title": "Blades of Fire review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Blades of Fire can be great fun, but it definitely overstays its welcome. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Blades of Fire doesn't do itself any favours pairing Aran, its rugged action hero with godlike powers, a tragic past, and a broken heart, up with a much younger sidekick he insists on calling \"boy\" and \"kid\" far too often—but cracking through the Kratos of it all reveals a game that's trying to leave a more exploration-heavy mark on the cinematic action genre. These are places to be savoured, not slaughtered. What is it?Another action game starring a buff gruff sad man.Release dateMay 22, 2025Expect to pay£50/$60DeveloperMercurySteamPublisher505 GamesReviewed onIntel i9-13900HX, RTX 4090, 32GB RAMLinkOfficial site The game truly believes that taking the time to explore its rustic fantasy locales, poking around sandy ruins and enormous crumbling castles instead of rushing from one waypoint to the next, is the heart of the experience. So much so that the game defaults to the hardest difficulty setting, the only one that doesn't allow me to bring up a convenient \"go here next\" map marker whenever I'm feeling a bit lost. And for a short while, it's magical. There's always some out of reach place I can't help but wonder how to get to close by, and every small deviation off the beaten path seems to hold some convenient shortcut or permanent stat boost. Everywhere I go looks gorgeous, whether covered in snow, sand, or blood, and I did enjoy entering new areas just to see what gorgeous vista I was going to be treated to next. Actually trying to progress through these areas is another matter. The first dozen or so hours contain not one buttwohours-long \"drag the NPC around if you want to get anything done\" gimmicks, one of which revolves around a crying child. Pushing further on only leads me to an endless parade of increasingly frustrating and flimsy roadblocks, the game making me stand right in front of the one thing/gate I needed to activate/unlock to move on… just so it can explain why it [in]conveniently isn't working right now. Too often I was sent off to gather several key items split across multiple unrelated zones first, or had to retrieve something I used once in a completely different location, hours ago, for the sake of a single barrier. Not even free fast travel, available at any of the sensibly-placed rest/repair/forging anvils scattered around, was enough to soften the repeated hammer blows to the game's pacing. The \"boy\" that sticks by Aran's side through all this is Adso, a young scholar who takes notes and draws illustrations in his journal as I play. When complete, these notes are a nice mix of interesting lore and genuinely useful battle information, with the two combining nicely. I can learnwhya boss has a particular attack, as well as what I should do about it. Unfortunately Aran and Adso struggle to go two minutes without engaging in some sarcasticbants. In cutscenes this can lead to some funny moments, but I really could have done without hearing the same small selection of quips whenever there's a button to push or, at its most grating points, a ladder or rope to climb. I can send him back to camp whenever I want some peace and quiet, but that just leaves me with a half-empty journal (Adso can't record things he hasn't seen, after all) and sometimes without the one person I need to activate a lever on the opposite wall. At least he's invincible, so I'm free to focus on mowing down the vast hordes of twisted abominations standing between Aran and the end of his quest. My controller's face buttons match the direction of Aran's swings—hitting the Y button at the top unleashes an overhead smash, while tapping B results in a slash from his right. It makes sense immediately and allows me to create some smooth combos on the fly, switching between piercing pokes and broad sweeps with ease. Attacks with heavy weapons feel wonderfully weighty, while smaller swords, axes, and daggers are light and agile in Aran's coal-stained hands. These directional attacks aren't just for show either. Locking on to an enemy brings up a colour-coded outline, showing how vulnerable each of the four major areas of their body are to Aran's currently equipped weapon—and where an attack will be so ineffective it'll harmlessly bounce off. In theory this brings some tactics into my fights—I'm supposed to aim for the green bits, treat the orange as second best, and actively avoid the red—but by and large enemies are just one uniform colour, and if that colour is anything other than green I just switch to a more effective weapon Aran has assigned to a quick slot (he can have up to four at a time, with even more readily available via the equipment screen) and carry on as normal. This colour coding is tied to my weapon's stats and damage type, instead of anything my opponent's wearing, divorcing what I'm seeing from what I have to do. A guy completely sealed in plate mail? Green. Weird skinny thing with obvious exposed areas? Maybe some orange or red in there. For all this tinted targeting, my tactical opportunities are limited to hurting them a little or a lot (or not at all). I can't make an effort to hack off a powerful enemy's sword arm, leaving them weaponless, or force a quick monster to stumble with a series of low blows. It doesn't help that there's little practical difference between most common enemy types; they're all just fodder for the end of my blades. One dagger guy is very much like any other dagger guy, no matter how they're dressed up or what difficulty setting I'm playing on. And those that do require me to change up my techniques are, a bit too often, just That Guy From Before: On Fire Edition or some other obvious remix. By and large, the battle tactics I was using 30 minutes in were unchanged 30+ hours later—as were the attacks being used against me. The rare boss battles were thankfully much better, offering an enjoyable combination of genuine challenge, cinematic climaxes, and truly unique phases and mechanics I had to learn and then perfect. Well-timed dodges, blocks, and parries are essential if I want to survive the lightning blasts, blades, and fiery magic sent my way. I'm encouraged to pay close attention to my own positioning and closely read my opponent's behaviour, while dealing with situations I have never experienced before or since. This naturally led to more than a few lost or broken weapons along the way, which need to either be retrieved and repaired or abandoned and then forged anew (materials willing). I expected to hate everything about this system. I am so over watching out for durability and breakages and wasting my time crafting things out of spare parts. So I was surprised to see just how quickly Blades of Fire won me over. Unless I deliberately go swinging a less sturdy weapon at the nearest rock, durability is something to generally keep in mind rather than constantly fuss over, and I never, ever, needed to carry a small army's worth of identical swords with me. Instead I ended up with a favourite undead-bopping polearm, as well as a sword I was sad to have to recycle for parts after I'd used it until it couldn't be repaired any more, and a pair of hand axes I cared for like they were my children. The in-depth forging process does a fantastic job of making whatever I create truly feel like mine from the moment Aran stands in front of the design slate with chalk in hand, allowing me to select everything from the weapon's handle type to the end point shape and the exact materials used for each major part too; every decision altering its speed, reach, balance, and more. I'm then made to hand-hammer the molten metal into its final shape, \"feeding\" the thinner areas from the \"lumps\" by carefully pushing them along the line, the angle and strength of my blows deciding how many one-click repairs the final weapon gets. It's even possible to auto-forge something to the highest quality already reached for that weapon type, greatly speeding up the process when forging an upgrade or just creating a handy spare. There were times I chose not to even when I could, just because it was so satisfying to do it all myself. So sometimes it sparkles like a diamond, but I still came away from my time with the game thinking it would have been twice as good if they'd dared to make it half as long. The lack of enemy variety and reactivity wouldn't have been so obvious if they'd shaved a good 10 hours off the nigh 40-hour run time. A major plot twist made me groan in frustration, game-long goalposts suddenly moved to shift the focus onto a character who before that point had been given about as much depth and screen time as the farting ogre with a comedy moustache I'd suffered through earlier. The odd bout of fetch-questing can be a great excuse to revisit an old area with a fresh pair of eyes, but too often I'm made to act like a bored fantasy courier, sometimes for people who canfly, rather than a brave hero. Even so, I like it. It looks beautiful, smashing skeletons to bits with a giant axe feels fantastic, and Aran and Adso are great characters when they're not slipping into some \"God of War via Marvel\" routine again. Blades of Fire may not be polished steel, but there is a shining nugget of something good in here; it's just a shame it's often hidden under layers of patience-testing flaws. Blades of Fire can be great fun, but it definitely overstays its welcome.

    "article_text": "Lenin must have written it on a post-it note. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If there's one thing I've learnt from my time with sims like Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, and that one game that gave me thehistoric opportunityto be the first person to write \"Rudolf Hilferding\" on this website, it's that I wouldn't cut it in a time of crisis. Material conditions would slam-dunk me into the dustbin of history like Kobe Bryant. I just don't have the mettle that let figures like Napoleon, Alexander, or Caesar steer the ship of state so effortlessly in periods of tumult. The latest game to remind me of this?Social Democracy: Petrograd 1917, another incredibly me-coded, free, and browser-based gem from the same dev—Autumn Chen—who made the aforementioned Rudolf Hilferding sim. Where Chen's last game had you try (and fail, in my case) to keep the German Social Democratic Party alive and thriving in the chaos of the late Weimar Republic period, Petrograd puts you in charge of one of several competing parties in the months leading up to the Russian Empire's October Revolution in 1917. On a first playthrough, you can take charge of either the Kadets (capitalists), Mensheviks (nerds), or the Socialist-Revolutionaries (like if Tom and Barbara fromThe Good Liferan a bombing campaign). Youcan'tplay the Bolsheviks—the game keeps them for a second playthrough—which is like making a Justice League game where you can't play Batman, but fine. My attempt to guide the Mensheviks to some kind of rapprochement with the Bolsheviks, its estranged sister party, kind of hit the rocks when the latter launched an armed uprising and didn't even think to call me about it. My attempt to commit the Socialist-Revolutionaries to a truly internationalist policy on WW1 (an immediate end to the war even at the risk of revolution or civil war at home) was scuppered by fully half of my party suddenly startingtheirown party. Even playing as Bolsheviks—which really ought to be easy mode—didn't go well. I just, uh, kind of forgot to do the October Revolution? I got really into fiddling with the party makeup of the Petrograd Soviet and someone went and convened a government without me. It's great fun if you're the same kind of nerd I am, and does an excellent job capturing just how chaotic, unpredictable and fractured this precise era of history was. You will constantly have to divide your attention between multiple concurrent crises—peasant revolts, the first world war, famine, inflation, attempted coups by left and right alike.

    "title": "Corsair's Frame series of PC cases is testing a modular DAC/amp accessory prototype, and I'll be the first in line to buy one if it makes it to production",
    "article_text": "Not for everyone, but definitely for me. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I have many interests, and about half of them involve my PC in some shape or form. But I moved country a few years ago, and this meant having to rebuild a decent chunk of my collection of tech. Corsair has shown off a version of one of its cases, with a DAC, which I might just have to pick up if it gets to market. An external DAC attached to a PC, that also allows you access to the trappings of a more traditional IO—sign me up. Shown off at the Corsair booth atComputex 2025, lucky attendees (including a few of the PC Gamer team) got a glimpse of the Frame 4000D case, a case that is already available to buy, but with a brand new accessory at the bottom. Effectively, with this new prototype, you can plug in a guitar or microphone to apply effects, record your music, or just use it as an amp. This new DAC accessory also means you can plug it into an audio source and get better sound than you would without it. A DAC (or Digital to Analogue converter), as the name suggests, converts digital audio signals into analogue audio signals, which is to say it can better reproduce the digital sound fed to your rig. Modern computers can convert digital audio natively, but they don't sound as good as something dedicated. Computer sound cards often come with their DAC, but it's not quite as high quality as an external dedicated DAC. It's quite simple, really. The standard 4000D case comes with two USB Type-A ports, a Type-C USB port, and an aux jack at the bottom, whereas this new prototype comes with an audio jack, instrument cable input, one USB Type-A port, one Type-C USB port, and a gain knob. This new prototype can replace the bottom panel of the 4000D case. TheCorsair Frame 4000Dis a modular case, as you might be able to guess from the fact that you can swap in this DAC prototype like a musical Lego block. It's reasonably priced, looks great, and has a rail mounting system to connect fans quickly for pointed airflow. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. We don't yet have a price on this DAC accessory, as it's still a prototype and we don't have a guarantee that it will actually launch. However, it not only looks great and seems super handy, but feels like it would save on space. My go-to interface right now is the Scarlett 2i2 (3rd gen), but it's a little over the top to use as a DAC because of its price and the space it takes up on a desk, so the idea of popping an accessory onto my PC and taking up no extra room seems perfect. One can only hope this is just the start of even more funky IO additions for the Frame 4000D.

    "article_text": "For all your Mission: Impossible fanfic needs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've had to contend with far fewer dicey data management situations than all that spy-fi I watched at an impressionable age led me to believe—just like quicksand, it's just not a day-to-day thing I need to worry about. Well, TeamGroup has unveiled a portable SSD that'll allow me to live out my youthful Mission: Impossible fantasy with less of a bang and presumably at great expense. The Expert P35S is a 2TB portable SSD that you can wipe at the click of a button—okay, it's more like a click anda slide. Billed as the 'anti-mistouch two-step trigger,' once activated, all data on the device is electrically destroyed and rendered unrecoverable thanks to a patented 'physical chip destruction circuit.' The device weighs only 42 g. 90 mm in length, 40 mm in width, and 18 mm in height, the SSD can easily fit in one hand. I can just picture it now: a latex-clad spy finds themselves staring down a ne'er-do-well in some remote urbex spot. Upon being asked if they have the dossier, they whip out the SSD from some improbable pocket and say, \"Yeah, I have it—but you never will.\"*CLICK* (*SLIDE*) Data management fanfiction aside, the Expert P35S offers one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port alongside performance that promises to shift data up to 1,000 MB/s. Though we've not had a chance to test it out ourselves, TeamGroup suggests that its portable SSD will be able to sustain this rate as the much quippier phrase, \"transfer 10 GB in just 10 seconds, ready for anything,\" is placed prominently on itsComputex 2025display. That probably won't make it one of thebest external SSDs for gaming, but it's decently speedy nonetheless. That said, theTeamGroup PD20is still our top pick for the best portable SSD, so perhaps data management with an air of danger will unseat one of our favourites. The TeamGroup Expert P35S is pitched at journalists, agents, and anyone else who may need NDA-violating files on the go. TeamGroup's display also suggests 'defense use.' Given the doozy of asecurity blunder by US government officialsin very recent memory, I'm not sure how to feel about that particular application. While those Signal screenshots are forever, I'm going to do my best to set aside that challenging geo-political situation just for the moment.

    "title": "In my first hour with Helldivers 2's new city maps, I've caused millions in property damage, been to several Illuminate raves, and committed treason in the fog of war",
    "article_text": "I wouldn't have it any other way. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Helldivers 2 released a huge milestone update today—a battle for Super Earth, and the inclusion of City Maps. I got my boots on the ground right away, dropping into a smoke-filled ruin of a city named Eagleopolis, the thrum of distant Illuminate ships and the warble of cruel, unflinching overseers flooding my senses. Our mission? To protect a missile silo from the alien advance. We set up our defences, dropped our sentries, placed our gun encampments, and rested our weary fingers on the triggers of our Eruptors and HMGs. And then this happened: I did not survive the Illuminate rave. Ostensibly, the efforts of Super Earth's finest during the prior major order reduced the Illuminate forces by around 20%. You wouldn't know it, though. While I did eventually manage to get into a groove, these defence missions are flooded wall-to-wall with ultraviolent aliens keen on dismantling you (and democracy) piece-by-piece. I'd say it helps that the new cities are gorgeous. Arrowhead's mastery over atmospheric fog, weather, and lighting is now met with towering skyscrapers flush with neon signs. Each mission start is a tense deployment into a clean urban dystopia, with only a matter of seconds to collect yourself before hell breaks loose. Without fail, things get considerably less clean the longer we're there. Obviously we can't just let the Illuminate run roughshod over Super Earth, but I can't help wondering if my teammate's hoo-rahs and 500kg bombs are causing more infrastructural damage than a few plasma rifles would. The seasoning on this hellscape steak, though, is absolutely the inclusion of civilians and SEAF troops. Helldivers 2 missions do feel like a warzone, but they feel like one you've been sentinto.A madcap guerilla strike on enemy lines, where the chaos feels appropriate to the ill-advised deployment from your Super Earth masters. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The claustrophobic architecture and the—sometimes literal—fog of war make for a perfect theatre for all these civilians and SEAF redshirts to occupy. Civilians who will sometimes yelp something about how adversity is an honour of citizenship, and SEAF soldiers who will follow you around like lost ducklings if you salute at them enough. For the first time, I feel like I'm fighting a proper conflict. Which made me feel a little bad when, peering through a heavy veil of mist (and carcinogenic building materials, no doubt) I saw what I'd assumed was a civilian running away from some shambling Illuminate voteless—zombies already under the thrall of the hivemind. I lined up the shot from my trusty Eruptor, said a quick oath to the Super Earth flag, and pulled the trigger. Cue the 'you just killed civilians' punishment noise. I turn around. My teammate stares at me through the sights of his gun. I turn away. I turn back. He hasn't stopped keeping me in his crosshairs. A bead of sweat starts to form on my brow. I nod, vigorously, as if to communicate that I'd understood the full weight of what I'd done. That seemed to get him to relax, and we shared a quiet, shame-filled extraction in the pelican. All in all, these city maps are claustrophobic, hectic, uncompromising, and as dense as your average helldiver's skull. In other words, Arrowhead's got the vibe exactly right—and I can't wait to get stuck back in, saving the cities of super earth with poor trigger discipline and enough ordinance to convince the Illuminate that we're probably not worth it, honestly.

    "title": "The new SteelSeries Rival 3 Gen 2 is the perfect reminder of the benefits of removable batteries in gaming mice",
    "article_text": "Gaming like it's 2010 again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I made the switch to wireless mice three or four years ago—it took me a while, I know—and since then, I haven't wanted to turn back. But ever since making the switch, like the close-minded bigot I am, I'd written off mice with removable batteries. They just seemed soold-fashioned, you know? But not according to SteelSeries, which has just released just such a removable battery gaming mouse. The new iteration of the SteelSeries Rival 3 that I've been using for the past few days has me reconsidering my stance. Now I've actually been using one and have been forced to consider its benefits, I reckon there's an argument to be made for gaming mice with removable batteries. We reviewed theoriginal SteelSeries Rival 3back in 2021 and found it to be a pretty decent option if you're on a budget, though not without its issues. That one was powered by removable batteries, and the new one hasn't deviated in that regard: It's powered by 1x or 2x AAA batteries, depending on how much weight you feel comfortable adding to it. There doesn't seem to be a massive difference between this version and Gen 1, although there are some nice new colour options and apparently some improved battery life. You're still getting a solid option for a budget price ($59.99 on release), with a snappy 18K DPI sensor, low (1.9 ms) click latency, and up to 450 hours of battery on Bluetooth or up to 200 hours on 2.4 GHz, modes which can be swapped between with the flip of an underside switch. I've been enjoying my time with the mouse for all those reasons, plus its sturdy general build quality, but primarily I'm surprised that I'm not missing the non-removable, rechargeable battery in, say, myLogitech G Pro X Superlight. Admittedly, that would probably be different if it didn't support rechargeable batteries, but it does. (Many battery devices do, of course, but some don't, given the lower voltage of rechargeable batteries.) Unfortunately, the Rival 3 Gen 2 doesn't come with rechargeable batteries, just regular single-use AAA ones, but I'm excited to get my hands on some rechargeable ones ASAP. That's for the same reason that we love theSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wirelessheadset: because you can charge one set of batteries while the other is in use and just keep swapping back and forth for essentially infinite battery life. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That might seem like a lot of effort, but really it's just keeping a charging pack plugged in and swapping out the batteries when they're about to run out. Compared to having to plug my mouse in every few days, I'll take that—fewer cables, and a mouse that's always wireless and usable. None of this is to say the new Rival 3 is worth it for that fact alone—there are plenty of other factors to consider. For those, you'll have to wait for my full review (watch this space), but for now, I can say at the very least that my previously closed mind is now open to removable batteries in wireless mice.

    "article_text": "Geralt of Rivia's finest hour. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 10 years on from its original release, The Witcher 3 still casts a shadow as enormous as its sprawling world. At the time, it felt like an unbeatable, landmark achievement for the genre. Sure enough, though RPGs have flourished in the decade since, I don't think anyone has yet matched its combination of rich and mature storytelling, expansive open world adventure, and lovable, nuanced characters. Its release hit videogames like a meteor strike. The series had always been quietly successful and well-regarded, but with The Witcher 3, its popularity exploded, firmly lodging Geralt and friends in the global public consciousness. A decade on, those characters are as recognisable as ever, and represented across TV shows, comics, game crossovers, board games, and more. Celebrating the game's birthday, then, doesn't feel like looking back on an aging classic. It feels like reiterating a passion that's never waned—and that only threatens to grow even more as we look ahead to the upcoming release of long-awaited sequel The Witcher 4. And we're not celebrating it alone. We've vistedCD ProjektRED for a marathon series of interviews, talking to 14 different developers who worked on the game about their experiences, how it got made, whatdidn'tmake it in, the impact it had on the studio, and even some hints as what we can expect from The Witcher 4. Watch out for more on that very soon. We'll be posting articles all this week, and collating them right here for your reading pleasure. So without further ado, scroll on and enjoy. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review Shaun's original review still encapsulates what we love so much about this landmark RPG. \"You guys are not Bethesda\": During development, The Witcher 3 devs were told by a Walmart rep \"I like you guys, but it's just not gonna happen\" It's easy now to imagine that the game was always going to be a smash success, but the truth is that back in 2015, CD Projekt RED still had a lot to prove.

    "title": "After 13 playthroughs, one Elden Ring player is still haunted by a mysterious item, only to be let down by the burden of knowledge",
    "article_text": "Olivinus, you clever, secretive mage. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's plenty of loot squirrelled away in nooks and crannies all overElden Ring. Searching around cliff edges, down caves, or just around the outskirts of the map can get you new daggers, shields, and even the much-loved cookbooks, which are definitely worth all the effort it takes to find them. But one item has managed to evade a seasoned player for 13 playthroughs. \"13 playthroughs in and I proudly don't have the slightest idea what the fuck that item is,\"Separate_Finance_183 says. Standing on a cliff's edge underneath Raya Lucaria Academy, you can see a glimmering rare item left on a rocky outcrop. It's much too far for someone to jump the gap, even with Torrent's help, but where there's a will, there's a way. If you go back into Raya Lucaria Academy and head to the Schoolhouse Classroom Grace, turn left into a room full of bookcases, and look for the empty bookcase; you'll find the false wall. Heading through this will lead you down a path to the rocky outcrop where this rare item sits. Unfortunately, the prize at the end of the treasure hunt is nothing more than a Glintstone Crown. \"It's one of those Karl Marx Burger King heads,\" oneplayer says. \"Not worth picking up unless you really like them.\" Specifically, it's the Olivinus Glintstone Crown, which increases your intelligence but, in return, reduces your HP by 10%. But, in all honesty, all of the Glintstone Crowns do look like the Burger King mascot, so the description does hold up. There's plenty of wacky armour in Elden Ring. There's the Albinauric Mask, which makes you look like a sad frog while raising Arcane, Azur's Glintstone Crown that increases Comet Azur, or my personal favourite, the Mushroom Crown, which raises attack power. These types of armour may look cool or complete a cursed look, but they aren't really that helpful, considering the cons that usually decrease HP or Stamina. \"I don't wear them, but I respect the powerful aura of those who do,\" anotherplayer says. Elden Ring Ranni quest: Follow the witchElden Ring Blaidd quest: Wolf man watchElden Ring Nepheli quest: Warrior womanElden Ring Fia quest: Cold comfortElden Ring volcano manor quest: Get Mt. Gelmir That's not to say any of them are useless. The Glintstone Crowns do come in handy every now and then. I used the Twinsage Glintstone Crown to complete the Fringe Tower puzzle, which gives you the Gavel of Haima and the Cannon of Haima on completion, but getting that crown was a bit of a pain, as I fought off enemies and parkoured over the slippery rooftops of Raya Lucaria Academy. So with that in mind, finding the Olivinus Glintstone Crown is a walk in the park. The mysterious loot may not have been anything special, considering Separate_Finance_183 has been wondering what it may be for 13 playthroughs, but at least it's not a cookbook.

    "title": "ASRock outs new 400 Hz 1440p gaming monitor and we're hopeful the price is going to be punchy",
    "article_text": "Supposedly the 'first' 400 Hz monitor When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. ASRock is claiming a \"first\" with its new PG27QFW2A gaming monitor, which we've just spotted on theshow floor at Computex. The novelty in question is its 400 Hz refresh. If you're thinking that we've seen 480 Hz before, even 500 Hz and 600 Hz-plus, you're right. But notspecifically400 Hz from an IPS panel. If that seems like a somewhat academic distinction, well, ASRock has form when it comes to good gaming monitors at decent prices. Moreover, 400 Hz is getting on some and will be plenty fast enough for all but the most demanding esports types. What's more, this is a 27-inch 1440p model. So, it's a decent all rounder you could use for all types of gaming, plus general computing duties, and not just one-trick panel for high frame rates in online shooters that's rubbish at everything else. The panel is rated at 400 nits and comes with entry-level DisplayHDR 400 certification and it's good for 93% coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. So, it's a solid all-round proposition. For inputs, you get a pair of HDMI 2.1 sockets, plus DisplayPort 1.4 and a USB-A hub. For the record, there's no USB-C and thus no single-cable connectivity for laptops. But you do get a 3.5mm audio jack plus a Wi-Fi antenna. So, it's pretty thoughtfully kitted out for gamers. Actually, that's typically the case with ASRock gaming panels. They tend not to bother with pointless frills, focussing on the stuff that actually matters. And that usually means price points you can get on board with. The one bit of information wedon'thave, however, is the pricing. But we hope, perhaps even expect, it will be pretty punchy in typical ASRock style. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. The company also has a slew of further gaming panels at Computex, but none that are actually new. Probably our pick is the ASRock Phantom Gaming PG032UFS,which I featured recently as a particularly good deal. It's a 32-inch 4K model using LG's WOLED panel tech, 240 Hz refresh at 4K, plus a 480 Hz 1080p mode. And it's yours for $820 on Newegg, which is still a chunk of change, but pretty attractive for this class of display. Anywho, stay tuned for more head-turning display spots from Computex.

    "title": "Raidou Remastered is more of a remake, with a hugely overhauled combat system and no more random encounters",
    "article_text": "The forthcoming remaster keeps a lot of the charm of the original and shears away most of its rougher edges. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army released exclusively for PlayStation 2 in 2006 and, ever since then, has been left for dead there. It's an oddity in the Megami Tensei universe, and wasn't particularly well-received upon release. But given the way tastes have shifted, and given the nowadays mainstream success of the Persona series, it's no surprise that Atlus has exhumed it. The good news is that with some modern touches—both light and surprisingly heavyhanded—it holds up pretty well, and will feel very familiar to anyone who playedPersona 3 Reload,Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeanceor evenMetaphor ReFantaziolast year. Thought you'd get through 2025 without casting Zio or copping abuse from a Tsuchigumo? Not so fast! Protagonist Raidou Kazunoha XIV is a \"detective apprentice\" for the Narumi Detective Agency, but behind this humble real world front hides greater status: he's a Demon Summoner too, working for the mysterious \"supranationalist organisation\" Yatagarasu whose work involves protecting Tokyo from scary supernatural forces. In his quest to do Yatagarasu's bidding the detective stuff is a front, basically, but Raidou still needs to solve mysteries to edge closer to his grander plans. Whether it matters to you or not, it's probably worth noting where Raidou fits in the ceaselessly confusing Megami Tensei continuum. Unlike most of its futuristic or present day stablemates, this entry is set in early 20th century Tokyo, which might make it all the more surprising that it belongs to the same Devil Summoner offshoot series as the neon-lit Soul Hackers games. Devil Summoner games are thematically connected by their detective fiction trappings, and Raidou leans into this aspect heavily. But what makes Raidoureallyunusual in the Shin Megami world, then and now, is its real-time combat. Yes: this is an SMT game with real-time combat. Anyone familiar with the combat in the 2006 version might feel inclined to pipe up with some caveats right now, but the most striking thing about Raidou Remastered is that it changes a whole lot more than the word \"remaster\" usually implies. The combat has been completely reworked. It kinda feels like a light remake. The original PS2 version had real-time combat, yes, but it was viewed from a static point-of-view and was pretty slow going. By modern standards it might as well have been turn-based. Now the combat takes place in arenas through which Raidou can run freely, issuing elemental magic attacks between blade-oriented wailing and gunfire missives. Raidou can jump and dodge as well, resulting in a new combat system that rewards precision, not just to stay alive but to feed various meters towards special attacks. One early game boss, which in the original was just a simple war of elemental attrition, now requires deft leaping over waves of dark magic, for example. I also need to know when to guard my demon companions, which results in some truly frantic—sometimes even overwhelming—moments. You won't be exploring the bright lit streets of 1920s Tokyo only to be mobbed by a pack of Azumi anymore, because random encounters are gone This being a Megami Tensei game, combat is all about exploiting elemental weaknesses, but as you might expect, Atlus' famed Press Turn system doesn't really translate to real-time combat. Instead, hitting a foe's elemental weakness stuns them, amplifying your physical damage output and also the amount of MAG you win back from attacking (MAG is basically mana). In other words, I still need to analyse my opponents for weaknesses, and it's still a waste of time to keep hitting foes with attacks they're not weak to. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The real SMT hallmark is demon collecting and fusion, and things are no different in Raidou. Collecting a demon is a matter of mashing a button in their vicinity mid-combat, but it won't work unless you're equal to their level or stronger. In combat I can control whether my two demon companions are using their elemental magic abilities—and thus expending MAG—or just their raw attacks, but if I want to command them to use a particular MAG attack I need to enter a menu. The same holds true if I want to swap them out with other demons in my reserve. As a result, a little bit of tactical breathing room is still accommodated for amid the hectic combat: you'll still need to pause to gain the upper-hand. Demons are used in clever ways outside of combat too. All demons come with a couple of Investigative Skills including stuff like \"sneak\", \"fly\", and \"ignite\" which lends an almost point 'n' click adventure dimension to proceedings. If I don't have a demon with the right Investigative Skill, I'm going to have to go find one or fuse one. I can also commandeeer demons for light stealth-centric puzzle-solving, since Raidou is the only one who can see them. Exploration is also a lot more fun, for two reasons: the environments are crisper and more readable, albeit still navigated from a fixed camera perspective that can make the mini-map very confusing. The other, much more important reason, is that random encounters aregone. Yep: you won't be exploring the bright lit streets of 1920s Tokyo only to be mobbed by a pack of Azumi anymore. It is quietly the most welcome change in this remaster. It's shocking how well Raidou presents in 2025 overall: the addition of voice acting certainly helps, but the UI overhaul also does wonders towards making this kinda-lost classic feel contemporary with Persona 3 Reload and Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance. I was originally a bit underwhelmed by the prospect of this PS2 remaster—why not do Digital Devil Saga instead?—but now I'm super pumped for June 19 to roll around.

    "title": "Phison launches the first ever SSD controller to have built-in AI processing, along with some monstrous random data performance figures",
    "article_text": "It probably won't appear in any gaming PC. Well, not yet, at least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to the world of PC gaming, a new SSD controller chip is unlikely to garner many headlines, as it's normally the solid state drives they're used in that are more newsworthy. But at this year's Computex event,SSD specialist Phison announced a new controllerthat is faster and more power efficient than the competition, and even has integrated AI processing to speed up…well…AI processing. The controller in question is the rather unassumingly titled E28, and it's already picked up anaward at Computexfor its innovation. Manufactured on TSMC's N6 process node, Phison says the E28 sports random read/write rates of 2,600K and 3,000K IOPS, respectively. To put those figures into perspective, thebest gaming SSD, the newWD Black SN7100, only goes up to 760K and 1,200K IOPS in each case. Even compared to Phison E31T, its best consumer-grade SSD controller, the figures are still mighty. That little chip, shown above in theCorsair MP700 Elite, can reach random read/write rates of 1,500K and 2,200 IOPS. The E28 makes it look positively slow. Phison also claims that the E28 controller uses 15% less power than other 6 nm SSD controllers, although it doesn't specify which others it's comparing the new chip to. Either way, less power means less heat, and that's good news all around when it comes to ultra-fast storage. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. As to why the E28 boasts such monstrously high random data rates, it's because the chip is designed to be used in AI workloads and even comes with built-in circuitry for accelerating data flows during inference and token processing. Phison goes on to say that the integrated AI acceleration can reduce training times by as much as 50%, which is a pretty remarkable claim. Of course, the E28 isn't aimed at the general public, least of all PC gaming. It's for mega-expensive, budget-be-damned AI workstations and servers, where the only thing that matters is raw performance. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. However, while gaming SSDs are becoming ever faster in terms of sequential read/write bandwidth, they're still surprisingly slow when it comes to random operations. The difference between the two is that the former involves a stream of continuous data, whereas the latter involves reading or writing data from all over the drive, in a constantly varying pattern. Random data performance is key to making any PC feel snappy and responsive, as sequential throughput is mostly only helpful for loading a game or a level. The fact that the E28 has a random performance that's up to 240% faster than the current best gaming SSD means that a some point in the near future, ordinary SSDs are going to feelmuchmore responsive. So while the E28 is going to be the preserve of the professional AI market, its successors and siblings are going to bring all of its random goodness to the everyday world of PCs and gaming. Now thatisnewsworthy. Nick, gaming, and computers all first met in 1981, with the love affair starting on a Sinclair ZX81 in kit form and a book on ZX Basic. He ended up becoming a physics and IT teacher, but by the late 1990s decided it was time to cut his teeth writing for a long defunct UK tech site. He went on to do the same at Madonion, helping to write the help files for 3DMark and PCMark. After a short stint working at Beyond3D.com, Nick joined Futuremark (MadOnion rebranded) full-time, as editor-in-chief for its gaming and hardware section, YouGamers.

    "title": "NZXT H9 Flow RGB+ case review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Outstanding looks and exceptional cooling deliver hard on this one. The H9 Flow RGB+ is exemplary; what's less stellar, however, is the price plus that rather lackluster rear 120mm fan. Still, if you can deal with that and that alone, what you'll end up with is a killer-looking PC—slick, clean, seamless, and seriously cool. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. This is not a cheap case. Not by any stretch of the imagination. At $290 for this particular variant, it's verging on the absurd. To the point that even the most enthusiastic of system builders might find it hard to justify this thing in their cart. But NZXT believes it's worth it. It believes you're willing to stump up the cash. And I reckon it might be on to something here. The H9 lineup is, without a doubt, NZXT's crowning glory. The flagship, the pinnacle of everything it can throw into good chassis design. I built with the most recent one, in itsElite configuration, complete with far too much glass and not enough intake, plus aRyzen 9 9950Xand anRTX 5090, and what I learned from that experience was that it seriously needed a lot more modern touches in terms of both cable management and how its cooling was handled. Yeah, it was good, but certainly notbest caseof the year kinda good; that's a fact. Fortunate for me, then, that this little number turned up in my inbox. Getting to test the new and improved, redesigned, and redeveloped H9 Flow was too tantalizing to throw up. For those familiar with NZXT cases, you might immediately recognize this as being remarkably similar to the H6 Flow that the company launched way back in 2024. Indeed, in many ways it feels like it's just that case but scaled up. You get the same recessed bottom mount fan slots. The same angular side vent and the same sweeping design aesthetics internally as well. Poke your head around the rear of the case, and you'll spot a remarkably similar internal layout there as well. Complete with Velcro straps and cable management doo-dads too. It's got the works. Form factor:Mid-towerDimensions:50.6 x 31.5 x 48.1 cmMotherboard support:E-ATX (Up to 277 mm), ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX (ATX, Micro-ATX \\BTF)Expansion slots:7 horizontalFront IO:2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen2x2 Type-C, Headphone JackTotal fan support:7Fan count:3x 120/140mm TOP, 3x 120/140mm SIDE, 3x 120/140mm BOTTOM, 1x 120mm REARRadiator support:Up to 420 mm FRONT, Up to 420mm SIDE, Up to 360mm BOTTOM, Up to 120mm REARGraphics card support:459 mm length (with <56 mm thickness fans installed at the front-right)Storage:4+2x 2.5-inch; 2x 3.5-inchPSU support:ATX (up to 200 mm)Weight:13.4 kgPrice:$290, £250, €300 But a lot's changed here. The biggest thing being, of course, those included fans. The H9 Flow is designed with 140mm fans in mind. TheFlow RGB+I've got in for testing here comes with two sets of NZXT's brand-new F420 Core RGB fan grids installed as standard, all routed and ready to go and plumbed into an included fan controller. These are monstrous, and, thanks to that chassis design and frame combo, look stunning. In fact, it's incredibly reminiscent of what Phanteks did with itsEvolv X2earlier this year and, of course, NZXT with its own H6 andH7 Flow. Cable management has seen significant improvements back here as well. There's full compatibility with back connector motherboards now as standard, and NZXT's also done a lot here to improve that particular building experience too. Very specifically, if you do decide to not go with BTF, it includes a pop-out plastic panel that will allow you to run your \"old-school\" 24-pin cables through instead. Go full prima donna mode, though, and the cover just stays there looking entirely flush. NZXT's also included a magnetic, screw-secured door here, along with a variety of SSD mounting points on it, plus some nice little cable management additions here as well, and if you look just close enough underneath the bottom left-hand side of the rear tray, there's enough space to tuck some of those unwanted front I/O cables out of the way. Nice. CPU:Intel Core i7-14700K |RAM:32 GB (2x16 GB) Corsair Dominator Titanium DDR5 @ 7200 C34 |SSD:4TB Samsung 9100 Pro M.2 PCIe 5.0 SSD |GPU:Gigabyte GeForceRTX 5070Ice SFF 12G |Motherboard:NZXT N7 Z790 |CPU Cooler:NZXT Kraken Elite 360 RGB |PSU:850W Phanteks Amp GH 850 Cabling aside, It's remarkably spacious to build in, and, if you keep those F420 RGB Core frames, super quick to complete, particularly as everything is already pre-routed for you. Plus, with that larger PSU enclosure (it's much heftier than the one found on the H6), even if you don't fancy cable-managing everything to the nines, you're not about to see any of it anyway, and you can just cram the lot in the back. Everything is well ventilated, and it all just works. The H6 Flow was a good case, and it turns out if you scale it up, the same basic principle applies. ✅ You want a flagship case, with top-tier performance:You get a total of seven fans as standard with the Flow RGB+, all controlled via an NZXT fan controller straight out of the gate. Slap a 420 or 360mm AIO in the side, and you'll be loving life. ❌ You're looking for something a little smaller:The H9 Flow is a beast of a chassis and takes up some serious desk space. The major downside, of course, is that price. The standard H9 Flow starts out life at $170 or £150, going all the way up to $290 / £250 for the full RGB+ suite. You can kind of justify that, given you effectively get a case with seven fans plus a decent controller, but it's still a heavy investment straight out of the gate, and it's not all brilliant either; the H9 Flow does have problems. The topmost radiator mounting location still doesn't have a removable bracket (although the angled side intake does); the F120 fan in the rear, compared to all of the F420s in the chassis, feels cheap and lackluster and just hasn't had a refresh yet like the other dual+ fan solutions (it lacks the side illumination and cleaner look); and the internal paint job just feels like the same you find on an $80 case, not ideal for what it is. Still, these are all fairly minor quibbles in the grand scheme of things. If you can pony up the cash and don't mind NZXT's F Core fans, this thing is an absolute treat. Not only does it look the part, but it keeps things seriously chilled and controlled while it does it. No fuss. No mess. Just a simple, easy rig. Outstanding looks and exceptional cooling deliver hard on this one. The H9 Flow RGB+ is exemplary; what's less stellar, however, is the price plus that rather lackluster rear 120mm fan. Still, if you can deal with that and that alone, what you'll end up with is a killer-looking PC—slick, clean, seamless, and seriously cool.

I've been staring too long into the infinite void of Zotac's custom PC case, and I believe it may be expanding the borders of my consciousness at an alarming rate. Either that, or my coffee this morning wasn't entirely regular. Anyway, the custom case stands in Zotac's booth at Computex 2025, drawing in unwary tech journalists like moths to a flame. There I was looking at some perfectly respectable graphics cards, and then boom, my third eye was irreparably squeegee-d. I can now taste colours, and my playlist is full of The Grateful Dead.

    "title": "Will 2025 be the year that CAMM2 memory finally makes a proper entrance? Rambus and Team Group believe it is",
    "article_text": "All aboard for the CAMM2 can-can. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been two years since the CAMM2 RAM format made an appearance, but despite support from the biggest memory vendors around, such asMicron, we've yet to see it make any real headway in the RAM market. However, at Computex 2025, there were clear signs that this could be the year that the low-profile memory format finally appears in our gaming PCs. If you're unfamiliar withCAMM2, here's a brief rundown on what makes it different from the RAM sticks we're all familiar with. The new format (can I still call itnewwhen it's been around for a couple of years?) still uses the same DDR5 chips that every new gaming PC, laptop, and handheld uses, but they're housed in a very different way.Instead of using vertical circuit boards that fit into multiple slots, the RAM chips are soldered onto a single, horizontal board, which is then attached to a port on the motherboard and screwed in place. The system allows for better signalling, more power, and easier cooling. Three wins all round. Despite its advantages over traditional RAM formats, CAMM2 and its low-powered version, LPCAMM2, have yet to make headway in the PC market. But I reckon that's about to change, and for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we've been seeing a variety of CAMM2 add-ons at this year's Computex event. For example, Team Group showcased its new CAMM2 DDR5-8000 module, replete with a very cool-looking RGB heatsink. So what, you may think. Well, Team Group doesn't go down the road of experimental, bespoke technology like some vendors do—it prefers to stick to markets that it knows and sells well in. So if Team Group is onboard the CAMM2 train, then others won't be far behind. Something else that's convinced me that 2025 is going to be CAMM2's year is the fact that Rambus has joined in the fun, too, releasing its own range of flat memory modules for desktops, servers, and laptops. Rambus isn't as big a player in the RAM market as the likes of Samsung and Crucial, so it must have good reasons for joining the club. I asked Rambus how it sees things changing in the memory market, with regards to the uptake of CAMM2. \"We expect LPCAMM2 will progressively gain market adoption in notebook PCs later this year, with continued growth into 2026 and beyond,\" said Peiro Bianco, Rambu's senior director of product marketing. \"To support this transition, Rambus has developed a complete PMIC and SPD chipset, helping businesses stay ahead of the adoption curve and enabling AI-powered notebooks to meet growing memory demands.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. With Team Group going all CAMM2 gamer RGB and Rambus targeting the continued growth of AI PCs with its LPCAMM2 tech, I'm pretty certain that we're going to see a raft of new CAMM2 motherboards from all the big vendors later this year. The performance of GPUs and CPUs is starting to stagnate a little, or rather, the generational increases are becoming ever smaller. However, there's still a lot of scope for memory to operate much faster, either through ultra-high clock speeds or via super-tight latencies, or indeed both.CUDIMMsare another way of achieving this, but because they use the traditional DIMM format, they're not as easy to cool as CAMM2 modules. I don't expect anyone will rush out to buy a new CAMM2 motherboard, of course, as the first generation of them is likely to be quite pricey. But once OEMs and system builders are churning out rigs sporting the funky, flattened RAM, there should be CAMM2 goodies for every budget.

    "article_text": "Don't cry, little Cooler Master liquid cooler, it's okay. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've ever wanted to personify the cooling solution in your gaming rig, Cooler Master has just shown off the best way of doing so with its new liquid coolers. If you want something a little more, well, useful, you can instead show off the temps of your rig, but that's just a little boring. We've got a few members of the PC Gamer team out atComputex 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan. With that comes the unique opportunity to see aDoom-themed RTX 5080, a500 Hz OLED monitor that detects when you've left it on, and, well, a crying liquid cooler screen. That screen is connected to theMasterliquid Atmos II series, which has just launched. A screen that makes you sad every time you look at it is not the onlycoolthing about Cooler Master's new liquid cooler. It has a low-profile pump, which means it can fit into smaller cases, and promises a \"quieter operation\", alongside \"exceptional cooling performance\". That screen is optional, as the top of the pump is modular, accepting LCD or Pixel LED screens. If you don't want a screen, it also works with a VRM Fan, which Cooler Master claims \"can reduce temperatures by up to 13°C.\" Buying the cooler will get you two differently colored decorative plates that snap on thanks to the help of magnets. This all means that whether you want a screen, an extra fan, or just a nice-looking top, you can pop it on the top of the Atmos II with little effort. This change plays into what Cooler Master calls \"FreeForm 2.0\". On this, Cooler Master CEO Jimmy Sha says, \"FreeForm 2.0 embodies this belief, giving our community the tools to customize, adapt, and reimagine their tech like never before.\" Effectively, this means Cooler Master is implementing more modular or customizable tech in its products, like theQube Series flatpack caseandDyn X racing simulator.

Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. This move to more modular hardware should mean more ability for PC builders to add some personal flair to their builds. However, modular tech is only as good as the support it gets, so I hope Cooler Master continues down this route. The Atmos II liquid cooler comes in two different variants, the 360 and 240. This dictates the size of the cooler, the 360 being 360 mm and the 240 being, you guessed it, 240 mm. It comes with support for major Intel and AMD processors, though we don't have the price point just yet. James is a more recent PC gaming convert, often admiring graphics cards, cases, and motherboards from afar.

    "article_text": "This speaks to my nerdiest desires. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're the type of person to load up HWInfo religiously to check your system stats, this might be for you. Hyte's Thicc Q60 liquid cooler, the one with a 5-inch screen and Arm processor attached to it, will soon show you key stats as a chart, so you always have access to key system stats over time. If that sounds like the world's most boring spectator sport, you've come to the wrong place—it looks pretty handy. It's an update coming with Nexus app version 2.4, which is currently in alpha but will be ready to go soon, and allows you to chart any key component's sensor data onto the cooler itself. For an at-a-glance view of your gear's temps or utilisation, it looks pretty useful, and at the very least speaks to my obsessive need to know what temperature my CPU is at all times. Of course, you need a Q60 cooler to benefit. That or the upcoming Q80, the triple-fan version, though that has been a long time coming. Hyte says that should be shipped out to those that pre-ordered soon, but otherwise it's still on a bit of a backlog, not helped by delays or pauses on many of its products shipping to the US due to tariffs. Those are still affecting Hyte's supply of parts despite recent US/China tariff deals, I'm told. Another feature headed our way with the 2.4 update is the ability to control your system RGB via the Nexus app through the Y70 touchscreen. If you have the screen already installed, this means you can skim through the options for changing RGB lighting right there on your case and see those changes pretty swiftly displayed by your case lighting. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Yet the one feature I'm waiting for on the Q60? The ability to orient the screen landscape.

    "article_text": "Computex is chocked full of colourful cases. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clean lines and angular edges dominate the world of PC cases today, but not over at Hyte's display at Computex 2025. The case and cooling company has put together something slightly out of time, a rounded, mesh creation called the X50. There are actually two cases, the X50 and X50 Air, coming in at $150 and $120 respectively. The X50 received all the air time at Hyte's booth, however, coming with a 4 mm thick \"laminated acoustic glass\" side panel and in various colourways, including black, white, red, pink, and green. Hyte has more fanciful names for each, obvs. The case's main schtick is the mesh front panel, lacking any sort of dust filter as Hyte claims the dust will stick to the outer holes rather than make its way inside due to their size. I'm definitely keen to see how that plays out after long-term use, and to see how much these holes affect airflow due to their size, but Hyte is pretty confident in this case, even calling it a \"modern performance case\". This front panel went through heaps of iterations to get manufactured too, due to the complexity of its rounded, mesh edges and mounting. Hyte made no issue of telling me that it had only been a matter of weeks since they finalised the design and received shipments of the removeable front panel. \"We are actually using automotive grade tooling to manufacture this which has four times higher tolerances than traditional case manufacturing tooling,\" Ish Patel, Hyte representative, tells me. There's room for 3x 140 mm fans up front and a reasonably large radiator should fit here too, up to but not including a 420 mm rad. There's room for more fans in the bottom of the case, protected from sucking up dust like a hoover by a dust filter, and the twisted rear of this case has space for another fan. In the rear, plenty of cable management, and what you might notice is the PSU mounting location at the top of the case. This might increase PSU temps a little—though we'll have to test that—but Hyte says this allows the PSU cables to fall naturally into place and makes building easier. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The white and black cases have 'bar feet' and the colourful cases have 'paw feet'. Overall, Hyte is taking a couple risks with the X50. The lack of dust filter on the front, the PSU mounted up top, and the fact it's a bit of a risky design, out of step with today's current market, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's great to see something a little different in design from the usual parade of modern cases, though I do wonder for its mainstream appeal. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. There's good news for Y70 and X50 fans out there, though. Hyte has put together a 120 mm, 1,500 rpm fan, the Flow FA12, in four different colourways to match its current case lineup. That's Snow White, Taro, Matcha, and Strawberry—see, I told you Hyte had more fanciful names for this stuff. There are also PCIe 5.0 'Hyper Risers' on the way, to colour match the Y70 cases. Hyte has put a pause on shipping some products to the US in recent months due to tariffs. While some tariffs have since been paused or adjusted, Hyte tells me that the US pricing for some of its products will still be affected for a while. I'm told that global availability and pricing is unaffected. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "article_text": "Say 'so long' to iCue. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rejoice! Our collective grumbling has been heard and peripheral makers are finally moving away from packing in one more bit of software to harangue your rig at start up. Corsair already announced itsfirmware updaterwebsite last month, but it's now taking things one step further by announcingCorsair Web Hub—a 'web-based utility engine' that allows you to customise your peripherals without dedicating precious SSD space to iCue. Speaking of peripherals, Corsair also announced a fresh keyboard to go along with its Web Hub announcement. The newMAKR 75 Barebones Keyboard Kitis pitched as being both delectably DIY while also offering a 'performance-focused' board for gaming. I've not been trusted with a DIY keyboard project sincethe great key cap disappearance of 2024, but for everyone else without my oddly specific problem, the MAKR 75 may offer a keeb fiend's dream. Alongside a ludicrously high 8K polling rate, this keyboard also offers Corsair'sFlashTap SOCD. It's a feature set that will likely please the players with esports aspirations, but there's still plenty on offer for folks like me who bruised their index finger missing parries inClair Obscur: Expedition 33. The vice president and general manager of gaming peripherals at Corsair explained, \"We truly believe that assembling an ultra-personalized DIY keyboard does not need to be a difficult task that can only be completed by the most hardcore keyboard enthusiasts. MAKR 75 was developed around the concept of an intuitive, layer-by-layer building process that makes the satisfying task of designing and assembling your perfect keyboard as simple as possible.\" As Corsair tells it, the MAKR 75 offers robust construction with screw-in stabilizers, and sturdy gasket mounting in an either silver or black aluminium frame. Importantly for me—a recent enjoyer of theBe Quiet Light Mount—all of that is combined with not one, not two, not even three buteightlayers of sound dampening. It's not yet clear whether this is silicone, foam, or both, but I'm expecting a quiet, cushioned typing experience from this board. Interestingly, Corsair also mentions \"support for additional enhancements through add-on modules.\" Whether this is along the lines of customising the MAKR 75's innards by, hypothetically speaking, addingeven moresound dampening or actually modular attachments likeBe Quiet's Dark Mountis not yet completely clear to me. What we do know is the full kit will allow you to include a wireless module to make your MAKR board cable-free, as well as the option to drop in a rotary dial module (because who doesn't love a good tactile twiddle) or even a wee LCD screen. Naturally, you also have your pick of keycap designs and Corsair switches too. I'm partial to the Celestial keycap designs myself, but cherry blossoms, a purple-y 'sci-fi' colourway, and more also feature. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Apparently the MAKR 75 has already won Corsair an iF Design Award so this keeb fiend has high expectations. Add to that a web-based means of noodling with RGB lighting profiles alongside my macros, and I may have reason to welcome another Corsair keyboard onto my crowded desk.

    "title": "Corsair made a see-through PSU because everything looks better when you can see its innards... welp, that came out weird",
    "article_text": "I just mean translucent tech is cool, leave me alone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Corsair has put together a sneaky concept forComputex 2025in Taiwan this year. Sneaky because 1) it was hidden at the bottom of a crowded case and surrounded by cables, and 2) it is quite literally transparent. It's a Corsair HX1000i Shift, which is a new PSU model being introduced by Corsair. This one is slightly different in that it's see-through. It's also just a prototype, though I and likely everyone else at Corsair's Computex event tried to convince them to make it the real deal. Is a power supply an interesting component to look inside of? Not massively, and you shouldn't go prodding inside one either as you might actually die. Seriously, don't do that. But as someone that enjoys a chunky power supply for no discernible reason, I appreciate the complete pointlessness of it, and the gall of Corsair to make a prototype see-through power supplyandnot make a big fuss about it. Seriously, you could easily have missed this thing at its booth and that's not just a joke about it being see-through. Though it does highlight, in a roundabout way, the new power supplies Corsair is releasing right now. Includingnew Shift HXi models: 1000 W, 1200 W, and 1500 W. These are all Platinum Cybenetics certified and fully modular, with a 140 mm fan and a 10-year warranty. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Shift part means that this power supply has its power connectors on the side, rather than the back, for easier access in compatible cases. I've given it a go in the past, and it's a pretty neat solution if you have all the Corsair bits to go with it. Speaking of Corsair bits, the company has also added a new feature to its latest HXi PSUs: an iCUE Link System Hub right there on your power supply. This supports up to 24 iCUE Link devices, such as fans or RGB lighting. This saves you from having to plug one in and using up a precious PCIe power connector, which each System Hub demands, and which can be in short supply with anRX 9070 XTin your system. Ask me how I know. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. There's one last thing to mention on this prototype PSU. It was being used in conjunction with aPowerBoard, by Singularity Computers, a motherboard tray that acts as a intermediary PCB to keep down cable clutter and allow for shorter cable runs to and from the PSU. It's a neat idea, if only really serving to neaten up the back of your build a bit, which is usually not very visible anyways. It's also slightly outgunned by a BTF motherboard, though they do achieve slightly different results. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

Custom keycaps have never been my thing, despite having an appreciation for those who like their keys in a variety of themes. These custom Godzilla andMechagodzillakeycaps, though? Ah, go on then, I'll take a set. Or several, if I'm honest. TheKeytocbooth at this year's Computex made me stop dead in my tracks. Any glimpse of Godzilla is absolutely worth investigation, but when I saw these little miniature mega-lizard heads staring up at me, imprisoned in their adorable little boxes, I knew I had to tell the world of their existence. I stood at the booth and tapped for a while, and can confirm that these feel like quality caps. The PBT + PC construction feel plenty sturdy under the right switch, and the dye job on the graphics is picture perfect, with every illustration lining up in a very pleasing way. Okay, so I'm not necessarily a custom keycaps guy, but I have been around enough high-endgaming keyboardsto know a good one from a bad one, and these are impressive. They're also fairly well-priced, starting at$79 for the basic setand $19 extra for one of the Godzilla head resin keycaps shown above. Not bad for your own dedicated \"rawwr\" button, if you ask me. They're Cherry MX compatible, too. Plus, you could pretend you were saving Tokyo every time you rammed your finger down on the escape key. Just me then? Just me. Still, Godzilla or Mechagodzilla, I reckon these are the best keycaps I've seen so far this show, and believe me, I've seen plenty. Oh look, there's just enough space left for another rawrr-ful pun.

    "title": "The Corsair Air 5400 offers such a clever and unique approach to CPU cooling, I'm surprised no one did it sooner",
    "article_text": "This case has triple chambers, but not in the way you might imagine. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Corsair has created what it holds to be the first triple-chamber PC case. One chamber for the parts, one chamber for the PSU and cables, and one special chamber that only houses a 360 mm radiator. This is designed to get the hot air out of your case as quickly as possible, without heating up any other components. From one side of the Air 5400, it looks more or less like a fishtank-style chassis, with a glass front and side panel to showcase the parts inside. It features top and bottom fan mounting locations, essentially forming a chimney of cool air over your components, like a few other popular cases of this style. However, it does differ to others in that Corsair tells me it's harnessing certain concepts of the Venturi effect, the same used by modern F1 cars to keep them glued to the track, to speed up the airflow through the case. I'm not sure how much of that Venturi effect stuff is marketing or science but it has installed plastic housing for the top and bottom mounted fans that shrink at the edge to, presumably, aid in the pressure/speed change that the Venturi effect would produce. This Venturi design determines this case to only use 120 mm fans, but that's no big issue if all Corsair's promises for top-notch cooling are true. As a fan of the original Air 540, it's no surprise I love the look here, and the glass and mesh two-tone front panel looks smart. But there's more to this design that aesthetics. Turn the case around to the side and that's where things really get interesting. Behind the front panel mesh is a 360 mm radiator. This is the AiO for the CPU and it's located in its own special chamber, away from the rest of the components. The tubes going between the radiator and CPU are pushed through a brush, rather than a rubber grommet, to keep the hot air separated from the rest of the case. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Look to the side panel and you'll noticed a gap where the side panel should be at the front of the case. This is a side chamber, the rare third chamber of this chassis, and has what can most easily be described as a plastic diffuser—again with the race car lingo—installed within. This is designed to throw the hot air from the radiator out from the side of the case and away from your other components. That's nearly enough excitement for one PC case, but peel away the side panel and the PSU and rear of the motherboard tray are revealed. Corsair has introduced a new mounting system for cables around the rear of the case, and it's essentially a pegboard for your PC. It has specialised cable holders that clip into the holes surrounding the motherboard plate, but you can just as easily attach cables with a couple zip-ties. It's a little more aesthetically pleasing than a couple straps, though you will have to be more purposeful with your cable runs and planning to really make the most of it. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're stalking the halls of Taiwan's biggest tech show once again to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to offer. This new cable management system/tray is also on the new Frame 5000D, which is a step-up from theCorsair Frame 4000DI reviewed last month. And good news there, too. The Frame 4000D will be getting a slight iteration with thicker sheets of metal, which should help with some of the flex that I reported in my review. One last thing. The Air 5400 only features Type-C USB ports on its front panel IO. No more Type-A, and I'm told we might see more of that as EU regulation takes hold and boots Type-A to the curb. With all that, the Air 5400 is shaping up to be a bit of a beast. I'm certainly hoping to take a look at one, as a fan of its spiritual predecessor, or at least I assume, the Air 540. Though one slight down note to end on is that this remains a concept for now. I got vaguely positive vibes for its eventual release, but I wonder if we'll see things like the Venturi fan shrouds make it into the shipping product, if there indeed ever is one.

    "article_text": "No new Intel Arc GPU for gamers at Computex. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel has announced newIntel Arc Pro B50 and B60 GPUs at Computex. The latter even serves up a hefty 24 GB of VRAM. Cue much rejoicing? Not for gamers, as these are not graphics cards aimed at games and, deep down, they're not actually new. So, what is actually going on? Last week we reported on acryptic posts on X by an official Intel accounttelling gamers showing interest in a new GPU from Intel to \"stay tuned.\" Well, there definitely isn't a new gaming GPU at theComputex showand we've been told directly by Intel that the posts on X were a miscommunication by an over-eager social media manager. Bummer. Anyway, the \"new\" Intel Arc Pro B50 and B60 GPUs use the same Intel G21 silicon as Intel's existing Arc B570 and B580 gaming GPUs. In other words, this is not the first outing of therumoured high-performance G31 chip that we've been hoping for. For AI and other pro workflows, these new cards could be quite compelling, especially the B60 with its 24GB of VRAM (not to mention the funkydual B60 board Jacob spotted at Computex with two G21 GPUs and 48 GB of VRAM). But they're simply not gaming relevant. As for when we might expect to see a new gaming GPU from Intel, that's hard to say. Reference to an Intel Arc B750 GPU has beenspotted on Intel's Japanese website. However, that is unambiguously a typo in the header. The full list of specifications belowclearly states \"B570\" and likewise lists the specs for the B570. It was all a false alarm, unfortunately. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Long story short, there's no chance Intel is announcing a new gaming GPU at Computex and virtually no chance it will announce one shortly after. At soonest, we might see something around September. But even that is speculative and it could come later. Indeed, there's no reason to assume that a new G31 GPU based on the current Battlemage generation of Intel graphics technology will ever appear. It may. It quite easily may not. Catch up withComputex 2025:We're on the ground at Taiwan's biggest tech show to see what Nvidia, AMD, Intel, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI and more have to show. Current rumours point to a GPU with 32 execution units, well up on the 20 EUs of the Arc B580, and performance that might just be on par with an NvidiaRTX 5070. But there has also been talk that Intel can't get the chip working well enough. That narrative centres on the high CPU overhead of the B570 and B580 GPUs. If that's proportionally higher with the mooted G31 GPU, in line with the increased EU count, that could make G31 unworkable in the real world unless paired with a very high-end CPU. And that doesn't make sense for a GPU that would slot into the mid-range. All of which means there's nothing exciting to report about Intel's gaming graphics for now. We remain hopeful. But definitely not even remotely expectant.

    "article_text": "GameBook’s 300Hz display and 2.5K resolution make it look great, at least on paper When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chuwi, a company better known for budget devices than flagship powerhouses, has unveiled its latest effort to break into the high-performance segment: the GameBook 9955HX. Promoted as alaptop for coders, gamers, and professional creators, this new model is powered by theAMDRyzen 9 9955HX processor, a Zen 5-based chip featuring 16 cores and 32 threads, with a boost frequency of up to 5.4GHz. It also includes a large 64MB L3 cache and a configurable TDP that can peak around 55W. As of the time of writing, the device's price remains undisclosed - however, given Chuwi’s history of undercutting bigger brands, it’s reasonable to expect this model to be priced lower than similar offerings fromMSIor Asus. For graphics, the GameBook 9955HX integrates theNvidiaGeForce RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU, based on the latest Blackwell RTX architecture, making itwell-suited for video editingand graphics-intensive tasks. The GPU offers 12GB of GDDR7 VRAM, a 140W TGP, and supports features such as full ray tracing, DLSS 4, and Multi Frame Generation. Chuwi says this setup can deliver up to 191 FPS in 1440p gaming with ray tracing enabled, and 149 FPS at4K, placing it firmly in the performance laptop category. For creators working with AI-accelerated tools, advanced 3D rendering, or video post-production, this could prove to be a top contender, provided its cooling system and thermal management are up to the task. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The display is a 16-inch 2.5K IPS panel with a 300Hz refresh rate, 100% sRGB color coverage, and a 16:10 aspect ratio. Peak brightness reaches 500 nits, though claims regarding color accuracy have yet to be verified through independent calibration tests. Internally, the GameBook comes equipped with 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5600MHz, upgradeable to 64GB, and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. Storage expansion is supported via two M.2 slots, one of which supports PCIe 5.0, offering a level of future-proofing not typically seen in Chuwi’s lineup. Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, a 2.5Gb Ethernet port, two USB-C ports (supporting 100W and 140W power delivery), three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, HDMI 2.1, and Mini DisplayPort 2.1a. There's also a 3.5mm audio jack, DC-in, and a Kensington lock slot. Other features include a full-sized RGB-backlit keyboard, a 2MP IR webcam with a privacy shutter, a 77.77Wh battery, and stereo speakers. The laptop measures just over 21mm thick and weighs 2.3kg.

In a wide-ranging discussion, Dell also laid out his views on political instability affecting the technology industry, and some of his key leadership principles. “The way I think about this is that if you look at every progress, that’s for any technology, you always have some change that goes on,” Dell said in response to our question about AI affecting or even replacing human workers. “My way of thinking is there’s probably a 10 percent effect for that - but I think 90 percent of that is actually growth and expansion and opportunity, and ultimately what I think you’re going to see is more opportunities, more economic growth.” “There are a lot of things that we don’t do, that we used to do, because we have the tools, and we’re more effective as a species because of that - (using AI) is just another example of that.” “One of the keys beyond productivity and efficiency I think for organizations, is to reimagine themselves, and say, alright, what is the trajectory of these capabilities, where is it going, and what should our activity look like in three years, five years time, given this capability.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “You know, a lot of roles today just didn’t exist 10, 20, 30 years ago - and no-one was forecasting that.” Having spoken withNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang in his opening keynote, Dell was also asked if the two shared any overarching leadership principles. “I think anytime there’s a new technology, you have to leap ahead (and think), what is the likely impact of this, and how do we need to change? And if we don’t have a passion around that, or there isn’t a crisis in your organization - make one! We think it can make us a better company.” Dell was also asked about how changing global economic and political situations might affect the company’s future outlook “We agree that those are issues and challenges,” he said, “in my general view, the importance of this technology is greater than all those problems - and I heard somebody say recently, tokens are bigger than tariffs - and that would sort of summarize our view of it.” “Are all those things helpful to our business? No, they’re not - but there’s a limit of what we can do about that, right? We can certainly do the things we’re supposed to do, and focus on the things we can control - we’re seeing plenty of companies that are dealing with all those challenges just as we are, and powering ahead in any case.” Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro. He has worked as a B2B and B2C tech journalist for nearly a decade, including at one of the UK's leading national newspapers and fellow Future title ITProPortal, and when he's not keeping track of all the latest enterprise and workplace trends, can most likely be found watching, following or taking part in some kind of sport.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As expected, this year's Google I/O keynote event brought major announcements showcasing the future of Android XR, Gemini, Project Astra, Search, and everything else the tech giant is working on. Google showcased Android 16 last week, which meant the keynote would focus its attention elsewhere. And so it did. Highlights included our first live demo of Android XR Glasses (on a Pro basketball player, no less), radical updates to Google Search, Project Astra, and powerful generative video and image tools. Many of the things Google announced, like Gemini Live on Android and iOS, are available today. All these changes could shift the way we interact with the internet and many other things. You can walk back through all the updates, find stories on the biggest announcements, and some afterthoughts below. You can alsorewatch the keynote here. The big stuff: As I mentioned, this event was chock-a-block with announcements. So many, it can be hard to tell what mattered. That is unless you read Global Editor in Chief Marc McLaren's round-up of the 13 biggest reveals The 13 biggest announcements from Google I/O 2025 Intrepid tech reporters Jake Krol and Phil Berne are currently queued up in an hours-long line to touch and try out the remarkable newGoogle Android XR Glasses. They look like quite an upgrade from Google's last glasses attempt. Keep an eye on TechRadar for updates on their quest. Google CEO Sundar Pichai sees AI as net-positive for search, adding that this is not a \"zero-sum moment\" for Search and AI. More in my story below. Google CEO: AI is not a 'zero-sum moment' for search The Project Starline's upgrade to Google Beam looked incredible and is even more exciting because Google already has a partner, HP, lined up. Our story is here. Google Beam could change your video calls forever with glasses-free 3D and near real-time translation We finally saw a live Google Android XR Glasses demo, and it was a doozy, especially because so many on stage were wearing them. Here's a deep dive on what we learned. Google finally gave us a closer look at Android XR – here are 4 new things we've learned One of my favorite announcements is the Veo 3 model update. This is the first time you can describe a scene with dialogue and sound effects and get AI-generated video output with audio. Wow. My story is here. Google's Veo 3 marks the end of AI video's 'silent era' Gemini Live, which lets the app see what you see and what's on your screen, is free to all iOS and Android users (assuming their phones support it). Here's our deep dive. Gemini Live is now free for everyone on Android and iOS, and you can finally share your screen and camera on iPhone - here's how to try it Google I/O 2025 keynote just wrapped up, and they unveiled so, so much. Fortunately, TechRadar has covered all the key bits. Below are some of the highlights and links to our in-depth coverage. Let's start with Search. It got a huge upgrade with better AI Overviews and, now, AI Mode for all in the US. Search Live also looks like a game-changer Google Search just got its biggest-ever upgrade to lure you away from ChatGPT – here are 7 new things to try You're welcome Gentle Monster and Warby Parker are both building Android XR Glasses. And Samsung is working on them, too. And it mostly worked! We're finally getting a good look at the glasses and how they work in real time. They even had a pro basketball player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, basketball player wearing them. Android XR will feature Gemini. They're still calling the Google/Samsung collaboration \"Project Moohan.\" It's still \"coming later this year.\" They quickly moved on to Glasses and a live demo. Google's new plans are Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra. Pro is $19.99 a month, and the aptly-named Ultra is $249.99 a month. The second plan is for the most serious AI creator, obviously. Flow is more comprehensive video creation tool that combines, among other things, Imagen 4 and Veo 3. They tout the character and scene consistency. You can even extend scenes. Also can add music from the new Google Lyria. Google presented a video featuring Darren Aronofsky and young filmmakers using a combination of real-life performances and Veo 3 generated video that they say they could not capture otherwise. One of them is Ancestra, the story of the filmmaker's birth. Imagen 4 will do much better on textures and text, which is a big deal for AI-generated content.. Veo 3 is coming with audio and video in a single output. These are big updates that will change how we produce AI content. Gemini will work as you browse the web on Chrome and understand the page you're viewing. Then you can ask questions. Coming to Gemini subscribers in the US this week. Your Gemini app experience is getting a big upgrade. This ability for Gemini to see what you see in person and on screen is huge. Are you ready for Google Gemini to really know you? You'll eventually be able to connect all your Google apps to Gemini. It'll make it more proactive. \"What if it could see what's coming and help you prepare, even before you ask?\" The three main goals: PersonalProactivePowerful Sounds like the tag line for Google Search is changing thanks to the integration of all this AI. Type it, say it, snap it, film it. They built a new model to better understand the human body. The models also understand how clothes and materials will fold and stretc,h and drape on people. You feed it a full-length picture, and then it lets you try on the outfits, virtually. It's a powerful demonstration. And, yes, you can use Agentic features to track sales and have the AI buy the outfit for you. Project Astra's visual capabilities are coming to AI Mode in Search. It's called Search Live. We're seeing some real-world applications. Google is showing how Complex Search and Data Analysis in Google Search AI Mode can answer complex sports questions. It's coming this summer. Google says AI mode capabilities will eventually blend into search. Personalized suggestions are coming soon. Pichai is back on stage, talking about Google Search. He's talking about how 1.5 billion users use AI overviews every month. AI Mode is coming to everyone in US starting today. Google believes we can have an incredible \"golden age of discovery and wonder\" in the areas of health and science if AI is developed safely. Google is showing off the latest version of Project Astra as a universal AI assistant. The scenario is a very natural interaction between Project Astra on the phone and a guy trying to fix his bike. It shows lots of natural language, asking for Project Astra to check for things online, and handling interruptions. This work informs everything from Veo to robotics. This is so powerful that they are still testing saftey. For now, it's available to trusted testers, We're into \"Gemini Diffusion\" territory. Definitely very developer-focused. The processing went so fast that the applause was muted when she got her result. We watching some real-time code and Web app generation in Gemini 2.5 Pro. She did have to cut the generation time (2 minutes short) and go \"baking style\" to show us the final app. Gemini 2.5 Flash has some very powerful language capabilities on the way. Here are some ideas: The DeepMind CEO is going over the key models in including Gemini 2.5 Pro and a new version of Gemini 2.5 Flash. Generally available in early June. Pro comes soon after. With your permission, Gemini could look across your apps and use that information create things like personalized smart replies in Gmail. This sounds both amazing and slightly scary. Google would be looking inside all your stuff and handing over details to Gemini. Coming this summer in Gmail. Project Astra, the powerful, mobile AI package that can look and react to real-time input is coming to iOS and Android today. The demo was good because it showed how Project Astra could keep correcting the user. Google has some cool real-time translation capabilities. That looked and sounded pretty good. Google is taking video conferencing to the third dimension with a massive upgrade to Starline to Google Beam. Six cameras in one device to create a 3D version of you for your video call. HP is the first partner. Just look at how many more tokens Google is processing since this time last year. Wow. Sundar Pichai is walking us through recent AI breakthroughs. There's Google CEO Sundar Pichai. He says every day is Gemini season at Google. With less than 10 minutes to go, the DJ has left the stage. Now we wait... What's kind of cool about this music is that it's all coming from this one guy. He's fast and smooth, turning all these knobs and occasionally singing a note, to make it happen. The pace of the music is also picking up and may continue to do so until we kick off the keynote at 1PM ET. Lance Ulanoff jumping in here. Google I/O attendees are currently being treated to what Phil Berne calls \"Ambient music with no explanation, after about an hour of vibe coding.\" It seems to be setting a mood, but not one of attentiveness. The Google DJ did tell people they could look at their phones. People are now taking their seats in theGoogle I/O 2025amphitheatre. The TeachRadar team are on site and will be bringing you all the important updates live from the event, which is scheduled to start at10 am PT / 1 pm ET / 6 pm BST. If you've got astreamof the Google I/O keynote open in a browser window you'll find that it has just suddenly sprung to life, playing a repeating animation and some, er, interesting, music. It's a sign that there's not long to go now, so it's time to get some snacks and a drink ready, because we are about to set the controls for the heart of Google, where we'll learn all about the exciting AI developments that the tech giant has in store for us.A ticker tape image message at the bottom of the video says \"Welcome to Google I/O. The Show Will Start Shortly.\" The TechRadar team is getting closer to the presentation theatre for Google I/O 2025, here's a few of the things that have been encountered along the way. Note - no pepper spray is allowed at Google I/O 2025! While we think the new announcements in the Google I/O keynote today will be all about AI, particularly aroundGemini, it's worth bearing in mind that AI is just one of four stages at Google I/O 2025. The four stages are: Android, AI, Web and Cloud.So, we think we'll be getting announcements in all four of these areas today. There's only 90 minutes left to go, we can't wait to bring you all the new announcements! It's pretty early in the morning for technology journalists to function at full capacity, but the TechRadar team are on site and ready to report on Google I/O 2025. Here's Phil. Ready, Set, I/O! One way of trying to predict what Google might be announcing at its Google I/O event tonight is to take a look at what it is cooking up in itsGoogle Labsdevelopment area. Google Labs is accessible to most people and lets you try a few of the fun tools that Google is working on before they are ready.Looking in there right now I can see AI Mode, which is Google's way of competing with ChatGPT search by using Gemini to help you search online. Also in there is Whisk Animate, which uses Veo 2 to turn your images into animations. I really like the look of Daily Listen, which uses Google's powerful Audio Overviews (the podcast-like audio created in NotebookLM) to produce a daily summary of news for you. Finally, there's Little Language Lessons, which uses AI to help you learn a foreign language.Will any of these projects see fruition tonight in Google I/O? Stay with us here at TechRadar to find out. There are about three hours left to go until the Google I/O event! How will you watch it? I think I'll be tuning in onYouTube. Not only does YouTube work across most devices, but it's a pretty solid system that can handle the sort of volumes you'd expect from a big event like this.Don't forget that we'll be bringing you updates throughout the event on this blog, so keep a TechRadar window open for all the updates. It's Graham Barlow, TechRadar's Senior AI editor taking over the live blog now in the run up to the big Google I/O event in a few short hours. I can't wait to see what Google has in store for us, particularly with Gemini, it's AI chatbot!My current favorite feature of Gemini is Live, which gives you the ability to have a human-like conversation with Gemini. I like this feature so much that I've actually hacked my iPhone's Action Button so that it launches straight into Gemini Live.Forget Siri, Gemini Live is the sort of AI tool that I wish Apple had by default. Want to know how to add Gemini Live to your Action Button on iPhone right now? Don't worry, I've written up the details ofhow to do it. On some phones, like thePixel 9andSamsung Galaxy S25, Gemini can 'see' through your camera and you canask it questions about what it's looking at. I would be great if these features were expanded even further in tonight's big event. He adds, “Of course, that’s not all Wear OS fans are getting. We’re also due to get better battery life, to the tune of 10% more efficiency (for Pixel Watch users, that’s an extra 2.4 hours of use) and Gemini on your wrist. We know you’ll be able to ask Gemini to do simple tasks for you, like remembering locker key codes, but we hope there are more surprises in store this evening. I’d personally love a Gemini notification summary feature, allowing me to summarize long email chains or WhatsApp group chat message threads without pulling out my phone. What we’re not likely to see today is any new wearables hardware – Google will likely leave the Pixel Watch 4, and any Fitbits it decides to throw our way, until later in the year.” We asked Matt Evans, TechRadar's Fitness & Wearables Editor, to give us more info on what we can expect from Wear OS 6. He said, \"We actually know quite a bit about what Wear OS 6 is going to entail, and expect this to be shown off in full during this year’s Google I/O. A redesigned interface with Material 3 Expressive will create a seamless (or at least “less seams”) transition between Android and Wear OS, with a similar design language. A widget stack like watchOS 10’s redesigned Glances replacement on thebest Apple watchesis coming, and will use the Pixel watch’s rounded face to get smaller and bigger as you scroll. Check out the GIF above showing it in action, as previously revealed by Google.\" Some last-minute rumors hint at Google launching a rival to Pinterest. This would be another attempt at a social media platform after the last attempt, Google+, went offline. According to sources, the new app will be based on image search results on Google, enabling users to collect different pictures into collections, which can then be shared with other people. If something like this is in the pipeline, then Google I/O 2025 offers the perfect platform from which to announce it. As someone who has never really used Pinterest, this doesn't fill me with excitement. But considering the website has millions of users globally, I suspect a Pinterest competitor could get some people talking. We recently comparedGoogle Gemini's new image editing feature to ChatGPT's, and found that Google's image generation is much better at sticking to the original image. After comparing both Gemini and ChatGPT's image editing prowess, TechRadar writer Eric came to this conclusion: \"Gemini's image edits were fast and accurate, and mostly only changed what I asked in the way that I asked. I'd say it's great, especially for quick edits. ChatGPT takes way longer to process the request, and wasn't great at getting it right the first time. It would likely require a lot of back-and-forth in editing prompts to get just the changes you want unless you use the highlight tool, which takes up some extra time, too. I still think ChatGPT's overall image quality is higher than Gemini's, but that only matters if you have patience and if ChatGPT gets it right the first time. I suspect I may use ChatGPT to make any images, but turn to Gemini if I want to make a few adjustments to an image that I otherwise find appealing.\" I'm not afraid to say it, I use Gemini more than I use ChatGPT, and honestly, I think it's just easier to use. The other day I used Gemini Live to help cook a meal, and it was incredible asking AI questions based on what it could see through my smartphone's camera. Gemini also offers Deep Research, which we've tested thoroughly, and even image and video generation that's as good as some of its competitors. In terms of consumer AI tools, Gemini is leading the pack in my opinion, and I expect Google to further the gap with OpenAI's ChatGPT at I/O later today. ChatGPT may be more powerful depending on your use cases, but for the average consumer, Gemini ticks all the boxes. We've been waiting to get more info on Google's smart glasses for what feels like forever. The time might've come, however, as we're fully expecting to get more of an insight into what Android XR and extended reality glasses are capable of at the event later today. It's rumored that Google, alongside its partner, Samsung, will showcase XR glasses alongside a larger project codenamedMoohan. Not long to wait now... Google started the day with the arrival of the NotebookLM app for iOS and Android. If you've not used Notebook LM yet, it's an impressive AI tool that is able to turn any written document into a short podcast clip with two hosts. The tool is very useful for studying, research, and even just for a bit of fun. We've tested NotebookLM extensively at TechRadar, so I'll leave a couple of articles below for you to read. The app is completely free and available to download now. I used NoteBookLM to help with productivity - here’s 5 top tips to get the most from Google’s AI audio tool How to use NotebookLM, Google’s new AI audio generator that lets you make a stunningly real AI podcast without a mic In March, Google revealed Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, which the company called its 'Most intelligent AI model' yet. I'm hoping to see more information on 2.5, and maybe a wider release. At the moment, naming schemes for AI models are getting increasingly hard to follow. Could Google rise up and find a way to simplify the process? Gemini has so much to offer from Gemini Live, Deep Research, Canvas, Veo, the capabilities are almost endless. If Google could merge everything so that the AI can determine what you need, when you need it, that would be a major shift in the way we interact with artificial intelligence. Normally we get a look at the future of Android at Google I/O, but this year is different after Google showcased Android 16 last week. If you want to see what the upcoming mobile software update looks like,we've covered the 5 most useful features coming with Android 16. Google I/O 2025 takes place over May 20 and May 21, but the main event is the Google keynote, which starts at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST, which is 3am on May 21 for those in the AEST time zone. The keynote will likely be around two hours long based on past form, and you’ll be able to live stream it fromGoogle’s I/O website, and also on theGoogle YouTube channel. We’ve embedded the YouTube video below, so you can watch it without even leaving this page if you want – and if you click the ‘Notify me’ button on the video, you can get a notification when the event is about to start. One feature I expect Google to talk more about today is AI Mode. TechRadar writer Eric Hal Schwartz has tried Google's AI Mode and saysit might be the end of Search as we know it. In his feature about the user experience he says, \"There's always a lot going on in my area, but finding information on what's on can often be tough. Instead of checking six different websites and hoping they’ve been updated, I asked Google through AI Mode:“What are some local events happening in the Hudson Valley this weekend?” As you can see above, the AI responded almost instantly with a tidy roundup of events. The list of links to the right showed where it was pulling from, and each event had a short description and details of location and time, as well as a hyperlink to where the information came from. The diversity of sources stood out, and I can't deny it was faster than a regular search plus time spent opening each site to see what was listed.\" Think of AI Mode as Google's take on ChatGPT Search, although, are we ready to fully embrace AI search yet? I'm not so sure. On Google's official website for the event, it says, \"Discover how we’re furthering our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\" This makes me think we're going to see some big improvements to Google Search, and maybe even a wider roll-out of AI Mode. AI Mode launched in beta earlier this year, bringing artificial intelligence to the forefront of the Google Search experience. Whether you love it or hate it, AI looks like it's here to stay, and Google Gemini is probably going to play a part. Google I/O 2025 starts in around 9 hours, at 10 am PT / 1 pm ET / 6 pm BST. That gives us loads of time to take you through everything we expect to see at Google's headline keynote. There's going to be loads of AI, maybe some Android, and definitely some surprises, so you won't want to miss what the tech giant has up its sleeve. Welcome to TechRadar's Google I/O 2025 live blog! John-Anthony Disotto, Senior AI Writer, here to take you through the first few hours of today as we build up to one of Google's biggest events of the year. So grab a coffee, set this tab up to the side of your monitor, and get ready for a huge day in the world of tech!

    "title": "‘It will last you from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed’: Samsung doesn’t want you to worry about the Galaxy S25 Edge’s battery life",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: “We're giving consumers what they need” When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeis earning plaudits aplenty for its stunning titanium design and improbable thinness (not least from ushere at TechRadar), but the phone’s smaller-than-hoped-for battery continues to raise eyebrows. At 3,900mAh, the cell in the Galaxy S25 Edge is only a smidgen smaller than the one in the standardGalaxy S25, but inSamsung’s new phone, that same battery has to power a much larger 6.7-inch display. Understandably, that’s led to question marks over the Edge’s endurance, but Samsung is confident that its new handset will provide more than enough battery life for all but the most hardcore users. In an exclusive interview with TechRadar, Kadesh Beckford, Smartphone Product Specialist at Samsung MX, played down the idea that the Galaxy S25 Edge compromises on battery life to deliver a more aesthetically pleasing design. “Even though we’ve made this device incredibly thin, we’ve tried to ensure that customers have [suitable] battery life available to them based upon their needs,” Beckford explained. “With 24 hours of video playback time and an all-day battery, [the Edge] is going to last you literally from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed. So, we're actually giving [consumers] what they need [in terms of battery life]. “And also,” Beckford continued, “with the lithium graphite technology and the thermal interface material in there, it keeps the device cool, so pretty much no matter what you're doing on your phone, [it’ll] last all day long and then some.” ‘All day long and then some’ is a bold claim for a 6.7-inch handset with a 3,900mAh cell – and it’s one we’re currently putting to the test for our fullSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge review– but Beckford says his enthusiasm for the phone’s endurance is based on his own real-world experience with the device ahead of its official launch. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. “I’ve playedGenshin Impacton the Galaxy S25 Edge, I’ve playedPUBG,” he explained. “It moves so smoothly, it’s unbelievable, and the phone has lasted me all day – sometimes into the following day as well. I’ve seen those elements [in action]. “Do also remember that, traditionally, phones at this level of thinness don’t support wireless charging. With the custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, we’ve still been able to include a thermal interface and wireless charging, with wireless power share as well, so I can even charge up my Galaxy Buds [using the Galaxy S25 Edge]. That there is real innovation.” Traditionally, phones at this level of thinness don’t support wireless charging. Beckford concluded: “You’ve also got the ability to add a Qi2 case [to the Galaxy S25 Edge] for convenience at home or in your car. So, you can easily connect it up, and your device will last all day.” Of course, being compatible with convenient charging methods isn’t the same as offering good battery life outright, but Beckford’s point around real-world practicality stands. For the majority of users, the Galaxy S25 Edge will deliver all-day battery life, and the phone’s wireless charging and Qi2 compatibility should ensure that it can be charged anytime, anywhere if you do find yourself wanting for juice. Just howquicklythe Galaxy S25 Edge can be charged to 100% is another matter entirely. The phone supports 25W wired, 15W wireless, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging – that’s comparable to the standard Galaxy S25 but a way off the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, which both support 45W wired charging. Whichever way you look at it, then, youwillbe sacrificing some endurance by choosing the Galaxy S25 Edge over one of thebest Samsung phones. But, as Samsung suggests, that downgrade isn’t likely to feel dramatic forthose who already charge their smartphone on a daily basis.

    "title": "Google’s Android XR glasses look like its most exciting gadget in years – but the headset leaves me wanting more",
    "article_text": "Android XR is a mixed bag for now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google has finally taken the lid off Android XR atGoogle I/O 2025to show us what theoperating systemwill be capable of when it launches on Android XR headsets and glasses later this year.We didn’t see quite everything I was hoping we would, but we did learn what Google’s silver bullet in XR will be:Google Gemini. Its AI-centric approach was demoed across both hardware types – AR glasses and mixed-reality headsets. Starting with the latter, Google gave a public version ofProject Moohanheadset demonstrations it has been running privately for media and tech experts. It highlights some standard headset advantages, like the benefits of an immersive screen for multi-tasking – we were shown a user accessingYouTube,Google Maps, and a travel blog as they research a location they’re planning to visit. Then, in one impressive moment, that user asks Gemini if it can “take me to Florence.” Gemini obliges by openingGoogle’s immersive 3D mapand gives them a birds-eye view of the city and some landmarks (including the iconic Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, whichAssassin’s Creed 2players will be very familiar with). Then there’s the glasses. Across a few different scenarios Google highlighted how Android XR specs can make your life easier with hands-free controls and a head-up display. You can draft and send messages to your contacts, access live translation with on-screen subtitles, search for Google Maps recommendations and then get directions to a location, and take pictures using the glasses’ camera and see a preview of the shot right away. It’s reminiscent of what Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses are capable of, and it’s exactly what we've been expecting Meta’s rumored smart glasses with a display will be capable of if (read: when) they’re showcased later this year. I was expecting more from Google in the headset department, frankly. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Android XR certainly seems neat, but I’ve yet to see a reason why it’s better than – or, to an extent, on a par with – with the competition (*cough*Meta Quest 3*cough*). However, I’m at least a little hopeful that by the time Project Moohan is ready to launch for consumers (with it again only being teased for release “later this year”) some of Android XR’s letdowns will be addressed. For now, the headset certainly seems like it’s playing second fiddle to the true Android XR star: the glasses. Not only are most of the showcased Android XR features (which look very useful) made for a device you’d wear all the time, I’m surprised by how much choice Google is already offering us in terms of hardware. Samsungis working on Android XR tech but so is Xrealwith its Project Aura, and stylish eyewear brands Gentle Monster and Warby Parker. And Google’s promise of it “starting with” these brands suggests more partners are on the way. This abundance of choice is fantastic for two key reasons. First up, with more choice prices will have to remain competitive. Meta’s display-equipped smart glasses arereportedly set to cost over $1,000with insiders expecting a cost in the $1,300-$1,400 range (which would be around £1,000-£1,100 or AU$2,050-AU$2,200). With more glasses options to choose from we may see prices drop to more affordable levels more quickly than if there were just one or two players in the game. Second, glasses, like other fashion accessories, need to prioritize style to some degree. Utility is important, but if we’re expected to wear smart glasses all day everyday then just like any other accessory they need to suit our identity. By partnering with a range of different brands out the gate – the aesthetics of Gentle Monster and Warby Parker are almost polar opposites to one another – Android XR tech should appeal to a wider audience than the Meta’s Ray-Ban-only approach, because it will boast glasses designed to suit a wider range of fashion niches. It’s still early days for Android XR, and there are crucial details we’re still missing, but Google has certainly come out swinging with its latest operating system I’ll be paying close attention to Google’s Android XR demos, and looking for more concrete information on the upcoming hardware. For now, though, Google certainly has me on the hook.

    "title": "Huawei's new foldable laptop looks like it was ripped straight out of a Mission Impossible movie – this is the future",
    "article_text": "18-inch OLED? Yes please... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Computex 2025is here, and it was only a matter of time until one of the huge tech companies during the expo revealed a new device that takes laptop design to the next level – and this one may be worth keeping tabs on. Onits website (translated from Chinese), Huawei announced the new MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop, featuring an 18-inch (when expanded) 3KOLEDdisplay running on Harmony OS 5. Notably, unlike other foldable laptops like the Asus Zenbook Duo, the MateBook Fold Ultimate Design unfolds into an entire single screen. Essentially, this means that instead of what would be two screens connected via regular laptop hinges, it's a 'water-drop hinge' that allows it to open and close smoothly, and lay completely flat for an 18-inch screen experience. This mechanism is arguably a step up aboveMicrosoft's new Surface Pro, which acts as a tablet but is also a 2-in-1 when you use its keyboard (which is sold separately). When in its laptop form, you'll have a 13-inch OLED screen at your disposal using its touchscreen keyboard (or the keyboard that's included in the package). However, the MateBook Fold Ultimate Design looks like more than just a 2-in-1 laptop; you'll be able to transform it from a regular laptop into a portable 18-inch display for casual viewing on the device in a matter of seconds. Closing the laptop entirely gives it a classy and thin notebook or diary-style design, as if it's built as a disguise, further setting it apart in terms of its design from competitors. To add a cherry on top, it has 1,600 nits of peak brightness, and a 74.69WHr battery – and both features could easily stand alone as major selling points. According to a reliable tech analyst,Ming-Chi Kuo, Huawei is planning a production target for the MateBook Fold of between 180,000 and 200,000 units, and its life cycle will primarily depend on user feedback regarding the software functionality. It's an important factor to note, since the MateBook Fold is by no means an inexpensive laptop. It's currently only available in China, starting at ¥23,999, which converts to around $3,330 / £2,490 / AU$5,200, but its new features will be hard to turn down if you can afford it. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I've played plenty of futuristic games likeCyberpunk 2077and seen enough movies likeMission Impossibleto suggest that Huawei's new laptop could be a game-changer. It isn't like other companies, such as Asus, haven't introduced similar devices – the difference is, none of them utilize the 'water-drop hinge' mechanism Huawei has introduced. It simply makes theAsus Zenbook Duoand theLenovo Yoga Book 9ilook like clumsy setups, that require a stand to stay upright and hinges for both screens. The MateBook Fold is the first laptop foldable laptop I've seen that has caught my eye – if only I could afford it. The only drawback here is that it will likely set you back thousands of dollars if it eventually launches globally. However, if it sells well enough and gains the traction that I anticipate, we could easily see Huawei's competitors and others follow suit soon – and that's exactly what I'm hoping for.

    "title": "The 13 biggest announcements from Google I/O 2025",
    "article_text": "Spoiler: AI, AI and more AI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Want proof that Google really has gone all-in on AI? Then look no further than today'sGoogle I/O 2025 keynote. Forget Android, Pixel devices,Google Photos, Maps and all the other Google staples – none were anywhere to be seen. Instead, the full two-hour keynote spent its entire time taking us through Gemini, Veo, Flow, Beam, Astra, Imagen and a bunch of other tools to help you navigate the new AI landscape. There was a lot to take in, but don't worry – we're here to give you the essential round-up of everything that got announced at Google's big party. Read on for the highlights. ‘Googling’ is no longer the default in the ChatGPT era, so Google has responded. It’s launched its AI Mode for Search (previously just an experiment) to everyone in the US, and that’s just the start of its plans. Within that new AI Mode tab, Google has built several new Labs tools that it hopes will stop us from jumping ship to ChatGPT and others. A ‘Deep Search’ mode lets you set it working on longer research projects, while a new ticket-buying assistant (powered by Project Mariner) will help you score entry to your favourite events. Unfortunately, the less popular AI Overviews is also getting a wider rollout, but one thing’s for sure: Google Search is going to look and feel very different from now on. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Shopping online can go from easy to chaotic in moments, given the huge amount of brands, retailers, sellers and more – but Google is aiming to use AI to streamline the process. That's because the aforementioned AI Mode for Search now offers a mode that will react to shopping-based prompts, such as ‘I’m looking for a cute purse’ and serve up products and images for inspiration and allow users to narrow down large ranges of products; that is if you live in the US as the mode is rolling out there first. The key new feature in the AI-powered shopping experience is a try-on mode that lets you upload a single image of yourself, from which Google’s combination of its Shopping Graph and Gemini AI models will then enable you to virtually try on clothes. The only caveat here is the try-on feature is still in the experimental stage and you need to opt-in to the ‘Search Labs’ program to give it a go. Once you have the product or outfit in mind, Google’s agentic checkout feature will basically buy the product on your behalf, using the payment and delivery details stored in Google Pay; that is, if the price meets your approval – as you can set the AI tech to track the cost of a particular product and only have it buy it if the price is right. Neat. Video calls are the bane of many people's lives, particularly if you work in an office and spend 60% of your time in such calls. But Google's new Beam could make them a lot more interesting. The idea here is to present calls in 3D, as if you're in the same room as someone when you're on a call with them; a bit like with VR. However, there's no need for a VR headset or glasses here, with Beam instead using cameras, mics, and – of course – AI to work its magic. If that all sounds rather familiar, it's because Google has teased this before, under the name Project Starline. But this is no longer a far away concept as it's here, and almost ready for people to use. The caveat is that both callers will need to sit in a custom-made booth that can generate the 3D renders that are needed. But it's all pretty impressive nonetheless, and the first business customers will be able to get the kit fromHPlater in 2025. AI video generation tools are already incredibly impressive, given they didn't even exist a year or two ago, but Google new Veo 3 model looks like taking things to the next level. As with the likes ofSoraandPika, the tool's third-generation version can create video clips and then tie them together to make longer films. But unlike those other tools, it can also generate audio at the same time – and expertly sync sound and vision together. Nor is this capability limited to sound effects and background noises, because it can even handle dialogue – as demonstrated in the clip above, which Google demoed in its I/O 2025 keynote. \"We’re emerging from the silent era of video generation,\" said Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis – and we're not going to argue with that. Google Gemini Live, the search giant’s AI-powered voice assistant, is now available for free on both Android and iOS. Previously a paid-for option, this move opens up the AI to a wealth of users. With Gemini Live, you can talk to the generative AI assistant using natural language, as well as use your phone camera to show it things from which it’ll extract information to serve up related data. Plus, the ability to share one’s phone screen and camera with other Android users via Gemini Live has now been extended to compatible iPhones. Google will start rolling out Gemini Live for free from today, with iOS users being able to access the AI and its screen sharing features in the coming weeks. Here's one for all the budding movie directors out there: at I/O 2025, Google took the covers off Flow, an AI-powered tool for filmmakers that can create scenes, characters and other movie assets from a natural language text prompt. Let’s say you want to see doctors perform an operation in the back of a 1070s taxi; well, pop that into Flow and it’ll generate the scene for you, using the Veo 3 model, with surprising realism. Effectively an extension of the experimental Google Labs VideoFX tool launched last year, Flow will be available for subscribers to Google Al Pro and Google Al Ultra plans in the US, with more countries to come. And it could be a tool that’ll let budding directors and cinematic video makers more effectively test scenes and storytelling, without needing to shoot a lot of clips. Whether this will enhance filmmaking planning or yield a whole new era of cinema, where most scenes are created using generative AI rather than making use of sets and traditional CGI, has yet to be seen. But it looks like Flow could open up movie making to more than just keen amateurs and Hollywood directors. Gemini is already a pretty good choice for AI image generation; depending on who you ask, it's either slightly better or slightly worse than ChatGPT, but essentially in the same ballpark. Well, now it might have moved ahead of its rival, thanks to a big upgrade to its Imagen model. For starters, Imagen 4 brings with it a resolution boost, to 2K – meaning you'll be better able to zoom into and crop its images, or even print them out. What's more, it'll also have \"remarkable clarity in fine details like intricate fabrics, water droplets and animal fur, and excels in both photorealistic and abstract styles”, Google says – and judging by the image above, that looks pretty spot on. Finally, Imagen 4 will give Gemini improved abilities at spelling and typography, which has bizarrely remained one of the hardest puzzles for AI image generators to solve so far. It's available from today, so expect even more AI-generated memes in the very near future. Enhanced image capabilities aren't the only upgrades coming to Gemini, either – it's also got a dose of extra brainpower with the addition of a new Deep Think Mode. This basically augments Gemini 2.5 Pro with a function that means it’ll effectively think harder about queries posed at it, rather than trying to kick out an answer as quickly as possible. This means the latest pro version of Gemini will run multiple possible lines of reasoning in parallel, before deciding on how to respond to a query. You could think of it as the AI looking deeper into an encyclopaedia, rather than winging it when coming up with information. There is a catch here, in that Google is only rolling out Deep Think Mode to trusted testers for now – but we wouldn't be surprised if it got a much wider release soon. Would you spend $3,000 a year on a Gemini subscription? Google thinks some people will, because it's rolled out a new Gemini AI Ultra plan in the US that costs a whopping $250 a month. The plan isn't aimed at casual AI users, obviously; Google says it offers \"the highest usage limits and access to our most capable models and premium features\" and that it'll be a must if \"you're a filmmaker, developer, creative professional or simply demand the absolute best of Google Al with the highest level of access.\" On the plus side, there's a 50% discount for the first three months, while the previoiusly available Premium plan also sticks around for $19.99 a month, but now renamed to AI Pro. If you like the sound of AI Ultra, it will be available in more countries soon. Google finally gave us the Android XR showcase it has been teasing for years. At its core is Google Gemini – on-glasses-Gemini can find and direct you towards cafes based on your food preferences, it can perform live translation, and find answers to questions about things you can see. On a headset, it can useGoogle Mapsto transport you all over the world. Android XR is coming to devices fromSamsung, Xreal, Warby Parker, and Gentle Monster, though there’s no word yet on when they’ll be in our hands. Project Astra is Google’s powerful mobile AI assistant that can react and respond to the user’s visual surroundings, and this year’s Google I/O has given it some serious upgrades. We watched as Astra gave a user real-time advice to help him fix his bike, speaking in natural language. We also saw Astra argue against incorrect information as a user walked down the street mislabeling the things around her. Project Astra is coming to both Android and iOS today, and its visual recognition function is also making its way to AI Mode in Google Search. Is there anything that hasn’t been given an injection of Gemini’s AI smarts? Google’s Chrome browser was one of the few tools that hadn’t it seems, but that’s now changed. Gemini is now rolling out in Chrome for desktop from tomorrow to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the US. What does that mean? You’ll apparently now be able to ask Gemini to clarify any complex information that you’re researching, or get it to summarize web pages. If that doesn’t sound too exciting, Google also promised that Gemini will eventually work across multiple tabs and also navigate websites “on your behalf”. That gives us slight HAL vibes (“I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that”), but for now it seems Chrome will remain dumb enough for us to be considered worthy of operating it. As part of Gemini 2.5, Canvas – the so-called ’creative space inside the Gemini app – has got a boost via the new upgraded AI models in this new version of Gemini. This means Canvas is more capable and intuitive, with the tool able to take data and prompts and turn them into infographics, games, quizzes, web pages and more within minutes. But the real kicker here is that Canvas can now take complex ideas and turn them into working code at speed and without the user needing to know specific coding languages; all they need to do is describe what they want in the text prompt. Such capabilities open up the world of ‘vibe coding’, where one can create software without needing to know any programming languages, and it also has the capability of prototyping new ideas for apps at speed and just through prompts.

    "title": "New Nintendo Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay has been revealed – say what you like, but I'm still not impressed",
    "article_text": "Frame rate and smoothness are what matter most... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The launch of theNintendo Switch 2is almost here, and it'll come with a handful of titles ready for gamers to dive into from day one. Luckily, we now have an early look at one in particular, from game developer CD Projekt Red. In aYouTubevideo byNintendo Life, CD Projekt Red'sCyberpunk 2077is revealed running on the Nintendo Switch 2, with visual quality that rivals other PC handhelds like theSteam Deck. This is thanks to Nvidia's custom T239 chip, which allows the new handheld to take advantage of DLSS upscaling, for better-than-native performance while upscaling from a lower internal resolution. Considering earlier expectations that were based on the hardware rumors (which turned out to be legitimate),Cyberpunk 2077has impressed many gamers with its lighting and environment details. However, it's worth noting thatNvidia's DLSS upscaling is rumored to be used quite aggressively, which is clear to see in some of the blurry sequences in the gameplay showcase. This is to be expected as the Switch 2 is already pushing above its weight in running a game likeCyberpunk 2077.But there are still very evident performance dips, particularly during vehicle traversal, which highlights the potential issue – if DLSS is indeed used aggressively and performance is not up to par, seeing dips into what looks like the upper end of 20fps, then is it really impressive after all? It's worth noting that it isn't exactly clear which segments of the gameplay below are either docked or handheld (it's likely the former considering the4Kvideo quality), and there will be a choice between quality and performance modes. This is also still a work in progress and will likely be drastically different from the launch version, but it will be interesting to see how this fares against theMSI Claw 8 AI+– which delivers great visuals and performance playingCyberpunk 2077– along with other upcoming handhelds like therecently-announced MSI Claw A8 using AMD's Ryzen Z2 Extreme. Now, before you say I have a Nintendo Switch 2 agenda, I do think games likeCyberpunk 2077have the potential to further exceed their performance and visual expectations on the device. Despite that, the handheld's $449.99 / £395.99 / AU$699.95price has me asking a basic question – wouldn't it be better to buy a PS5, Xbox Series X at around the same price, for a better experience? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I could go into the handheld PC comparisons, and the Claw 8 AI+'s processing power, but I'd hate to sound like a broken record. Spoiler alert; it's purported to be the better and more powerful device. However, the simple fact here is that the Switch 2'sCyberpunk 2077isn't in the same ballpark visually and performance-wise as either ofSony's orMicrosoft's consoles. In that sense, the Switch 2's value as a gaming console rival is lost if it costs nearly the same and yet provides a worse experience. Before you point out that theMSIClaw 8 AI+ costs more than the PS5 and Xbox Series X, it's not in the category of game console (it also doesn't come with a dock for extra performance), and its price compared to the Switch 2 is still warranted considering the power packed in such a compact device. If the Switch 2's price were much lower, I'd be far more impressed withCyberpunk 2077's performance, but tariffs or not, that's not the case. DLSS seems to be the one factor that will do the heavy lifting with the Switch 2, and I'd argue it's the one reason why its version ofCyberpunk 2077can be compared to other handhelds using either XeSS or FSR (neither of which are on the level of Nvidia's DLSS). Even then, without tools like Frame Generation, it still leaves me unimpressed with the Switch 2, but I'll happily eat my words if I'm proven wrong with its capabilities.

A Widow's Gameis a gripping newNetflixmovie which is giving seriousGone Girlvibes, and I'm so excited to watch when it arrives on one of thebest streaming services. Arriving on May 30, it definitely has the potential to be one of the best Netflix movies, as it's inspired by a very interesting case I hadn't heard of before known as \"the black widow of Patraix.\" The Spanish-language movie is directed by Carlos Sedes and written by the team that brought us the Netflix drama seriesThe Asunta Case.That series follows a couple who reported their daughter missing, which unravels the truth about a seemingly picture-perfect family. Check out the new trailer below. Set in 2017, the body of a man is found in a parking lot. He's been stabbed seven times and the authorities believe all signs point to a crime of passion. With a veteran inspector heading up the crime, she's soon led to a suspect no one expected: Maje, the young widow who had been married to the victim for less than a year. The cast is led byPan's Labyrinthstar Ivana Baquero, who plays Maje, andCriminal's Carmen Machi, who is Eva, the case inspector. The cast also includes Tristán Ulloa, Joel Sánchez, Álex Gadea, Pablo Molinero, Pepe Ocio, Ramón Ródenas, Amparo Fernández and Miquel Mars.

    "article_text": "Warning: some of these are only experimental features for now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google Search is under pressure – not only are many of usreplacing it with the likes of ChatGPT Search,Google's attempts to stave off competition with thefeatures like AI Overviews have also backfireddue to some worrying inaccuracies. That's why Google has just given Search its biggest overhaul for over 25 years atGoogle I/O 2025. The era of the 'ten blue links' is coming to close, with Google now giving its AI Mode (previously stashed away in its Labs experiments) a wider rollout in the US. AI Mode was far from the only Search news at this year's I/O – so if you been wondering what the next 25 years of 'Googling' looks like, here are all of the new Search features Google's just announced. A word of warning: beyond AI Mode, many of the features will only be available to Labs testers in the US – so if you want to be among the first to try them \"in the coming weeks\", turn on theAI Mode experiment in Labs. Yes, Google has just taken off the stabilizers off its AI Mode for Search – which was previously only available in Labs to early testers – and rolled it out to everyone in the US. There's no word yet on when it's coming to other regions. Google says that \"over the coming weeks\" (which sounds worryingly vague) you'll see AI Mode appear as a new tab in Google Search on the web (and in the search bar in the Google app). We've alreadytried out AI Mode and concludedthat \"it might be the end of Search as we know it\", and Google says it's been refining it since then – the new version is apparently powered by a custom version of Gemini 2.5. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. A lot of AI chatbots – includingChatGPTand Perplexity – now offer aDeep Research modefor longer research projects that require a bit more than a quick Google. Well, now Google has its own equivalent for Search called, yes, 'Deep Search'. Available in Labs \"in the coming months\" (always the vaguest of release windows), Deep Search is a feature within AI Mode that's based on the same \"query fan-out\" technique as that broader mode, but according to Google takes it to the \"next level\". In reality, that should mean an \"expert-level, fully-cited report\" (Google says) in only a few minutes, which sounds like a big time-saver – as long as the accuracy is a bit better than Google's AI Overviews. Google already lets you ask questions about the world withGoogle Lens, and demoed its Project Astra universal assistant atGoogle I/O 2024. Well, now it's folding Astra into Google Search so you can ask questions in real-time using your smartphone's camera. 'Search Live' is another Labs feature and will be marked by a 'Live' icon in Google's AI Mode or in Google Lens. Tap it and you'll be able to point your camera and have a back-and-forth chat with Google about what's in front of you, while getting links sent to you with more info. The idea sounds good in theory, but we're still yet to try it outbeyond its prototype incarnation last yearand the multimodal AI project is cloud-based, so your mileage may vary depending on where you're using it. But we're excited to see how far it's come in the last year or so with this new Labs version in Search. We'renot exactly wild about AI Overviews, which are the little AI-generated paragraphs you often see at the top of your search results. They're sometimes inaccurate and have resulted in some infamous clangers, likerecommending that people add glue to their pizzas. But Google is ploughing ahead with them and announced that AI Overviews are getting wider rollout. The new expansion means the feature will be available in more than 200 countries and territories and more than 40 languages worldwide. In other words, this is the new normal for Google Search, so we'd better get used to it. Google's Liz Reid (VP, Head of Search) acknowledged in a press briefing before Google I/O 2025 that AI Overviews have been a learning experience, but claims they've improved since those early incidents. \"Many of you may have seen that a set of issues came up last year, although they were very much education and quite rare, we also still took them very, very seriously and made a lot of improvements since then\", she said. Finding and and buying tickets and still something of painful experience in Google Search. Fortunately, Google is promising a new mode that'spowered by Project Mariner, which is an AI agent that can surf the web just like a human and complete tasks. Rather than a separate feature, this will apparently live within AI Mode and kick in when you ask questions like \"Find two affordable tickets for this Saturday's Reds game in the lower level\". This will see it scurry off and analyze hundreds of ticket options with real-time pricing. It can also fill in forms, leaving you with the simple task of hitting the 'purchase' button (in theory, at least). The only downside is that this is another of Google's Lab projects that will launch \"in the coming months\", so who knows when we'll actually see it in action. Google gave its Shopping tab within Google Search a big refresh back in October 2024, and now many of those features are getting another boost thanks to some new integration with AI Mode. The 'virtual try-on' feature (which now lets you upload a photo of yourself to see how new clothing might look on you, rather than models) is back again, but the biggest new feature is an AI-powered checkout feature that tracks prices for you, then buys things on your behalf using Google Pay when the price is right (with your confirmation, of course). We're not sure this is going to help cure our gear-acquisition syndrome, but it it does also have some time-saving (and savings-wrecking) potential. Like traditional Search, Google's new AI Mode will offer suggestions based on your previous searches, but you can also make it a lot more personalized. Google says you'll be able to connect it to some of its other services, most notably Gmail, to help its answer your queries with a more tailored, personal touch. One example Google gave was asking AI Mode for \"things to do in Nashville this weekend with friends\". If you've plugged it into other Google services, it could use your previous restaurant bookings and searches to lean the results towards restaurants with outdoor seating. There are obvious issues here – for many, this may be a privacy invasion too far, so they'll likely not opt into connecting it to other services. Also, these 'personal context' powers sound like they have the 'echo chamber' problem of assuming you always want to repeat your previous preferences. Still, it could be another handy evolution of Search for some, and Google says you can always manage yourpersonalization settingsat any time. Mark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

    "title": "Google Beam could change your video calls forever with glasses-free 3D and near real-time translation",
    "article_text": "Project Starline is all grown up When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You may have already seen Google's Project Starline tech, which reimagines video calls in full 3D. It was first teasedover four years ago, and atGoogle I/O 2025we got the news that it's rolling out in full with a new name: Google Beam. Since its inception, the idea ofGoogle Beamhas been to make it feel like you're in the same room as someone when you're on a video call with them. Rather than using headsets or glasses though, it relies on cameras, mics, and AI technology. \"The combination of our AI video model and our light field display creates a profound sense of dimensionality and depth,\"says Google. \"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust as if you were face-to-face.\" Beam participants need to sit in a custom-made booth, with a large, curved screen that's able to generate a partly three-dimensional rendering of the person they're speaking to. The first business customers will get the equipment fromHPlater this year. There's another element of Google Beam that's been announced today, and that's real-time translation. As you might expect, this is driven by AI technology, and makes it easier to converse with someone else in a different language. As per the demo that Google has shown off, the translation is just a second or two behind the speech, and it works in the same way that a translation might be added afterwards on top of someone speaking in a video recording. It's another impressive part of the Google Beam experience, and offers another benefit for organizations with teams and clients all across the world. According to Google, it can preserve voice, tone, and expression, while changing the language the audio is spoken in. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This part of the experience won't only be available in Google Beam though: it's rolling out now inside Google Meet now for consumers, though you are going to need either the Google AI Pro or the Google AI Ultra plan to access it.

    "article_text": "See it, Solve it... for free When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google just announced that its AI voice assistant,Gemini Live, is now available for free on iOS and Android. Gemini Live has been available to paid subscribers for a while now, but you can now chat with AI, use your smartphone's camera to show it things, and even screen share without spending any money. The major announcement happened atGoogle I/O, the company's flagship software event. This year, Google I/O has focused heavily on Gemini and the announcement of AI Mode rolling out to all US Google Search users. Gemini Live is one of the best AI tools on the market, competing with ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode. Where Gemini Live thrives is in its ability to interact with what you see on screen and in real life. Before today, you needed an Android device to access Live's camera, but now that has all changed, and iPhone users can experience the best that Gemini has to offer. Google says the rollout will begin today, with all iOS users being able to access Gemini Live and screen sharing over the following weeks. Free access and iOS rollout weren't the only Gemini Live features announced at Google I/O. In fact, new functionality for the voice assistant could be a headline new addition. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Over the coming weeks, Google says Gemini Live will \"integrate more deeply into your daily life. \" Whether that's by adding events to your Google Calendar, accessingGoogle Maps, or interacting with more of the Google ecosystem, Gemini Live is going to become an essential part of how AI interacts with your device. While Google didn't say if this functionality will be available on iOS, it's safe to assume that, for now, increased system integration will be limited to Android. Gemini Live's free rollout, along with its upgrades, is one of, if not the, best announcements of Google I/O, and I can't wait to see how it improves over the next few months. Accessing Gemini Live is simple, you just need access to the Gemini app on iOS or Android.

Three spouseware apps - Cocospy, Spyic, and Spyzie, have gone dark. The apps, which are all basically clones of one another, are no longer working. Their websites are gone, and theircloud storage, hosted onAmazon, is deleted. The news was broken byTechCrunchearlier this week, who said that the reason behind the disappearance is not blatantly obvious, but it could be linked to data breaches that happened earlier this year. “Consumer-grade phone surveillance operations are known to shut down (or rebrand entirely) following a hack or data breach, typically in an effort to escape legal and reputationalfallout,” the publication wrote. 60% off for Techradar readers With Aura's parental control software, you can filter, block, and monitor websites and apps, set screen time limits.

U.S.-based spyware maker pcTattletale went out of business and shut down in May 2024 following a hack and website defacement.” Spouseware, orspyware, is a type of application that operates in the grey zone. It is advertised as a legitimate software, used to keep track of minors, people with special needs, and similar. However, most of the time it is just a cover for illegal activities, such as spying on other members of the household, love interests, and similar. Given its nature, the development team and key people are usually hidden, which makes it difficult for members of the media to get a comment or a statement. In late February this year, two of the apps - Cocospy and Spyic - were found exposing sensitive user data: email addresses, text messages, call logs, photographs, and other sensitive information. Furthermore, researchers were able to exfiltrate 1.81 million of email addresses used to register with Cocospy, and roughly 880,000 addresses used for Spyic.

    "title": "Want to be the next Spielberg? Google’s AI-powered Flow could bring your movie ideas to life",
    "article_text": "AI-Movie... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google clearly wants to inject artificial intelligence into more creative tools, as evidenced by the introduction of Flow at today’sGoogle I/O 2025. Flow is the search giant’s new ‘AI filmmaking tool’ that uses Google’s AI models, such asVeo, Imagen, andGeminito help creative types explore storytelling ideas in movies and videos without needing to go out and film clips and cinematic scenes or sketch out a lot of storyboard scenes by hand. Effectively an extension of the experimentalGoogle Labs VideoFXtool launched last year, Flow lets users add in text prompts in natural, everyday language to create scenes, such as \"astronauts walk out of the museum on a bridge,” and the AI tech behind Flow will create such a scene. Flow lets filmmakers bring their own assets into it, from which characters and other images can be created. Once a subject or scene is created, it can be integrated into clips and scenes in a fashion that’s consistent with the video or film as a whole. There are other controls beyond the creation of assets and scenes, with Flow offering direct manipulation of camera angles, perspectives and motion, easy editing of scene to hone in on features or widen up a shot to include more action - this appears to work as easily as a cropping tool - and offers the ability to manage all the ‘ingredients’ and prompt for Flow. Flow will be available for subscribers of Google Al Pro and Google Al Ultra plans in the US, with more countries slated to get access to the filmmaking AI soon. From seeing videos of Flow in action, it appears to be a powerful tool that brings an idea into a visual form, and with surprising realism. Powered by natural language prompts means budding filmmakers can create shots and science that would in the past have required dedicated sets or at least some deft CGI work. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. In effect, Flow could be one of those AI tools that opens up the world of cinema to a wider range of creatives, or at least gives amateurs more powerful creative tools to bring their ideas to life. However, this does raise the question of whether Flow would be used to create ideas for storytelling that would then be brought into silver screen life via physical sets, actors, and dedicated cinema CGI. Or if Flow will be used to create whole movies with AI, effectively letting directors be the sole producers of films, and bypass the need for actors, camera people, and the wealth of crew that are integral to traditional movie making. As such, AI-powered tools like Flow could breathe new life into the world of cinema that one might argue has got a little stale, at least on the big production commercial side, and at the same time disrupt the roles and work required in the movie-making industry.

    "title": "Trump accuses Biden’s advisors of treason",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has accused senior aides to his predecessor of committing“treason at the highest level”by allegedly exploiting Joe Biden’s cognitive decline to implement unauthorized policies that he would never have supported himself. In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump claimed that Biden never advocated for open borders and that the surge in illegal immigration was orchestrated by staffers who effectively“stole”the presidency by taking control of the autopen – a device used to replicate a person’s signature. “The Joe Biden that everybody knew would never allow drug dealers, gang members, and the mentally insane to come into our Country totally unchecked and unvetted. All anyone has to do is look up his record,”Trump argued, adding that the resulting influx has cost the US“hundreds of billions of dollars.” “It wasn’t his idea to open the border… It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the autopen,”he added.“This is TREASON at the highest level!... Something very severe should happen to these treasonous thugs that wanted to destroy our Country, but couldn’t, because I came along.” Trump’s allegations come amid renewed concerns about Biden’s health, following the recent announcement that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 and metastasis to the bone. While Trump publicly extended well wishes to Biden, he also questioned the timing and transparency of the disclosure, suggesting that the public was not informed soon enough. “I’m surprised that… the public wasn’t notified a long time ago, because to get to stage nine, that’s a long time,”Trump told reporters on Monday, questioning how doctors at the White House and Walter Reed hospital could have missed a condition that takes years to develop. “And the autopen is becoming a very big deal. You know, the autopen is becoming a big deal because it seems that maybe it was the president – whoever operated the autopen,”Trump added, speculating whether the same doctors had overlooked signs of cognitive decline.“In other words, there are things going on that the public wasn’t informed of. And I think somebody’s gonna have to speak to his doctor.” The autopen has become a focal point in Trump’s broader criticisms of Biden’s presidency. Earlier this year, Trump declared that several last-minute pardons issued by Biden were“void”because they were allegedly signed without his knowledge. Legal experts note that the use of the autopen by US presidents has historical precedent and is legally valid when authorized. However, Trump maintains that in Biden’s case, the device may have been misused by aides acting independently. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has since launched aninvestigationinto whether senior Biden aides orchestrated a cover-up of the president’s alleged cognitive decline.",

    "article_text": "Telegram founder Pavel Durov has promised to come to Romania and testify on the alleged foreign interference into the country’s presidential election. Durov promised to“help”the Romanian democracy in a post on X on Tuesday, responding to a message by George Simion, a Eurosceptic right-wing candidate who narrowly lost the election. Simion claimed the polls were subject to“external interferences by state and non-state actors,”including France and Moldova, and urged the country’s Constitutional Court to immediately annul the results. “I’m ready to come and testify if it helps Romanian democracy,”Durov wrote in response to Simion’s post. The Sunday runoff was won by pro-EU centrist Nicusor Dan by a margin of 53.6% to 46.4%. Simion, however, refused to recognize the outcome, accusing foreign parties of attempting to undermine his campaign. Simion’s claims received unexpected backing from Durov, who has claimed that French foreign intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally asked him to censor conservatives on his platform ahead of the latest attempt to elect Romania’s president. France’s foreign intelligence service, the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), has denied the claims, insisting it had contacted the Telegram founder only to“firmly remind him of his company’s responsibilities, and his own personally, in preventing terrorist and child pornography threats.” Durov was arrested in France last August and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users. The Russian-born entrepreneur, whose company is headquartered in Dubai,was ultimately released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail and allowed to leave the country mid-March. The latest attempt to elect the president in Romania follows a major political scandal prompted by the November vote, when the first round was unexpectedly won by hardline right-wing independent Calin Georgescu. The initial vote was promptly annulled by Romania’s Constitutional Court, which cited alleged Russian interference. Media reports citing initial findings of the probe into the affair indicated Georgescu’s surprise surge was likely prompted by a campaign staged by a firm with ties to the ruling National Liberal Party, which presumably sought to split the conservative vote. Georgescu, however, was ultimately banned from participating in the new election. Romania’s Foreign Ministry has accused Moscow of meddling in the latest runoff as well. The Russian government has dismissed the claim, stating that Bucharest’s“electoral mess”shouldn’t even count as a proper vote.",

    "article_text": "Right-wing EU critic George Simion has said he would challenge the result of Romania’s presidential election, claiming it was compromised by“foreign interference,”flagging France and Moldova in particular. Sunday’s runoff saw pro-EU Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan defeat his Euroskeptic rival with 54% of the vote in the second round of Romania’s presidential election. The rerun was ordered after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of the November election, in which independent candidate Calin Georgescu, an EU and NATO critic, finished first with 23% of the vote. The authorities claimed that there had been“irregularities”in his campaign, citing intelligence reports alleging Russian interference – allegations which Moscow has denied. In a Tuesday post on X, Simion – who had been the frontrunner – said he had“officially”asked Romania’s top court to annul Sunday’s election result“for the very reasons the December elections were annulled.” 🚨🇷🇴 I officially ask Constitutional Court TO ANNUL Romanian presidential elections (May 2025).For the very reasons December elections were annulled: EXTERNAL INTERFERENCES by state and non-state actors.

Neither 🇫🇷, nor 🇲🇩, nor anyone else has… He claimed that there was evidence of“external interferences by state and non-state actors,”adding that“Neither France nor Moldova nor anyone else has the right to interfere in the elections of another state.” Simion had previously claimed the electoral rolls contained some 1.7 million fictitious names and accused the government of busing in voters from neighboring Moldova. His Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) had also claimed that Moldova’s pro-EU ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) had directed its million-strong diaspora in Romania to vote for Dan. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, who has claimed French intelligence tried to pressure him into censoring conservative Romanian channels ahead of Sunday’s vote, reposted Simion’s message, saying he is“ready to come and testify if it helps Romanian democracy.” I’m ready to come and testify if it helps Romanian democracy.https://t.co/lEq16uKg8b Paris has denied Durov’s claim. Romanian officials, in turn, have accused Russia of interfering in the election without providing any proof. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed the accusations, calling the election“strange”and asserting the most popular candidate had been“forcibly”removed without justification. In response to Durov’s remarks, he also cited what he called the EU’s history of meddling in other countries’ affairs. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova also dismissed Bucharest’s accusations, calling the latest vote illegitimate and saying Romanian officials should clean up their own“electoral mess”instead of blaming others.",

    "title": "‘EU sanctions against me a signal to all Europeans’ – German journalist",
    "article_text": "The European Union’s decision to sanction two German nationals could set a dangerous precedent, where Brussels could severely limit the rights of any critic, journalist and blogger Thomas Roeper told RT. Roeper, who has also collaborated with RT’s German-speaking service, has been accused by the bloc of“destabilizing activities”and slapped with an EU entry ban, as well as an asset freeze. The European Council, comprising the leaders of EU member states, approved the bloc’s 17th round of sanctions against Russia on Tuesday. Roeper and German blogger Alina Lipp, both of whom currently reside in Russia, are among the individuals the bloc has targeted for being“involved in activities aimed at undermining the democratic political process in... Germany.” Speaking to RT later on Tuesday, Roeper said the EU had introduced personal sanctions against him because he has large audiences in Germany. Brussels’ latest decision to sanction EU nationals should be of great concern to all German citizens, the blogger believes. He noted that the punitive measure against him was adopted despite there being“no court [decision], nobody said which law I have violated.” “Without any court decision, some bureaucracy decided to freeze my money, to forbid working,”he told RT. According to the author, the move“is a signal for all people in the European Union, because if they do it to us, and this goes through, tomorrow they will start doing the same… against any critics.” He described the EU’s allegations against him as ludicrous.“I’m just a blogger sitting here in my kitchen and writing articles and I’m ‘destabilizing’ the EU which has a billion-euro budget for media work,”he quipped. But what’s“not funny,”he noted, is that while he lives in Russia, people in Germany would have a hard time meeting their basic needs if their rights were curbed in a similar manner. The EU’s latest round of sanctions primarily targeted Russia’s so-called ‘shadow fleet’ of oil tankers, which operate outside Western insurance systems. According to Brussels, Moscow has allegedly been using it to circumvent G7-led efforts to enforce a price cap on its crude oil exports.",

    "article_text": "Political developments over the past few weeks in Australia suggest that we may be witnessing the embryonic emergence of a new populist party in this country. The conservative Liberal/National party coalition suffered a devastating and catastrophic loss at the recent Australian federal election. The incumbent Labor party government won 93 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition managed to win only 43. Then this week, in an extraordinary development, the National party refused to renew its coalition agreement with the Liberals that has been in place for decades. The situation of the conservatives in Australia is, therefore, analogous to that in the UK – with a Labor government in power, opposed by a deeply divided and increasingly ineffective conservative opposition. There is, however, an important difference between the political landscape of each country – namely that, in the UK, Nigel Farage’s populist Reform party has recently emerged as a major political force. Reform’s victories in the recent local council elections, and its win in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election (overturning a 17,000 vote Labor majority) have confirmed that Reform is now the country’s main opposition party. In Australia, however, despite surging electoral dissatisfaction with the conservative opposition for the past decade, a populist party akin to Reform has not yet come into being. That situation, however, may be about to change. In the UK, Reform emerged in the wake of Brexit and widespread disenchantment with a Conservative party – now led by the ineffective Kemi Badenoch – racked by internal division, and unable to ideologically distinguish itself from the elitist Labour party. Over the past decade, increasing numbers of disaffected UK voters have realised that both major parties represent the economic and ideological interests of the global elites that now rule Britain, as well as most Western countries. The voters also appreciate that these elites are responsible for the current cost-of-living crisis and the destruction of traditional British values – processes that have reduced many ordinary Britons to penury, and made them cultural outcasts in their own country. Reform has given these disaffected voters a voice – by adopting policies that accord with their values, and provide a clear-cut political alternative to the policies espoused by both major parties. Reform’s policies include scrapping net zero and massive subsidies for renewable energy; putting an end to mass illegal immigration; dismantling DEI and transgender programs; defending traditional Western values; ending UK involvement in foreign conflicts; and nationalising key industries. In espousing these policies, Reform has opposed the entrenched elitism of both Labour and the Conservatives – and disaffected voters have responded by voting for Reform in increasing numbers. In Australia, the conservative coalition’s disastrous recent election loss –and its subsequent dramatic split – make it clear that it is finished as a meaningful political force. Since the election, the coalition has descended into bitter and public infighting over the spoils of defeat. It is perfectly clear that its politicians – save for National party Senator Matt Canavan, as to which see more below – have learned nothing from their recent electoral annihilation. The long-standing internal division within the Liberal party – between woke moderates and religiously oriented quasi-Trumpian conservatives – has re-emerged with increased ferocity and bitterness since the election. Right-wing Liberal party politicians have predictably called for a return to the party’s conservative“core values”–without being able to define what these values are, let alone acknowledge the deep ideological division at the heart of the party. The woke moderates are equally deluded. They have pressed for a“shift to the centre”– that would make the party even more indistinguishable from the Labor party than it was in the lead up to the recent election. The moderates have also maintained that the party’s difficulties can be solved by simply electing more women, and urged that female quotas be introduced. One moderate Liberal MP even suggested that the party should model itself on Kemi Badenoch’s Conservative party – because it was led by a black woman and committed to diversity. Notwithstanding such self-delusional nonsense, the moderates narrowly prevailed in last week’s Liberal party leadership contest – and the moderate former deputy leader, Susan Ley, was elected party leader by the a slim margin of 4 votes, 29 to 25. She is the first female leader of the Liberal party. A supporter of female quotas, Ley is an uninspiring diversity appointment, and will be lucky to survive in her position until the end of the year – especially now that her first act as leader has been to preside over the disintegration of the coalition agreement. The last thing that the Liberals need is an incompetent leader like Ley – she has much in common with Liz Truss – and her election has confirmed that the Liberal party (aptly described by Labor treasurer, Jim Chalmers, as a“smoking ruin”) is doomed to extinction. To paraphrase T.S. Eliot“this is how the Liberal party ends, not with a bang but a quota”. Both segments of the Liberal party have recently made obligatory  genuflections to Sir Robert Menzies, who created the modern Liberal party in 1944, and was prime minister from 1949 until he retired in 1966. Menzies was leader of the ramshackle and divided conservative United Australia party in 1944. He realised that, if the conservatives were to become a viable political force in post-war Australia, the party had to be replaced by a vigorous new organization with a coherent anti-Labor ideology. That is precisely what Menzies did. This is the only useful lesson that contemporary conservatives can learn from Menzies – but bickering Liberals, on both sides of the party’s acrimonious ideological divide, steadfastly refuse to acknowledge it. The rural-based National party, which did not lose any seats at the recent election, despairing of its future tied to the faltering Liberals, has decided to go it alone – but not before one foolish National party senator defected to the Liberals last week – an action akin to a rat leaping aboard a sinking ship. Amidst all this political“sturm und drang”, another National party senator, Matt Canavan, challenged the party’s current moderate leader two weeks ago, and did so on the basis of an explicitly populist agenda – thereby becoming the first mainstream conservative politician in Australia to advocate for a fully-fledged populist program. Canavan’s bid for leadership failed – by 15 votes to 5 – but his challenge constituted a populist attack on the ideological bankruptcy of the conservative coalition.  Canavan’s program was, in his own words,“a radical one”, opposed to“the tyranny of groupthink”, and designed to“give Australians a real choice”. He promised to scrap net zero and subsidies for renewable energy; oppose DEI and affirmative action programs; fully exploit Australia’s natural resources; and act in the the interests of workers and farmers by reducing food and energy prices. Canavan contested the leadership because the National party, like the Liberals, was incapable of adopting a populist program – and he must have known that his chances of being elected leader were poor. Canavan must also have realised that, even if he had been elected leader, the Liberals would have rejected his populist program out of hand, and that the coalition would have split. Be that as it may, notwithstanding that Canavan’s quixotic attempt to impose a populist agenda on the National party failed in limine, it caused the Nationals to seriously question net zero and associated renewable energy policies. This, in turn, has led the Nationals to split from the Liberals – which is what Canavan was probably seeking to achieve. Canavan is now left with only two options – he can retreat to the shadow backbench and watch the coalition parties disintegrate around him, or he can establish a new populist party. Robert Jenrick, Badenoch’s Justice Secretary, recently crossed the populist Rubicon, and – no longer willing to sit idly by while his divided party sleepwalked into complete irrelevance – demanded that the Conservative party immediately form a coalition with Reform. Badenoch, of course, condemned Jenrick for daring to suggest this. The task for Canavan, should he go down a similar track, is somewhat more onerous – yet far from unfeasible. A significant number of like-minded right-wing National and Liberal politicians would surely join a new populist party led by Canavan – after all, they now have virtually nothing to lose, and a great deal to gain. Obviously the process would be messy and take time. But the new party would have the advantage of its members already having seats in parliament – and the moderate remnants of the coalition parties, led by non-entities like Ley, would quickly disappear. Prime Minister Albanese no doubt believes that he will be in office for the next two terms at least, but the rapid recent collapse in popularity of the Starmer Labor government – also elected with a massive majority – shows that such hubristic assumptions can quickly be proved false. It is important to remember that the decline in Starmer’s popularity was brought about by Reform’s extraordinary advance – not by a resurgence of the Conservative party. And it will soon become obvious to Australian voters that Albanese’s government, like Starmer’s, is incapable of alleviating the cost-of-living crisis in the next three years. Remember, too, that Nigel Farage only decided to lead Reform into last year’s election at the very last moment – he had planned to go to America and campaign for Trump – and look at the commanding position that he finds himself less than a year later, even though his party has only five seats in the house of commons. The difficulties involved in establishing a new political party are, of course, considerable – and Farage has only recently established a functioning national party organisation and attracted substantial financial backing – as large donors desert the Conservatives en masse. If Canavan and other like-minded conservative politicians are serious about becoming an effective political counter-force to the Labor party, it is now obvious they can only do so by establishing a new populist party. The trajectory of contemporary politics in the West is beyond dispute – the decline of traditional conservative parties is irreversible; the popularity of social democratic parties tenuous in the extreme; and populist parties are rapidly becoming the major opposition parties. Events over the past two weeks in Australia make it clear that this ineluctable process is already beginning to reshape politics in this country. It only remains to be seen whether Matt Canavan, and his like-minded conservative colleagues, have sufficient Menzies-like determination to establish a new populist party and take advantage of the contemporary political zeitgeist.",

    "title": "Biden’s wife should be charged with ‘elder abuse’ – senior DOJ official",
    "article_text": "Jill Biden should face ‘elder abuse’ charges if she pushed her husband Joe to run for the presidency despite knowing about his cancer, Donald Trump’s DOJ lawyer Leo Terrell has said. Last weekend, the former US president’s office revealed that he has been diagnosed with an“aggressive form”of prostate cancer. The announcement met with mixed reactions, with some offering condolences to Biden and his family, while others alleged the diagnosis had been long known but deliberately withheld from the public. Responding on X to a post by Ian Jaeger on Monday, Terrell, a senior counselor to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, floated the idea. The Internet personality and political commentator directly claimed that Jill Biden“knew about President Biden’s health problems… but still wanted him to run for president.” “Elder Abuse! Criminal Charges??”Terrell wrote. Elder Abuse! Criminal Charges??https://t.co/prfDh49ulk According to Biden’s office, the ex-president and his family are now“reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”The condition of the former president, who had been previously successfully cured of skin cancer, was confirmed during a routine physical examination. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,”the office said in a statement.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.” Donald Trump offered his sympathy to Biden and his family, stating on Truth Social that“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,”he added. The president’s eldest son, however, struck a different note, joining the chorus of those alleging foul play.“What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???”Donald Trump Jr.wroteon X. Many users, however, pointed out that the ex-president’s wife is not a medical doctor, as her title stems from her doctorate in education. Trump Jr. made the remarks in response to a post by the CEO of Atossa Therapeutics, Dr. Steven Quay, who argued that prostate cancer was the“easiest”to diagnose, and it was“highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.”",

    "title": "Romanians destroy passports after pro-EU candidate’s election win (VIDEOS)",
    "article_text": "Dozens of Romanians have posted videos of themselves cutting up their passports in protest against the outcome of the country’s latest presidential election. The controversial vote, suspended last year by the country’s constitutional court, saw the pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, defeat his Euroskeptic rival, George Simion, with 54% of second round votes. On TikTok and other platforms, Romanians living abroad began sharing clips in which they can be seen destroying their passports. “This is my vote for Romania. My vote is worth nothing. We will never return,”one woman said in a widely viewed video. “Romania is dead,”proclaimed another netizen in a separate clip. The passport-cutting campaign comes amid claims from Simion and his supporters that the election had been manipulated by Romanian authorities, who allegedly coordinated with foreign powers to sway the vote. Simion claims that the electoral rolls contained some 1.7 million fictitious names and accused the government of busing in voters from neighboring Moldova. Simion’s Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) has also claimed that Moldova’s pro-EU ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) had directed its million-strong diaspora in Romania to support Dan. They point to an increase of over 70% in the Moldovan diaspora vote compared to the first round. Around 30% of Moldova’s population are dual Moldovan-Romanian citizens. Their votes constituted almost 25% of the total of Sunday’s turnout, according to the AUR. Simion had been a supporter of the independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu, a NATO and EU critic, who won the first round of elections in November 2024, but which were later annulled by Romania’s Constitutional Court, which alleged foreign interference. Georgescu was later barred from running again in what Simion claimed was a“coup d’état.” Telegram founder Pavel Durov has claimed that French intelligence attempted to pressure him into censoring conservative Romanian channels ahead of the vote. Paris has denied the claim while Romanian officials have in turn accused Russia of interference, but have not presented any evidence to support their claim. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has dismissed the allegations and has described the election as“strange,”arguing that the candidate with the strongest support had been“forcibly”removed without justification. Peskov reacted with credulity to Durov’s claims of European interference, noting the EU’s long history of meddling in the internal affairs of other states. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has also denied Bucharest’s accusations of election interference and dismissed Romania’s latest vote as illegitimate. Officials should clean up their own“electoral mess”instead of blaming others, she said.",

    "article_text": "Three schoolgirls have been injured in a stabbing rampage at a school in the southern Finnish town of Pirkkala. The attack was allegedly carried out by a fellow student, who has been taken into custody. The incident unfolded early Tuesday, when the suspect, 16, dressed in black, randomly attacked female students in the hallway of the Vahajarvi school in Pirkkala, around 180km (110 miles) north of Helsinki, which has around 1,200 children ranging from preschool age to ninth grade. The suspect had a camera attached to his body and streamed his attack online, disturbing footage of which made the rounds on social media. The suspect was taken into custody without incident outside the school within minutes of the attack, local police said in a statement. A bladed weapon was seized. Police said the victims’ injuries were not considered life-threatening. One of the girls sustained a knife wound to her neck, another was stabbed in the waist, and the third in the hand. Law enforcement said they have been investigating a written manifesto supposedly published by the suspect ahead of the attack, but did not elaborate on the contents. Local media reports suggest that the manifesto described the suspect’s intention to attack female students and stated that he had no friends and sought to gain fame through violence. The suspect also said he planned to surrender to police after the attack. The suspect was reportedly planning the attack for around six months and used ChatGPT in preparation, for reasons that are not immediately clear. A number of top officials have reacted to the attack. Education Minister Anders Adlercreutz took to X, saying:“all violence in schools is unequivocally condemnable.”",

    "article_text": "A Ukrainian-born male model has become the second suspect to be charged in a UK arson investigation involving properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, national media have reported. Romanian citizen Stanislav Carpiuc, 26, was charged with conspiring alongside fellow suspect Roman Lavrynovych – a Ukrainian national who was detained last week – and others in a series of attacks targeting locations in north London, according to a statement from the Metropolitan Police on Tuesday. Carpiuc was arrested Saturday at London Luton Airport by counterterrorism officers, who were called in because the properties are connected to“a high-profile public figure,”police said. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday morning and was remanded in custody until a further hearing alongside Lavrynovych on June 6. According to British media, the targets of the arson between May 8 and May 12 included a car once owned by Starmer, his private residence, and an address he used to live at. Carpiuc is believed to be the same individual listed as a male model based in London. According to public profiles, he was born in Chernivtsi, a town in western Ukraine with a significant ethnic Romanian population. The Daily Mail reported that Carpiuc is an aspiring actor and currently works in construction. Lavrynovych, 21, a Ukrainian national arrested on Tuesday last week, reportedly runs a building company and has also signed with a modelling agency. A third suspect, a 34-year-old individual whose identity has not been released, was arrested Monday and remains in custody, police said. Both Carpiuc and Lavrynovych have been charged with reckless endangerment of life. According to The Telegraph, the Starmer family home located in Tufnell Park is currently rented by the prime minister’s sister-in-law and was occupied during the attack. Addressing Parliament last week, Starmer condemned the alleged arsons, calling them“an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for.”",

    "title": "Spain hit by telecom disruption weeks after major blackout",
    "article_text": "Spain has been hit by a widespread communications outage, just weeks after a major power blackout affected the entire Iberian Peninsula. The network failure occurred due to an update by the telecommunications company Telefonica, which disrupted emergency services, landlines, and internet. The outage, which began early Tuesday, affected regions including Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, Andalusia, Aragon, and the Basque Country. In several areas, access to the 112 emergency hotline was interrupted, prompting the local authorities to provide alternative contact numbers for emergency services. Telefonica, Spain’s largest telecom provider, confirmed that it did“some network upgrade work which has affected some companies’ fixed communication services (voice and internet).”The company said the affected systems were isolated and service teams were deployed to restore operations. According to Telefonica, the origin of these problems stemmed from the network upgrade work, and access to services was“fully restored”by 12:30pm. The Ministry for Digital Transformation said it was in contact with Telefonica throughout the day and requested a detailed report on the incident. The disruption comes less than a month after a widespread power outage struck Spain and Portugal on April 28, affecting transport networks, telecommunications, and public infrastructure. The cause of the blackout is still under investigation, though preliminary assessments suggest a voltage anomaly led to automatic safety disconnections. On Tuesday, Spanish Energy Minister Sara Aagesen said Madrid found no evidence that the blackout was caused by a cyberattack on power generation control centers.",

    "article_text": "The phone call on Monday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump, marks a positive development and continues to restore communication, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has said. Talking to reporters on Tuesday, Rutte said it was a“good sign”that the conversation took place and welcomed Trump’s“leadership”in efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict. He added that the US president had“broken the deadlock”from“day one”since returning to office earlier this year. Rutte acknowledged there had been“no discussions with the Russians”until January, when Trump began to“open lines of communication”with Putin. Asked whether pressure on the Russian president should be increased, Rutte said,“Let’s be thankful that Americans are now taking this position, this leadership role.”He added it would not be helpful for him, as a NATO leader, to comment on every step in the process. Both Putin and Trump described their latest call as productive and encouraging. The US president said he expected progress on the Ukraine conflict within two weeks. According to a Kremlin statement, Putin thanked Trump for“US support in resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.” Yury Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy aide, said the call was conducted in a tone of“mutual respect,”with Trump expressing support for normalizing ties between Washington and Moscow. Putin said on Monday that he and Trump agreed that the next step should be a memorandum outlining principles and a timeline for a peace settlement in the Ukraine conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the next day that“there is and cannot be a deadline”for completing the document. Rutte’s remarks come as NATO members seek ways to militarize and produce more weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to raise €800 billion ($896 billion) to“rearm”the EU. The Trump administration has consistently demanded that European NATO states increase their annual military spending to 5% of GDP, calling the longstanding 2% target insufficient. Russian officials have condemned the steps being taken in Europe toward militarization, and dismissed claims that Moscow intends to attack either the EU or NATO. Moreover, Russia has expressed concern that, rather than supporting the US peace initiatives for the Ukraine conflict, the EU and UK are instead gearing up for war with Russia.",

    "title": "Germany’s border crackdown can only last ‘a few more weeks’ – police",
    "article_text": "Germany’s new border crackdown can only be sustained for“a few more weeks,”the country’s police union has warned, citing mounting pressure on officers tasked with enforcing the policy. The warning comes two weeks after the government introduced stricter border controls to curb the number of asylum seekers entering the country. ”We can only manage this because duty rosters have been adjusted, training for the units is currently on hold, and the reduction of overtime has been halted,”Andreas Rosskopf, chairman of the Federal Police and Customs division of the German Police Union, said. He warned that the controls can only be sustained“for a few more weeks.” The measures represent a major shift in Germany’s migration stance and fulfill a key campaign promise of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who vowed to tighten the immigration laws. The May 7 order from Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt bans asylum applications at all land borders, reversing former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 open-border policy. Exceptions are made for children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups. Up to 3,000 officers are being added to the 11,000 already stationed at Germany’s borders. The 2015 policy defined Germany’s approach to refugees, while also drawing fierce political backlash, with critics calling it“disastrous.” A week after the measures were announced, Dobrindt claimed that the number of rejections increased by almost a half. However, according to Der Spiegel, the number of asylum applications remained largely stable in the week after May 7. As the EU’s largest economy, Germany has been the most popular destination for asylum seekers. According to official statistics, foreigners currently make up 17% of the country’s population. Migration remains a polarizing issue, with local authorities often warning that the number of asylum seekers is straining their budgets. The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is known for its strong anti-immigration stance, was designated a“confirmed extremist entity”earlier this month by the domestic intelligence agency (BfV), which said its activities could threaten Germany’s democratic order. The designation was later suspended after legal appeals and public outcry.",

    "title": "EU and UK impose more sanctions on Russia despite US concerns",
    "article_text": "The EU and UK imposed new sanctions on Russia on Tuesday, escalating their campaign to pressure Moscow while ramping up support for Kiev. The sanctions were announced shortly after a call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart, Donald Trump. Following the conversation, Trump warned that imposing additional economic restrictions on Moscow could hinder efforts to achieve peace in the Ukraine conflict. The European Council, comprising leaders of EU member states and top officials, approved the bloc’s 17th round of sanctions, targeting what foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called“nearly 200 shadow fleet ships.”Kallas, a vocal critic of Moscow, stated that further measures“are in the works”in Brussels. Western officials claim that the targeted fleet enables Russia to evade G7-led efforts to enforce a price cap on its crude oil exports. In a coordinated move, the UK added 18 vessels from the same network to its sanctions list on Tuesday. In addition, the UK imposed sanctions on the St. Petersburg Currency Exchange and Russia’s state deposit insurance agency, citing efforts to sever critical financial lifelines. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the measures are intended to hold Putin accountable for supposedly“delaying peace efforts.” Last week, delegations from Russia and Ukraine met for the first time since 2022, when Kiev abandoned negotiations in favor of pursuing victory on the battlefield, as advised by the then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. European backers of Ukraine initially supported Kiev’s demand for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire before resuming talks, and threatened additional sanctions if Russia refused. Zelensky later backtracked after the Trump administration supported Putin’s proposal for renewed diplomatic engagement. Zelensky insisted, however, that Putin meet him in person in Türkiye to demonstrate his commitment to peace – an idea that the Russian president had not proposed. Ukrainian officials continue to call for expanded sanctions over what they describe as Moscow’s non-compliance with peace overtures. The Putin-Trump call on Monday was characterized as productive by both leaders. Trumpsaidhe believes Putin is interested in ending the conflict and warned that additional economic pressure could obstruct US mediation efforts. Putin has said Moscow and Kiev should negotiate a formal memorandum outlining a detailed path to a broader peace agreement, adding that a ceasefire could be part of the proposed road map.",

    "title": "EU quietly complains Ukraine is ‘all on us now’ – FT",
    "article_text": "European leaders backing Ukraine were reportedly“stunned”by US President Donald Trump’srefusalto support their efforts to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a phone call between the two leaders. ”He [Trump] is stepping away,”a senior European diplomat said, as cited by the Financial Times on Tuesday, describing the impression the US president produced.“Supporting and financing Ukraine, putting pressure on Russia: that’s all on us now.” The conversation between Putin and Trump on Monday was their third public engagement since Trump took office in January, with both describing it as positive. Trump reiterated his call for continued direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, and said the conflict is“a European situation”in which the US should never have been involved. Trump personally briefed the leaders of Ukraine, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the European Commission on the call, and made it clear he is“not ready to put greater pressure”on Russia, an unnamed source told the FT. EU officials and European NATO members had been counting on Washington’s support to extract concessions from Moscow by leveraging threats of new sanctions and continued weapons support for Ukraine. They interpreted the perceived shift in the US posture as a diplomatic win for the Kremlin, the British newspaper said. Before direct talks between Moscow and Kiev resumed in Istanbul last week, Ukraine and its backers demanded a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Russia as a prerequisite. Kiev agreed to take part after the US endorsed the talks, while European leaders postponed their own deadline for a truce. Moscow has since called for a memorandum to be drafted that would set out a road map to a peace treaty, possibly including a ceasefire. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovnotedthat finalizing the document would take time. Trump said following his discussion with Putin that in addition to ending the violence, a resolution of the conflict could lead to major economic benefits for the US, Russia, and Ukraine. He added that progress in the talks could be seen in a couple of weeks, but warned that a lack of results could lead Washington to reconsider its role as mediator.",

    "title": "EU state votes to quit ICC",
    "article_text": "Hungary's parliament has approved a bill initiating the country’s formal withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC). The move advances Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s push to exit what his government has labeled a biased and discredited institution. The National Assembly passed the legislation on Tuesday with 134 votes in favor, 37 against, and seven abstentions. The vote follows a decision in late April in which lawmakers agreed in principle to leave the ICC. ”Hungary firmly rejects the use of international organizations – in particular criminal courts – as political instruments,”read the bill published on parliament's website. Hungary joined the ICC by signing the Rome Statute in 1999 and ratifying it in 2001. However, according to Orban, the country“has always been half-hearted”in its membership. Orban announced the plan to quit The Hague-based institution last month during a state visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The ICC previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, alongside three Hamas leaders in November, over alleged war crimes in Gaza. Orban accused the ICC of losing its impartiality and becoming a“political tribunal,”assuring Netanyahu that the court’s actions“will have no effect in Hungary.”The Israeli prime minister praised Hungary’s“bold and principled”stance against the“corrupt”court. The ICC’s jurisdiction is currently recognized by 123 countries. Among the non-signatories are the US, Russia, China, and Israel. The court does not have its own police force and relies on member-states to detain and transfer suspects. In February, the administration of US President Donald Trump sanctioned the ICC and its top prosecutor, Karim Khan, for going after Netanyahu and Gallant. Earlier this month, Khan took a leave of absence amid a UN investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. In 2023, the court also issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and children’s rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of unlawfully deporting children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow rejected the charges as“null and void,”insisting the children were evacuated from conflict zones for their safety and could be returned to their families upon request. According to the terms of the Rome Statute, Budapest must notify the UN secretary-general of its intent to withdraw, and the decision would then take effect one year later.",

    "title": "US news network CEO quits over Harris interview",
    "article_text": "The president and CEO of CBS News, Wendy McMahon, has stepped down amid escalating tensions inside the network over a $20 billion lawsuit filed by US President Donald Trump. The US leader has accused CBS of interference in the 2024 election and favoring his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. McMahon, who was appointed to her post in August 2023, tendered her resignation on Monday as CEO of CBS News and Stations, explaining that“the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” The resignation stems from Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against the network, which centers on an October 2024 interview with Harris, the then-vice president and Democratic nominee. The network released two widely different versions of the conversation, one of which featured a convoluted and vague response about the Middle East policy, while the other was much more clear-cut and concise. Trump called the interview a“word salad”and accused CBS of deliberately editing Harris’s remarks to make her look better ahead of the 2024 presidential election. While the network admitted to editing the interview, it insisted that the changes were made for clarity and are standard journalistic practice. While Trump’s lawsuit is widely seen as a longshot in court, it is reportedly viewed as a significant liability impeding the merger of Paramount Global, CBS’s parent company, with Skydance Media, which requires federal approval. Paramount is said to be weighing a legal settlement with Trump over the lawsuit to avoid further delays. McMahon’s resignation follows that of Bill Owens, a top producer at CBS’s ‘60 Minutes’, who quit in late April, citing a loss of journalistic independence. Both were reportedly opposed to the settlement. Commenting on the lawsuit controversy and Owens’ resignation, ‘60 Minutes’ correspondent Scott Pelley claimed that the network has drastically altered the way it supervises stories. He insisted that while“none of our stories has been blocked,”the ex-producer“felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”",

    "title": "Trump opposed to new Russia sanctions",
    "article_text": "The US does not want to impose further sanctions on Russia“because there’s a chance”of progress towards a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, President Donald Trump said on Monday. The remarks followed a two-hour phone conversation earlier in the day with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a post on Truth Social following the call, Trump wrote that the tone and spirit of the conversation were“excellent.”Putin described the discussion as“very useful.” Speaking to reporters at the White House shortly after the call, Trump suggested that he is opposed to ramping up the sanctions on Russia. “Because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse,”the president said in the Oval Office, according to CNN.“But there could be a time where that’s going to happen,”he added. Trump also stated that immediately after his call with the Russian president, he relayed the details of their conversation to Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, along with the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, and the European Commission. According to the Financial Times, EU leaders were“stunned”by Trump’s portrayal of what had been agreed to during the conversation. A source familiar with the call told the outlet it is evident that the US president is“not ready to put greater pressure”on Putin. The EU is pushing to dramatically tighten the sanctions in order to compel Putin to end the Ukraine conflict. EU ambassadors approved the 17th package of sanctions against Russia last week, targeting nearly 200 oil tankers that the West claims are part of a Russian ‘shadow fleet’. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the US and EU must“go further”and impose“devastating sanctions”to“suffocate”the Russian economy“once and for all.” The push has been encouraged by US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who proposed what he called“bone-crushing”sanctions, including 500% tariffs on exports from Russia if it resists peace talks. Russia remains committed to seeking a long-term solution to the Ukraine conflict but will not tolerate being addressed in the“language of ultimatums,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week. He has also stated that Russia is accustomed to Western pressure and is not concerned about new sanctions.",

    "title": "Germany promises new EU sanctions after Putin-Trump call",
    "article_text": "Germany has said it supports new EU sanctions against Russia in the energy sector, following a phone call between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Berlin wants Washington to support the restrictions, though Trump is reportedly reluctant to ramp up pressure on Moscow. Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said Berlin“supports the elements [of sanctions] related to Nord Stream,”adding:“It is, of course, also crucial that the US will accompany a potential sanctions package.” The Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea have been inactive since 2022 due to EU sanctions and sabotage, which Russia insists was orchestrated by Western intelligence agencies. Last week, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the next round of EU sanctions would target Russia’s financial sector, a fleet of ships used to bypass oil bans, and the Nord Stream system. The goal, she said, is to compel Moscow to accept a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine. Moscow has stated that it is open to a ceasefire“in principle,”but has expressed concerns that it would only benefit Ukraine and allow its battered forces to regroup. Russia has also said it considers the Western sanctions illegal, while noting that the country’s economy has long been accustomed to Western pressure. The comments by the German official come after a highly anticipated two-hour phone call between Putin and Trump. Putin described the call as“substantive and quite candid,”adding that Russia is ready to work with Kiev on drafting a memorandum on a potential future peace agreement. Trump described the call as“excellent,”noting that“Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an end to the war.” European leaders were“stunned”by Trump’s response, the Financial Times reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. It added that the US president is apparently“not ready to put greater pressure”on Putin and did not make any promises regarding future punitive action. FT sources also said Trump made it clear that“he would pull the US back from engaging with the conflict and leave Ukraine and Russia to directly negotiate a ceasefire.”",

    "title": "France used ‘terror’ and ‘child porn’ to mask political agenda – Durov",
    "article_text": "Telegram founder Pavel Durov has doubled down on his claims that France’s foreign intelligence agency pressured him to censor conservative voices on his platform, dismissing their purported law enforcement concerns as a“manipulation tactic.” On Sunday, Durov accused the head of the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE), Nicolas Lerner, of asking him to take down Romanian Telegram channels ahead of the country’s presidential runoff. The DGSErejectedthe allegations of political interference, insisting that it had contacted Durov on multiple occasions only to“firmly remind him of his company’s responsibilities, and his own personally, in preventing terrorist and child pornography threats.” “French foreign intelligence confirmed they met with me – allegedly to fight terrorism and child porn. In reality, child porn was never even mentioned. They did want IPs of terror suspects in France, but their main focus was always geopolitics: Romania, Moldova, Ukraine,”Durov said in a post on X on Monday. The Russian entrepreneur argued that Telegram has long combated child abuse through“content fingerprint bans, dedicated moderation teams, NGO hotlines, and daily transparency reports on banned content.” “Falsely implying Telegram did nothing to remove child porn is a manipulation tactic,”he added, insisting that Telegram’s extensive moderation efforts have been“verifiable”since at least 2018. Durov, whose company is headquartered in Dubai, was arrested in France last August and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail and dismissed the charges as baseless. He was eventually permitted to leave France in March after assuring the court that Telegram had increased cooperation with the authorities worldwide. In September 2024, the encrypted messaging service updated its privacy policy to allow the collection of metadata – such as IP addresses, device information, and username changes – for up to one year. According to the policy, this data may be shared with the“relevant judicial authorities”if a user is suspected of engaging in illicit activity. Late last year, Telegram channels belonging to major Russian news outlets were rendered inaccessible across the EU. Durov criticized the move, claiming the bloc imposesmore censorshipand media restrictions than Russia. The latest controversy emerged as Romania held a runoff presidential election. The vote followed a Constitutional Court ruling that overturned the initial results after right-wing independent candidate Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round. The case was cited by US Vice President J.D. Vance during a speech in Munich in February as an example of EU governments undermining democratic norms.",

    "title": "Trump reveals difficult relationship with Zelensky",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that his relationship with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has been challenging, describing him as“not the easiest person to deal with.”The comment came as Trump reiterated his efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine following separate phone calls with both leaders. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump shared his impressions after holding discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine’s Zelensky earlier in the day. “I’d rather tell you in about two weeks from now, because I can’t say yes or no… Look, Zelensky is a strong guy, and he’s not the easiest person to deal with. But I think that he wants to stop… I hope the answer is that he wants to get it solved,”Trump told reporters at the White House, following separate conversations with Putin and Zelensky earlier in the day. Trump stated last week that“nothing is going to happenuntil Putin and I get together,”as he urged Kiev to“immediately”accept Moscow’s proposal for direct negotiations. Asked whether he still felt that way following theIstanbul talksand his latest calls, Trump said he remains cautiously optimistic. “I tell you, big egos involved, but I think something’s going to happen. And if it doesn’t, I just back away and they’re going to have to keep going,”he said. He declined to say what would cause him to abandon efforts to mediate the conflict. “I would say I do have a certain line, but I don’t want to say what that line is because I think it makes the negotiation even more difficult than it is,”he added. Trump said his phone call with Putin“went very well”and that“progress is being made,”but offered few details of his follow-up call with Zelensky. The US president has long suggested that Kiev isharder to work with, recalling a heated Oval Office meeting in February in which the Ukrainian delegation was told to leave prematurely andonly returnwhen Zelensky is“ready for peace.” Zelensky said he spoke with Trump twice on Monday – before and after the call with Putin – and warned him against any decisions on Ukraine being made without Kiev’s involvement. While insisting that Ukraine wants to“stop the war,”Zelensky said Kiev would not agree to any Russian“ultimatums,”and once again demanded nothing short of a“full and unconditional ceasefire.” Putin described the two-hour call with Trump as“substantive and quite candid,”announcing that Moscow is ready to work with Kiev on a memorandum envisioning a future peace agreement. “In general, Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,”Putin said.",

    "title": "Alexander Skarsgård Is Leaning Into Fetishwear at Cannes",
    "article_text": "“Is this the best way to promote a film?” a reporter askedAlexander Skarsgårdyears ago at the 2023Sundancepremiere ofInfinity Pool, an event to which the actor wore a tasteful crewneck sweater and a leashed leather dog collar. “I have no idea,” the actor, whose icy good looks, 6’4” stature, and terse Scandinavian nature, always brings a certain freaky vibe to the function that keeps everybody on their toes,deadpannedin reply. He added, with a sly smile, “It’s a hot look.” (The accessory was, in fact, thematic; there are leash-centric moments in the film, which was directed by the unnerving-by-blood director Brandon Cronenberg, son of David Cronenberg.) Nonetheless, it’s a promotional strategy that Skarsgård continued to stick with at the 2025CannesFilm Festival, which kicked off in southern France last week. This year, the Swedish actor is promoting the upcoming dramaPillion, in which his character, the leader of a queer biker gang, starts up a dom-sub relationship with a newcomer played by the British actor Harry Melling, who is most broadly recognizable for portraying Dudley Dursley in theHarry Potterfilms. (Per a recent interview withVanity Fair, when Skarsgård first learned about this project, he “definitely wanted to put on the leather gear and jump into the trenches with it.”) Alexander Skarsgård wearing Loewe leather pants at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival. Working with the celebrity stylistHarry Lambert, whose client roster also includes Harry Styles and Emma Corrin, Skarsgård dressed strategically in a casual, kink-forward look for aPillionscreening: black leather pants and biker boots by Loewe, dark aviator shades from Linda Farrow, and an ’80s-era tee printed with an illustration of a supine man licking the sole of a leather boot. Later on, inside the theater—where the film received a seven-minutestanding ovation—Skarsgård embraced a man in a pup hood, who revealed himselfon Instagramto be a real-life Welsh biker named Paul Tallis,a consultant on the film. After the leather pants and vintage bootlicker T-shirt, Skarsgård upped the ante for the red-carpet premiere of Wes Anderson’s latest film,The Phoenician Scheme, in a festishistic Saint Laurent look—a haughty double-breasted tuxedo jacket paired with thigh-high black leather boots—from designer Anthony Vacarello’s fall 2025 menswear collection, which imagined a fictional ’80s linkup between Yves Saint Laurent and the artist Robert Mapplethorpe. (Think boardroom by day, BDSM dungeon by night.) A look from Saint Laurent's fall 2025 menswear collection. In March, Pedro Pascal wore the full Saint Laurent look at the season-two premiere ofThe Last of Us. Celebrity-menswear cognoscenti may recognize the boots thanks to fellow menswear firebrandPedro Pascal—a jury member at this year’s Cannes festival—who wore the hefty Saint Laurent wadersto much fanfare at theLast of Usseason premiere in March. For those in the know, both actors’ looks nodded to the narrative queerness and kink of Vacarello’s collection. Later that day, Skarsgård kept with the edgy juxtaposition for the premiere of Swedish-Egyptian filmmaker Tarik Saleh’sEagles Of The Republic, to which he wore a pinstriped gray suit jacket and pale pink bow tie by the Italian label Magliano with cobalt sequined trousers by the young British designer Bianca Saunders. He looked like an uncanny prom king, whose sequin pants suggested that he may just ditch the whole shindig to go rave in a field instead. Many actors are still coming around to the idea thatoutlandish red-carpet dressingis a reliable (and relatively low-lift) way to drum up attention and promote their work. But Skarsgård, the eldest son of actor Stellan Skarsgård, knows his way around these publicity-stirring waters: for years, the lead image onthe actor’s IMDb pagehas shown him pantsless at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards. But despitehis longstanding appreciationfor freak, the 48-year-old is, by his own admission, the type who is more likely to show up to an event wearing, say, a standard Calvin Klein suit. Previously,the actor toldGQthat he doesn’t like the unsustainability of red-carpet pomp: “I don’t want [the situation to be that] every time you’re on the red carpet, you have to wear something new and then never wear it again. I think we consume enough in our society, that’s not something I’d want to promote or endorse,” he said. So with any luck, we’ll all see Skarsgård wearing those leather waders again.",

    "title": "‘Highest 2 Lowest’ Is The First Great A$AP Rocky Film",
    "article_text": "When news broke that Spike Leewas remaking Akira Kurosawa’s crime classicHigh and Low, you’d be forgiven for feeling at least a little nervous. The director’s track record when it comes to reinterpreting beloved cinema is far from stellar: his 2013 take on Park Chan-wook’s cult classicOldboywas less a reimagining and more a greatest-hits highlight reel that failed to capture the exhilarating yet queasy spirit of Park’s film.Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, a remake of the 1973 horrorGanja & Hess, was also met with a frosty reception. The first hour ofHighest 2 Lowest, which premiered yesterday at theCannes Film Festival, would have you believe those fears are justified—it begins as a strangely flat crime drama that feels like Lee working on autopilot, until it really comes alive and stands on its own. And whenHighest 2 Lowestdoes rise to greatness, it’s not because ofDenzel Washington—it’s because ofA$AP Rocky. Not that Washington isn’t a commanding presence. That’s a given. He plays David King, head of Stackin’ Hits Records, an ailing label years past its prime and on the verge of a sale to a conglomerate. When his driver’s son is kidnapped from basketball camp after the culprit mistakes him for David’s own son, the mogul is forced to consider coughing up millions to pay the ransom. Lee has switched out the shoe business in Kurosawa’s original for the music industry here, and it’s fertile ground for sharp observations aboutart and commerce in the Spotify era. There are debates around cancel culture and social-media clout, and many of those heady, topical ideas are filtered through Rocky’s Yung Felon, an underground rapper who intends to be noticed by his idol by any means necessary. Highest 2 Lowesttruly kicks into gear when Rocky enters the picture. Both funny and invigorating, his performance injects the film with a propulsive energy when it needs it most. He arrives in an exhilarating subway chase sequence in which he wobbles on top of the 4 train—a thief with an abundance of ambition and none of the skill. David’s worried about technology and AI encroaching on artistic integrity, and Yung Felon is all of his worst fears realized. Attention, the rapper argues, is the most valuable form of currency—but what’s music without artistry? Their confrontation culminates in an impromptu rap battle: Washington delivers his rhymes with Shakespearean gravitas, but Rocky proves an effective foil, lacing his verses with frustration and anger at a world that refuses to hear him. Not many actors can say they’ve gone up against Denzel Washington and put up a good fight. Rocky is now one of them. At the film’s press conference, Lee suggested that his latest collaboration with Washington could be his last. “I think this is it: five,” the director said. “He’s just been talking about retirement, even though he’s just done another deal. Five films together, they stand up.” Washington will always be one of Lee’s greatest creative partners—but perhaps Rocky has the potential to be the next one.",

    "title": "Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal Both Paid Tribute to That Harrison Ford Cannes Photo",
    "article_text": "Thanks to its location on the Mediterranean, its famed golden light, and an abundance of infinity pools, there’s no shortage of great places to snap a photo inCannes. If you’re chasing maximum menswear clout, however, there’s only one choice: the gravel walkway in front of the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in nearby Cap d’Antibes. That’s wherePedro PascalandPaul Mescalboth posed for photos duringthis week’s Cannes Film Festival, the formerin a plunging-tank-top-flared-trousers-and-studded-loafers ensemble, the latter incuffed white chinos and a vintage Sundance (ha!) sweatshirt. So what’s so special about this particular backdrop? The answer involvesHarrison Ford, a pair of short shorts, and one of the greatest fit pics of all time. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, which opened in the mid-19th century, is a legend unto itself and has been adestinationfor royals, moguls, and A-list celebrities since F. Scott Fitzgerald popped bottles there in the 1930s. If you’ve seen a picture of someone standing outside the hotel’s famous facade, however, it’s more than likelythe one of Harrison Ford, hands in his pockets, during Cannes in 1982. Dressed in a navy blue crewneck sweater, thigh-bearing shorts, aviator shades and a pair of extremely lived-inboat shoes, Ford exudes the kind of easy-going charisma that made him the definitive leading man of the 1980s. (WhenGQinformed Ford that this photo had become somewhat of a menswear north star,he replied, in characteristic deadpan: “I think I’m going to be ill.”) In this context, it makes sense that Pascal and Mescal both chose this spot to immortalize their outfits this week. Pascal's Calvin Klein runway look was a big swing, and while it might have worked on the red carpet, it seems slightly formal against the relaxed, idyllic backdrop of the famed French Riviera hotel. Meanwhile, Mescal’s outfit, complete with his signature Adidas trainers, comes off as more casual by comparison. Still, put either of them next to Harrison Ford at the height of his powers and you’ll realize what makes that 1982 photo so special. That’s because there’s nothing particularly remarkable about Ford’s clothes at all. Instead, it's the way he wears them. It’s the slouch, the smirk, the tousled hair, and the E.T. button jauntily pinned to his shorts pocket. It’s a level of effortless cool that many aspire to, but few—even guys with serious menswear clout—can often achieve. That said, if you happen to have a crewneck, someshort shorts, and a pair of boat shoes in your closet, you now know exactly how to wear them to maximum effect.",

    "title": "7 Best Sleep Trackers of 2025 to Make Sense Of Your Restless Nights",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you’re searching for the best sleep trackers, you’re doing yourself a favor.Quality sleepis necessary for feeling like a functional human, but it seems increasingly elusive these days. And despite whatTikTok wellness brosmight say, getting rest shouldn’t feel like a science experiment. Between endless sleep hacks and half-baked advice about blue light and cold showers, it’s hard to know what actually matters. Sleep trackers won’t fix yoursleepovernight, but they can help you figure out what’s going on when you close your eyes. Over time, they reveal trends in your sleep stages,resting heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), restlessness, sleep latency (the fancy word for how long it takes you to fall asleep), and overall habits. I tested the most popular options—rings, wristbands, headbands, and on-mattresssensors—to figure out which ones are actually worth wearing to bed and sifting through the data when you wake up. Oura Oura Type of Device: RingBattery Life: 8 daysHSA/FSA Eligible: YesConnectivity: BluetoothSubscription: Yes Of all the sleep trackers I tested,Ouraseems like the best solution formostpeople who want to learn as much about their sleep as possible. The app is easy to navigate, and the insights are clear without being too dumbed down. It gives you a general sleep score each morning (I’ve hovered around 83 and could rarely seem to crack 90) along with stats like total sleep, time in bed, resting heart rate, and how long you spent in each stage of sleep. Everything is presented on a sliding bar, which makes it easy to spot what’s going well and what needs work. There’s also a health trends section that gets better the longer you wear the ring. You’ll see your sleep regularity score, and eventually, your chronotype—basically whether your body prefers early mornings or late nights. After a little under two weeks of wear, mine’s still calculating, so you have to stick with it to get the full functionality of the app. There are a few drawbacks, though. I ordered the rose gold-colored ring, and it’s already showing scuffs and scratches. (I am hard on my gear, but this felt a little fast). The activity tracking also isn’t great. It logs every short walk as a workout, and if you’re coming from something like Garmin, the fitness features will feel limited. But for sleep and recovery tracking, it does what it’s supposed to do—and does it well enough that I’m still wearing it. Ultrahuman Ultrahuman Type of Device: RingBattery Life: 4 to 6 daysHSA/FSA Eligible: YesConnectivity: BluetoothSubscription: No Ultrahuman offers the most data of all of the sleep trackers I tested, but you’ll need to be dedicated—or at least willing to poke around the cluttered app. The battery life lags behind Oura and the dedicated menu has a lot of sections that feel like an unnecessary waste of space unless you use other devices like a glucose monitor. But once you get past the bloat, there’s a lot of good information here. You get a color-coded sleep score each morning, plus a separate recovery score that accounts for your sleep and activity. (Green means good, yellow means average. I’ve yet to see my score dip into the red.) Click into your sleep score and you’ll get a breakdown of total sleep, time in bed, resting heart rate, HRV, and sleep stages. It also flags certain metrics—like my sleep efficiency and restfulness, which were almost always labeled as “needs attention.” A few smart additions make it stand out from the Oura: It calculates both your caffeine cutoff time and sleep debt, which feel far more actionable than a vague sleep score alone. (I was behind by 90 minutes one day and actually went to bed earlier because of it.) If you’re comparing it directly to the Oura Ring, one clear advantage is that it doesn’t require a subscription. But the app is messier, and the overall experience feels a little less refined. That said, I wore both rings side by side for weeks, and my sleep and recovery scores were consistently in sync. Whoop Whoop Type of Device:Wrist wearableBattery Life: 14 daysHSA/FSA Eligible: YesConnectivity: BluetoothSubscription: Yes Want to sleep better to get more out of your workouts or PR your next race? You can learn a lot about your sleep, recovery, and overall health by wearing a Whoop. It’s built for people who want to track everything—training load, HRV, respiratory rate. The app gives you a recovery “Strain” score each morning, which pulls from those metrics and reflects how ready your body is to handle stress. Sleep tracking is part of that picture, with data on duration, disturbances, and consistency. The interface is perhaps the most polished of the bunch—it is screen free, but the visuals on the app are crisp and clean. The insights are useful and the habit logging feature is genuinely interesting if you use it consistently—it makes correlations between your recovery score and things like caffeine and alcohol intake. Compared to other wearables, the Whoop’s sensors are always on, constantly monitoring your heart rate and rhythms. (For this reason, it’s a great choice for medical insights, too—but you’ll have to pay a premium for the FDA-approved MG “medical grade” version.) Either way, be prepared to pay monthly: While the cost of the band is cheap, you’ll need a subscription to make any use of it. Garmin Garmin Amazon Type of Device: Wrist wearableBattery Life: 14 daysHSA/FSA Eligible: NoConnectivity: BluetoothSubscription: No This watch was built to do everything—and do it well. It’s a full-on fitness watch with GPS, heart rate, workout tracking, and a long list of sport modes. But the sleep tracking also holds its own. You’ll get a breakdown of sleep stages, HRV, breathing rate, and sleep temperature, all packaged nicely in a morning report. Throughout the day, you can reference your “Body Battery” score to see how your energy levels are holding up. And the sleep coach will gently tell you how much sleep you need based on your previous night’s schedule. The main trade-off is comfort. It’s bulkier than a ring or sensor pad, and if you’re not used to wearing a watch to bed, you’ll notice it. Still, if you want one device that does everything—track runs, log strength training, give you recovery data, and help you figure out why you feel like garbage after five hours of sleep—this one can handle it. Eight Sleep Eight Sleep Type of Device: Mattress-basedBattery Life: N/AHSA/FSA Eligible: YesConnectivity: WiFiSubscription: Yes Eight Sleeptracks your sleep while adjusting bed temperature as you go, so it’s ideal for anyone who runs hot and doesn’t want to wear something to sleep. The app delivers core sleep data—total time, latency, HR, HRV—and also calculates a daily recovery score. Best of all, it’ll tell you how much you or your partner snores, and automatically adjust the head height to try to curb the noise. (You’ll need the Ultra model in this case.) If you're into automation, it’ll preheatyour bedandcool it downbased on your temperature and sleep cycle. But it’s quite pricey and the subscription is non-optional to access all of the functions. Plus, the whole system is overkill if you just want basic insights. It’s also the most involved setup on this list: The podcovergoes over yourmattress, the hub is the size of a desktop computer, and you need a solid WiFi connection. Still, if you’re already thinking about a big bedroom upgrade and want sleep data without wearing a thing, this is the most feature-rich option out there. And will prevent those night sweats. You just can’t put a price tag on good sleep…..right? Sleepme Sleepme If you hate wearing things to bed but still want sleep data, Sleepme is one of the few non-wearable options that doesn’t totally suck. The setup includes a thin sensor pad that goes under yourfitted sheetand connects to a small wire and hub. It’s not invisible—you’ll feel it a little if you’re sleeping on a baremattress—but once you throw amattress padover it, it mostly disappears. The tracking itself is basic but functional. You get your sleep stages, total time in bed, actual sleep time, sleep latency (how fast you fell asleep), resting heart rate, and HRV. It won’t give you any slick recovery scores, but it gets the essentials right. Compared to my other trackers, all of the data was surprisingly consistent for something that doesn’t attach to your body. That said, it’s heavily reliant on a stable Wi-Fi connection. One night my router rebooted mid-sleep and I woke up to a blank dashboard. Other nights, my connection was iffy and I had large gaps in my sleep data. This isn’t the most detailed tracker on the list, but it’s ideal if you want low-effort, low-interference data without wearing a ring or strapping something to your wrist. (This is the sleep tracker I passed onto my parents, who wanted more sleep insights without worrying about wearing or charging a device.) Elemind Elemind Instead of just tracking your sleep, Elemind’s headband is designed to improve it. The headband tracks your EEG brainwaves and plays short auditory pulses that supposedly sync with your personal rhythm, so you fall asleep faster. Does it work? Eh, unclear. Its effectiveness was demonstrated inpreliminary clinical studies, but when I wore it, my sleep latency (the time it took to fall asleep) ranged from 4 to 16 minutes, according to the device’s app. That’s pretty on par with the numbers from my Oura ring on all other nights. The static sound can also be more distracting than soothing: The first night I wore it, I had to turn the volume all the way down, which negates the sleep-inducing benefits I was supposed to get. (The annoying pulses of static are apparently what stop your mind from wandering and put you to sleep.) And even at a lower volume, it took some getting used to. But the headband stayed on all night, felt comfortable and squishy (even as aside sleeper), and left only minor lines on my forehead by morning. Sleep tracking includes total time asleep, latency, sleep efficiency, restfulness, and basic stage data. It’s not nearly as detailed as some trackers (it doesn’t measure your heart rate), but it’s enough to get a sense of how your night went. If you’re curious about brain-based tech and struggle to fall asleep each night, it’s an interesting tool—and it could work for you better than it worked for me. Just know that you’ll need the subscription to unlock the sleep insights. Type of Device:There’s no one device that works for everyone. Rings are the most comfortable for many people, but they can get in the way during activities like lifting or climbing. Wrist wearables tend to be annoying for side sleepers, but if you already wear a watch every day, they might feel totally normal. And if you don’t want to wear anything at all, some sensors go directly on the mattress—but they’re generally less accurate than devices that pull data straight from your body. Data and Insights:All of the sleep trackers listed above measure the basics like sleep stages, time asleep, and sleep latency. Most (except the Elemind headband) will give you more insights like heart rate, HRV, and respiratory rate. The better ones give you context—like whether your rest was restorative, or how your habits (late-night snacks, wine, stress) are affecting your recovery. You don’t need a tracker to tell you your midnight restlessness is bad, but you might want one that helps you figure out why it keeps happening. Look for platforms that give you both the raw dataandsome interpretation, or else you may just end up more overwhelmed then before you started tracking. Battery Life:Charging a device every night defeats the point of using it while you sleep. (For me, at least.) Most rings and watches last several days, though headbands often die faster.Mattress padsstay plugged in, but can glitch out with bad Wi-Fi or power interruptions. If you’re someone who forgets to charge your electronics, you may want to find a sleep tracker with a lengthy battery life. Subscriptions:Some trackers lock key features behind a monthly fee. Others give you full access with the upfront cost of the device. If you're comparing two similar products, this might be the deciding factor. Subscriptions aren’t necessarily bad—but you should consider how long you plan to wear it and if the features are worth the monthly credit card charges. Extra Features:You should also consider whether you want other features in addition to sleep tracking. If you like to track your routes during runs or bike rides, it helps to have everything in one device, like in the Garmin Venu 3. If you need features to boost your sleep quality, consider the Eight Sleep Pod or Elemind. Do sleep trackers actually work? They work to a point. Most wearable devices are good at tracking trends over time (like total sleep, body temperature, REM sleep, deep sleep, light sleep, blood oxygen levels, sleep latency, and resting heart rate), but less reliable when it comes to granular data like exact sleep stages. The more important question is whether the data helps you change anything. If you’re going to stress over every dip in your recovery score, it might do more harm than good. But if you use it to spot patterns and adjust habits, it can be genuinely useful. What’s the most accurate type of sleep tracker? Generally, the closer the sensor is to your body, the better. Rings, Fitbits, smartwatches, and wrist wearables tend to be more accurate than mattress-based sensors, which can get thrown off by movement or shared beds. But even the best consumer trackers aren’t medical devices. (Except the Whoop MG, which has an FDA-approved EKG to detect atrial fibrillation and blood pressure.) If you're after precision down to the minute or a sleep apnea screening, you're better off doing a sleep study than using something you can buy on Amazon. For most people, though, a consistent and reasonably accurate sleep tracking device Like a Garmin, Oura, or Apple Watch is more than enough to get meaningful sleep monitoring insights and better sleep.",

    "title": "The 27 Best Nike Dunks of All Time, Ranked",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. It’s hard to place the origins of sneaker culture as we know it today. You could say it started with the originalAir Jordanor Nike’sAir Max line. You could argue it really got going via the NikeTalk forums and the resale industry and SNKRS, with social media and cell phones acting as the great equalizer in a retail world once built on knowing the right person who could get you the right pair of shoes at the right time. Still, if you want the closest parallel to the sort of creative energy, hype, and ethos that the current sneaker world exists in, it’s the Dunk Era. Dunks first exploded in the ’80s as a basketball shoe, with high- and low-top variations fusing function and aesthetic like few other sneakers of the era. What started as a shoe made for the court eventually planted the seeds of the culture, largely thanks to the ’90s-era CO.JP line. Through this project, Nike produced a series of exclusive colorways (with some choice Dunks among them) for Japanese retailers that soon became the stuff of sneaker legend, creating a sense of elusiveness to new colorways and fueling a community of Western fans eager to find a way to track down a pair from the other side of the planet. Along the way, the silhouette took on immense popularity in an unexpected place: skate culture. The flat, traction-friendly sole and lightweight nylon tongue (a new addition to the silhouette in the nineties) made it as perfect for riding a board as it was for the court—not to mention the shoe had become incredibly accessible as Jordans and signature basketball sneakers took over the market. It was easy to walk into a sneaker store and find Dunks on a discount rack, meaning nobody had to feel any type of way about thrashing their pair on a sesh. When sneaker legend Sandy Bodecker took over the burgeoning Nike SB line in 2001 (the official brand launch came in 2002), he saw incorporating the Dunk into the line as an obvious move. So with some choice modifications (namely a fat padded nylon tongue) the SB Dunk hit the scene, changing the course of sneaker history. Throughout the aughts, Nike SB Dunks became the centerpiece of sneaker culture, thanks to an unrivaled run of visionary designers, skaters, collaborators, and a tendency to embrace chaos. Shoes drew inspiration from cult cinema, cities, music, and more. In an era in which so many of these worlds were colliding with each other and that of streetwear, SB Dunks became everything. For a specific generation of sneakerheads, this era is ground zero for their obsession with shoes. After the aughts the Dunk fell off, going largely dormant throughout the 2010s as Yeezys, FlyKnits, and UltraBoosts moved to the center of the culture. But you can’t keep a good shoe down. Dunks—both the classic and SB iterations—made acomeback in a big way around 2019, with retros of the original ‘Be True’ line and a series of hot collaborators in the SB division recapturing the vivacious spirit of decades past. With more hits certainly on the way in the years to come, it’s safe to say the Dunk will never die. For the old heads, skate rats, and resellers alike, these are the 27 best Nike Dunks of all time. Never has such a simple sneaker generated such controversy. Is it played out? Is it basic? Is it ugly? Beauty’s in the eye of the beholder, we say. The most ubiquitous Dunk of the modern era has its acolytes and its haters. Ultimately? It’s a black-and-white shoe that goes with just about any fit. It’s hard to judge it against the standard of some of the most exciting and creative sneakers of all time, but it deserves a mention on this list. The best SB Dunks reject subtlety and embrace kitsch and loud homage. Count the gnarly ‘Thrashin’ colorway amongst them. It takes its inspiration from the 1986 skater film starring Josh Brolin, a bonafide cult classic and a staple of Los Angeles skate culture. If you wanna talk sneaker history, well, the ‘Heaven’s Gate’ Dunk certainly contends for the most morbid colorway of all time. The black and purple kicks are inspired by the notorious Heaven’s Gate cult, who infamously included a specific pair of Nikes in their uniform right until the grisly end. It’s the sort of shoe you kind of can’t believe got signed off on—and in fact, it didn’t. This one never made it to retailers, with most of the pairs out in the wild marked as samples (some are dated 2007, others 2008). SB Dunks experienced a minor renaissance a few years ago, thanks to a handful of unique colorways that captured the spirit and heat of Nike SB’s 2000s golden age. One of the biggest drops of that moment were theChunky Dunkys, a crazy loud pair of kicks designed in partnership with ice cream maestros Ben & Jerry’s. The Rayguns dropped in the original heyday of SB Dunks with a cool story behind the colorway. The shoes imagine a fictional ABA basketball team called the Roswell Rayguns (which starred Vince Carter, Jerry Stackhouse, and more in the commercials) and are decked out in their hypothetical colors. Over the years, a slew of Rayguns apparel and sneakers have dropped, but the originals remain the best of the bunch. Draped in chocolatey brown and cheetah print—à la Matthew Broderick’s fit in the ’80s comedy classic—the Ferris Bueller Dunks might not be the most high-profile of the SB line, but real ones know they can hang with the best of them. From the top-tier storytelling to the undeniable colorway, they’re a slept-on classic. Released in an array of bright colorways to coincide with the legendary stoners’ unmistakable iconography, theGrateful Dead Dunks were a smash hit upon release. Featuring fuzzy exteriors and a goofy vibe, they captured the essence of SB Dunks during the line’s 2020 renaissance. You gotta give it up for the original. Pro skater Danny Supa collaborated with Nike on the first-ever SB Dunk, ushering in one of the most important eras of sneaker culture of all time. The shoe itself, legend aside? Turns out it’s pretty great: that New York-inspired orange, white, and blue palette is pretty hard to screw up. Expect to seeTimmy Chalamet show up in theseif the Knicks make the Finals. NY graffiti iconStash is among the Swoosh’s most notable collaboratorsover the years. He’s had his hands on just about every classic Nike silhouette you can name, but his take on the Dunk (limited to only 50 pairs available at the Parisian boutique Colette) stands as one of the shoes that best captures his unique ethos. Speaking of street art legends:Futuradesigned these currency-covered bangers (the lettering stands for “For Love Or Money”) to commemorate the opening of his store in Japan way back in 2004. The shoe was limited to a crazy low run of 24 pairs, making it one of the rarest Dunks in the world. You aren’t just gonna find a pair of these on StockX, brother. One of the very first brands to ever collaborate with Nike,Stüssyis practically synonymous with the Swoosh at this point. Given their roots in surf and skate culture, Stüssy’s Neapolitan-inspired take on the SB Dunk still stands as the brand’s best-ever sneaker. Even before you get to the origin of these, the metallic upper and purple detailing instantly made for an all-time Nike Dunk colorway. When you take into consideration that they were designed by none other than J Mascis—frontman of influential indie rockers Dinosaur Jr., a staple of skate soundtracks andGuitar Herogames for decades—well, they’re undeniable. Every shoeCactus Jack touchesturns to gold. It’s been true since he first started jamming with the Swoosh way back in 2017, but even with his collaborations marking the gold standard for the Swoosh for years now, his paisley-and-denim-covered take on the Dunk is 24 karats. The Villain is as synonymous with the golden age of Dunks as anyone, existing at the intersect between skate and alternative culture, sneakers, and music. His menacing Dunks, featuring a touch of faux ostrich leather at the toe, have long been some of the most sought after in the scene—and they’ve only grown more iconicfollowing Doom’s untimely passing in 2020. A perfect piece of color blocking and easily one of the highlights of the CO.JP era, the ‘Viotech’ Dunk dropped as part of the Japanese-exclusive ‘Ugly Duckling’ pack in the early aughts. It played a huge part in bridging the continental sneaker culture divide and became a hot subject on sneaker forums and trading circles. A 2019 retro made the shoe a bit more accessible in the modern era. The Paris Dunks would already be one of the most coveted sneakers of all time on the merit of their design alone—plus the fact that there are only a couple hundred out there on the streets (or, more likely, kept deadstock in climate-controlled storage units). When you factor in the uniqueness of the colorway, which features original art on the canvas from French artist Bernard Buffet, that desirability only skyrockets. A private sale for a pair of these came in at $150K, so safe to say most of these never touched a skateboard’s griptape. Long beforeNike ever sniffed an official collaboration with Tiffany & Co, LA streetwear staple Nicky Diamonds decked his SB Dunk out in the jeweler’s famed teal, offset by a gleaming silver Swoosh and luxurious faux croc leather. The result was an instant classic—one that continues to be referenced and iterated upon in the sneaker world today. Hey man, don’t be a drag. Chill out. Take a puff. It’s just a pair of sneakers. It’s just a pair of skunked-out SB Dunks released to commemorate the holiest of holy days, 4/20. Mellow out. Don’t stress a list of sneaker rankings. Everything’s copacetic. What do you get when you pair the album cover from one of the greatest LPs of all time with a classic Nike silhouette? You get the De La Soul Dunks, wrapped in3 Feet High and Rising’s vibrant art, a shoe for the real heads if there ever was one. With the crew’s music finally getting added to Spotify recently after years off the grid, maybe it’s time to show some love to one of the coolest pairs of Dunks to ever hit shelves. The SB Dunk era elicited its fair share of controversies, and the ‘Heineken’ Dunk ranks among the biggest. The colorway itself is a heater, drawing inspiration from the German beer manufacturer’s iconic green bottles. The problem? Nike didn’t exactly clear this one with legal, resulting in legal action from Heineken. The shoe slipped out into the wild eventually, though in highly limited quantities, and stands to date as a particularly elusive pair of Dunks. Much of the culture surrounding skating and sneakers as we know it today wouldn’t exist if not forKeith Hufnagel, the legendary skater, mogul, and founder of the brand HUF. He was also an early adopter of Nikes as skate shoes, with his tie-dyed signature HUF Dunks marking a high point in the early era of Nike SB. Hufnagel passed away in 2020 after a prolonged battle with brain cancer, lending even greater weight to these kicks. As they say, heroes get remembered, but legends? You know the rest. The CNCPTS lobster line is one of the most famous in the world of Dunks, with the Boston streetwear hub producing a small array of colorways that each coincides with the most common lobster colors—complete with a thick rubber band across the toe box. While the purple and yellow renditions have plenty of heat to spare, it’s hard to argue with the original. One of the most elusive Dunks of all time, the Freddy Krueger Dunks remain something of a sneaker horror story. After shipping out the shoes paying homage to the gruesome slasher of theNightmare on Elm Streetseries, producers at New Line Cinema caught wind and sent the Swoosh a cease and desist for this unlicensed collaboration. Amidst the recalled pairs, a few managed to make their way out into the world. Today, those pairs—some samples, some retail that missed the memo—are insanely valuable and hard to come by. A F&F exclusive for Nike and the greatest rap crew of all time, theWu-Tang Dunks are a sneaker unicorn. If you see an original pair in person, you best pinch yourself to be sure you aren’t dreaming. Decked out in the Clan’s signature black and gold, they’re one of the best sneakers of all time—and while you can’t touch the original, a general release in 2024 finally made the shoe accessible to the common man. Legend has it Nike created and shipped the original Dunks on a breakneck six-week timeline—maybe Romewasbuilt in a day. Released in a group of seven sneakers (six Dunks plus a pair of Terminators for Georgetown, who’ddemanded their own model), each paired to a juggernaut college hoops team, the Nike Dunk ‘Be True’ line set the stage for one of the greatest sneaker runs of all time. I mean, you knowthe story, right?Jeff Staple’seponymous streetwear hub released 150 pairs of these tonal, suede-happy beauties in New York in 2005 and they caused a full-fledged riot, with the NYPD having to step in and theNew York Daily Newsslamming the scene on the front page the next day. They’re synonymous not only with the heyday of SB Dunks but with sneaker culture run rampant—and hey, beneath all that, the shoes themselves are pretty damn cool. It was the best of times. It was also probably the worst of times but nostalgia’s a hell of a drug.Supreme’s 2002 take on the SB Dunk draws inspiration from classic Jordans, draping the silhouette in white, black, and cement print. They dropped at a moment when all this—sneaker culture, skate culture, Nike SB as an endeavor—was in its infancy, and everything that followed exists in the shadow of this collaboration. Everything was new, Supreme was still an IYKYK brand, and resale culture hadn’t taken the sneaker world in a vice grip. Skate culture is often about challenging the status quo and rejecting the idea of a canon. Still, in this case? You don’t disrespect the original.",

    "title": "28 Best Recovery Tools for Athletes of 2025 to Get Back After It ASAP",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Aching and groaning after a gruelingworkout? Chances are you pushed yourself to the limit, buddy. Luckily, the best recovery tools for athletes can make those jello-likemusclessolid again, so you can get back out there to push yourself past the breaking point. (Again.) In our everydaystrugglesefforts to better ourselves, we've had to find ways to make sure we're not limping into the office like we just got into a bar fight. For the most part,rest daysare all you really need to get your recovery bar back to 100. Otherwise, if you really just need something to put the pep back in your hobbling step, here are the bestrecoverytools for pretty much every post-workout situation. I'm sure we would all love to have a masseuse on speed dial, ready to go to war on knotted and sore muscles at a moment's notice. Unfortunately—for most of us—that's both logistically and financially irresponsible. The next best thing: amassage gun. These have come a long way since the jackhammer-esque behemoths of even just a few years ago. They're lighter and quieter, and some even incorporate red light, heat, and cold therapies. So, for the price of a few sessions at the local spa, you can bring that level of service to your couch. Those sore muscles won't know what hit them. Therabody Therabody Arguably the highest-tech option currently available, the Theragun Pro Plus sets the standard for a top-of-the-line massage gun. This thing has five speeds of deep tissue percussive therapy, near-infrared LED light, and attachments for hot and cold massage. It also includes a built-in heart rate sensor for guided breathwork sessions. So if you want the best massage gun money can buy, look no further (just know that it will indeed require a decent amount of money). Hyperice Hyperice “Made to move,” the Hypervolt Go 2 is my recommendation for a high-quality travel massage gun. It weighs only 1.5 pounds but boasts a 40-wattage high-torque motor, three speeds of percussion, and a three-hour battery. Clocking in at $139, it is a great option to bring along some massage relief in your gym bag or on that next vacation. Renpho Amazon If you want a massage gun that will provide solid percussive relief, without breaking the bank, the Renpho Massage Gun is for you. For its low price, it still provides five speeds of massage, and a variety of interchangeable attachments. Renpho Amazon Dawgs tired after a long day? Maybe that marathon training has you spending too much time thinking about something called “plantar fasciitis?” Either way, the Renpho Foot Massager will get you sorted. It has three levels of heat, compression, and massage while still being small enough to fit under a desk or chair. Fire it up while you compulsively refresh Slack. Doing a tech cleanse? Own a vintage car? Maybe you just like doing things the old-fashioned way? Don't worry about high prices and the need to keep batteries charged. These manual massage tools will attack your overtrained self with an equal degree of vigor as their mechanized brethren. Less dent to the wallet, and always ready to go—seems like a no-brainer. PSO-RITE Amazon The Pso-Rite is a hard plastic massage tool with two parallel peaks designed to mimic the size of a therapist's hands and the density of an elbow. You can use it to activate and release the psoas, aka the hip flexor, a large muscle complex that essentially connects the upper and lower halves of the body. If you lead an active lifestyle but also spend a lot of time behind a desk (most of us these days), then your psoas is probably tight. The Pso-Rite will fix that, and it can also be used to target various other muscle groups in the body. Thera Cane Amazon Think of the Thera-Cane as the manual version of a massage gun. You've probably seen one of these curved plastic objects with various protruding points hanging in your physical therapist's office, and for good reason. It can be used to target a variety of tight spots and makes for an affordable addition to any recovery protocol. TriggerPoint Amazon A foam roller is one of the easiest self massage tools to use: You literally just set it down and start rolling. Great for targeting muscles in the legs and back, they're affordable and don't take up too much space. This one from Triggerpoint has a hollow core design and multi-density foam. It delivers firm compression to attack those tight muscles. Champion Sports Amazon Even easier to use and more compact than a foam roller, the firm rubber in a standard lacrosse ball can make for a great massage tool. They are specifically good at targeting muscles in the feet. You can also put it up against a wall to target the back. Most experts argue that the two best things you can do to boost recovery are eat a balanced diet with enough protein and get eight hours of qualitysleepper night. Recovery supplements can help with the nutrition side—working to keep you fueled before, during, and after workouts—whether it beprotein powder,creatine, or ahydration mix. Momentous Momentous Creatineis one of the most heavily studied and safest supplements on the market today, perhaps second only to protein powder in that regard. It is scientifically proven to aid in strength building, athletic performance, andrecovery,by allowing your muscles to store more energy. Some new studies also show that it can even aid brain health. Vega Amazon Advice on how much protein one should eat varies widely. If you're trying to maximize muscle growth and performance, one gram of protein per pound of body weight is a solid target. This protein powder from Vega will help you get there. It uses a plant protein blend that I find to be easier on the stomach than whey, and it's packed with other useful ingredients like tart cherry and probiotics. Skratch Labs Amazon Hydration plays a major role in recovery, reducing inflammation while helping to improve blood flow and nutrient delivery. This Hydration Everyday Drink Mix from Skratch Labs will make sure you stay hydrated at peak levels by providing just enough sugar and electrolytes. It is also made without any artificial sweeteners or coloring—only real fruit. Dr. Teal's Amazon While I wouldn't recommend eating it, soaking with this Epsom salt from Dr. Teal's will go a long way towards soothing sore muscles. Compressiongear uses pressure to constrict blood flow in certain areas of your body, thus stimulating circulation and boosting recovery. Not unlike the doctor's office blood pressure cuff or a tightly wrapped bandage, the compression helps circulate your blood and aids with lymphatic drainage. The result: shorter recovery time. Hyperice Hyperice These are the most high-tech iteration of compression boots yet to grace the market. They don't require any hoses or separate control units, everything is housed within each boot (which sync automatically via Bluetooth). Such convenience does not require a sacrifice in quality either—these have seven levels of compression, a four-hour battery life, and zone boost technology that lets you target specific areas of your legs. I've been using them for the last couple of months while rehabbing a knee injury and can attest that my sore legs feel noticeably fresher after a 30- to 45-minute session in the evening. 2XU Amazon Thesecompression socksfor recovery from 2XU follow the same principles as the Normatec boots, albeit with lesstech.They have a graduated fit to promote blood flow and help boost muscle recovery. They're also a lot cheaper and you can walk around while wearing them. Temperature therapy, both hot and cold, is a great addition to any recovery protocol, especially when dealing with an injury. It can help to reduce inflammation, manage pain, and speed up overall recovery. Heat therapy can help with persistent pain by warming up muscles and reducing stiffness. Cold therapy is great at reducing swelling and inflammation, reducing pain in the process. Higher Dose Higher Dose Saunause provides a host of science-backed benefits such as improved cardiovascular health, increased VO2 max, and better circulation. This Infrared Sauna Blanket from Higher Dose heats up in 10 minutes and allows you to soak up those benefits on the go or at home, where space or budget might preclude you from accessing a full-size sauna. You don't even need to know what heat shock proteins are! Get sweating. Higher Dose Higher Dose Think of the HigherDose Infrared PEMF Pro Mat as a yoga mat on steroids. You can set it to emit different wavelengths of pulsed electromagnetic field to aid with relaxation, grounding, recovery, and focus. I'm still not sure how much of those effects I felt, but where the mat really shines is with its infrared tech. There are multiple settings of heat, and once warmed up, it does a great job of boosting relaxation and easing sore muscles. FreezeSleeve Amazon Ice is great for managing swelling and inflammation. Thankfully, gone are the days of an ice-filled plastic bag wrapped with Saran Wrap being the main option for receiving said benefits. The freeze sleeve is reusable, and slides on seamlessly, providing 360-degree coverage while still allowing you to walk around freely. As a bonus, you can throw it in the microwave for heat therapy. Chattanooga Amazon Tried and true—and a staple of physical therapy offices nationwide—the ColPac reusable ice pack provides plenty of coverage to soothe sore joints. Keep a couple in the freezer and throw them on after a particularly intense workout. Also known as the shoes that comeafterthe shoes. Whether you're finishing up a run, ruck, or session at the gym, these are the shoes you throw on to give your dawgs a much-needed break. They're available as slides, mules, or slip-ons, and they provide all the comfort where you want it. Hoka Hoka These recovery slides from Hoka's Ora line provide great support in a sleek and vaguely futuristic package. I found them to be light on the feet while still maintaining excellent arch support. They are also more sustainable than previous iterations, introducing a footbed made of recycled sugarcane. Salomon Nordstrom These slip-on recovery shoes from Salomon are comfortable and breathable, great to throw on around camp after a particularly grueling hike. Their mild tread pattern still provides some traction, though I wouldn't recommend straying too far. They have a tech-forward silhouette that vaguely resembles a pair of water shoes, in a cool way (I promise). Oofos Oofos The fan favorite Oocloog from Oofos uses a patented footbed designed to reduce joint stress and absorb 37% more impact than standard footwear. All this means that it really does feel like walking on a cloud. They're also machine washable. Kane Kane We've tested a handful ofrecovery shoes, and Kane's Revives are our top pick for being the best-looking of the bunch, while providing all the foot comfort and support you probably didn't even know you needed. They're breathable (look at those holes!) and easy to slip on and off thanks to the laceless design. Would we do our best to wear these at home only? Sure, but a quick dip outside in these wouldn't be the worse—especially since they're like walking on a cloud. Many of you are probably not stretching enough—and that might be contributing to an accumulation of post-workout aches and pains.Yogais a great way to increase flexibility while also providing great exercise in its own right. However, if you want to take things a step further and reach for a tool that will take your stretch game to the next level, these mobility aids should do the trick. CastleFlexx Amazon The CastleFlexx is not your standard stretch band—instead it uses a foot hammock to promote even toe flexion and a deeper stretch. This combined with the grip bar means you'll be nailing that sit and reach in no time. At over $200, it is on the pricier side, but can you really put a price on mobility? Pro-Tec Amazon Pro Tec makes a great, straightforward stretch band. Firm but with just a touch of flexibility, it has 10 grip handles to make sure you stay in control. Optimizing sleep is probably the single greatest thing one can do to aid recovery. Our bodies literally repair themselves while we sleep, and ensuring that you get a solid eight hours in a cool, dark room can help supercharge that process. The best sleep aids will help make that dream a reality, no matter how prone you are to doom-scrolling in bed. Eight Sleep Eight Sleep The Cadillac of sleep devices. TheEight Sleep Pod 4 Ultraprovides elite quality sleep with a two pronged approach: The mattress cover and hub provide temperature regulation and sleep monitoring, while the base finds the ideal position for spinal alignment and snoring mitigation. The result: You wake up recovered and ready to take on whatever the day holds. Therabody Therabody Sleeping in genuine darkness is very important but sometimes not feasible.Sleep masksprovide an easy solution to that problem, and this one fromTherabodyis as nice as they come. In addition to blocking out light, it uses gentle vibration patterns to pull you into the deepest of slumbers. Whoop Whoop A good sleep tracker is the best way to ensure that your sleep is indeed of good quality. There are many out there, but theWhoop 4.0band is an industry leader providing various insights into performance,recovery,and sleep. Ozlo Ozlo These Ozlo Sleepbuds block the world out so you can achieve some much-needed rest. Great for city dwellers and light sleepers alike, they are low profile with an extra comfortable silicone tip. Early morning sirens are about to become a concern of the past. We work out quite a bit here atGQ, enough to go through a bunch ofworkout clothes, supplements, and the occasional yoga mat or two. That means we get pretty sore, too, and because we want to make sure we're always in peak physical form, we've done our due diligence to put recovery first (OK, maybe second to actually going to the gym). We compiled an assortment of recovery tools that haveactuallyworked for us, as well as reviewer-vetted options that we haven't personally got our hands on.",

    "title": "How To Build Muscle With a Deload Week",
    "article_text": "We've all been there: we'vebeen in the gymfor months and want to know how to build muscle, but we feel stagnant and we don't break our personal records. If this is the case for you, maybe you should consider starting a week of deloading. When we have certain goals in the gym, we may feel like we have to go every day, challenging ourselves and ending up exhausted after each session. But we tend to forget thatmuscle is actually gainedby going home and resting. That's why alltrainersandfitness expertstirelessly stress the importance of adequate rest. If we find our progress stagnating, perhaps it's time to rethink our strategy. In allsports, athletes know that they need times to rest completely or reduce the level and intensity of their training. So why don't we do the same with the gym? Why don't we assume thatliftingalso requires such periods? This is where the so-called deload week comes into play. It's very simple. It consists of scheduling a week every so often in which we reduce the intensity or volume of ourtraining routine, to allow our body to recover optimally between sessions. We can do this by reducing the number of sets per exercise, or lifting a lower amount of weight than we are used to. Take this as an opportunity to boost progress and prepare for the next stage of your fitness journey. With a deload week, your body will also adapt to training, reducing thelikelihood of injury. When training, we increase our strength and performance. But, at the same time, we also deal withfatigue, which can eventually lead to the type of extreme fatigue that ends up affecting our performance negatively. It's simple: if we are permanently tired, we will not be able to make progress in our training. When we take that deload week, fatigue and tiredness are reduced, and we will begin to see the results of our effort, motivating us to continue working toward our goals. There are three different methods and, in the end, you will have to choose the one that best suits your lifestyle and needs. This is the simplest. Don't lift weights for a full week, or do any other type ofexercise in the gym. It is useful to make an active recovery and improve circulation in the muscles while doing this. Stretching or walking is typically a good way to do that. Through this method, we decrease the training volume but maintain a high intensity. In short: continue to lift large amounts of weight, but do half as many sets. This is perhaps the most popular method. Moderately reduce the volumeandintensity of training. Lift less weight and eliminate one or two sets per exercise. If you usually do three or four sets, move to two or three. Also lighten the load a little bit: if, for example, you usually do 20 pounds for shoulder presses, do 10 or 15 pounds instead. Basically it is a week in which training continues as normal, but with a lighter approach. There are two approaches. From the proactive approach, schedule a deload week every four to eight weeks. From the reactive approach, follow an intuitive perspective and take a deload week every time you feel like you need it, perhaps because you haven't been recovering properly aftertraining. You can also include it during a period between finishing a training program and starting another one. Reaching that moment when it seems impossible togain muscleafter months of training can be frustrating. With a week of deloading, you will surely find the energy to continue moving forward, leaving all frustration behind. A version of this story appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "In 'The Last of Us,' Every Watch Has a Hidden Meaning",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The Last of Usinternet sleuths can stand down. Close those subreddit tabs and stop pressing HBO MAX's pause button becausewe've solved the mystery of Joel’s watch. No, it’s not a Lüm-Tec Super Combat B2. In the words of the prop master for season one, Justin Onofriechuk: “Joel’s watch was made to match the game, by a watchmaker (sorry, they would like to be unknown at this point), but it’s based on a Timex watch.” The unnamed timepiece that has played such a significant role in the series, and which was passeddown to Ellie in a heartbreaking moment in season two episode three following Joel’s horrendous murder at the hands of Abby, has finally been identified. As Nevin Swain, prop master for season two, explains, “It doesn’t have a brand name [in the series] because it doesn’t have a brand name in the game. [The prop team] received the 3D model from [video game developer] Naughty Dog and made an extreme effort to match every detail from the game exactly, all the way down to the exact same cracks.” Swain and Onofriechuk remain tight-lipped on the exact Timex, but comparing it to what is currently in the brand’s catalogue, the closest contenders could be anExpedition Titaniummodel or anMK1. Swain's only hint is that it has to be an automatic. “We wanted watches that wouldn’t require batteries,” he says, presumably because you’re not going to find too many watch batteries or tools to replace them with in a post-apocalyptic world overrun with zombies. “So, you may notice a lot of the cast's watches are automatics.” Another noticeable watch, anEaster egg for those unfamiliar with the game, also appears at the beginning of the series. In the moment when Abby sets out her intention to avenge her father’s death by murdering Joel, we see her place her father’s dog tags on his grave. Her watch in shot is strikingly similar to that of Joel's. Swain confirms this was no accident and provides a clue for those who don’t know the game that Abby will get her revenge. “While selecting the watches for the cast, we tried to keep the rest of the watches far away from Joel’s, except for Abby. Here, Craig wanted something similar to Joel’s while still being slightly different. We played around with the colours of the strap until we landed on the khaki one you see in the show.” The other interesting watch choice is the one worn by Tommy, Joel’s brother, seen in the shot when he takes Joel’s timepiece off his dead body as he cleans it in episode three. Swain confirms that Tommy's watch is aMortima Datomatic, a dive watch from the '70s made by a French brand from the company Cattin & Cie. Swain didn’t say why this specific timepiece was chosen but it does speak to the carefully crafted aesthetic: the Texan plant Indian paintbrush on his boots and his First Nations-crafted belt buckle,which actor Gabriel Luna chose specificallyfor his character because he felt he was a man who would treasure well made things from before. The final teaser for fans is that we haven’t seen the last of Joel’s watch. “Spoiler warning. We do see it in flashbacks in future episodes in season two,’ Swain says. But will Ellie ever wear it? “Not as ofyet,” Swain replies. That ‘yet’ has us hypothesizing. I guess we’ll have to wait untilseason three of The Last of Usto find out.

    "title": "Best Beach Wedding Attire for Men, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Before enjoying the beauty of watching someone else get married against the backdrop of an azure ocean, you first have to nail down your beach wedding attire. What to wear to a wedding is already fraught; now you have to contend with the intricacies of a formal ceremony taking place where anyone not on the invite list is shirtless and half-drunk on margaritas. Assuming you haven’t been given explicit directions on a dress code, you’ll want to start the same as with every other wedding: with asuit. (Doubly so if you’re the one getting married.) But when sand is present, your three-season wool standby isn’t invited. You want a beach-wedding-worthy suit that combines coastal swagger with a lightweight fabric and a cut that will flatter, without suffocating. You’ll also need shoes (sorry, flip flop aficionados) that won’t sink into the sand or make you look like a finance bro lost in Cabo. You’ll want a shirt, too—though when it comes to a beach wedding, this is where you can get a little more creativeandcomfortable, as you’ll see. From there, you can add on some extras—jewelry, a watch, shades—for bonus points. Below, we’ve pulled together what to wear to a beach wedding, in a mix-n-match format that’ll make you the best dressed guy on the dunes. And all of it should fit in yourcarry-onluggage, along with someswim trunks(in case the afterparty hits the waves) andsunscreen. Because the only thing worse than being badly dressed for a beach wedding is being a badly dressed lobster in all the photos. Unless the invite explicitly says “casual,” wear a suit. Hell, even if it does, we’d suggest wearing one, because a laid-back suit looks better when it’s not mandatory. Linen, seersucker, and tropical wool are your best, breeziest bets. Cotton’s not bad, either, but it’ll feel a little heavier in the sun. Whatever you go with, ideally the jacket is unlined or half-lined. Color-wise, we like soft grays and browns, light blues, or a subtle seersucker stripe. Anything dark feels both too formal and, in the sun, too damn hot. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason’s take on the classic carry-on blazer is built fortravel, but now it comes in a breezy summer-weight blend that mixes lightweight, cool-feeling Tencel with cotton. It’s the kind of fabric that can handle anything, including an impromptu ocean dip once the afterparty gets going. Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republichas been cooking with fire for the last couple years, particularly on the affordable suit front. Made from a cotton-linen blend sourced from Italy, this suit is designed with warmer climates and sweat-prone guys in mind. The cut leans slim, with an Italian-style soft shoulder for that relaxed elegance. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder We’d trustTodd Snyderto suit us up for any occasion, even the sandiest. The American designer once again works in a very right-now-but-retro style with this double-breasted two-piece in a handsome cream-colored seersucker. He left behind the old-timey stripes, knowing the subtle puckered texture stands out nicely—and let’s a breeze in, too. J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter Jake Mueser, founder ofJ. Mueser, has been helping guys look dangerously handsome in bespoke suits since 2008. His secret sauce? A blend of traditional Neapolitan tailoring and a New York sensibility that makes his pieces as everyday wearable as they are sharp. Recently Mueser blessed men who couldn't make it to NYC by offering off-the-rack suiting online. This particular suit, cut from 100 percent linen and finished with a butterfly lining for easy movement, works just as well on a Saturday night as it will on a sandy beach. (Though there's a cream option if you're worried about the noonday heat of Saint Lucia.) When it comes to a beach wedding, shirts are where the fun starts. (Okay, the open bar is where the fun starts, but you get the gist.) Nothing against awhite dress shirt, but we’d swap it for a polo, camp shirt, or Cuban, particularly in short sleeves. If you wear a long-sleeve shirt, stick with linen, and tuck it in. Whether the dress code reads “beach formal” or “tropical chic,” these six shirts will bring your A-game—underneath the suit and straight through to the dance floor. Percival Percival Drake's Huckberry Madewell Madewell Frizmworks Huckberry Uniqlo Uniqlo Mr P Mr Porter Listen, we know sandals are tempting, but here’s the thing: you can always kick off your kicks if the party goes in that direction.

    "title": "Donald Trump’s $640 Watch Was Delivered With a Major Typo",
    "article_text": "Last September, Donald Trump launched a wide range of watches,including everything from $100,000 tourbillons to relatively affordable diver-style pieces. The watches carried all the hallmarks of the current president’s style—they’re gaudy, over-the-top, and gold, and many of them come covered in diamonds. And, as of this week, at least one of the timepieces sharesanother quality with many of Trump’s products: it’s defective. Tim Petit, a Rhode Island man, bought a $640 “Inauguration First Lady” watch. The timepiece is a gold-tone, pink-dialed, limited-edition, Trump-themed dive watch that Petit got as a gift for his wife, only for it to show up missing the “T” in “TRUMP,”NBC 10 News reported. A single missing letter wouldn’t be so funny if this didn’t result in the dial reading “RUMP.” “I thought it was really nice,” Petit said about why he was initially driven to buy the watch. “It was beautiful, and I knew it would be something that she’d like.” However, Petit couldn’t excuse what arrived. ”I’m very disappointed,” he told the news station. “I want it to be a special thing for her. And we had expected that it would have the integrity of the president of the United States and good follow-through.” Petit relayed that his wife cried when she saw the mistake on her new watch. The watches, produced by the same company that made the now-infamous$100,000 “Victory Tourbillon,”are Chinese-made products that use “the “Trump” name, image, and likeness under a paid license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms,” according to the website selling the watches. The latest in a long line of gold-toned“luxury” goodshawked by the president, the Inauguration First Lady is “a women’s timepiece that embodies elegance and exclusivity. Crafted with a pink face, and beautiful golden fireworks printed on the dial, this watch goes beyond fashion!” Sure. The specs are pretty standard for a dive-style watch at this price point: steel case and bracelet (here with two-tone accents); unidirectional dive bezel with an aluminum insert; automatic Seiko movement with date function. In fact, the sapphire crystal is actually an impressive touch at $599. Thankfully, GetTrumpWatches.com is looking out for the little guys like Petit. When the company heard about the mistake, it reached out to apologize, replace the watch, and provide an $800 coupon to get another piece from the site. Hopefully the Petits hold onto the defective timepiece, though. In the annals of horological history,watches with typos on themhave seentheir value skyrocket. But something tells us that RUMP watches aren’t going to catch fire anytime soon.",

    "article_text": "Aimé Leon Dore andNew Balancehave been best buds for about six years now. During that time, the duo have worked on some of themost hyped sneakers of the decade—most notably the duo's inescapable spin on the 550 basketball model in 2020. Now, for the first time ever, the New York City streetwear label's working on a fully original silhouette: the Aimé Leon Dore x New Balance RC56. Aimé Leon Dore x New Balance RC56 ‘Green’ First teased in an ALD look book earlier this year, the RC56—a brand-new sneaker designed to look like an old-school sneaker—has been unwrapped in three colorways. Riffing off New Balance's deep, deep archives, there's the ‘Pristine’ version, which arrives in white with dark green accents; the ‘Navy,’ contrasted with bright yellow tones; and the ‘Green,’ which  falls more in line with ALD's classic palette—and will probably be the one that sells out first. All three pairs work are built on top of a breathable mesh base. The bottom half of the upper is dripped out in a nylon-esque fabric, while the top half is covered in smooth leather. Across the sides, you'll find a “N” logo that also acts as part of the lacing system (a move borrowed from the New Balance2002R), and “Aimé” is stamped on the tongue. Aimé Leon Dore x New Balance RC56 ‘White’ Down south, the big, beefy midsole is infused with the Boston sportswear company's FuelCell tech. That kind of cushioning is usually reserved for the brand's most advancedtrack shoes, so while the RC56isn'tintended for 10Ks, you might be able to still pull one off in 'em if you really wanted. All of this then comes packed in a special edition shoebox that was made just for this collab, and it comes with a lovely cotton dustbag, too, to keep your kicks nice and safe. A raffle for the Aimé Leon Dore x New Balance RC56 is now open exclusively viaAimé Leon Dore. This will close at 11:59 p.m. ET on May 21, with a complementary clothing collection scheduled to drop two days later on May 23.

    "title": "The Liver King Let a Documentary Filmmaker Inside His Bizarre Kingdom. Here's How That Went",
    "article_text": "Of all the bizarreinfluencersscrabbling for their own lucrative patch of internet fame, few are more bizarre—or bigger, both statistically and literally—than the Liver King. The majesticallybearded, outrageously jacked man otherwise known as Brian Johnson (no, notthat one) acquired millions of social media followers in the early 2020s via his OTT online presence, which involved eating a load of raw animal liver (and testicles, among other assorted organs) on camera, underwater bench presses, and butt-naked sunbathing. His evangelizing for an all-meat diet and a return to an imagined hunter-gatherer masculinity—as codified in his“9 ancestral tenets”—made him one of themanosphere’s more colorful characters. Then, as with so many self-made superheroes, there came a fall. Despite his cartoonish physique, Johnson always denied usingsteroids, but concrete evidence to the contrary came out in late 2022. He apologized (sort of) in aYouTube video, but didn’t stop the influencing—there weresupplementsand snack bars to sell, after all. NowNetflixhas put out a documentary about him,Untold: The Liver King. Directed by Joe Pearlman, who helmed the streamer’s series on Robbie Williams, it ventures deep into the court ofthe Liver King:a Texas compound where he has lamps modelled on AK-47s atop his office desk, and a small army of staff to attend to him and his family (his wife, the “Liver Queen”, and two teenage sons, Stryker and Rad). Pearlman toldGQabout seeing the Liver King’s kingdom up close, trying to expose the man behind the online persona, and why the steroid scandal obscures the positive side of his message. Netflix GQ:Why make a documentary about the Liver King? Joe Pearlman:These internet stories play out very publicly on YouTube, but it’s often opinion rather than actually being in the room. No one ever spent any time with him. I had the opportunity to go and meet Brian in Willis, Texas. We had three different blocks with him. The initial block was at the beginning of [2024], then we went back, and then the final trip was last summer. And from the first day, I realized there was a much bigger story to be told. What were your first impressions of him and the world he had created for himself? You approach his house, and on the gate there is a family arms and shield. [Then] you drive through a mile of forest, and suddenly this house next to a lake [appears]. My initial impression was, my Lord, he is bigger than the internet has led us to believe—not taller, but certainly wider! We started filming straight away. Normally, on my first filming trips, I stand back and just let it play out, and most of the time that means you see absolutely nothing, because most people’s lives are incredibly boring. But in the case of Liver King, he had orchestrated three weeks of events for us to see: the massacre of the bull; him taking us toVegasto go to theUFC; shooting; horses turning up; certain meals being put in front of us. It felt like an orchestrated attempt to bring us into the world very quickly. That first trip, he was surrounded by a large group of staff who were working on the social media stuff and his businesses. Everyone referred to him as “LK”, and there was a call to arms they would do the whole time: they would shout “Yeya boy!”, and everyone would reply “Yeya boy!” in unison. The first time we heard it [it was] unnerving. Towards the end, it was hard tonotshout “Yeya boy.” Did you end up eating any funky organs yourself? I tried it all. I felt the best way to go into this was [to] not only have a beard, but be perfectly ready to attack any animal parts. In the film they kill a bull and then dismember it in the field, and the first thing I ate was a piece of the thymus gland very kindly handed to me by Barbara, Liver Queen. It was disgusting, but I felt I had to hold my own and prove I was up to the challenge. How was the trip to Las Vegas? It was so he could show us how famous he was in the outside world. Vegas is the place where everyone wants to come talk to him. It’s interesting that, given you visited him long after the steroid scandal dented his image, he really played up that image in front of you. You have to separate Brian Johnson from the Liver King. They’re two very different characters. Brian Johnson is an incredibly successful businessman who is worth an amazing amount of money. The only way I can describe [the Liver King] is a WWE re-versioning of himself. Brian, as a marketing genius, was able to invent the Liver King to ultimately sell product. What mix of Brian Johnson versus the Liver King do you think you got? Did that change over time? The first trip was very much the Liver King in all his glory. The second trip, he had less organized, which meant we were able to hang around a lot more. And that’s when I met Brian. You can see in the film there’s a vulnerability underpinning him that is a huge amount to do with his childhood: no father; bullied as a kid; shorter than his friends. It resulted in what we saw on screen. Netflix Was the invention of the Liver King entirely cynical—he always lied about the steroids, after all —or did Johnson partly believe his own hype too? When you create your own universe and you are the center of it, there is nothing else beyond that. Brian is a perfect example. He doesn’t engage in the way us mortal humans engage. I think that in the early days [he] bought into his hype. Equally, the drive for success and engagement and all those things clearly overrode anything else. Do I think he believes the things he was doing? I’m not sure, but he did it constantly in front of me, and there were days when the cameras weren’t there and we were hanging out and he was still eating the stuff. [But] were there chinks in the armor at times? Absolutely, especially with the family. You see [his] boys are engaged with what their father are doing. But you’re [also] seeing those kids look at the camera and question, sometimes, some of the things their father is doing in front of them. [In] the dinner table scene, he says, “I’ve taught you guys how to be men.” Rad and Stryker are lovely, lovely boys. When I met them, they were 14 and 16. Are they men yet? As far as I’ve seen, they barely left the confines of their own house. Was he different to the more traditional celebrities you’ve looked at in previous documentaries, like Robbie Williams and Lewis Capaldi? When I met Robbie and Lewis, I met Robbie and Lewis. I met the Liver King [initially]; I didn’t meet Brian Johnson for a good month. Robbie and Lewis are very famous, and they’re not looking for anything—they want a great documentary, but they exist in the world [already]. Brian hadn’t really existed in the world for about six months, eight months, whereas now a documentary crew from Netflix had turned up, and it felt like it was an opportunity. I think he turned down previous people to do it over the last few years. But as soon as we approached him, he was all in. How did you get to the real Brian Johnson? It was a lot to do with time. The master interview we did was four straight days and probably 12 hours each day, and I guess you chip away after a while. He’s very combative; he wants to win. I knew that after a couple of weeks of being with him. So I let him say what he needed to say, and then started pushing on the things that I wanted. When he confessed to committing crimes earlier in life— making his own drugs and printing money—did you believe him? Yes. There was a moment in the interview where after a few days of talking and grinding him down, he decided that he was going to reveal much more of his character to me. I was surprised it was [a] criminal past, but I absolutely believe him. The specificity around some of the things he was doing made me believe him. And there were stories about his childhood that didn’t make it into the film: pretending to be Boy Scouts and collecting money and then spending it on candy. It felt like there was an uncontrolled independence he had because of [having] no father figure, and because his mom was dealing with another child and her job. Is he as toxic as other “manosphere” figures like Andrew Tate? There [are] lots and lots of potentially toxic ideas, but I don’t think that’s the core of it. We can’t forget that, for all the steroids and the other things that happened with Brian, he helped a lot of people understand ways in which they could become healthier. He was definitely on a mission to help people. That changed, and you see that change. But do I think the intention was good? At the beginning, it probably was. I think that is important, and it should be an underlying thing in this story. Did you get any sense of his politics? This is the saddest thing: there’s no politics. I was on the phone to him the moment Trump got shot in the ear, and I was like, “Whoa, holy shit.” And he said, “Why would I care about that?” This guy, he doesn’t operate outside of his universe. What’s happening in front of him and on his screen is what matters. There is nothing else. And that was a fascinating thing to realize. When he injects himself with something in the middle of one of your interviews, were those steroids? That was human growth hormone ortestosterone, one of the two. Was that a performance staged for you? 100 per cent. It wasn’t the only time he took steroids on camera, but it felt like to do it in the master interview was making a statement. The mental gymnastics he was able to do to feel like he was telling the truth about other things, [despite] being deceptive around the drugs, is very interesting. He is still doing those drugs to this day. Is he still eating liver and kidney and all those things? Yes, he is, [and] as you see from the end of the film, there’s a new version of [his diet which includes vegetables]. By the time someone talks to him in a couple of weeks about the documentary, there’ll be another new version. But that’s who Brian is, and that’s the core of this story: someone who doesn’t really know who he is and is trying to reinvent himself constantly, to try and make a mark on the world.

    "title": "Pedro Pascal's Best Film and TV Roles, Definitively Ranked",
    "article_text": "The whole thing aboutPedro Pascalbeing the internet's favorite “zaddy” is a bit tired at this point. But it does at least point to one truth embedded within his oeuvre: be it in the Old West, post-apocalyptic America, or the vastness of space, hardly anyone matches his ability to play a dad. That was reified by his tenure as sad-dad Joel on TV'sThe Last of Us, whose second season finale is set to air this weekend, albeit in the actor's absence (no spoilers as to why). And it looks to be further cemented when he makes his MCU debutThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsthis July, with the trailers teasing that he will portray an especially fatherly version of Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards. Nevertheless, it would obviously be reductive to characterizePascalas a guy who can only play daddish roles. Survey his increasingly prolific portfolio across TV and film, and you'll find a wide variety of great parts: supporting characters that elevate already great movies, sword and sandal heroes, and at least one gun-totingNicolas Cagesuper fan. Read on for our favorite Pascal performances. Ethan Coen's ultra-queer road movie opens with Pascal anxiously clutching a briefcase in a Philadelphia bar; soon thereafter, he's cornered in an alleyway and beheaded by an unnamed assassin. It's three melodramatic, camp minutes of screen time that make for a bracing introduction toDrive-Away Dolls'devilish sense of humor. But that's not the last we see of Pascal. The contents of a mysterious shoe box mistakenly picked up by Margaret Qualley and Geraldine Viswanathan's lesbians on the lam? Pascal's head, frozen in cartoonish terror. Talk about impact. Here's another cameo that proves Pascal's huge value. The actor appears inIf Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins' 2018 adaptation of the seminal James Baldwin love story, in a short, officially uncredited role towards the end. After Fonny (Stephan James) is accused of rape by a Puerto Rican woman (Emily Rios), his future mother-in-law Sharon (Regina King) visits the island in the hope of convincing her of his innocence. But first she must get through Pascal's Pietro, an enigmatic middle man who initially rebuffs her; nevertheless, his steely exterior gives way to reluctant compassion when he is confronted with a photo of Fonny and his pregnant fiancée, an emotional journey that Pascal sells in a matter of glances. Pascal's first major franchise appearance came in theKingsmansequel, in which he portrays drawling cowpoke “Jack” Whiskey, a rough-and-tumble agent for Kingsman's American counterparts who breaks bad and joins forces with Julianne Moore's megalomaniacal Poppy Adams. He chews up the scenery with charm and wit fit for a rogue Southern super spy—and has anyone ever looked better flicking around an electrified lasso? Shame about the meat grinder. He now has his own share of deranged mega-fans, not least in a postThe Last of Usworld. But inThe Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, he's the one with the parasocial obsession asNicolas Cage'snumber one stan. Cage portrays a fictionalized version of himself in Tom Gormican's parodic B-movie caper, in which Pascal's Javi—a billionaire Cage obsessive—pays the down-on-his-luck actor a million dollars to be the guest of honor at his birthday. The action movie twist? Turns out Javimightjust be an infamous arms dealer, inviting a helluva lot of trouble… and the opportunity forCageto reunite with the golden pistols fromFace/Off. Cage and Pascal play off one another tremendously, and it's clear they're having a ton of fun. This short, chic period piece from Spanish auteur Pedro Almodóvar concerns a pair of gunslingers in the Old West who reunite after two and a half decades; it soon comes to pass that they were once lovers.Ethan Hawkeplays Pascal's old beau, and the two enjoy enjoy immediate chemistry that makes their relationship feel lived in and believable. To watch them discuss their past feels as though you've stumbled into a conversation to which you shouldn't be privy, and yet it's impossible not to listen. It is honest, sensual, and achingly intimate. Despite Marvel's waning stature at the global box office, Pascal's turn inThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, will unequivocally be his highest-profile movie role to date. For now, however, that honor is reserved for Ridley Scott'sbelated sequeltoGladiator, in which Pascal appears as Acacius, a popular and noble general of the Roman army against whomPaul Mescal's Luciusswears revenge after an invasion led by Acacius leads to the death of Lucius' wife. Pascal plays Acacius as an honorable man who struggles with the weight of loss incurred by Rome's imperial bloodlust, and his fight scenes showcase his underappreciated physicality. Dude is great with a sword! Famously, we seldom see Pascal under the helmet inStar Warsspin-offThe Mandalorian, in which he plays Din Djarin, who comes from the same bounty hunter race as fan favorite Boba Fett. And yet the actor elevates the series with his swagger and gravitas—perfect traits for a lone gunslinger who gives “Clint Eastwood in space.” That he has so much screen chemistry with Grogu, a.k.a. Baby Yoda, a.k.a. a CGI augmented puppet, is a testament to Pascal's brilliance. Straw poll the vast majority of even the most dedicated Pedro Pascal obsessives, and chances are they'll tell you thatGame of Thronesis where they first encountered him. For seven episodes of the fourth season, he plays Oberyn Martell, a philandering hedonist who also happens to bereallygood with spears, the tips of which he laces with poison (hence his nickname, “The Red Viper”). As Martell, Pascal has charisma coming out of his pores; some of the best scenes in that season ofThronesare those in which he steals the frame, be it with his acrobatic physicality or his abundant charm. Then there'sthat[redacted] fight scene. What a way to bow out. Whatever skepticism existed within onlineThe Last of Usfan circles around the casting of Pascal as—the hero of the immensely popular Naughty Dog video game that the HBO series is adapted from—disappeared effectively overnight after the series debuted to rave reviews. His Joel is variously brutal, ruthless, broken and, eventually, compassionate—his hard heart softened by the arrival of Ellie (Bella Ramsey), who he comes to take on as his surrogate daughter inThe Last of Us' post-apocalyptic world. His part in the series solidified two things: not only is Pascal's Joel one of the greatest anti-heroes to hit the small screen, he remains an unparalleled TV dad.

    "title": "Why You Should Embrace Slow Running",
    "article_text": "Speaking from experience, when yougo for a runand someone considerably older—who's slow running and doesn’t look like they’ve put much time into their fitness—passes you without appearing to make a significant effort, it’s a confronting moment. Running slowly is something I find embarrassing. I know I shouldn’t feel that way, and I don’t want to, but I do. Talking about the power of slowrunning—the fashionable phrase issexy pace—with two people who really know about the sport, though, has totally changed the way I feel about my pace. Here, right now, I’ve decided to come out as a plodder. The problem is twofold. First,running is done mainly in public spaces. Even the treadmill is like a small, raised stage in the gym and when running outdoors, you’re on display to the world. Second, unlike weights orsocceror rugby, pace is a very fair measure. Me,The Rock,Harry Kane, and that really old man who passed me the other day all have the same chance to move ourselves through space. That doesn’t apply to a bench press or a free-kick, where size and talent make comparisons impossible. Elliot Gilesis a middle-distance runner and two-time European medalist who has competed at theOlympicsand World Championships. Talking to Giles, a man who is beyond question very fast, is profoundly calming. It turns out that most of the time, his training comprises slow running. He enjoys that enormously. “People can be fixated on times, distances and all the rest of it, but there is a beauty in running slow,” he tellsGQ,offering up a decent explanation of why it's important to take the term sexy pace seriously. \"I ran today and I was basically almostwalking. There’s a place for slow running in an elite athlete’s training plan because slow running is where you build your foundations.” Giles’ training weeksplits about 80-20 in favor of slow runs. “The 20 percent is so hard you have to do the 80 percent slow,” he says. Even as an international competitor, he is able to find the mindful pleasure in moving at a gentle pace. “This morning I went for a run and I didn’t even botherwearing a watch. I’m in St. Moritz currently and it’s one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been to. I just embraced what was happening around me. A slow run is my time to de-stress.” Running slowly inevitably leads torunning faster, which is why elite athletes spend so much time at a fraction of their maximum effort. “The quicker you’re running the more likely you are to be exposed to an injury, the faster you run the more stress you put through your joints. Fewer injuries means more consistency and more consistency will inevitably make you go faster. Run slow to run fast,” Giles adds. For me, at its best, running is a form of mobilemeditation. At the risk of sounding like someone who talks to trees, there is nothing like a comfortable 10k through a rural setting to remind you being alive is really excellent. Until that is, a senior citizen overtakes you. How does Giles feel when someone glides by at a faster pace when he’s enjoying the landscape? “My ego isn’t big enough. I just think good luck to them. My competitiveness is saved for the track and it’s like an on-off switch. Let them go. Let them do it.” At the other end of the spectrum to the international athlete is the world of the weekend runner, the novice with their first mile in sight. Gary House runs theHouse Running Club, an online coaching company, and hosts theRunstrongpodcast. He has helped hundreds of amateur runners and is perfectly placed to understand the shame around slow running. “I had one particular guy who was running around the local supermarket car park to try and break a mile, but he’d only do it at 11 at night when there was no one there and the lights were off.” House believes school often casts a long shadow into adult life. “I remember enjoying cross-country, but the kids who genetically weren’t able to compete at that age were just outcasts. People think of running at school as a bad experience. They remember fitter kids laughing at them.” He also suspects that all the information we have about our own performance isn’t helping. “All that data from ourtrackerscan be self-limiting. Runs get uploaded to social media and it’s a complete minefield. You compare yourself to everyone in your area and you’re scared to run slow.” For someone looking to start running and embrace the joy of the amble, House suggests alternating walking with running. “Try going for a walk every day and add in running every other day. Walk for an hour on the run day and add in some running sections—say five minutes—and then increase that. I work with a lot of rugby players. They often can’t run at first, but are soon up to 45 minutes in that hour.” As I write, I’m about to head out. I will run carefree. I will not look at my heart rate or my timing splits. I will not share my run onsocial mediaand when octogenarians bounce effortlessly past me. I will graciously wave them on. Let’s do this, at a pace that feels comfortable.

    "title": "Al Capone’s Diamond-Covered Pocket Watch Is Up For Sale",
    "article_text": "Bust-down watches—the rap-world colloquialism for timepieces encrusted in aftermarket diamonds and gemstones—seem like an invention of recent history. In the early 2000s, especially, there was no bigger wristwear trend in hip-hop; nary a music video would flash by on TV without a glimpse at a Rolex or Audemars Piguet absolutely dripping in jewels. But nearlya century before Pharrelland Gucci Mane, there was another man unsatisfied by the bling on his factory-made watch: the gangster Al Capone, whose custom pocket watch is coming up for sale at Sotheby’s next month. In terms of provenance (the fancy watch term for “lore”), this watch’s story is off the charts. Capone was allegedly unhappy with the “plain” case of his Patek Philippe pocket watch and took it to his local jeweler to have it modified—and not with something common and cutesy like an engraving. The first step was to ditch the original case it came with and replace it with solid platinum. Just imagine how heavy this watch was, like toting around several rolls of quarters. Capone’s local jeweler in Chicago made the custom case for the gangster before putting the Patek movement back inside it, according to Geoff Hess, Sotheby’s global head of watches. “[Capone] took the time and initiative to make a project out of this,” Hess said. But Capone’s most impressive and prescient adjustment is seen on the caseback. Capone was not just known for his style, the original Scarface defined the flashy way we imagine gangsters dress. His pocket watch is a reflection of that. Rather than engraving the watch with his initials, Capone directed his jeweler to spell out “AC” using 90 single-cut diamonds. This type of gem-setting “would definitely not have been standard to say the least,” Hess said. “The notion of having a custom gem-set case made would have been highly unusual. He was a cutting-edge criminal!” And, apparently, cutting-edge when it came to his watches. This is the second time Capone’s pocket watch has come under the hammer this decade. In 2021, the gangster’s family sold a number of his former belongings through Sacramento-based auction house Witherells. The sale included Capone’s favorite Colt .45 semiautomatic pistol, a diamond tie bar, and this custom pocket watch. The timepiece was estimated to fetch a price between $25,000 to $50,000, but got all the way to $229,900. Sotheby’s pre-auction estimate is $80,000 to $160,000. This pocket watch is more memorabilia than pure horological grail, but few vintage watches come complete with as many stories and interesting details. The dial is extremely faded and even the minute hand is missing in action (or maybe Capone just needed to have a vague idea of the time). But this is the watch that goes with the gangster’s defining style. Today, icing out a watch is largely looked down upon, but aftermarket diamonds have never looked as good as they do on Capone’s custom pocket watch.",

    "title": "How Rob49 Became Rap's Most Viral Hitmaker",
    "article_text": "New Orleans rapper Rob49, so named because he grew up between NOLA’s Fourth and Ninth Wards, started rapping as a lark during thepandemicin 2020, quickly garnered co-signs from all over the industry, and landed a record deal before his rookie year was over. Not long after that, he was anointed an XXL Freshman. Even before Birdman andLil Waynejumped on his projects, he was the first national breakout rap star New Orleans had minted since Cash Money’s late-’90s/early-aughts reign of chart dominance. In an age where the rap hit has become a random, elusive chimera at the whims of TikTok’s inscrutable algorithm, Rob has mastered the beast in a way few others have. He has an unusual and impossible-to-bottle-or-synthesize gift specifically suited to this moment in rap music, manifesting virality seemingly through sheer force of will. What makes his pop fluency more remarkable is how distinctly, stubbornly un-pop his music is, at least on its face. Rob favors ugly production that compliments his high energy delivery and his cartoonishly booming voice-of-God baritone. All gothic strings and funeral-procession church bells, it’s music to get amped to before a battle—or, if his popularity amongstNBAathletes is any indication, a high-leverage basketball game. In March, he set social media on fire once again with “WTHelly”—a two-minute-and-17-second anthem that hearkened back to the Cash Money Dynasty. An extremely goofy earworm made for coming in or out of TNT commercial breaks, the song started gaining traction during Super Bowl weekend, when local DJs were playing it in New Orleans’ clubs, and quickly took off, within Rob’s circle of celebrity rap friends and loyal followers and on the Internet, where it soundtrackedHelly R (fromSeverance) fan videosand posts byThe Los Angeles Chargers,Sexyy Red, andMadonna, among hundreds of thousands of others, becoming the latest in Rob’s growing roster of viral trend-sparking hits, including “Wassam Baby” and “Homebody”. Last week Rob announced that his first studio album,Let Me Fly, which boasts features from Cardi B, Lil Wayne, Sexxy Red and Quavo, will drop this Friday, May 23rd. When we spoke over the phone from New Orleans, we discussed Pelicans basketball, the art of virality, and howJustin Bieberended up jumping on a (still-unreleased) “WTHelly” remix. This Interview has been edited and condensed to make me sound like less of an asshole. GQ: Walk me through a tick tock of the Bieber thing. Rob49: Yeah. He DM’d me, then I don't know. I just can't remember this shit, but then I see he followed me. What was the conversation like? He just said he fucked with my shit and shit like that. Have you met him in person yet? I was supposed to when I went toCoachellabut it didn't work out. Was there any sort of collaborative process? Nah. After he posted I just called him like, “You should get on ‘WTHelly.’” He like, “I knew you was gonna say that,” and he just sent it. He sent it while we was still on the phone saying that. Like, it was already done. I don’t know what the fuck he got goin' on, he funny as shit, bro. He's singing. I'm happy he's singing. I hear him laughing. What do you think ofthe new musicthat he's been previewing? He feel free. I feel like he free, he do whatever he want. I feel like mainstream outlets are giving him shit and rap fans are like, “This is actually pretty interesting. He should try more of this.” Yeah, he just feel good about what he doing. They call me like,Man, you should get him to rap. You should get him to say more on the song. I talked to him. He asked me, “Do you want me to go harder? You want me to sing?” I told him,Brother, you feel good about it. Brother, you called me about it. You feel good. I obviously like what you doing. I don't give a fuck what you say on this motherfucker. That's how you feel? That's what we doing. You sat courtside for Game 2 of Pacers-Bucks as a guest of the home team andswapped jerseys with Tyrese Halliburton, who's referenced on “WTHelly.” How was the game? Probably the best game I’ve ever seen in person man. It seems likethey really don’t like each other. It does right? I thinkDameput Tyrese Haliburton on his“Most Overrated” list, so I guess that’s why. Are you still runningyour celebrity game? I was going to try to get it together today. If it doesn’t happen today, I'm not going to do it no more. More headache than it's worth? Yeah. As a fan, are you more player or team? I’m team over player. So Pelicans all day? I'm a Pelican fan. I don't care about no other team. How are we going to fix the team? I don't even know how to fix that team. It's just so lost. It's so everywhere. I can't understand it. The Blender is a great stadium, and the team has been fun alternately over the years, but you go to a Saints game and you go to a Pelicans game and you can immediately see there's a huge difference between how the city responds to football and how they respond to basketball. I know, right? When it comes to the Saints, they don't even care about the losses. The Saints can lose all day. No one is going to say anything about the Saints. They're like,Fuck that. We there tomorrow. But when it comes to basketball, you keep losing, and them stadiums start getting emptier and emptier. And it's dirt cheap. I’ve had nothing but pleasant experiences whenever I go. What do you think is behind that? I don't know, probably because they're not getting the superstar—Zion don't play every game. I seen him a handful of times. And I go to a lot of games. It just feels like a town that's more about football than basketball. But we never had a superstar player that actually got his chance. Like, when Chris Paul was playing, we was packed, you know? But with AD, he was hurt. And they never had a team around him, except for that one year with Boogie.Besides Haliburton, do you have any connections to other NBA players or teams? You got to understand we in the rap world, so really everyone, you know? Ballers want to be rappers. I talk to Jose Alvarado a lot. I talked to him today, honestly. He called me about the Pacers and shit. One of my favorite players, too, actually. For real? Nah you’re just saying that. Well, he's from New York, and I love how he’s a complete ball hawk. You just can't not pay attention when he's on the floor. And Grand Theft Alvarado has to be one of the greatest nicknames ever in the history of basketball. I was just trying to put people onto that bro. GTA is crazy. I was listening to the new album and you have a song called “Angel Reese”, about hustling and grinding, which I think is a really progressive rap metaphor in this context. Where'd the idea for that come from? Honestly, I said it on a song, my brother called me from jail and he said he want Angel Reese, so I was like,Okay, that’s the name of this song. We gonna call it “Angel Reese”, she gotta hear this. I've known her since she was going to LSU.She'sbeenlistening to me. Does she know that you have the song coming or is it going to be a surprise? That's a surprise. Can you give me some insight into how you're able to go viral over and over again? Do you start from a place of thinking it's time for me to go get another one? You always want another hit, but if you just keep going, it’s going to fall in your lap. I remember when we were in New Orleans, I was really surprised because I thought “Wassam Baby” was something that you had just come up with. Everybody be saying that shit, right? But it was pre-existing regional slang. What's really smart about it is, you're taking a common phrase from where you're from and making a song around it, so the city is going to immediately embrace it. Does “Helly” have a similar origin story around it? Hell yeah. Everybody in my city was saying “What the helly.” All my friends were saying it. So I just started saying it. When you have a hit song like “WTHelly,” is there a strategy for the rollout that you think might help push it from a conventional hit to a viral hit? Not really, but this time I had a lot of “What the Helly” t-shirts ready. I made sure the video was shot, that everybody turned up. That’s the route I took. But I don't usually do that. I wanted to do it for “Wassam Baby”, but I didn't. But I had a feeling about [that] one. I noticed with what I’ve heard of the album, there's a lot of classic Rob tracks, but there are a few songs that feel more introspective and soulful. What have you been listening to lately? Soul music. Like, D. Hathaway, Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean, SZA. You mention Frank a lot, and he's from New Orleans. Would you like to collaborate with him at some point? Hell yeah! You get a lot of crazy celebrity co-signs, long before Bieber. What are some of the more random ones? Madonna, for sure. The Indiana Pacers. But actually Buffalo Wild Wings. They my favorite shout out, because I used to buy the shit out of that.",

    "title": "Why Millennials Are Going All-In on All-Inclusive Resorts",
    "article_text": "The concept isso simple—a beautiful vacation where everything is taken care of—it’s hard to imagine it ever being formallyinvented.This would be like claiming to be the first person to want to wear comfortable clothes, or hang out with friends. And yet, most sources agree: The first modern all-inclusive resort was founded in 1950 by the Belgian entrepreneur and water polo player Gérard Blitz. Built on the Spanish island of Mallorca, the Mediterranean lapping at the club’s shores, it was only natural to call it exactly that: Club Méditerranée. Just by packaging endless sunshine, bottomless buffets, and mindless relaxation, Club Med had a replicable winner, decade after decade. The idea was so replicable, in fact, that when competitors began catching up, in the ’90s—Sandals, SuperClubs, Beaches—they were suddenly everywhere. All throughout my childhood, commercial breaks were full of ads promising generic tropical fun (with strong undercurrents of marital sex)—and at a shockingly low price. It isn’t surprising then that the all-inclusive model gained a reputation for attracting budget travelers. After all, the thinking went, who would want to sacrifice choosing where to eat and drink each day but sunblock-nosed penny-pinchers? Well, now, everyone, apparently. Over time, the all-inclusive customer base has continually widened, as all-inclusives have become fancier (Club Med among them) and fancy resorts have become more all-inclusive-y. Major hotel brands like Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG are in an arms race to invest in resorts across the Caribbean and Mexico—and for good reason. Between 2019 and April 2024, demand for all-inclusives on Expedia and Hotels.com grew by 70 percent. More recently, interest has begun to mushroom: Just last October, it was divulged that searches on Hotels.com filtering for such resorts jumped 60 percent year over year. Yes, we are witnessing, in real-time, the fabled rise of AI—that is, all-inclusives. This cultural phenomenon was, until recently, none of my business. In fact, the last time I thought seriously about prepackaged tropical vacations was at a copywriting gig I had 15 years ago. This mostly consisted of pumping out mind-numbing, repetitive nonsense for a high-end credit card for travelers. Even when inspiration struck, it was sure to be snuffed out by their draconian legal and compliance teams. We’d get dinged for calling a destinationsunny(it might rain) orperfect(no such thing) orthe vacation of your dreams(how were we to know what customers dreamed about?). This led to some delirious language choices (instead ofa delicious adventure,we’d writea taste-inspired excursion), as well as crazy-making repetitions of preapproved phrases (Fill your family photo album;definitely doable!). But there was one term that we overused more than all the rest, given its brevity, versatility, and literary quality:escape. Day after day, I’d write lines likeBook your escape todayandPlan your next escapeandEscape to the beaches of Miami.Of course, lest someone confuse the word for something more meaningful (escape expectations, escape your boundaries, escape yourself), these lines were inevitably paired with palm trees, tranquil waters, white sand beaches. What was most striking about these images was, well, the fact that there wasn’t a single striking thing about them. There were no cultural signifiers, no geographic clues, nothing to get in the way of the viewer’s imagination. They weren’t really advertising a specific place; the point of such a vacation was what you were leaving behind. I was not my target audience. I much preferred to think of travel as a chance to see the world, to widen my experience of it. I learned that I didn’t even need to go that far—Montreal was a short drive away, Mexico City a short flight—to feel like I was in a completely new culture. This was, of course, the whole point of taking a vacation: not toescape,but to find something exciting and immersive and, most of all, real. Yes, if traveling was a game, authentic experience was its grand prize, the nectar that justified peeling through the hard stuff—the cost, the flight, the jet lag. This all made meeting my wife, Mette, a Danish expat, extra sweet; I could now travel to Copenhagen and find myself among actual Danes living genuine Danish lives. Once or twice a year we would go with hardly a suitcase between us, crashing on friends’ couches, dining out most every night, drinking most every night, using and abusing our metabolism for adventure. Then, out of nowhere, as if my copywriting past were coming back to haunt me, I began to see sun-drenchedescapeseverywhere. Which is to say: all over Instagram. In stories posted by close friends, in posts published by old coworkers, even on my Explore page, it was all there—the picturesque sunsets and piña coladas and every anodyne detail in between. Except, as I started to pay a bit more attention, I realized that there was something different about these pictures, some new aspect that wasn’t in the stock photography we’d used at the agency. Look a bit closer at the piña colada and you’d notice the wrist-banded hand holding it. Zoom in on the towels and you’d see the same logo, over and over again. Scan the background of the image and you’d spot a surplus of staff, ready to assist with whatever was desired. The author, his wife, and their twins. (Third child not pictured.) Adding to my confusion was the fact that, just a few thumbscrolls down these same feeds, you’d find photos of tequila-soaked music festivals, ruined European villages, street food in Kuala Lumpur, espressos in Havana, blacked-out nights of karaoke, white-out parties at nightclubs, new lovers, old friends, backpacking, road trips, side projects, political activism. Whathappenedto everyone? Well, the answer is also right there on the grid, a clean demarcation separating the before times from now: a picture of a newborn baby, that impossible thing, posted from a state of near bliss. Mette and Ihave a sort of inside joke, where we look at each other and cheerily mutter,“Easy-peasy lifestyle!”The joke is that, with a toddler and twin babies, our lifestyle is not easy at all. The night before I started writing this story, I experienced a pretty typicaleasy-peasymoment. After a long, intense day at work, I was tasked with putting all three kids to bed. (Mette was out for the night.) I don’t know when exactly things went off the rails, but I soon found myself consoling the twins—one was slapping the other in the face, which somehow caused thembothto cry—while my toddler shouted for me from the other room. It wasn’t until I’d calmed the twins that I realized why: Diarrhea was pouring out of his butt, filling his pants, and, on the way to the bath, his socks too. Now it was the twins’ turn to be ignored. They screamed and hollered as I sprayed down my son, which caused him to add some earsplitting shrieks to the mix. Ignoring this deafening cacophony, I tried desperately to recall what we had contaminated on the way to the bathroom, while ricocheting shower water speckled more fecal matter across my legs. I tell this story not to showcase an especially trying night. In fact, I so quickly assumed my usual pre-bedtime mentality—a kind of benumbed state in which I forget I exist for anything but logistics—that I barely noticed how hard things had become. At that moment I cared about one and only one thing: getting everyone fed and changed and locked in their cribs, where it was only a matter of time before they would become beautiful, sleeping creatures again. I imagine that if you have kids, you’re nodding vigorously right now, and that if you don’t, you’re thinking,This is kind of boring.I myself would have felt the same way a few years ago, when we were still childless. Part of me feels that way today. That’s the weird thing about becoming a parent: You transform, but you never lose the person you were. The old you stalks you night and day, occasionally popping in just to let you know how single-minded you’ve become, how rigid, how tedious. It’s enough to make you wonder how much happier you’d be if only you’d been born a parent and never knew all of what you were missing out on. After all, Gregor Samsa’s problem wasn’treallythat he metamorphosed into a cockroach; it was that he remembered being a man. This ambivalence is even more salient when confronted with the irksome behavior ofotherparents. I feel it when I watch them obsess over slicing grapes as thinly as possible, as I myself have done just that. I feel it when they make the kind of lowest-common-denominator chatter parents make, as I will happily join in. And I feel itmost of allwhen I see them post about those vanilla, sun-drenched resort vacations they’ve taken, as my first instinct is to wish I was there. Yes, perhaps no other carousel of images provokes such a distinct mix of envy and repulsion than those featuring endless buffets, signature cocktails, and perfectly manicured pools. It isn’t just American parents who have succumbed to this road very much taken. “I have never thought I would end up booking an all-inclusive resort vacation,” our friend Kenneth, a consultant in Copenhagen, recently admitted to me. Before kids, he spent his vacations going to places like Marrakech and Moscow, train-hopping in Spain and trekking through Fiji. And yet, after his first child was born, priorities shifted—specifically from “adventure” to “comfort.” Though he and his family have since gone as far as the Canary Islands and Greece, both trips were through the same Danish travel company—one that caters specifically to families. In these exotic locales, he has found himself surrounded by a strictly Scandinavian crowd, but this is hardly a concern. When recalling what he loved most about the trips, Kenneth doesn’t cite the atmosphere or the activities or even the unlimited drinks. Instead, he notes the messes left by his children after meals and how relieved he was “every time the waiter came and cleaned up under our table.” If I had, through almost four years of being a parent, managed to hold onto the idea that I myself was above such a vacation, a confluence of factors intervened at the end of this winter. It was the longest of my life, an impossible stretch of time in which, somehow, I had no time at all. Between my full-time job, the kids, the release of my new book, and nights spent working on my next one, there just weren’t enough hours in the day to give anything its due focus. I became so used to multitasking—writing while I watched the twins, or doing an interview while I reparked the car—that I even began toappreciatescrubbing crusted yogurt off the floor after dinner, as it was one of the only times during the day that I got to do just one thing. With the clarity of desperation, I realized that not only did I need a vacation now more than ever, but it was to be unlike any I’d ever taken before. I no longer craved adventure. I did not yearn for a new experience. I didn’t even want to have to plan anything, really. Instead, I went with the first idea that came to mind, an option I’d never given much thought to despite the fact it’s been swimming in my subconscious since I was a child. So it was: We were going to Club Med. If greatness takessacrifice, so too do great trips. In this case, we sacrificed our toddler. While we spent five days in Club Med Michès Playa Esmeralda—tucked away on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic, it is the company’s only five-star resort in the Americas—he would pass his days with hisnammaandfarfarin suburban New Jersey. Though we felt some guilt for leaving him behind, we worried the vacation wouldn’t be possible otherwise. Unfortunately, we would be proven right. The morning of the trip, I experienced an upset stomach. This is putting it lightly. On the drive to the airport, we had to pull over twice—three times if you count when we first got in the car—narrowly avoiding the unspeakable each time. (Considering I drive a 2009 Nissan Altima, this could have quite literally totaled the vehicle.) After the second instance, I became so worried Lady Luck would leave my side that I inserted a baby diaper inside of my boxer briefs, like a menstrual pad. The whole debacle, along with some other snafus, set us back an hour; in fact, it was only by the grace of a few angelic airport employees that we boarded the plane in time for takeoff. The flight itself was fine—but then again, if I’d had the same experience before I was used to being a parent I would have considered it torture of mind and body. We spent most of our critical thinking abilities deciphering what might satisfy our little nonspeaking piggly-wigglies and dedicated our bodies to the sole task of creating enough comfort for them to go to sleep. When they finally did—after a spate of crying from each in perfect succession—I used my free concentration to watch the market crash on various cable-news networks. The drive to the resort was long (about 90 minutes) but a relief: After hauling the babies in carriers for seven hours, we could finally off-load their weight to car seats. Then, arriving at the resort, our suitcase was taken from us and our step became a little lighter. Minute after minute, more burdens were lifted: Our thirst was quenched with a medley of fresh-squeezed juices; our clammy skin was dried by the cool, fragrant air; our taste for luxury, heretofore repressed, was simultaneously released and satisfied. The public areas were breathtaking but elegant, and so was our abode, a long, long bungalow that led directly out onto the purring, blue tropical water. While we were basking in how much space we had—the suite was even bigger than our apartment—and how well that space was furnished, my gaze settled on a canvas beach bag lying on a chair. Picking it up by its roped handles, I saw that there was a message embroidered on it in gold thread:Sunset MINDSET.This reminded me of a post I saw on Club Med’s Instagram a few days before. Overlaid atop a video of a couple water-skiing under a setting sun was the phrase, written in plain white text,What if our only problem is to miss the sunset?At the time, I’d mocked this in my mind, reasoning that such a reality would imply I’d recently been lobotomized. But now, I found my chronic cynicism just out of reach.Sunset mindset,I thought, optimistically. It struck me that the phrase was a near-perfect synonym foreasy-peasy lifestyle—and yet, at the same time, it was completely different: purer, simpler, unsoiled by our sarcasm. It was even a kind of promise, if not a provocation: In its fearless earnestness I could, if I wanted, find the courage to be earnest too. I thought more about this. I pondered over how much of our happiness is controlled by our own free will. Then, finally removing the baby diaper from my boxer briefs—completely unused, mind you—I realized that we had undergone a great change today. It was a slow, smooth shift, an easy gradient that had started when we’d woken up and ended at this very moment. Yes, on one side was hell, and on the other side, this one, was a place that held the possibility of heaven. Our first day,Saturday, we introduced the twins to basically every possible permutation of baby-friendly water: the ocean; the main swimming pool, long and thin like a runway; the more private, family-only pool; the water park. While each came with their own unique, resplendent environs, the water felt exactly the same, kept at a temperature that was, impossibly, at once refreshingly cool and easy to slide into. I began to notice, however, that there were areas wecouldn’tenter. There was the child-free Zen Pool, with its corresponding El Limon Bar. There was the Emerald Jungle, a village and social zone only for adult guests. If these delineations at first seemed like a rebuke, a middle-finger aimed at those keeping the human race alive, I came to understand they served the opposite purpose. Yes, these spaces were just as much for parents temporarily relieved of their kids by the resort’s on-site childcare as they were for the childless. After all, what did liberated parents want more than to forget there was such a thing as children? Perhaps it is just that my poisoned brain cannot hear “adults-only” and not think of sexual penetration, but these areas also called to mind some of the lore I’d heard about a bygone Club Med era. Sometime during the ’70s, its sporty, young, minimalist vibe—riding the waves of the sexual revolution—morphed into something a bit more, well, horny.Les Bronzés,a 1978 cult French comedy satirizing Club Med, features a scene in which men lazily adorn women’s bare breasts with paint. A curious piece inTheNew York Timesfrom 1981 captures “the image of sexual abandon,” describing a wet T-shirt contest “and its male counterpart.” Well into the ’90s, Club Med’s reputation remained: the place to go, whether you were a single or a swinger, to get your coconut scraped. “In the ’80s and ’90s, the core of our clients were active singles,” Carolyne Doyon, president and CEO of Club Med North America and the Caribbean, told me. But then, in the early aughts, decades of sex finally yielded to its most natural consequence: children. After suffering waning demand in the ’90s, and then 9/11’s dampening effect on travel, Club Med initiated what would be a decades-long pivot. In 2004, with recently installed CEO Henri Giscard d’Estaing (son of the former French president) at the helm, Club Med reportedly began investing billions of dollars to enhance its resorts while gearing them toward a new demographic. “We have realized that, with the needs of the clients of today and tomorrow, the family market—theaffluentfamily market—was the way for us to go,” Doyon said. The more we explored, the more I came to appreciate just how tailor-made the resort was for families, meeting parents on a nearly psychological level. For starters, the endlessly paved paths and ramps allowed us to push our stroller across the expansive campus with sublime ease. Then there was the abundance of high chairs. And the toddler-size poolside cabanas. And the blackout curtains in our room. (For once, I wouldn’t need to use the black plastic sheets I brought with us everywhere, covering any and all windows in a ritual that made me feel like Patrick Bateman.) It was so convenient to be a parent there that a French family of three (the mother a psychiatrist, the father a member of the French air force) chose the resort for their honeymoon, telling us that it was easier to take their daughter with them than have her stay with relatives and “go somewhere just us.” This spirit of seamless accommodation is neatly captured by the fact that all Club Med staff—from the waiters to the receptionists to the porters—go by the term G.O., or Gentle Organizers. If the moniker is a bit unsettling at first (reminiscent as it is of an inpatient psychiatric unit), it quickly makes a certain kind of sense. Flash a look of worry and a G.O., clad in the brand’s signature bright white and royal blue, will soon be at your side, ready to help. Walk with a heavy gait and a golf cart will miraculously appear. At mealtimes, it was hard to go five minutes without a G.O. visiting our table, making faces at the twins. Such interactions with G.O.’s are, for many guests, a big part of the appeal. The moderator of the r/Club_Med subreddit, who has visited Club Med resorts 39 times to date, told me, “Over the years, I’ve become quite close with many of the G.O.’s,” noting that she’s even befriended a few at one resort, only to cross paths with them again at another location. Her husband doesn’t quite get it. “He is kind of like, why would I want to talk to a bunch of strangers on my vacation? It’smyvacation.” “There’s not really a firm line between ‘you’re staff’ and ‘you’re a guest,’ ” a former G.O. who worked at Club Med in the aughts told me. As a “naive Brit” among “more sexually free and adventurous” French guests, she said she found her professional friendship sometimes mistaken for something more. “I was definitely propositioned a couple of times,” she said. “I was like, ‘I’m English.’ ” As in,No thank you, I’m not going back to your room with you and your wife.Plus, she had work to do, like dressing up as a baby chicken for a comedy sketch put on by staff or encouraging guests to join a dance party in broad daylight. It is a testament to the power of social conditioning that, in no time at all, having a team of people gently organizing our lives felt completely natural. When a few G.O.’s corralled everyone for a coconut-throwing contest on the beach, I hardly thought twice; in the moment, it seemed as normal as lining up at the buffet. Slowly, like shy crabs approaching the ocean to mate, guests big and small, young and old, gathered around a particularly charismatic G.O. One by one he called us up to toss the hairy shells over our heads, with each throw receiving a nice clap from our fellow competitors, and even someooh’s andaah’s. The event created such a flow state that it was hard to even care that prizes, though promised, were never awarded. Wasn’t the real prize just being there, laughing with and rooting for strangers? Wasn’t the only point of anything the feeling it gave you in the moment? What if our only problem, at the end of the day, was to miss the sunset? Club Med's Gentle Organizers use choreographed dances called “crazy signs,” which are the same across locations, to entice guests to dance. To say thatit was important that the resort had childcare would be like saying it was important that our suite had beds and running water. So it was that as I walked the twins to Baby Club Med—their first day care of any sort; Mette stays home with them—I was a little worried. What if they didn’t take to it? What if they cried? What level of guilt was I willing to withstand for the paradise of having a child-free day? The author relaxing. There was no guilt required. As soon as I brought them in, they were absorbed and tended to, surrounded by loud, bright toys and chirping, attentive G.O.’s. After a few minutes of playing, one of the caregivers gave me the sign and I left like a thief in the night, scrambling back to our room to deliver Mette the good news. Nervous with possibility, the hours ahead like scarce funds we needed to spend wisely, we hurried to the kid-prohibited Zen Pool. There I read a paperback and drank a cocktail called a Dominican Spirit (likely the trip’s deepest cultural foray). This was followed by a banana daiquiri at the swim-up bar, where I soon ordered its strawberry cousin, and then went back to banana. By the time I’d normally be ensconced in my first meeting of the day, I was four drinks in. What to do now? Browsing the My Club Med app, I reviewed the long list of scheduled activities. We could attend classes on Latin dance, archery, vinyasa yoga, and trapeze (a Club Med signature). We could play beach volleyball, bocce ball, and something called “Coffee Games.” It is precisely these sorts of activities that many guests pay the Club Med premium for. (A four-night trip like ours, including day care and private transport to and from the airport, costs around $6,500 during peak season.) And yet, I wanted none of it. In fact, the very idea of skipping these events gave me an odd sort of pleasure, as if each one were a meeting I was intentionally missing. Yes, all I wanted then was whatever in this world was the exact opposite of work, a concept that suddenly seemed not only a bit foreign—abstract, even—but utterly, perplexingly, shamefully absurd. Why, I wondered, my brain the right kind of stupid, were people alwaysmakingthings? What, really, still needed to be done? Wasn’t the invention of NFTs proof alone that a breather was in order? We went to the beach. I read some more and then swam languidly in the water. I drank various elixirs. We had sex. We ravaged the buffet. I pushed my limit on passion fruit. I got a mind-blowing massage from a gifted masseuse. Lying under a cabana overlooking the ocean, we laughed so hard I cried. We devoured a beach barbecue and drank from coconuts, running into the water right after eating. Lying on a hammock, I became emotional as I considered how lucky I was—not to be there, but to have what I have. This was, more or less, how we would pass the rest of the vacation: not withactivities,but with boundary-less pleasure, floating from one thing to the other, doing whatever our hearts desired, and yet, at the same time, doing nothing at all. It was the first time in almost four years we had been alone together and not felt the need to cash in our autonomy for something especially eventful. It was the first time, after a long winter of multitasking, that I could engage, finally, in exactly zero tasks. One of the bestparts of the trip, for me, was reading together. It’s something we never do anymore, given the demands of parenthood, and the pressure to fill in our leisure time with more active pursuits. (And yeah, okay, sometimes we’re too exhausted to do anything but be on our phones.) Just like old times, we traded notes about the book she was reading, which I had loved and given to her:Perfectionby Vincenzo Latronico. The novel follows an expat couple in Berlin as they live exactly as young, hip, creative professionals are supposed to: with au courant taste and limitless freedom. They’ve liberated themselves from everything: salaries, convention, nationality, ideology, tradition, history. The book succeeds as a commentary on how curation can take the place of identity, a nearly anthropological study of two people suffocated by their own liberty—though I couldn’t stop myself from thinking there was quite a simple solution to all that ailed them. If their lives are so rich in freedom but devoid of meaning, why not sacrifice one for the other? That is: have kids. I sympathize with Latronico’s protagonists. It wasn’t so long ago that I, too, felt that I had way too much possibility and not enough actuallifeto fill it in with. In retrospect, this is precisely what my pre-kids vacations were actually about: exchanging some of my excess freedom (time, money) for a meaningful experience. But of course, the trade can be made in the opposite direction too—which is exactly what’s in order when you suddenly find yourself drowning in a sea of work, obligation, responsibility, routine. On our last morning, our fifth straight day spent mindlessly, vacuously pursuing nothing but our own comfort, it dawned on me that this trip wasn’t at all what I’d expected. Well, we did basically exactly what I thought we would, but how it felt—what it meant, even—was beyond what I’d imagined. It wasn’t really, in the end, even anescape.That term was far too focused on subtraction, the deletion of something from your life. What I had experienced, on the other hand, was an addition, an acquisition, a retrieval even. Yes, this whole time I had been briefly reclaiming the freedom that I had, years ago, left behind.

    "title": "We’re All George Floyd Now",
    "article_text": "When I think of America’s trajectory since the murder of George Floyd, I can’t help but hear in my head the lyrics from the Notorious B.I.G.’s 1994 hit “Juicy”: “It was all a dream.” Five years ago this week,George Floyd—a part-time bouncer, rapper, and former high school athlete—was killed in broad daylight by Minneapolis police officerDerek Chauvin,who was later found guilty of murder. The slaying was captured in a cell phone video by a daring teenage onlooker namedDarnella Frazier.She managed to keep her camera running for a harrowing 10 minutes, much of the recording showing Floyd being pinned to the ground, under Chauvin’s knee. The footage of Floyd, essentially narrating his own death, quickly went viral. The protests that followed were overwhelmingly peaceful, interfaith, multiracial, intergenerational. The ripple effects from those demonstrations gave hope to millions, brought meaning to many, and spurred sweeping social action. As part of a national “racial reckoning,” corporations and academia rushed to make financial and structural commitments to bolster efforts supporting equity and justice. A long-observed holiday in the Black community, calledJuneteenth, became a federal one. Arts spaces and the public square became even more fertile grounds for elevating too-little-discussed narratives of the experiences of communities of color. But in the half decade since, America’s capacity to grapple with itself has swung widely from the arc of justice, to paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to a more cruel, divisive state of being. The US now seems to be at a juncture in its historical journey that calls to mind the gravest periods of the nation’s past. SOCIAL JUSTICE MOVES AT THE SPEED AND PLEASURE OF WHITENESS. Five years ago, just months into the pandemic, I allowed myself to hope. I allowed myself to believe that George Floyd’s death, and the widespread revulsion to it, somehow marked a turning point in the country’s centuries of struggle with race, identity, and belonging. The reality now is much more complicated, much more challenging. The bitter truth that has been gnawing at me and at so many Black Americans since May 25, 2020, is this: Social justice often moves at the speed and pleasure of whiteness. Since European colonists first “settled” what was then Indigenous land, many Americans have tended to see more recent immigrants—at least those who happen not to be white—as the “other.” Still, a new kind ofotheringis rearing its ugly head. Even before the old-new administration returned to the White House, the commitments made by American business, philanthropy, and academia toward realizing Dr. King’s “beloved community” had begun to dissolve in the face of political intimidation and legal action. Come 2025, daily reminders abound. International students enrolled in America’s institutions of higher learning are being arrested, detained, and threatened with being sent home—just for protesting what they consider to be an immoral conflict in the Middle East. Latine residents—including those who are, in too many cases, naturalized and birthright citizens—are being detained or deported without due process.They, too,to borrow from Langston Hughes,sing America.Perpetually under political assault, the LGBTQ+ community is bracing, again, to defend “marriage equality,” while trans youth and their families desperately scramble to receive and maintain requisite medical attention. And the recent acquittals of three Memphis Police Department officers charged in the 2023 death of Tyre Nichols—as well as last year’s acquittal ofDaniel Pennyfor the chokehold strangling death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car—are yet another painful reminder that too easily, and too often, Black bodies can be sacrificed without accountability. Communities of color and groups that identify as LGBTQ+ are feeling the heat of the backlash to “wokeness”; diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI); critical race theory; and other grossly misrepresented terms that have been weaponized by the retributive forces in Washington, DC, and beyond. Too many people in the administration, in Congress, and on Main Street America now believe that previously understood remedies to address structural injustices are somehow manifestations of “reverse racism,” preventing a “true meritocracy,” one that might allow America to be “great again.” As a result, in the view of many on the far right, civil rights laws and policies enacted over the past 70 years must be suspended or reconsidered. Last fall the Thurgood Marshall Institute’s Legal Defense Fund (LDF) releaseda reporttitled “What Project 2025 Means for Black Communities.” It examined the 900-page strategic plan incubated by the Heritage Foundation and intended as a blueprint for restructuring (indeed, de-structuring) the federal government. The study raised red flags about the social and economic risks posed by Project 2025 to Black Americans, but ultimately toall Americans. The LDF noted proposed staff cuts across the federal workforce, including to the Department of Education; the weakening of civil rights law enforcement by the Department of Justice; and the targeting of programs such as Head Start. Taken together, the LDF predicted, these initiatives would comprise a holistic assault on decades-long protections for “minority” and poor communities in the United States. Donald Trumpsigned 143 executive orders in the first 100 days of his second term. Most hewed closely to the predictions of the LDF report and aligned with the priorities detailed in Project 2025. Within 48 hours of his inauguration, he signed an executive order that rid the federal government of all personnel working on DEI efforts, which, after George Floyd’s murder, had been elevated within the public and private sectors. The president halted the work of agencies overseeing environmental protections for communities of color and revoked a 1965 executive order, signed by Lyndon Johnson, that required equal employment opportunities for all. Now such programs are considered “illegal.” Historical memory, as well, is embattled. A Trump executive order has accused the Smithsonian’s 21 museums (including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, as well as the forthcoming American Women’s History Museum) of fostering “a sense of national shame” and disseminating“improper ideology.”What’s more, the head of the National Archives,Colleen Shogan,was dismissed and replaced by none other thanMarco Rubio,who also holds the jobs of secretary of state, acting national security adviser, and head of USAID. Librarian of CongressCarla Hayden—the first woman and first Black American to hold the position—was sacked this month, learning of her firing in a two-line email. In short, the Trump administration and the framers of Project 2025 have upended, one by one, each and every dream that Americans allowed themselves during the first flush of the Black Lives Matter–driven movement. Was it all a dream? By now, the public has had time to absorb the realities of these rollback efforts. Since the murder in Minneapolis, the views of Americans today are more nuanced when it comes to matters of race. Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center released “Views of Race, Policing, and Black Lives Matter in the 5 Years Since George Floyd’s Killing.” In that time, there has been a 15% decrease in support for the Black Lives Matter movement. At present, 49% of Americans are pessimistic about the prospect of Blacks achieving equality with their white counterparts. (That number stood at 39% in 2020.) Most people—72%—say that the increased attention to race, during a period of increased DEI efforts, didn’t improve the lives of Black Americans. Amid the steady implementation of Project 2025’s priorities—and the government’s sanction of grievance-driven forces within the media, the political class, and the electorate—an ever-growing chorus of voices urges me to “keep my head down,” “not make any waves,” “stay under the radar.” To say the least, I am disappointed and saddened at the realization that most of my fellow Americans may not really understand or care what it means for a person of color to show up in the world each day, to look in the mirror, to retain hope and pursue dreams. Nonetheless, something has been stirring during the four months since the ascendance of MAGA 2.0, since the fracturing of the world order across so many systems. I see it in the virtual and IRL protests that have begun to emerge. In combative local town halls with elected officials. In the human blockades of buildings and roadways. In mega-rallies and marches. In the arrests of those who have mobilized against the detention of undocumented residents and their families. In scores of lawsuits being filed in state and federal courts. In the untold thousands who have stood up for friends and colleagues who have lost their jobs to DOGE’s unsparing scythe. And, of course, in innumerable behind-the-scenes attempts to counter Project 2025. More than anything else, the national and global response to the murder of George Floyd reinforced for me the resolute power of shared humanity, of existing on common ground. And today, as new forces have amassed in backlash to that power, it is clear that the historically disenfranchised, the systematically oppressed, those dehumanized for their religious beliefs,the others,are slowly but surely beginning to forge alliances—with one another and with those willing to sacrifice their positions of power and comfort to provide support and aid, empathy and unity. Last month’s“Hands Off!” demonstrations, for example, spanned the artificial silos of identity across race, ethnicity, spoken language, age, and economic status. We are in a period in which our ties are frayed or broken. Multiple, overlapping threats confront us all, whether we recognize them or not, and we have each sought solace or answers, retribution or protection, in our own corners, in our own way. This is why creating solidarity—and preserving credible narratives and histories—matters. Because it all illustrates our commonality and inspires connection rather than division. All of it may have been a dream, but we need to wake up from the present nightmare and stand up—together.

    "title": "Joe Biden’s Diagnosis Is a Sad Fact of American Life. I Know Because I Have a “Cancer Family.”",
    "article_text": "My husband was diagnosed with a mass on his pancreas on a clear and cold January day in 2023, right after his 59th birthday. I remember when he called me on the way home from the hospital. “They found a mass on my pancreas,” he said. There is no amount of anxiety that can prepare you for the moment when your spouse is diagnosed with cancer. As someone who just relived this painful experience, along with my mother’s dementia diagnosis, in writinga forthcoming book,How to Lose Your Mother,thewhiplash-inducingJoe Bidennews cycle of the past several days has hit differently. After days ofdetails spilling outofOriginal Sin,Jake TapperandAlex Thompson’s book chronicling the “cover-up” of Biden’s “decline” during the 2024 election cycle, the former president’s officeshared the newsSunday that he had been diagnosed with an “aggressive form” of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. With a Gleason score of9 out of 10, Biden’s cancer “represents a more aggressive form of the disease,” his office said in its statement. Still, “the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management,” according to the statement, and “the president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.” In a social media post, Bidenwrotethat “cancer touches us all,” adding, “Like so many of you,Jilland I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.” One of the things that happens when you become a “cancer family” is that you start doing math. The Bidens, of course, were already a cancer family; the former president’s eldest son, Beau,died of cancerin 2015 at age 46. What I noticed is how life becomes a series of binaries, no longer a world of multiple choices. For instance, you’ll undergo surgery or you won’t. My husband had two surgeries, both of which were wildly successful. As for treatments, you’ll start with one, and if it works, like it did with my husband, you won’t have to go any further. In some cases, though, you’ll go from treatment to treatment until you’ve exhausted all your options. So much of American life is grappling with a nearly endless series of choices. With cancer, there are protocols. You will do one, then another, then another. Sometimes the doctors are optimistic, but often they will be extremely careful with future predictions. They will speak in generalities, they will offer possibilities; if the patient responds well to X, then we can move to Y. But you will be very aware that when it comes to cancer, there are still many, many unknowns. Bodies are different; a treatment works on one person and not another. My husband was a couple decades younger than the 82-year-old Biden when he was diagnosed, though they discovered the tumor in a scarier place. His pancreatic cancer, thankfully, turned out to be slow-moving, making it more treatable. So much of cancer survival just boils down to the mechanics of how fast your cancer moves or spreads. A slow-moving cancer can coexist in your body for years, even decades; a fast-moving cancer can kill you in weeks or months. As a cancer family, we started doing the math—like trying to determine how long my husband might have, what different treatments would mean for our family’s quality of life. I have teenage kids, so the math of my life was different than that of the Bidens’, but the math of how one’s husband’s illness ripples through the family is the same. Except Biden’s illness goes beyond his family and ripples through the world. Our family struggled with deciding whom to tell what and when. For the Bidens, this question must have taken on far more magnitude. The former president is in a totally different position than most people in the world. When my husband got sick, we didn’t worry about any political implications of his illness, nor how it might reflect on the Democratic Party as it reckons with defeat in 2024 and plots a way forward. We didn’t have to worry about the president’s sonsuggestinga “cover-up” ormockeryfrom the MAGA crowd. Also, my husband never got allthatsick. He was able to work almost every day, and because his work involved investing in education, he was deeply motivated by the opportunities that his companies created for the disenfranchised. He found that his cancer gave new meaning to his work and the importance of it. He asked himself if he had months, weeks, days, would he keep going to work? What would his legacy be? One of the few positive aspects of becoming a cancer family is that you get really connected to your humanity and the humanity of the people around you. Cancer is nonpartisan. Cancer doesn’t care whom you voted for or how much money you made or have. I don’t know what happens next for Biden, but for our family, my husband’s diagnosis created even more meaning in his life. His work became even more important to him.

    "title": "Dystopia Now: Why ‘The Hunger Games’ Still Speaks Volumes About Teens, War, Propaganda, and More",
    "article_text": "The first quarter of the twenty-first century seems to have been an especially confusing time to be a teenager, which is quite the achievement. But look at the century’s most successful teen franchise, theHunger Gamesnovels and movies, a relentlessly grim series that expanded this spring to add a second prequel novel to Suzanne Collins’ original set of three books. That trilogy was turned into four movies between 2012 and 2015, followed in 2023 by an adaptation of the first prequel. All in all, that’s a lot of dead kids on screen. Twentieth-century teens enjoyed bloody entertainments like theScreamandFriday the 13thmovies, but the body counts in those franchises are to Hunger Games slaughter as the crimes of Watergate are to any recent afternoon in the current White House. You can measure Collins’ achievement in the obvious ways. The new sequel,Sunrise on the Reaping, moved 1.2 million copies in the US on its first week off the block in March. All told, the books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide. The five movie adaptations are rated the 16thhighest-grossing film franchise in North America by Box Office Mojo (though I would argue with the way website has sliced and diced various franchises and would rank The Hunger Games #12). ASunrise on the Reapingmovie is already scheduled to arrive in theaters for Thanksgiving 2026. A less obvious way to measure theHunger Games’ success is by how open to interpretation the books and films have proven—almost as elastic as the Greek myths Collins drew on. (Reread Theseus and the Minotaur.) “I don’t write about adolescents. I write about war for adolescents,” Collins has said. I think this is both true and not. Yes, the series is about war, as well as politics, propaganda, media manipulation, and power in most of its manifestations. But when you create a futuristic dystopia organized around a televised blood sport in which teenage gladiators are forced to fight to the death, you have either wittingly or unwittingly created a pretty nifty metaphor for high school—the social battlefields ofThe Breakfast ClubandMean Girlsmade literal. There is intergenerational warfare, too. Coriolanus Snow, the evil president of Panem, the stories’ dystopia, justifies the Games as “a pageant of honor, courage, and sacrifice” meant to reinforce the bond between the ruling Capitol and its outlying, formerly rebellious districts. “This is how we remember our past,” he says. “This is how we safeguard our future.” The logic doesn’t track, even in context, but adolescent readers and moviegoers likely hear a variant of the old parental boilerplate:Someday you’ll thank me for this. As for grander themes, perusing the extensive academic literature devoted to the series, I have learned thatThe Hunger Gamesis also a parable about the dangers of big government and thus an inspiration to young Republican activists, but that it is also a parable about the dangers of income inequality, pitched to the Occupy Wall Street crowd. Or the tale might be an allegory of the American Revolution . . . or of Christian love and sacrifice . . . or of the twenty-first century’s cutthroat college admissions derbies and ruthless job markets. It might be free-market propaganda. It might be a veiled criticism of the Global War on Terror (entering its second decade when the firstHunger Gamesfilm hit theaters in 2012). The heroine Katniss Everdeen is an American frontier archetype, descended from James Fenimore Cooper’s Natty Bumppo and the loners played in movie westerns by John Wayne and Clint Eastwood—unless, what with her lethal prowess and indifference to male suitors, she gives a proud feminist middle finger to “heteronormative expectations.” The Hunger Gamescould be about some or many or all these things at once: pop art that lands big isn’t always easy to parse—or necessarily coherent at all. People can see what they want to see inThe Hunger Games, even the commentator on the Stormfront, a neo-Nazi website, who hailed Katniss as a “Hitler figure, a veteran, a reluctant hero, an idealist.” On second thought, him we’ll ignore. **** But most people don’t go to the movies to absorb allegories and parables. I am partial to the conflicted enthusiasm ofThe National Review’s John Podhoretz regarding the first Hunger Games picture: “The thing is gripping as hell . . . I don’t know that these books or the movie that springs from them are morally defensible, really—they glory in the violence that they view with horror— but my oh my they do get under your skin and into your head.” Simply put, the movies are well-made, well-acted entertainments, suspenseful, and satisfying. But “simply put” is not my job here. So what does it say about recent times that they produced this bizarre, convoluted, and brutal saga that has resonated so profoundly and lucratively with young audiences—and older ones, too—but in another era might have made a few ripples as a provocation when dropped into the pond but otherwise sunk quickly to cult exploitation movie status? (See:Death Race 2000.) Simply put: what’s wrong with us? There are some obvious e-ticket answers anyone could recite without too much thought: 9/11, America’s blundering Global War on Terror, the Great Recession, the degradations of online culture, climate change, the rise of right-wing populism and nationalism around the globe, and Trumpism here at home, the stain we can’t get out. The MAGA phenomenon postdatesThe Hunger Games, but both were incubating during the same period (and share cosmopolitan elites as their chief villains). Collins has said the initial inspiration struck one night in the mid-2000s when she was channel surfing back and forth between a reality show and the news, which might also be how certain voters got the idea that the star ofThe Apprenticewould make a fine president. Collins’s epiphany was even more fanciful. “I was very tired,” she told one interviewer, “and I was flipping through images on reality TV where these young people were competing for millions of dollars or whatever, then I was seeing footage from the Iraq War, and those two things began to fuse together in a very unsettling way, and that is the moment where I got the idea for Katniss’s story.” As mentioned above, teenagers getting slaughtered on screen is not a new form of entertainment, not just in slasher films but the countless war films that have featured youthful cannon fodder quaking in trenches, foxholes, jungles, and deserts, dating back at least as far as the originalAll Quiet on the Western Front(1930). In that context,The Hunger Gamesis merely a refinement, a conceptual tweak. Collins herself once said, when asked whether her books were too brutal and frightening for young people, “There are child soldiers all around the world right now who are nine, ten, carrying arms, forced to be at war. Can our children not even read a fictional story about it? I think they can.” Another terrible fact of twenty-first-century life unfortunately relevant to this discussion: school shootings. They didn’t begin with the 1999 tragedy at Columbine High School—the Naval Postgraduate School’s Center for Homeland Defense and Security maintains a school shooting database going back to 1970—but the scale of that assault (thirteen dead, not including the two shooters, and twenty-one wounded) marked a divide in American life, a before and after akin to Pearl Harbor, the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and 9/11. The number of shootings have fluctuated in the years since, trending upward a bit in the second half of the 2010s, though it’s not clear if that’s a meaningful rise or a statistical blip, since the annual totals are relatively small, even if the impacts are huge. But the death tolls from specific attacks have continued to set horrifying records: the Columbine body count was surpassed by the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut, only to be surpassed again in 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and once more in 2022 at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas—a sickening, unspeakable tally, the terror magnified for children by years of increasingly realistic barricade-the-classroom drills, with fake shooters roaming the halls firing blanks. Why wouldn’t Panem’s fictional mayhem strike a chord with kids accustomed to literal trigger warnings? That said, I thinkThe Hunger Games’ appeal is far more escapist than therapeutic; I mean, the movies aren’t after-school specials. Teens (and adults) have long looked to Hollywood for vicarious, transgressive thrills, and twenty-first-century adolescent lives are circumscribed in multiple ways that might magnify such appeal. It’s not just that, according to study after study, kids are having less sex than their Boomer and Gen X forebears even as they marinate in a hypersexualized culture. They also drink less and don’t smoke or vape as much, and, marijuana aside, their use of recreational drugs has dwindled (trends that all began in the 1990s). Moreover, their interest in the adult-ish pursuits legally allowed them, traditional stepping-stones toward independence such as part-time jobs, has also waned. ‘Hollywood High’ by Bruce Handy Amazon Bookshop According to Jean Twenge, a psychologist at San Diego State University who has written extensively about contemporary teenage life:“Even driving, a symbol of adolescent freedom inscribed in popular culture fromRebel Without a CausetoFerris Bueller’s Day Off, has lost its appeal for today’s teens. Nearly all boomer high school students had their driver’s license by the spring of their senior year; more than one in four teens today still lack one at the end of high school . . . In conversation after conversation, teens described getting their license as something to be nagged into by their parents—a notion that would have been unthinkable to previous generations.“ Well, yes, unthinkable at least to my sixteen-year-old self, back in 1974, intoxicated by the freedom granted by a car key. Society should, of course, celebrate the fact that less drinking, drug-taking, and driving means fewer kids crashing cars and killing or injuring themselves and otherwise ruining their lives. But even overanxious parents might feel pity for adolescent homebodies who, in Twenge’s words, are “more comfortable in their bedrooms than in a car or at a party.” To hear her tell it, aside from trudging to and from school, teens barely even leave the house anymore. “The shift,” she asserts, “is stunning: twelfth graders in 2015 were going out less often thaneighth gradersdid as recently as 2009.” (Her emphasis.) And even when teenagers do roam about, parents can reach and keep tabs on them in real time thanks to their cell phones–cum–tracking devices—not so different, a young person might feel, from the relentless scrutiny the teen gladiators are subjected to in the Hunger Games arena. **** Unsurprisingly, study after study asserts that teenagers are more depressed than ever before. One example: the Centers for Disease Control’s biannual Youth Risk Behavior Survey for 2021 found that 42 percent of all high school students reported “feeling so sad or hopeless that they could not engage in their regular activities for at least two weeks during the previous year,” up from 28 percent a decade earlier. Over roughly the same period, the number of girls admitted to emergency rooms for “self-harm” tripled, and the suicide rate for people between the ages of ten and twenty-four (that’s how the CDC breaks down the data) has increased steadily over the last two decades (as have the suicide rates for middle- aged and older adults). Do we blame helicopter parenting for that? Crushing loads of homework? Not bothering to learn to drive? Social injustice? American carnage? Agoraphobia? Covid and Zoom schooling surely didn’t help. But the true culprits are literally at hand, according to popular alarmists like Twenge and the psychologist Jonathan Haidt, author of the bestselling 2024 bookThe Anxious Generation, but also Vivek H. Murthy, the US surgeon general under Joe Biden. All three have pointed the finger squarely at social media and smartphones, linked technologies that both reached critical masses of usership in the early 2010s, coinciding almost too perfectly with the abrupt decline in teen mental health; online porn and video games, each addictive and all-consuming in its own special way, also come in for blame. Haidt calls it “The Great Rewiring of Childhood”: “Gen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and . . . unsuitable for children and adolescents. Succeeding socially in that universe required them to devote a large part of their consciousness—perpetually—to managing what became their online brand.” In two or three decades, will Haidt’s warnings seem as hyperbolic as twentieth-century fears about violent comic books or smutty rock and rap lyrics? Maybe . . . ? There are researchers who feel the phone/social media/depression link is overstated. But if I had to bet, I’d bet not. In October 2023, following a damning surgeon general’s report, thirty-three states filed a suit in federal court against Meta, parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, accusing it of ignoring “the sweeping damage” its platforms “have caused to the mental and physical health of our nation’s youth.” Eight other states and the District of Columbia filed separate but aligned suits against Meta—which means that social media’s allegedly deleterious effect on teens is the rare, maybe even sole, issue upon which more than four-fifths of state governments, both red and blue, can agree. Surgeon General Murthy called for warning labels to be put on social media platforms spelling out the dangers for adolescents. My first thought:That’ll work, followed by an eye roll emoji. But the impulse feels right. As Murthy wrote in a 2024New York Timesop-ed essay, “The moral test for any society is how well it protects its children.” On that score, I’d like to think we’re at least doing better than the adults in Panem. But how do kids feel? Maybe for them—depressed, shadowed by horrific violence, living in fishbowls—The Hunger Gamesfeels less like a metaphor than the day after tomorrow? “I think one reason this franchise was so successful is that this generation feels they are fighting for their survival all the time, and that survival is far from certain,” Gary Ross, who directed the first film, observed in 2022, marking its tenth anniversary. “From climate change to authoritarianism, their generation feels a real sense of dread and jeopardy . . . I think, sadly, the themes in this movie are only more resonant now than when we made it.” And the last three years have only increased that resonance… ten-fold? Even more? Collins’ first novel was published in 2008, so in 2028The Hunger Gamesfranchise will enter its third decade of bleak relevance. Will we celebrate?

    "title": "Has the ‘Real Housewives’ Franchise Finally Reached Its Breaking Point?",
    "article_text": "AsHeather Dubrowonce toldAlexis Bellino,“If everyone says you’re dead, it’s time to lie down.” The same could now be said about theReal Housewives of New York—a show that’s beenstruggling to findits footing. On May 7, just days ahead of NBCUniversal’s upfront presentation to advertisers, Bravo revealed which of its shows were being renewed for another season. But the network didn’t includeReal Housewives of New York,leadingPage Sixto report that they had effectively pulled the plug on theReal Housewivesfranchise’s flagship series. ThoughAndy Cohenquicklyshut downthe rumors of the troubled show’s death, the reports had fans rejoicing anyway—which can’t be a good sign for the future ofNew York,or theReal Housewivesmore broadly. These conflicting reports come two seasons afterNew Yorkwas totally rebooted, bringing in acompletely new crop of women—but failing to connect to an audience that had grown accustomed to its old cast and pacing. AsNew Yorkflounders, theReal Housewives of New Jerseyas we know it has been shuttered, taking a similarly extensive “pause” after a 14th season that hit a brick wall story-wise. Meanwhile, the franchise’s most recent buzzy entry,Real Housewives of Dubai,couldn’t even make itto a third seasonbefore it was put on pause. All of which prompts a question: Has theHousewivesbubble burst? The answer may lie not in pauses or cancellations, but rather in Bravo’s new series orders. As OGHousewivesshows have been fading, Bravo has been greenlighting a flood ofHousewivesspin-offs likeUltimate Girls Trip, Welcome to Crappie Lake, Love Hotel, Next Gen NYC,and the newly announcedWife Swap: The Real Housewives Edition—which signals that the franchise may have already jumped the shark. And that’s according to Cohen himself, who oncesaidthat an All Stars–style crossover could happen “when the show is just about out of gas.” While these kinds of shows are a great way to utilize the network’s deep bench of talent, past and present, releasing so many spin-offs also feels a little like Disney acquiring ownership ofStar Warsand then devaluing the brand by throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Soon enough, we’ll be getting aLuann de Lessepsprequel series. (Fine; that, I’d watch.) But perhaps theReal Housewivesfranchise isn’t really out of gas just yet. These series have always had ebbs and flows, and when one city is down, another one tends to be up. Right now,Salt Lake City, Miami,and evenOCrecently aired some of their best seasons ever. Still, there seems to be a pattern that’s emerged of these shows faltering right around their 15-year mark—and we’re watching in real time as differentHousewivesseries try to overcome that slump in different ways. WhileRHONYexperimented with wiping the slate clean, its predecessorRHOCbounced back from its own darkest days by doing the opposite.OCturned to its stacked bench of former Housewives, bringing back faces like the aforementioned Dubrow and Bellino. But even though they’d been gone for years, watching them again never felt like rehashing the past or chasing the show’s glory days. We were seeing these classic Housewives in a new stage of their lives, interacting with newer cast members to create a dynamic that was simultaneously fresh and nostalgic. It’s a balance that otherHousewivesshows have tried to strike, includingPotomacandAtlanta,with mixed results. Currently,Atlantais trying to find its footing again with a season that’s alternating between rocky (the unexpected mid-season exit ofKenya Moore) and promising (centering old favoriteShamea Mortonand introducing newbieAngela Oakleyand her portable fan). It’s shake-ups like these, ones that carefully walk the line between old and new, that tend to work best. They’re a jolt to the show, without discarding what’s been built over the years—and what the audience has already invested in. As we watch Bravo try to tackle theHousewives’growing pains in different ways, it’s clear that there’s no foolproof escape from a rut. That might have less to do with these shows hitting that 15-year mark, and more to do with how our culture has changed since they launched. Fifteen years ago, Bravo didn’t have to worry about hiring cast members that had preconceived notions about what it meant to be a Real Housewife. But there’s now a playbook for that role, in the form of thousands of episodes of television. Some new hires lean too hard into it, while others try to subvert expectations by outsmarting it. But the key to being a great Housewife isn’t flipping tables or throwing glassware—though that does help. It’s authenticity, and authenticity can’t be faked. These shows thrive when they feature women who are either unafraid to be themselves, or too unaware to hide who they really are. Their guards need to be down—something increasingly difficult to manage in an age where everyone is accustomed to curating their persona via social media. That’s the crux of what went wrong with the newRHONY,which featured women who were all too aware of what they were getting into. Worst of all, they lacked any believable ties to one another. The art of making good reality television has gotten harder, but it hasn’t gotten impossible. And while it’s jarring to watch a franchise that used to have an incredibly high success rate suddenly start dropping shows left and right—and replacing them with a barrage of new offerings—we should giveHousewives,and Bravo, some credit for trying to evolve and keep up. Through trial and error, theReal Housewivesfranchise is trying to find its place in a cultural landscape that’s vastly different from the one in which it was launched. And all the while, we in the audience are watching and judging every misstep—just as we’ve been conditioned to do.

    "title": "I Fought Two Monsters: James Toback and Shame",
    "article_text": "For the past 17 years, I have borne a tremendous weight. When I was 22, a powerful man three times my age and three times my size took advantage of my wit and burgeoning sexuality. He told me I was beautiful, muse-like, and movie star material. Our first encounter was benign. We were standing in line at a Starbucks on the Upper West Side. He was with his nine-year-old son. He didn’t say much but shared that he was a film director and confessed that he couldn’t help but notice my profound sexual energy. “I know we just met, but I need to write a script for you.” Pulling from a stack of papers in his back pocket, he tore off a piece of theVillage Voice,scribbled his name, number, and the titles of two films he had made,When Will I Be LovedandTwo Girls and a Guy.He told me to call him. Intrigued by his proposition, I did the next day. Since then, I have carried the gravity of my secrets. Secrets kept from family and friends are heavy, but the accumulation of shame that prevents such secrets from being shared is the most oppressive. By now, his name is no secret and I am no longer ashamed. His name isJames Toback,and for five years, he strung me along while demanding sexual favors. For those five years, I kept the details of our meetings to myself. Until I told my therapist about them in 2013, I had believed these interactions were my fault and the result of my stupidity. What’s most shocking is that I had never considered his manipulation tactics as a form of abuse. I was so fixated on my own poor choices that I never entertained the part he played in my shame. The biggest blow to my ego, however, was that this movie never materialized. Not only had I performed sexual favors for this man, but I had truly believed that this script he was writing for me would eventually emerge. I had convinced myself that if I just continued showing up and doing what I was told, he would make me a star, and all my financial woes would vanish. I remember mentioning Toback in passing during one of my therapy sessions. I felt so embarrassed to admit that I massaged his nipples that I hid inside my sweater while sharing this secret with my most trusted listener. I remember my therapist then asking how massaging his nipples made me feel, and without hesitation, I responded, “Disgusting.Hewas disgusting.Iam disgusting.” As I replayed the image in my head, I remember this feeling of repulsion taking over my body almost instantly. I wanted to vomit. And that’s when it hit me. For the past five years, I had unconsciously forgotten the details of my encounters with Toback, not because they were insignificant but because they weresoimpactful that I had to repress all of them. I chose to work on other parts of my less-than-perfect self during therapy rather than confront what had happened with Toback—until the world confronted it for me, that is. When the #MeToo movement broke out in the fall of 2017 and people started posting their stories of assault and abuse, I felt insincere in not acknowledging this skeleton in my closet. I realized that this problem was more pervasive than I had ever imagined. Reading others’ stories made it nearly impossible to ignore my past encounters with sexual assault and difficult not to feel a set of mixed emotions: sadness, shame, and rage were just a few. As other brave women started coming forward about Toback, I felt empowered to face this head-on. I contactedLos Angeles TimesjournalistGlenn Whipp,who was actively investigating Toback’s abuse. He put me in touch with at least a dozen other women who had also been subjected to the director’s grooming. Lucky for me, I have always been a woman of many words and found great comfort in journaling. I wrote down every conversation, every sexual act, and everything I felt as a result of that very first meeting with Toback in November 2008 up through my last meeting with him in the fall of 2013. Ironically, the last time I met him in New York was also at an uptown Starbucks, though this meeting was a little less benign. I cry for the younger version of myself who didn’t have the courage to scream then and there. About two weeks into the #MeToo movement, I revisited the four journals I kept during my time with the director. When I kept these meticulous records, I convinced myself that the sole purpose of these journals was so that one day I could write a book: These meetings were too extraordinary not to record. Revisiting them in 2017, I realized that there was another reason I kept them: I needed to process a set of colossal emotions. Because I kept almost all parts of my relationship with Toback a secret, these journals became a series of confessions, a way to try and process feelings that felt bigger than me. What I found in these journals shocked even me, but as I read, visceral memories—smells, sounds, textures—all began flooding back. For better or for worse, I began to relive these encounters. I remembered them, grappled with them, and began the work of sharing them, first with my therapist and then with my most trusted friends. While it had taken me several years to accept that Toback’s sexual demands were abuse, these journals made it completely obvious that the process he put me through was a textbook case of grooming. In rereading these four journals (more than once), the thing that kept returning to haunt me was the level of disgust and shame I experienced throughout those five years. Toback was this abject human who simultaneously fascinated and repulsed me. Touching him made me feel, momentarily, specialandimmediately revolting. The ways in which he used his power to feed off my preexisting insecurities are obvious in retrospect. In the moment, however, my anxiety got the best of me. During our first meeting, he requested that I masturbate for him. When I declined, he lectured me about how my refusal was representative of a lack of trust and how he had failed me as a director. “You see, what I need to get you to understand is that I will never ask you to do something that you are going to say ‘no’ to, because if you say ‘no,’ then I havefailed. I have failed as a director, and therefore, I have failed as a person.” He gave me this lecture on more than one occasion. On the surface, it seemed like he was being respectful of my choices, when, in reality, he was a manipulative monster. During one of our meetings, he requested that I get naked for him. When I refused, he told me I had a prepubescent attitude toward my body and there was only one way to fix it: point out each one of my bodily flaws to him as I perceived them; he would show me that my body was beautiful. Never mind that I struggled with some body dysmorphia. James Toback had the final word. I could process the various acts I engaged in, the reasons why I kept returning, and the layers upon layers of manipulations he served me. Yet a part of me still felt stupid for falling for his bait. I wasn’t an actor. Why did I think it was even remotely realistic for me to go to bed one night as a graduate student and wake up the next morning a movie star? By 2018, I had processed all I needed to process and could process. I moved on. Fast forward to 2022, when the Adult Survivors Act was enacted in New York state, which extended a one-year window for victims of sexual abuse to file lawsuits in civil court, regardless of when the abuse occurred. One of the women Whipp had put me in touch with,Mary Monahan,galvanized as many Toback survivors as she could get in touch with and started the arduous process of finding a lawyer who would take on our case pro bono.Nix Pattersonwelcomed us with open arms. Whipp ultimately heard from nearly 400 women who had accusations regarding Toback. Of those 400, 100 were game for this trial. Of that number, 45 met the specific criteria for pursuing Toback legally, and 40 agreed to testify. The lawyers were fantastic from the get-go, and if anyone could help us win this case, it was them. But Toback proved to be evasive, and the discovery process was complicated. Almost three years in, it felt like Toback might get off scot-free. An update in early 2025, however, surprised us. By the end of January, we had a trial date set and were making arrangements for in-person testimonies. Married and two kids later, I revisited my journals in preparation for the trial. Many of the issues I had struggled with during the time I met with Toback—and continued to struggle with at the time of the #MeToo movement—were now problems of the past. My self-esteem had greatly improved; the way I purged my anger and disgust found new outlets; the gratification I derived from controlling every morsel that entered my body had become a burden. Motherhood no doubt changes you. Even though it had lightened somewhat, however, I still carried the weight of my shame about what had transpired with Toback. I would receive an email from my lawyers with good news, and without fail, the self-flagellating question would emerge: How could an intelligent, assertive, no-nonsense kind of gal fall for Toback’s lies and manipulations? Could I really take the stand as myself and verbalize—to a room full of strangers—all the horrible things he did and the ways he treated me? Motherhood has made me a much braver version of myself, especially if something is at stake for my two girls. Of course, I would take the stand, no matter how nervous or humiliated I felt. From the day I chose to bring life into this world, my life ceased to be about me. I flew to New York because that is what I would have wanted my girls to do. Of course, I hope they never come across another James Toback, but if they should cross paths with a disgusting human, I hope they have a million more role models than I and my millennial crowd had. There is nothing shameful about being manipulated. There is nothing embarrassing about being groomed. I wish everyone understood that shame lives in our secrets, and its burden evaporates the moment you use your voice. The most liberating part of my testimony was forming a sisterhood with the women I met while in New York. The other plaintiffs are beautiful, intelligent, successful women who, like me, fell prey to Toback’s empty promises and beguilements. During the trial, we laughed, we cried, we supported each other in all sorts of ways. We connected instantly and joked about the irony of bonding over our core commonality: knowledge of Toback’s sexual proclivities. Five days after I returned from New York, the verdict came in: “The Supreme Court of the State of New York holds Toback responsible for a sprawling pattern of sexual assault, false imprisonment, coercion, and psychological abuse.” The jury awarded a total of $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion in punitive damages to the plaintiffs. That’s $42 million for each of us. Well, in theory. Toback claims he is so financially destitute that he couldn’t even afford to hire legal representation for our trial. But I don’t think any of us did this for the money. A verdict like this speaks loud and clear. As many news sources have articulated: This is not just a legal victory. It is a cultural reckoning. I no longer bear the weight of my shame. I feel light. I feel whole. I feel like I have just proved something to the world about bravery. I’m telling the truth when I say I no longer feel shame about any of the things I did with Toback, which is why I share this story today. Toback is a monster, but shame is also a beast. I’ll probably never see a cent, but I feel like 42 million bucks. Ro Khanna Really Believes“Blue MAGA” Can Save the Dems—and Steve Bannon Loves It Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "“I Feel a Lot Freer”: Jodie Foster Finds Herself, en Français",
    "article_text": "It’s been more than 20 years sinceJodie Fosterlast appeared in a French film, when she took on a very small part inJean-Pierre Jeunet’sA Very Long Engagement.But on Tuesday, Cannes audiences will see her speak their native language once more: inRebecca Zlotowski’sVie Privée(translation:A Private Life). The project marks both a long-awaited return for the Los Angeles native, who’s been fluent in French for most of her life, and a daring new frontier: She’s never led a non-English-language movie before. And inA Private Life,her dialogue is almost entirely in French. “This was a huge, huge challenge,” the two-time Oscar winner tells me over tea in a Cannes hotel. “When you get older, it’s really hard to learn lines—so learning lines in a different language is one hundred times harder.” Yet from the opening scenes of this darkly comic murder mystery, in which Foster portrays an American therapist in Paris whose patient has just died under mysterious circumstances, it’s clear the actor feels right at home—and not just because of her flawless French (to this American’s ears, anyway). Foster has long navigated her career with a European sensibility, consciously avoiding blockbusters and taking risks with tricky characters. “I really appreciate big CGI movies or crazy transformation films as an audience member. But as an actor I’m like, ‘Eh, I don’t want to do that,’” she says. “I’d rather go to the gym.” Foster’s been in the entertainment industry since she was three years old. In recent years, she’s been acting less frequently—a decision that’s helped her find the joy in her profession again. It’s no coincidence that2023’sNyadresulted in her firstOscar nominationin nearly 30 years, or that last year’sTrue Detective: Night Countrywon her theEmmy for best actressin a limited or anthology series, her first. “I do look back on the last four, five things I’ve done, and I just feel so liberated from being so obsessed with being taken seriously—from having the entire film on my shoulders,” Foster says. “I feel a lot freer.” Foster is sitting beside Zlotowski, huddled inside while rain pours on a muggy Tuesday. The festival’s first week had great weather; the pair joke that they’ve brought the storm with them ahead of their premiere. Their vibe, in any case, is awfully sunny. Zlotowski conceived ofA Private Lifewith exactly this dream in mind: Foster as her star, Cannes as her launching pad. “I had the title,Vie Privée,that obsessed me, and I had a person, Jodie Foster, that obsessed me,” the director says. “I’ve never seen someone with such intelligence visible on her face. You can touch the rapidity, the quickness of the thought, and the struggle between body and mind.” Unfamiliar with Zlotowski’s work—her past movies include the acclaimed French tragicomedyOther People’s Childrenand theNatalie Portman–ledPlanetarium—Foster signed on having just read the script. The star moved to Paris a month before filming began to get her “mouth moving” while ditching English. “Honestly, the biggest problem is that my jaw gets tired and my brain gets tired,” she says. “If you’re by yourself and not talking to a lot of Americans for a little while, your brain adapts to speaking French all the time.” Foster then drilled down on the dialogue, memorizing every word with a rigor beyond her typical process; she’d get flustered whenever she tried to improvise. “At the end [of the shoot], I wouldaskher to make mistakes, because it was too flawless,” Zlotowski says. This helped shape Dr. Lilian Steiner, a character who’s dryly comic while loaded with neuroses. When we meet Lilian, she’s clearly not at her best. She’s barely listening during sessions, she’s ignoring her new grandchild, and she’s dealing with threats of a lawsuit. Her patient’s death is initially assumed to be a suicide, but some believe otherwise—leading Lilian to revisit recordings of the sessions to determine whether or not she’s responsible. It might sound grim, but Foster’s performance is witty, knowing, even a little campy. She very clearly relishes the chance to say “murder” in a thick French accent. “I think I\u0000\u0000’m a different person in French than I am in English—I’m a muchlighterperson in French. I’m not as confident. I’m a little more vulnerable,” Foster tells me. “I’m always scared that I’m going to make a mistake. My [French] vocabulary is the vocabulary of an 18-year-old.” Zlotowski interjects: “35.” Beyond the language,A Private Lifefound Foster entering yet more uncharted territory. For starters, Zlotowski used artificial intelligence to create elaborate dream sequences that find Lilian plumbing her subconscious—and in turn, her past—for clues as to her patient’s fate. “Some images had to [represent] fantasies or dreams or what we repress. It’s so connected to the worlds of cinema that nourished me, like Lynch or Fellini, and it’s been a goal to create those kinds of images,” Zlotowski says. “I was happy to use [AI] because it has to be connected to our work right now as directors. I know it’s going to be the next step, and I don’t want to be a victim of it—I want to be mastering it.” When I ask Foster, a director herself, how she feels about AI’s use in film generally, she has a very different response: “I’m just petrified by it. I’m a bit of a Luddite. I’m older, I can do emails. But we’re all scared of it, and rightfully so.” She’s been engaging with the topic for years, though, including by directing theBlack Mirrorepisode “Arkangel.” Further, she found Zlotowski’s approach compelling in its impact: “It’s surprising how the use of the AI [creates] one of the most emotional parts of the movie. We were able to take some digital, robotic thing and use it in order to become more human.” The film also allowed Foster to do something she hadn’t done onscreen since entering her 50s and 60s: engage in a genuine middle-age romance. Lilian’s quest to discover the truth leads to her enlisting her ex-husband, Gabriel (Daniel Auteuil), as a makeshift co-detective. As they investigate, they rekindle their bond—and finally confront old wounds. Zlotowski made the relationship more prominent only after casting Auteuil, a decorated icon in French cinema, opposite a fellow icon in Foster. “Those very Hollywood golden age comedies that we French love—I thought it was a beautiful, secret layer of the film,” Zlotowski says. Foster adds, “I have been watching Daniel since I was young. I have his face memorized. I know where his dimples are, and all that kind of stuff. Thirty years later, we’re shooting a makeout scene.” The primary theme ofA Private Lifelives right there in the title. People have their public worlds, even the worlds they bring into their therapist’s office—and then they have what’s going on deep inside. As Zlotowski puts it, “There’s a private life, there is a public life, and then there is a secret life.” Famous actors know that dynamic well—especially Foster, who’s kept her personal lifeas private as possiblethroughout her career. She connected to how Zlotowski’s script, cowritten withAnne BerestandGaëlle Macé,explored that tension. “In me, it’s more compartmentalized than necessarily with other people, because it’s life or death for me. It’s how I was raised since I was a child,” Foster says. “I have to do it in order to survive.” Regardless of what she’ll say in an interview or when the recorder goes off, however, she believes she’s at her most authentic and honest when she’s onscreen. “The real gift of acting for me is that it allows me to investigate an emotional life in a way that I might not have been capable of as a real person,” she says. “I should have been a lawyer; I should have never been an actor. But I got thrown in at three, so I didn’t have a choice. I had to sink or swim. It’s kind of a cruel thing to do to an OCD, intellectual kid: ‘You’re going to have to pretend that your grandfather’s dead and cry.’ How can you do that to me? But I had to learn.” Amid the pretending, Foster started making real connections. “We do this weird, false thing between two characters that are made up, and yet you have these real moments that you’ll never forget. That’s been my whole life,” Foster says. “You might never see them again, but then you might see them at Cannes—and you’re going to run into each other’s arms, because you know you had those moments.” Indeed, both Foster’s and Zlotowski’s careers took off on the Croisette. The director’s debut feature—Dear Prudence,starringLéa Seydoux—premiered to strong reviews at Cannes; 15 years later, this will be her fourth film to launch at the festival. As for Foster? Well, she first came as a teenager withMartin Scorsese’sTaxi Driver,which won the Palme d’Or and earned Foster her first Oscar nod. She’s since directed multiple Cannes premieres and received the prestigious honorary Palme d’Or. So how couldA Private Lifeand Foster’s first French leading role be introduced anywhere else? “That I could make this film with Jodie is thanks to Cannes,” Zlotowski says. “It gave us this chance.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depth2025 Cannes Film Festival coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Denzel Washington Gets Testy With Photographer Before Receiving Surprise Palme d'Or",
    "article_text": "On Monday,Denzel Washingtontook a quick, emotional trip to the Cannes Film Festival. The 70-year-old Oscar winner walked the Cannes red carpet forSpike Lee'slatest film,Highest 2 Lowest, in which Washington co-stars withA$AP Rocky. The trio posed together, much to the delight of photographers—who didn't hesitate to show their excitement, even if it meant being unprofessional. As Denzel Washington stood by A$AP Rocky, a photographer on the red carpet grabbed his arm to get his attention—a gesture the actor didn't appreciate at all. He shared his displeasure by pointing his finger at the culprit, asking him to stop and not repeat what he had just done. But the photographer repeated his gesture, prompting Washington to push his arm away impetuously. \"Stop it! Stop it!\" the actor said in response. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Washington’s evening seemed to improve as the premiere got underway, and he received a nice surprise: an honorary Palme d'Or. The award was presented by Spike Lee, who has directed Washington in films includingMo' Better BluesandMalcom X.Prior toHighest 2 Lowest, their sixth film together, the friends had not collaborated for some twenty years—amplifying the emotion at the Cannes festival. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” Washington said as he received his honor. “It's a total surprise for me, so I'm a bit emotional, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart. It was a wonderful opportunity to collaborate again with my brother—a brother from another mother, Spike.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Highest 2 Lowest, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, is a reinterpretation of the crime thrillerHigh and Lowby Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, released in 1963. Spike Lee's film is set in New York, and focuses on a music tycoon (Washington), the victim of a ransom attempt, as he faces a moral dilemma between life and death.",

    "title": "Spike Lee and Denzel Washington Vividly Celebrate Their Own Legacies in ‘Highest 2 Lowest’",
    "article_text": "Among the weirdest films to premiere at this year’s Cannes Film Festival isSpike Lee’s out-of-competition drama-thrillerHighest 2 Lowest, the kind of idiosyncratic indulgence only a filmmaker of Lee’s stature is allowed. Lee’s film, a curious mash of tones and tempos, has such an odd cadence that it sometimes plays like it’s been translated from a mysterious foreign language. But this is indeed a homegrown film, even if it is adapted from a 1963 movie by Akira Kurosawa. In the last decade of his career, Lee has seemed to shake off anything that could be considered industry pressure and turned back to the creative impulses that first made him famous 40 years ago. His films have grown more assured in their strangeness, their offbeat approximation of the rhythms forever thumping in Lee’s head.Highest 2 Lowestis peak Lee, a determinedly New York film about money, influence, and generational divides in the business of making art. It’s half mess, half triumph, and thrilling even in its failures. The film opens on gleaming, overly bright shots of the DUMBO neighborhood of Brooklyn (new-build highrises towering at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge), set to “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” fromOklahoma!. Lee gives little indication of what sort of movie is about to come He seems merely excited to be running a camera again; to, for the zillionth time, be capturing his beloved hometown in all its teeming, infinite possibility. That enthusiasm is infectious, so much that one is willing to forgive a lot of subsequent awkwardness.Denzel Washington, collaborating with Lee for the sixth time, plays David King, the gregarious, seemingly tireless impresario of a legendary music label who is living the good life in an eye-popping penthouse with his beautiful wife, Pam (Ilfenesh Hadera), and handsome, precocious teenage son Trey (Aubrey Joseph). Not all is perfect, though. Times have changed for David’s business, as they have for Lee’s. While David enjoys grand-poobah status, he’s also facing the sale of his carefully built company, a relinquishing of power that will push him out the window with a golden parachute. The threat of obsolescence creeps toward him, a feeling that Lee can no doubt relate to as he approaches 70 and turns to consider a film industry barely recognizable from the one he first stormed in the 1980s. Amidst the onslaught of streaming and smartphones and the internet, what remains constant is Lee’s commitment to the erratic ingenuity of art over the dull pattern of commerce.Highest 2 Lowest, which was written byWilliam Alan Foxbut no doubt considerably reworked by Lee, is, among other things, an argument for a return to purest passion. Men like Lee and Washington may have found their riches in a system often hostile to them, but now it is time to throw away the trappings of the contemporary world and refocus on the soul of their endeavors. It’s a nice message. If much ofHighest 2 Lowestplays like older men shaking their fists at the youth culture of today—all fast and hustling and shallow—it does so in charming, rakish fashion.Highest 2 Lowestis not ranting at young men to pull up their pants; instead, it’s just explaining how it felt to make and enjoy art at a time where doing so felt more risky. Faith is a part of that return to core values, perhaps an addition from the increasingly devout and proselytizing Washington. There’s a kidnapping inHighest 2 Lowest, transforming the film from broad cultural survey to something approaching a thriller. Lee is casual in his approach to this suspense. He takes his time arriving at the incident and then, once it’s kicked into motion, has his characters react to it with a jarring offhandedness. Maudlin music scores many of these scenes, in which David weighs the paying of a steep ransom against his financial interest in buying back his company. There’s a clumsy, ersatz Almodóvarian quality to all this melodrama, broad and theatrical and brightly lit. This is the messy side ofHighest 2 Lowest, in which it seems Lee has little grasp on the proportions of his film. But he finds a lovely groove about halfway through, ramping up the action as he sends David tearing across a vividly articulated New York City to get his money back—and, in the process, rediscovering the purpose of his work.Howard Drossin’s music shifts from overindicating to wholly vital;Matthew Libatique’s saturated cinematography takes on new depth. Washington seems invigorated by the tone shift, too. He’s especially electric in a pair of scenes withA$AP Rocky, who plays an aspiring rapper with a limber, coltish eagerness that’s a nice match for Washington’s elder-statesman cool. Highest 2 Lowestends on a disarmingly sweet note, with a titan of his craft reconnecting with his primal passion. Lee confers that blessing of renewal on David, and on himself, too. InHighest 2 Lowest, he happily trots out his favorite tropes. There are paeans to the city he loves—a long pause to have fun at a Puerto Rican Day party, Yankees fans causing merry mayhem on the 4 train. There is heavy, frequent invocation of Lee’s many heroes, from Malcolm X to Aretha Franklin. It may all seem like old stuff—except thatHighest 2 Lowestboldly reclaims the familiar Lee tics, winningly reinstating them as features rather than bugs, causes rather than crutches. The last line of the film is “Let’s get to work,” which—coming from 68-year-old Lee and 71-year-old Washington—proves awfully moving.Highest 2 Lowestfinds Lee both defiant of his age and proud of it, seizing our attention with the friendly insistence of someone with still so much left to tell us.

    "article_text": "Michael Dell says AI will bring change, but that’s OK When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The CEO ofDellTechnologies has toldTechRadar ProAI offers a great opportunity for organizations to re-evaluate themselves to positive effect Speaking at a media Q&A session atDell Technologies World 2025, Michael Dell looked to reassure us that AI will never fully replace human workers, and in fact may offer them a whole new outlook. In a wide-ranging discussion, Dell also laid out his views on political instability affecting the technology industry, and some of his key leadership principles. “The way I think about this is that if you look at every progress, that’s for any technology, you always have some change that goes on,” Dell said in response to our question about AI affecting or even replacing human workers. “My way of thinking is there’s probably a 10 percent effect for that - but I think 90 percent of that is actually growth and expansion and opportunity, and ultimately what I think you’re going to see is more opportunities, more economic growth.” “There are a lot of things that we don’t do, that we used to do, because we have the tools, and we’re more effective as a species because of that - (using AI) is just another example of that.” “One of the keys beyond productivity and efficiency I think for organizations, is to reimagine themselves, and say, alright, what is the trajectory of these capabilities, where is it going, and what should our activity look like in three years, five years time, given this capability.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “You know, a lot of roles today just didn’t exist 10, 20, 30 years ago - and no-one was forecasting that.” Having spoken withNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang in his opening keynote, Dell was also asked if the two shared any overarching leadership principles. “I think anytime there’s a new technology, you have to leap ahead (and think), what is the likely impact of this, and how do we need to change? And if we don’t have a passion around that, or there isn’t a crisis in your organization - make one! We think it can make us a better company.” Dell was also asked about how changing global economic and political situations might affect the company’s future outlook “We agree that those are issues and challenges,” he said, “in my general view, the importance of this technology is greater than all those problems - and I heard somebody say recently, tokens are bigger than tariffs - and that would sort of summarize our view of it.” “Are all those things helpful to our business? No, they’re not - but there’s a limit of what we can do about that, right? We can certainly do the things we’re supposed to do, and focus on the things we can control - we’re seeing plenty of companies that are dealing with all those challenges just as we are, and powering ahead in any case.” Mike Moore is Deputy Editor at TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "Trump accuses Biden advisers of treason",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has accused senior aides to his predecessor of committing“treason at the highest level”by allegedly exploiting Joe Biden’s cognitive decline in order to implement unauthorized policies that he would never have supported himself. In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump claimed that Biden never advocated for open borders and that the surge in illegal immigration was orchestrated by staffers who effectively“stole”the presidency by taking control of the autopen – a device used to replicate a person’s signature. “The Joe Biden that everybody knew would never allow drug dealers, gang members, and the mentally insane to come into our Country totally unchecked and unvetted. All anyone has to do is look up his record,”Trump argued, adding that the resulting influx has cost the US“hundreds of billions of dollars.” “It wasn’t his idea to open the border… It was the people that knew he was cognitively impaired, and that took over the autopen,”he added.“This is TREASON at the highest level!... Something very severe should happen to these treasonous thugs that wanted to destroy our Country, but couldn’t, because I came along.” Trump’s allegations come amid renewed concerns about Biden’s health, following the recent announcement that he has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 and metastasis to the bone. While Trump publicly wished Biden well, he also questioned the timing and transparency of the disclosure, suggesting that the public was not informed soon enough. “I’m surprised that… the public wasn’t notified a long time ago, because to get to stage nine, that’s a long time,”Trump told reporters on Monday, questioning how doctors at the White House and Walter Reed hospital could have missed a condition that takes years to develop. “And the autopen is becoming a very big deal. You know, the autopen is becoming a big deal because it seems that maybe it was the president – whoever operated the autopen,”Trump added, speculating whether the same doctors had overlooked signs of cognitive decline.“In other words, there are things going on that the public wasn’t informed of. And I think somebody’s gonna have to speak to his doctor.” The autopen has become a focal point in Trump’s broader criticisms of Biden’s presidency. Earlier this year, Trump declared that several last-minute pardons issued by Biden were“void,”alleging that they were signed without his knowledge. Legal experts note that the use of the autopen by US presidents has historical precedent and is legally valid when authorized. However, Trump maintains that in his predecessor’s case, the device may have been misused by aides acting independently. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has since launched aninvestigationinto whether senior Biden aides orchestrated a cover-up of the president’s alleged cognitive decline.",

    "title": "Senior DOJ official: Biden’s wife should be charged with ‘elder abuse’",
    "article_text": "Jill Biden should face ‘elder abuse’ charges if she pushed her husband Joe to run for the presidency despite knowing about his cancer, Donald Trump’s DOJ lawyer Leo Terrell has said. Last weekend, the former US president’s office revealed that he has been diagnosed with an“aggressive form”of prostate cancer. The announcement met with mixed reactions, with some offering condolences to Biden and his family, while others alleged the diagnosis had been long known but deliberately withheld from the public. Responding on X to a post by Ian Jaeger on Monday, Terrell, a senior counselor to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, floated the idea. The Internet personality and political commentator directly claimed that Jill Biden“knew about President Biden’s health problems… but still wanted him to run for president.” “Elder Abuse! Criminal Charges??”Terrell wrote. Elder Abuse! Criminal Charges??https://t.co/prfDh49ulk According to Biden’s office, the ex-president and his family are now“reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”The condition of the former president, who had been previously successfully cured of skin cancer, was confirmed during a routine physical examination. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone,”the office said in a statement.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management.” Donald Trump offered his sympathy to Biden and his family, stating on Truth Social that“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis. We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery,”he added. The president’s eldest son, however, struck a different note, joining the chorus of those alleging foul play.“What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???”Donald Trump Jr.wroteon X. Many users, however, pointed out that the ex-president’s wife is not a medical doctor, as her title stems from her doctorate in education. Trump Jr. made the remarks in response to a post by the CEO of Atossa Therapeutics, Dr. Steven Quay, who argued that prostate cancer was the“easiest”to diagnose, and it was“highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.”",

    "title": "What to Wear to a Beach Wedding 2025: Suits, Shirts, and Pants and More",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Before enjoying the beauty of watching someone else get married against the backdrop of an azure ocean, you first have to nail down your beach wedding attire. What to wear to a wedding is already fraught; now you have to contend with the intricacies of a formal ceremony taking place where anyone not on the invite list is shirtless and half-drunk on margaritas. Assuming you haven’t been given explicit directions on a dress code, you’ll want to start the same as with every other wedding: with asuit. (Doubly so if you’re the one getting married.) But when sand is present, your three-season wool standby isn’t invited. You want a beach-wedding-worthy suit that combines coastal swagger with a lightweight fabric and a cut that will flatter, without suffocating. You’ll also need shoes (sorry, flip flop aficionados) that won’t sink into the sand or make you look like a finance bro lost in Cabo. You’ll want a shirt, too—though when it comes to a beach wedding, this is where you can get a little more creativeandcomfortable, as you’ll see. From there, you can add on some extras—jewelry, a watch, shades—for bonus points. Below, we’ve pulled together what to wear to a beach wedding, in a mix-n-match format that’ll make you the best dressed guy on the dunes. And all of it should fit in yourcarry-onluggage, along with someswim trunks(in case the afterparty hits the waves) andsunscreen. Because the only thing worse than being badly dressed for a beach wedding is being a badly dressed lobster in all the photos. Unless the invite explicitly says “casual,” wear a suit. Hell, even if it does, we’d suggest wearing one, because a laid-back suit looks better when it’s not mandatory. Linen, seersucker, and tropical wool are your best, breeziest bets. Cotton’s not bad, either, but it’ll feel a little heavier in the sun. Whatever you go with, ideally the jacket is unlined or half-lined. Color-wise, we like soft grays and browns, light blues, or a subtle seersucker stripe. Anything dark feels both too formal and, in the sun, too damn hot. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason’s take on the classic carry-on blazer is built fortravel, but now it comes in a breezy summer-weight blend that mixes lightweight, cool-feeling Tencel with cotton. It’s the kind of fabric that can handle anything, including an impromptu ocean dip once the afterparty gets going. Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republichas been cooking with fire for the last couple years, particularly on the affordable suit front. Made from a cotton-linen blend sourced from Italy, this suit is designed with warmer climates and sweat-prone guys in mind. The cut leans slim, with an Italian-style soft shoulder for that relaxed elegance. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder We’d trustTodd Snyderto suit us up for any occasion, even the sandiest. The American designer once again works in a very right-now-but-retro style with this double-breasted two-piece in a handsome cream-colored seersucker. He left behind the old-timey stripes, knowing the subtle puckered texture stands out nicely—and let’s a breeze in, too. J. Mueser Mr Porter J. Mueser Mr Porter Jake Mueser, founder ofJ. Mueser, has been helping guys look dangerously handsome in bespoke suits since 2008. His secret sauce? A blend of traditional Neapolitan tailoring and a New York sensibility that makes his pieces as everyday wearable as they are sharp. Recently Mueser blessed men who couldn't make it to NYC by offering off-the-rack suiting online. This particular suit, cut from 100 percent linen and finished with a butterfly lining for easy movement, works just as well on a Saturday night as it will on a sandy beach. (Though there's a cream option if you're worried about the noonday heat of Saint Lucia.) When it comes to a beach wedding, shirts are where the fun starts. (Okay, the open bar is where the fun starts, but you get the gist.) Nothing against awhite dress shirt, but we’d swap it for a polo, camp shirt, or Cuban, particularly in short sleeves. If you wear a long-sleeve shirt, stick with linen, and tuck it in. Whether the dress code reads “beach formal” or “tropical chic,” these six shirts will bring your A-game—underneath the suit and straight through to the dance floor. Percival Percival Drake's Huckberry Madewell Madewell Frizmworks Huckberry Uniqlo Uniqlo Mr P Mr Porter Listen, we know sandals are tempting, but here’s the thing: you can always kick off your kicks if the party goes in that direction. In the meantime, we’d begin and end our search for beach wedding footwear in the slip-on aisle.Loafersare a solid option, but make sure they’re woven or unlined.
