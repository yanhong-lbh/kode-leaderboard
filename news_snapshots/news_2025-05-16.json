    "title": "Biden struggles with words, key memories in leaked audio from Special Counsel Hur interview",
    "article_text": "'Timcast' host Tim Pool reviews leaked audio of the interview between then-President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur on 'Jesse Watters Primetime. Leaked audio from former President Joe Biden’s interview withSpecial Counsel Robert Hurshowed the president struggling with key memories, including when his son Beau died, when he left the vice presidency, why he had classified documents he shouldn't have had and more. The audio was leaked after more than a year of congressional lawmakers demanding its release amid questions about the former president’s memory lapses and mental acuity. Thetranscript of Biden’s interviewwith Hur was released last year, and confirmed the president’s frequent memory lapses. The audio, obtained by Axios, contains clips from several interviews between the former president and Hur related to an investigation into his handling of classified documents when he was vice president. HUR TRANSCRIPT CONFIRMS BIDEN MEMORY LAPSES, CONTRADICTS PRESIDENT'S CLAIM ABOUT EXCHANGE OVER SON'S DEATH Leaked audio clips obtained by Axios give further insight into President Biden's declining mental state.(Getty Images) When asked by Hur about where he kept papers he was actively working on around 2017 and 2018, Biden said that Beau Biden was either \"deployed or is dying\" at that time. Beau died in 2015. At one point, Biden said to himself \"When did Beau die?\" and a lawyer answered that it was 2015. He also said in the audio thatPresident Donald Trumpwas elected in 2017 and was corrected that it was 2016. \"Why do I have 2017 here?\" he said, referencing his notes, and a lawyer tells him, \"That's when you left office.\" Later, when asked about a classified document on Afghanistan found at his lake house, Biden said at first he wasn't sure how the document got there, but then admitted, \"I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity's sake.\" The interview was also filled with long pauses with Biden sometimes going off on tangents and slurring his words. The House Judiciary Committee, last July sued then-Attorney General Merrick Garland for the audio recordings, stressing the importance of the \"verbal and nonverbal context\" of Biden's answers that could be provided by the audio recordings – especially considering that Hur opted against charging Biden after the interview, in part, because he was viewed as\"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The committee argued at the time that the audio recordings – not merely the transcripts of them – are \"the best available evidence of how President Biden presented himself during the interview.\" That lawsuit came beforeBiden dropped out of the 2024presidential race last July after he struggled in a June debate with Trump. Biden had exerted executive privilege over the audio recordings. Hur, whoreleased his reportto the public in February 2024 after months of investigation, did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling and retaining classified documents, and he stated that he would not bring charges against Biden even if he were not in the Oval Office. HOUSE JUDICIARY SUES GARLAND FOR BIDEN AUDIO THAT HUR SAYS SHOWS HIM AS 'ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY' Those records included classified documents about military and foreign policy in Afghanistan and other countries, among other records related to national security and foreign policy, which Hur said implicated \"sensitive intelligence sources and methods.\" Hur noted in his report that Biden struggled to remember details about when his son Beau died, which drew sharp backlash from Biden. The report also showed Biden asking multiple times when his term as vice president ended while being questioned specifically about some of theclassified documents at his home. Another instance included Biden being asked about a notebook in his possession related to thewar in Afghanistan.

Yeah.\" President Biden struggles with his speech and forgets key details while speaking with Special Counsel Hur in leaked audio obtained by Axios.( Scott Olson/Getty Images) Back when Hur's report was released, Biden reacted to him being classified as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Biden responded by saying, \"I'm well-meaning, and I'm an elderly man, and I know what the hell I'm doing. I've been president. I put this country back on its feet. I don't need his recommendation.\"",

    "article_text": "The New York Mets lost to the Houston Astros after Juan Soto struck out in a pivotal at-bat. Craig Carton, Danny Parkins, Greg Jennings, and John Smoltz discuss Soto’s potential as a Met and if he can lead them to the World Series. Juan Soto only spent just one season in New York Yankees pinstripes. After helping the Yankees advance to the 2024 World Series, Soto switched New York City boroughs and signed ahistoric contractwith the Mets. The Metsopen a three-game series with the Yankees on Friday night. The latest edition of the Subway Series will also mark Soto's first time competing at Yankee Stadium since he hung up his pinstripes. Much of the chatter leading up to the series has centered around the reception Soto will receive from the Yankees faithful. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New York Yankees broadcasters, Michael Kay and John Sterling look on before the game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium on Apr. 20, 2024, in New York, New York.(New York Yankees/Getty Images) Longtime play-by-play announcer and radio host Michael Kay weighed in on the discussion. While Kay discouraged fans from engaging in vulgar chants, he encouraged them to boo the former Yankees slugger. \"I’m anticipating the reaction that Juan Soto is gonna get at Yankees stadium,\" Kay said. \"And I think the reaction, if I’m a Yankee fan, would be constant booing of Juan Soto. Now, nothing profane. It shouldn’t be that. You should be ashamed of yourself if you say anything like that.\" METS' JUAN SOTO LOOKS FORWARD TO SUBWAY SERIES AGAINST FORMER TEAM, DESPITE POTENTIAL YANKEES FANS' BOOS Kay doubled down on his anti-profanity stance and advisedYankees fansto be \"a little more clever.\" Port St. Lucie, FL: New York Mets' Juan Soto during a spring training workout in Port St. Lucie, Florida on Feb. 16, 2025.(Alejandra Villa Loarca/Newsday RM via Getty Images) \"Don’t be classless with the bleep Juan Soto,\" Kay added. \"Be a little more clever than that. You can boo without using the f-word. There are gonna be kids in the crowd! But make him feel how hurt you feel. Nothing wrong with it. Don’t let anybody guilt you into that.

Nevertheless, Kay suggested many Yankees fans felt a sense of betrayal when Soto bolted for the team's crosstown rival. \"They feel betrayed, they feel like jilted lovers,\" Kay noted. \"If you feel like you’re betrayed, then boo him.

    "title": "DHS open to Duck Dynasty producer's pitch for immigrant-based reality show: 'Happy to review'",
    "article_text": "\"It's got to be extremely discouraging to be one of your constituents—to see you fight for a terrorist like this.\" DHS Secretary Noem drags a Democratic congressman for continuing to push his party’s narrative on ‘due process’ for Abrego Garcia. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is considering working with the producer of ‘Duck Dynasty’ on a reality show featuring immigrants vying for U.S. citizenship. Rob Worsoff, the A&E producer who pitched the department about the show in a 35-page slide deck first reported by Daily Mail, envisioned immigrants taking part in competitions around the country for the prize of fast-tracking their citizenship process, such as digging for clams in Maine or rafting down the Arkansas River in Colorado. The show would be called ‘The American,’ also the name of the Amtrak train that would cart them around the country. As they travel to each state, the competitors would \"learn about the history, quirks and activities of each region,\" one slide seen by Fox News Digital said. \"Aboard the train, we will learn who they are, where they come from, their unique backgrounds, and why they have chosen to immigrate to the United States of America,\" the slide reads. DHS seemsopen to the proposal. NOEM DISMISSES JEFFRIES' WARNINGS AS DHS CONSIDERS ARRESTS OF DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS AFTER ICE FACILITY CLASH HHS Sec. Kristi Noem, known for her made-for-TV moments on the job, has not yet been briefed on the idea because it’s in the early stages, a department official told Fox.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) A document from the pitch deck for the proposed reality show.(Fox News Digital ) \"I said it may be a good idea,\" Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS, told Fox News Digital. \"We get hundreds of pitches for shows. We need to revive patriotism and civic duty in this country and we’re happy to review out-of-the-box pitches.\" She added on X that Sec.Kristi Noem,known for her made-for-TV moments on the job, has not yet been briefed on the idea because it’s in the early stages and has not been approved by staff. DHS CHIEF NOEM ACCUSES LAWMAKERS OF 'COMMITTING FELONIES' AT NEWARK ICE FACILITY: 'THEY SHOULD BE CENSURED' The winner would be deemed \"our newest fellow American!\" though all contestants on the show would be eligible for eventual citizenship. Other game prizes would be \"iconically American,\" including 1 million American Airlines points, a $10,000 Starbucks Gift Card, or a lifetime supply of 76 gasoline. Worsoff, who is Canadian, told Fox News Digital he’d pitched the idea as far back as the Obama administration, and the DHS under both President Barack Obama andJoe Bidenhad been receptive to it. \"Both cases there was a positive response,\" he said. \"There was a very positive response under [DHS Sec. Alejandro] Mayorkas, then he got impeached.\" \"My show is very much a positive, fun inclusive show,\" Worsoff added. He said years ago he'd pitched the idea for the hit reality show ‘The Biggest Loser’ and people had initially accused him of fat-shaming. \"Then people watched the show they realized this is a heartwarming, kind show.\" \"Nobody's moving backwards in the [immigration] process\" by being on the show, he emphasized. The DHS has launched a $200 million ad campaign aimed at highlighting the administration’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.) Worsoff told the Wall Street Journal he’d pitched the idea as far back as the Obama administration, but it never gained traction. Worsoff formerly wrotefor and produced ‘Duck Dynasty,’ the reality TV show about a Louisiana family and their duck hunting activities. He also produced Bravo’s Millionaire Matchmaker. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Worsoff, who hails from Canada, told the Daily Mail: \"I’m not affiliated with any political ideology. As an immigrant myself, I am merely trying to make a show that celebrates the immigration process, celebrate what it means to be American and have a national conversation about what it means to be American, through the eyes of the people who want it most.\" DHS has launched a $200 million ad campaign aimed at highlighting the administration’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.",

    "title": "'View' co-host tells others Trump is in power 'because you guys screwed this up' in clash over Biden cover-up",
    "article_text": "Alyssa Farah Griffin of \"The View\" argued with her co-hosts, claiming the Democratic Party and those in the media who defended Biden from scrutiny are to blame for the party's defeat in November. \"The View\" co-hosts locked horns Friday over whether the Democratic Party needs to reckon with how it protected then-President Joe Biden from scrutiny amid rumors of his decline or move on to focus on President Donald Trump. Adding fuel to the fire is the upcoming book \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" co-written by CNN host Jake Tapper, who admitted hedid not cover Biden’s worsening conditionenough. \"The View\" shared clips of Tapper talking about his coverage, followed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., stating their intent tolook forward rather than back, which sparked a heated debate among the hosts. Co-host Sara Haines responded that many people have lost faith in the Democratic Party precisely because it spent too much time denying and trying to distract people from what they could see with their own eyes. \"The View\" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin argued that Democrats need to own the fact that they are part of why President Trump returned to the White House.(ABC/\"The View\") SPARKS FLY AS 'THE VIEW' HOSTS CLASH OVER REASONS FOR BRUTAL HARRIS DEFEAT: 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH AMERICA?' \"They told the voters what to care about, and they did not listen when the voters said they cared,\" she added. \"So these stories coming out aren’t about beating a dead horse, it’s saying if they could have a fair conversation that ‘We heard you, we saw it as they saw it,’ they’d be gaining some of the voters back.\" Co-host Sunny Hostin slammed Haines’ analysis. \"I think that I want to move on from why the Democratic Party lost and I want to hear from the Democratic Party about how we are going to take our country back,\" Hostin said, offering a laundry list of grievances with the Trump administration. Co-host Ana Navarro condemned campaign books like Tapper’s for featuring anonymous insiders, arguing it makes each of them look like a \"complicit coward.\" \"Or was there a culture within the White House that people felt that they couldn’t speak truth to power?\" Griffin responded, citing quotes in the book where people claimed they would be \"boxed out of meetings\" if they raised concerns. The co-hosts of \"The View\" had a lively discussion about how the Democratic Party should move forward. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE One key example from the book Griffin mentioned was when Biden didn’t recognize George Clooney at a political fundraiser in June. Behar disregarded the incident and sparked laughter from the audience by quipping, \"[Clooney] looks different lately.\" Griffin argued it was a stark sign Biden would not have been able to rise to the occasion during a time of crisis. \"Does that give you confidence that, in the middle of the night, if China is about to attack us, there’s a war breaking out in Iran, that he is the sharpest person to be able to handle that?\" Behar dismissed the argument again, contrasting Biden's administration with the current Trump administration. \"Do we just keep lowering the bar because Trump is bad?\" Griffin asked. \"'Nothing else is bad because Trump is bad?'\" After further back and forth, Behar declared, \"This ship has sailed. It’s out in the ocean somewhere with Biden. It’s over. Get over it.\" \"We have Trump because you guys screwed this up,\" Griffin exclaimed. \"All due respect.\" Biden's debate against Trump in 2024 opened the floodgates to criticisms over his mental acuity.((Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) | (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) | Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)) Haines, who has slammedDemocrats for hiding Biden's decline before,argued they are acting like the Republican Party. \"Dems are actually taking a page from Republicans, because Republicans didn’t want us to look at January 6,\" she said. \"They said, ‘Let’s look forward. Don’t look at what happened on that day. Look over there.’ So in a way it’s working.

    "article_text": "‘The Five’ co-hosts break down the fallout from former FBI Director James Comey’s Instagram post. Former FBI DirectorJames Comeyis expected to meet face to face with U.S. Secret Service officials in Washington, D.C., for an interview about his \"86 47\" post, two sources briefed on the meeting told Fox News. Comey is under investigation for an Instagram post showing seashells arranged on a beach to read \"86 47.\" \"Cool shell formation on my beach walk,\" he wrote in the since-deleted Thursday post. Some have interpreted the post to mean \"86\" – get rid of –  \"47\" –Donald Trump, the 47th president. Comey offered an explanationfor the postafter he received backlash on social media. TRUMP ADDRESSES COMEY'S '8647' MESSAGE: ‘HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT’ Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to meet face to face with U.S. Secret Service officials in Washington, D.C., for an interview about his \"86 47\" post, two sources briefed on the meeting told Fox News.(Mark Reinstein/Corbis via Getty Images) \"I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,\" the subsequent post from Comey said. \"I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" EX-FBI CHIEF COMEY'S ‘86 47’ SOCIAL MEDIA POST CONDEMNED BY WHITE HOUSE TO PUT ‘HIT’ ON PRESIDENT Trump didn't accept Comey's explanation, telling Bret Baier, \"He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant. If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant ‘assassination,’ and it says it loud and clear.\" Comey's 86 47 Instagram message.(Fox News; James Comedy/Instagram) Comey was seen late Friday afternoon going into a garage entrance of a building that houses government law enforcement agencies where he was interviewed and explain his side of the story. His meeting lasted for 70 minutes and his wife will be interviewed by the U.S. Secret Service next, a source told Fox News. The FBI, which Comey used to lead before he was fired by Trump during his first term, had no comment on the matter, but it was also apparent that people at the top levels of the agency were aware of the post. Trump's new FBI director,Kash Patel,acknowledged that agency personnel were \"aware\" of Comey's post in his own statement shared on X. \"We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran,\" Patel said. \"Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\" President Donald Trump didn't believe James Comey's explanation.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The U.S. Secret Service is leading the investigation at this point, but the FBI and Department of Justice could take a larger role if necessary, Fox News is told.

    "article_text": "First lady Melania Trump delivered remarks honoring military mothers at the White House A bronze statue ofMelania Trumpwas sawed off at the ankles and stolen this week in the first lady’s native Slovenia, police said. The statue replaced a wooden one that was erected near her hometown of Sevnica in 2020 at the end of PresidentDonald Trump’sfirst term after it was targeted in an arson attack. Both statues were a collaboration between Brad Downey, an artist from Kentucky, and a local craftsman, Ales \"Maxi\" Zupevc. The original figure, made of wood and cut from the trunk of a linden tree, portrayed the first lady in a pale blue dress, similar to the one she wore at Trump’s 2016 inauguration. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP TURNS 55: HER LIFE IN PHOTOS, FROM SLOVENIA TO WHITE HOUSE A bronze statue of Melania Trump was sawed off at the ankles and stolen this week in the first lady’s native Slovenia, police said.(Associated Press) The new statue was placed on the same stump as the old one and modeled after the previous design. In July 2020, Downey said the statue would be made \"as solid as possible, out of a durable material which cannot be wantonly destroyed,\" according to The Guardian. Slovenian police spokesperson Alenka Drenik Rangus said Friday that police were investigating after the vandalism and theft were reported Tuesday. Franja Kranjc, a worker at a bakery that sells cakes with the first lady’s name in support of her, told The Associated Press the rustic likenesswasn’t well liked. Only the ankles remain of a Melania Trump statue that was sawed off and stolen, Slovenian police said.(AP Photo/Relja Dusek) WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAYS STATUE OF LIBERTY GOING NOWHERE, REPLIES TO FRENCH POLITICIAN \"I think no one was really proud at this statue, not even the first lady of the USA,\" Kranjc said. \"So, I think it’s OK that it's removed.\" Zupevc said he and Melania Trump were born in the same hospital, which partly inspired him to create the design. He carved the statue with a chainsaw and sanded it with a power tool. The statue was a rustic likeness of the first lady.(Getty Images) \"I plugged in my angle grinder. … I worked and made mistakes … finished the hair … the eyes and all. Then, I called my brother, who said, ‘Spitting image of our waitress.’ And so it was,\" Zupevc said during a documentary film by Downey on the making of the original statue. A plaque next to the statue says it is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Melania which stood at this location.\" Born Melanija Knavs in nearby Novo Mesto in 1970, the first lady grew up in Sevnica while Slovenia was part of the Communist-ruled former Yugoslavia.

    "title": "UN said to be stalling reforms in hopes Democrats flip House in midterm elections",
    "article_text": "President Trump speaks to reporters about asking Representative Elise Stefanik to stay in Congress and withdrawing her nomination for Ambassador to the United Nations While the United Nations,through its UN80 Task Force, continues a public-facing attempt to slash its budget to manage a decline in external contributions and in recognition of overlapping mandates and duplicated efforts, a U.N. diplomatic source tells Fox News Digital that the effort is an attempt \"to keep a mammoth organization untouched\" until 2026 midterm elections. The source explained that the \"zero-growth budget\" proposed for 2026 has already been prepared, and that \"talk about how we’re going to get it leaner\" is only intended to \"take [President] Trump for a sucker.\" The source said that the U.N. believes that the budget will tide the U.N. over until the House flips to Democratic control and Trump will no longer be able to\"inflict damages to the U.N.\" The source claimed the effort is the \"brain child\" of the U.N. Foundation, something the group refuted. \"We have never proposed linking U.N. budgetary deliberations to the U.S. mid-term elections,\" a spokesperson from the U.N. Foundation told Fox News Digital. WATCHDOG ORG CALLS FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST UN APPOINTEE ACCUSED OF ANTISEMITISM A view of the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City, United States on Jul. 16, 2024.(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) \"The U.N. Foundation is an independent organization, separate from the U.N. itself. We are not involved in the U.N.’s budget process, which is decided by the U.N. General Assembly. We also share a widely held view that there is scope for efficiencies and innovations to strengthen delivery of the U.N.'s lifesaving work,\" the spokesperson added. Fox News Digital viewed internal documents which show efforts by various U.N. entities to direct cost-cutting measures. The source says some show the disingenuous nature of the effort. A UN80 memo from the U.N. Resident Coordinators in Africa from April 2025 discusses how previous reforms have failed. It explains that they \"did not fully address incentives for collaboration,\" which left U.N. entities to \"too often prioritize their corporate obligations over system-wide coherence.\" Coordination, the memo reads, \"is too easily viewed as additional work rather than a core responsibility,\" and \"funding competition further compounds these issues.\" UN GLOBAL COMMS ARM UNDER FIRE FOR ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS AS CRITICS CALL FOR REFORMS The official X account for a United Nations women's group got hammered this week after waiting almost two months to call out Hamas by name for its attack on Israel.(REUTERS/Yana Paskova/File Photo) While the memo identifies two options for reorganization, it notes that \"implementing such ambitious structural reforms, especially Option 1, will require a medium-term phased approach over a 5-10 year horizon,\" and notes that Option 2 \"is not likely to be viable if no structural changes are made to [headquarters] level entities.\" The U.N. source says the memo \"shows…theinability of the U.N. to reformitself.\" Another memo from the office of the Secretary-General sent on April 25 directs Secretariat entities to perform a \"functional review for cost reductions and efficiencies.\" Among the directions provided is that personnel \"identify which functions could be relocated,\" including \"at a minimum the functions, organizational units, post numbers, and grade levels proposed for relocation.\" Numbers were to be sent to the Office of the Controller by May 16, noting that the \"tight deadline\" is in line with the \"very limited timeframe\" the U.N. has \"to prepare and submit the revised estimates through [the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ)]\" so they might be considered \"within the overall context of the proposed programme budget for 2026.\" Fox News Digital’s source called foul on the earnestness of the endeavor. \"This Secretary-General has to deal with bodies that, even though they are called the United Nations, they do not depend on him,\" they explained. \"The document does not represent any value legally, because none of their boards have committed nor listened or reviewed\" the order. REPUBLICANS SEEK TO BLOCK THE REAPPOINTMENT OF UN OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF ANTISEMITISM The chamber of the House of Representatives is seen at the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 28, 2022.(J. Scott Applewhite, File) Fox News Digital asked Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ spokesperson Stephane Dujarric whether Guterres could expect organizations with independent boards to enforce changes like those addressed in his memo. \"We do not take such a pessimistic view. The Secretary-General and the heads of the U.N. Funds and Programmes will act in areas under their authority while, of course, keeping the governing bodies informed,\" Dujarric said. Before the deadline for responses came due, Guterres delivered a May 12 briefing admitting that the proposal for the 2026 budget \"was already given to ACABQ some time ago and it will be impossible to change it at the present moment.\" While Guterres said he would present revised proposals in September in time for budget approvals, he explained that \"changes that require more detailed analysis will be presented in the proposal\" for the 2027 budget. Fox News Digital’s source says the admission is proof that \"this whole attempt is a lie to appease the Americans so they don’t go harsh enough and cut anything right now.\" United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres speaks at the ReutersNEXT Newsmaker event in New York City, New York, U.S.(REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) On May 13, Guterres addressed a letter to all U.N. staff about the need for \"bold, transformative thinking\" and extensive reforms to bring the U.N. out of its liquidity crisis. While expressing gratitude for employees’ \"extraordinary dedication, expertise and creativity\" he warned \"that ‘leaks’ and rumours may create unnecessary anxiety,\" Guterres said that \"it will be inevitable that we cannot leave all posts untouched.\" After over three decades of working for the U.N., the source says they have \"seen the U.N. attempt to change itself at least five times.\" Instead, they said that the U.N. only got \"a larger footprint.\" They explained that other insiders \"are fed up that the organization is not changing.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"You have…asuper state that basically controlsitself,\" the source explained. \"And you should also trust them to reorganize themselves?\" they asked.

    "title": "ICC prosecutor behind Netanyahu arrest warrants steps aside amid sexual misconduct probe",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. JERUSALEM—The scandal-plagued prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) has been compelled to step down, pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, the court announced Friday. Khan has categorically denied the allegations against him. Fox News Digital sent detailed press queries to the ICC and embattled prosecutor Karim Khan on Thursday, asking if the world court planned to oust him and whether he would resign. The Associated Press reportedthe court said in a statement that Khan on Friday ″communicated his decision to take leave until the end″ of an external investigation that will be carried by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the U.N. internal watchdog. That same report said that women's rights groups welcomed the move, who had called for him to step down after the allegations emerged last year, but Khan initially resisted leaving. ICC REQUESTS ARREST WARRANTS FOR NETANYAHU, HAMAS LEADERS OVER ‘WAR CRIMES’ International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan poses during an interview with AFP at the Cour d'Honneur of the Palais Royal in Paris on Feb. 7, 2024.(Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images) Last year, an Associated Press investigation found that two court employees in whom the alleged victim confided came forward with the accusation in May. That was a few weeks before Khan sought arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, his former Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. Israel has been waging an existential war against the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, since it invaded the Jewish state on October 7, 2023 and slaughtered more than 1,200 people, including American citizens. Eugene Kontorovich, a legal expert and senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News Digital, \"Removing Khan is not enough. The entire tribunal, including his prosecutorial team and judges, enabled his blood libel. The scandal points to the inherent defects of the institution - a total lack of accountability.\" Gaza City, Gaza on Feb. 02, 2025.(Ali Jadallah/Anadolu via Getty Images) The Associated Press reported that two co-workers in whom the woman confided at theICC’s headquarters at The Haguereported Khan’s alleged misconduct in May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan himself wasn't questioned at the time. While the court’s watchdog could not determine wrongdoing, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity. Khan has been facing increasing pressure on multiple fronts. U.S. President DonaldTrump filed sanctions againstKhan in February in relation to his Israel warrants. The sanctions are hampering work on a broad array of investigations at the court. ICC REJECTS ISRAELI APPEALS, ISSUES ARREST WARRANTS FOR BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, YOAV GALLANT Israeli PM and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in the Kirya HQ during the Strike in Iran(Avi Ohayon/ GPO) TheWall Street Journal reported Khan’s decisionto prosecute Netanyahu and the country’s former Defense Minister raised \"questions about whether Khan was aiming to protect himself from the sexual-assault allegations. The day before announcing the warrant application, Khan abruptly canceled a trip to Israel and Gaza that he had previously said was important to make his decision.\" The Wall Street Journal reported the ICC employee’s graphic account of Khan allegedly raping the woman and sexually molesting her. Lawyers for Khan from the firm, Carter-Ruck Solicitors, told Fox News Digital on Friday that, \"Our client does wish to make clear, however, that it is categorically untrue that he has engaged in sexual misconduct of any kind.\" Khan’s lawyers continued, \"Our client is cooperating fully and transparently with the investigation by the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in relation to allegations that have been raised against him.\" With respect to information that Khan exploited the ICC to save his own skin by charging Israeli leaders, Carter-Ruck Solicitors said \"The decision to announce that arrest warrants for individuals including Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Gallant and leaders of Hamas, our client also wishes to make clear that the fact that ICC Judges approved the applications for those warrants underscores that the evidence on which they were based met the rigorous legal threshold required under the Rome Statute.Suggestions that the Prosecutor’s applications were linked to, or precipitated by, unrelated allegations of misconduct are totally false.\" HOUSE PASSES BILL THAT WOULD SANCTION INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT FOR TRYING TO ARREST NETANYAHU Hamas fighters stand in formation as Palestinians gather on a street to watch the handover of three Israeli hostages to a Red Cross team in Deir el-Balah, central Gaza, on Feb. 8, 2025(Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Kontorovich said about the ICC case against Israeli leaders: \"This fundamentally undermines the integrity of the case, and in a normal judicial system, would lead not just to these charges being thrown out, but cast doubt on all his prior cases.\" He continued that \"Given that the ICC has only managed to secure final convictions against six people for atrocity crimes in its quarter-century of existence, a massive scandal of prosecutorial misconduct should be grounds for shutting down the institution, not just removing the prosecutor.\" When asked if the ICC plans to rescind the arrest warrants against the Israeli leaders, Fadi El-Abdallah, the spokesman for the ICC, told Fox News Digital that \"As there is a pending request, I can’t offer comment or speculation on its outcome.\" El-Abdallah referred Fox News Digital to Khan’s media team regarding questions related to his alleged sexual misconduct and allegations he damaged the integrity of the world court. A general view of the International Criminal Court (ICC) building in The Hague, Netherlands on Apr. 30, 2024.(Selman Aksunger/Anadolu via Getty Images) Israel asked the ICC to withdraw the arrest warrants in early May. Fox News Digitalpreviously reported the British chief prosecutor, Khan, published an academic essay in 2013 that suggested his own current effort to arrest Netanyahu would be a travesty of justice because the court cannot provide due process to defendants. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Make no mistake: the problem is bigger than Khan. They’re throwing him under the bus to protect the institution and salvage their campaign against Israel. But the rot runs deep. This was never about justice, it was always about a political agenda,\" Hillel Neuer, a lawyer and UN Watch Executive Director, told Fox News Digital. A spokesperson for the United Nations told Fox News Digital that it does not comment on the ICC because it is an independent judicial body. The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

Ambassador Danny Danon condemned aUnited Nationsofficial over remarks that he said \"shattered any notion of neutrality.\" On Tuesday, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher accused Israel of committing genocide in his remarks before the U.N. Security Council. \"Israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,\" Fletcher told the Security Council on Tuesday.

You did not brief the Council; you delivered a political sermon.\" In response to a Fox News Digital request for comment, OCHA spokesperson Eri Kaneko said that \"As Mr. Fletcher made clear in his Security Council remarks, it is for legal bodies to consider whether a genocide is taking place - Mr. Fletcher's point is that the world must take decisive action to prevent genocide and ensure respect for international humanitarian law.\" Israeli Permanent Member to the United Nations Danny Danon speaks during a session of the Security Council at the New York City headquarters.(Israel United Nations mission) When asked whether Fletcher was accusing Israel of deliberately killing and harming civilians, Kaneko said that the official's words speak for themselves, as \"not a single civilian in Gaza - teachers, artists, merchants, aid workers, hostages - has been spared.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Danon questioned under whose authority Fletcher issued the accusation and said the U.N. official’s use of the word \"genocide\" was a \"desecration and subversion of a term with unique force and weight.\" He went on to say that what made Fletcher’s remarks \"far worse\" was the fact that Israel had \"engaged with you and your office in good faith at the highest levels.\" TheIsraeli ambassadorconcluded his letter by turning the questions around on Fletcher, telling the OCHA chief to ask himself whether he had done enough to prevent Oct. 7, accelerate the release of the hostages and hold Hamas accountable. Kaneko told Fox News Digital that \"Mr. Fletcher has repeatedly and publicly spoken out against what he calls the horrendous Hamas-led attacks and called for the release of the hostages.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams has the latest on the killing of the beauty influencer on America Reports. A Mexican social media influencer was shot dead while livestreaming at a beauty salon in a region renowned for cartel violence, with prosecutors saying she was the victim of a targeted attack by a hitman. Valeria Márquez, 23, a model and beauty influencer with more than 113,000 followers on TikTok, collapsed on camera after being shot in the head and chest by a masked gunman who fled the scene on a motorbike with an accomplice, prosecutors said. Thebrazen murderis being investigated as femicide, a gender-based crime under Mexican law, with Mexican President Claudia extending her condolences to Márquez’s family and saying that Mexico's security cabinet is working to solve the murder with the prosecutor's office. Mexican social media influencer Valeria Márquez was fatally shot during a livestream. Authorities suspect she was the victim of a targeted hit linked to cartel violence, and it is being investigated as femicide.(@v___marquez/via Instagram) AFTER CARTELS KILLED MY HUSBAND, MY FAMILY WAITED 40 YEARS FOR JUSTICE. THANKS TO TRUMP, IT’S FINALLY HERE Hours before the grisly killing, Márquez had expressed concern that two men had arrived at the salon in the state of Jalisco near Guadalajara inwestern Mexico,claiming to have a \"very expensive\" gift that needed to be delivered to her in person but she wasn’t there at the time, according to a witness. \"Maybe they were going to kill me,\" Márquez said in her video minutes before she was killed while livestreaming from the salon. \"Were they going to come and take me away, or what? I’m worried.\" When the men returned, they asked if it was Márquez who was now in the salon. She was heard saying, \"They're coming,\" before a voice in the background asked, \"Hey, Vale?\" \"Yes,\" Marquez replied, just before muting the sound on the livestream. Moments later, she was shot to death. A person appeared to pick up her phone, with their face briefly showing on the livestream before the video ended. Denis Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Jalisco State Prosecutor’s Office said investigators believe that the men were hired assassins. Friends and relatives held a funeral for the slain influencer on Thursday.(Reuters) WEALTHY SUBURB ROCKED BY SUSPECTED CARTEL MURDER-FOR-HIRE SHOWS DRUG LORDS' REACH ACROSS US: EXPERT \"The aggressor arrived asking if the victim (Márquez) was there. So it appears he didn’t know her,\" Rodríguez said. \"With that, you can deduce — without jumping to conclusions — that this was a person who was paid. It was obviously someone who came with a purpose.\" Márquez was handed a stuffed animal and a bag of Starbucks coffee while she was on the livestream before the fatal shots rang out. The region is firmly controlled by one of the most powerful cartels in Mexico, theJalisco New Generation Cartel,and murders by hired guns on motorcycles, often known as \"sicarios,\" have become a common occurrence. Rodríguez said that authorities were also investigating if the death was connected to the murder of a former congressman just hours earlier in the same area of Guadalajara, also carried out by two men on a motorcycle. The killing has sent shockwaves through a country that faces high levels of violence against women. Sheinbaum said on Thursday that an investigation is under way to first find those responsible and the motive behind this situation.

    "article_text": "Delegates from Russia and Ukraine and are expected to hold their first peace talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday. PresidentDonald Trumpon Friday told reporters he wants to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine \"as soon as we can set it up.\" The president, speaking from Abu Dhabi during the last stop of his four-dayMiddle Easttour, said: \"I think it’s time for us to just do it.\" Trump had said earlier that a meeting between him and Putin was crucial to breaking the deadlock. Putin spurned an offer this week by Ukrainian leaderVolodymyr Zelenskyyto meet face-to-face for peace talks in Istanbul. Trump said he didn’t think Putin would show up if he didn’t attend the talks himself. RUBIO DOUBTS 'ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE' WILL HAPPEN IN UKRAINE PEACE TALKS TRUMP, PUTIN President Donald Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi Friday that he wants to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine \"as soon as we can set it up.\"(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) \"I said, you know, they all said Putin was going, Zelensky was going, and I said, if I don't go, I guarantee Putin's not going. And he didn't go,\" Trump told reporters Friday. When asked for a timeline, Trump said, \"as soon as we can set it up.\" In place of Zelenskyy and Putin, a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov is expected to meet with a low-level Russian team headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to the media following an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Antalya, on May 15, 2025, ahead of potential peace talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey.(UMIT BEKTAS/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Officials and observers expect these talks to yield little immediate progress on stopping the more than three-year war between Russia and Ukraine. RUBIO TAKES SOMBER TONE ON RUSSIA-UKRAINE PEACE DEAL: 'CLOSE BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH' The two sides are far apart in their conditions for ending the war. Ukraine has accepted a U.S. and European proposal for a full, 30-day ceasefire, but Putin has effectively rejected it by imposing far-reaching conditions. Meanwhile, Ukrainian government and Western military analysts allege that Russian forces are preparing a fresh military offensive.

That would show Trump that Ukraine is determined to press ahead with peace efforts despite Russian foot-dragging, Zelenskyy said, amid intense diplomatic maneuvering by Kyiv and Moscow. The Russian delegation also includes three other senior officials, the Kremlin said. Putin also appointed four lower-level officials as \"experts\" for the talks.

The U.S. side included Secretary of State Marco Rubio as well as retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg. Rubio on Thursday said he did not foresee any major breakthroughs in Istanbul. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We don't have high expectations of what will happen tomorrow.

    "title": "Judge on warpath presses Trump DOJ on Abrego Garcia deportation, answers leave courtroom in stunned silence",
    "article_text": "‘Fox News @ Night’ panelists Alex Swoyer and Mehek Cooke comment on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s fiery exchange with a Democratic lawmaker during a House hearing and more. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis excoriated Trump administration lawyers Friday in a remarkable status hearing centered on Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant andalleged MS-13 memberwho was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error. The heated back-and-forth was full of eye-popping exchanges between the judge and the Justice Department, as she took umbrage with their attempts to invoke the state secrets privilege to shield details concerning Abrego Garcia from the court. \"What world are we living in,\" Xinis asked in disbelief after more than two hours of proceedings. \"What sort of legal world are we living in?\" She sparred multiple times with DOJ lawyers over theirassertion that Abrego Garciawas lawfully detained and deported. JUSTICE KAGAN SNAPS AT TRUMP LAWYER IN MAJOR CASE: 'EVERY COURT HAS RULED AGAINST YOU' Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., to protest the continued detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported to El Salvador in March, in what Trump administration officials have acknowledged was an \"administrative\" error.(Fox News Digital - Breanne Deppisch) \"He was lawfully detained? No he wasn’t!\" Judge Xinis objected. \"There was no order of removal, there was no warrant for removal – there was nothing.\" She cut off Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn again when he attempted to continue with a different argument. \"You didn’t even respond to what I just said,\" she told him. \"A DHS attorney came in at the first hearing and confirmed that there was no lawful basis to arrest Abrego Garcia.\" \"Why are we skipping over that – as part of the misconduct at issue, in light of the pattern I'm currently faced with on this day?\" she asked, in disbelief. For at least 30 seconds, the courtroom fell completely silent. The judge said she would issue an order later Friday outlining next steps, after the two sides huddled for a closed portion of the case. Xinis, who, despite her mounting frustrations, seemed likely to grant the government another deadline extension, described the hours-long hearing as beating a \"frustrated and dead horse.\" At one point, she rebuked the Justice Department for trying to invoke the state secrets privilege via a footnote referencing a filing in a separate case before a different court, noting that this would not pass muster in her courtroom. Most of the public hearing was marked by similar sharp exchanges over whether the Trump administration had taken any steps to comply with court orders to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return – a point Xinis reiterated was already settled by both her court and the Supreme Court last month. At another contentious moment, she laughed in apparent disbelief at the lack of evidence and disclosures from the government. \"I can’t count the number of ‘I don’t knows’ my wonderful clerks and I have heard,\" she said of depositions fromTrump administrationofficials. FEDERAL JUDGE JAMES BOASBERG FINDS PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD TRUMP IN CONTEMPT OVER DEPORTATION FLIGHTS The government has so far declined to facilitate his return to the U.S., despite court orders and a Supreme Court ruling.(Fox News Digital - Breanne Deppisch ) Xinis told the government lawyers they had not presented her with a sufficient affidavit to invoke the state secrets privilege – which the Trump administration has asserted is necessary in this case to protect sensitive diplomatic andforeign policymatters from being made public in court. Pointing to a prior admission from the Trump administration, Xinis also said Abrego Garcia was removed from the U.S. \"without lawful authority.\" \"You’ve conceded it. There’s witness testimony,\" she said. Any attempt to revise this \"would be exceptionally difficult.\" \"Respectfully, your honor, he was removed lawfully,\" Guynn replied. \"No,\" an incredulous Xinis shot back. \"He was removed unlawfully.\" \"His removal from the U.S. was lawful,\" the Justice Department attorney insisted. \"Well no – no it wasn’t,\" Xinis said, visibly stunned. TRUMP'S REMARKS COULD COME BACK TO BITE HIM IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION BATTLE The judge in the case ordered both sides to court Friday, May 16, 2025 to hear from Trump officials seeking to invoke state secrets privileges.(Fox News Digital - Breanne Deppisch) \"Because there's actually the [Immigration and Naturalization Act], which says that if the United States elects to remove someone to a third country, there's a process. Congress has set out that process, the executive has to follow that process.,\" she said. \"So it is not determined yet whether removal to a third country would be appropriate, which is why the Supreme Court ruled the way it did.\" Ultimately, she said, the government will likely have extra time to file additional declarations to allow it to seek the state secrets privilege. Still, she said she \"has to point out\" that the unlawful removal ofAbrego Garciafrom the U.S. \"is a foregone conclusion.\" \"He was removed in error. He was sent to El Salvador when there was a notice of withholding of removal, and so that was not lawful.\" Plaintiffs noted that the government had labeled 1,140 documents related to Abrego Garcia’s case as privileged – but in contrast, they were sent just 164 documents – 132 of which were photocopies of their own court filings and interrogatories sent back to them. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Your Honor, a life is in the balance,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers said, urging the court to move faster. Xinis previously criticized the administration for failing to comply with her court’s requests for information in the case – accusing officials in a blistering eight-page order of submitting \"vague, evasive and incomplete\" responses that she said demonstrated \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\" Breanne Deppisch is a national politics reporter for Fox News Digital covering the Trump administration, with a focus on the Justice Department, FBI, and other national news.",

    "title": "Supreme Court blocks Trump effort to deport Venezuelan migrants under Alien Enemies Act",
    "article_text": "Attorney Mehek Cooke explains why the Trump administration is using the Alien Enemies Act, and why federal judges have a range of opinions on the matter. TheSupreme Courton Friday decided in favor of an appeal by a group of Venezuelan migrants who asked the high court to halt their deportation under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). The decision, similar to others it has made in the past on the matter, revolved around the alleged illegal immigrants not having enough time to reasonably file a challenge to their deportations. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented. PresidentDonald Trumphas been using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to try and speed up the deportation processes of illegal immigrants, but the Supreme Court's Friday ruling presents another blow to those attempts after the court ruled against the Trump administration in their effort to remove men already in immigration custody in a northern region of Texas. SUPREME COURT BLOCKS NEW DEPORTATIONS OF VENEZUELANS IN TEXAS UNDER 18TH CENTURY ALIEN ENEMIES ACT Suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang.(El Salvador Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) \"Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster. But it is not optimal for this Court, far removed from the circumstances on the ground, to determine in the first instance the precise process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case. We remand the case to the Fifth Circuit for that purpose,\" the ruling from the court reads. The court did not rule on Friday on whether theAEA was lawful, but rather sent the matter back to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \"To be clear, we decide today only that the detainees are entitled to more notice than was given on April 18,\" the Supreme Court's ruling said. Last month, the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order barring the government from deporting migrants under the AEA. However, that decision also made clear that anyone the government wants to deport must be given proper notice. A few weeks after that decision, the Court halted deportations of illegal immigrants in Texas that the Trump administration was trying to proceed with under the AEA. ALITO BLASTS 'UNPRECEDENTED' SCOTUS MOVE TO HALT TRUMP'S VENEZUELA DEPORTATIONS: 'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE' Decisions on six emergency appeals dealing with challenges to President Donald Trump's executive actions are forthcoming, including several tied to the Trump administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants.(AP) The Supreme Court's Friday decision to once again halt deportations by the Trump administration comes a day after the High Court's justices heard oral arguments in a case on birthright citizenship, which is also tied to whether federal judges can use their power to block the president's executive actions nationwide. Several lower court federal judges have sought to stop the Trump administration from rapidly deporting illegal immigrants under the AEA. Including thebirthright citizenship case,there are five other pending emergency appeals dealing with challenges to Trump executive actions. Those include cases related to temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezuelan migrants, immigrant parole programs, independent agency member firings, DOGE access to Social Security Administration data and federal workforce-reduction efforts — the last of which was filed on Friday afternoon. A number of Trump administration initiatives are before the Supreme Court on emergency appeals.(Fox News) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after news of the ruling. The president followed up with a subsequent post on the platform, as well. \"The Supreme Court has just ruled that the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally, are not allowed to be forced out without going through a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person, and one that will allow these people to commit many crimes before they even see the inside of a Courthouse,\" he wrote. \"The result of this decision will let more CRIMINALS pour into our Country, doing great harm to our cherished American public. It will also encourage other criminals to illegally enter our Country, wreaking havoc and bedlam wherever they go. The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do. Sleepy Joe Biden allowed MILLIONS of Criminal Aliens to come into our Country without any ‘PROCESS’ but, in order to get them out of our Country, we have to go through a long and extended PROCESS. In any event, thank you to Justice Alito and Justice Thomas for attempting to protect our Country. This is a bad and dangerous day for America!\"",

    "article_text": "The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses the fallout from former FBI director James Comey's social media post and why he is now under investigation for the 'threat.' Ex-FBI Director James Comey had another anti-Trump seashell moment prior tohis Thursday Instagram postthat showed seashells arranged to show the numbers \"86 47,\" a message that White House officials swiftly condemned as an attempt to incite a \"hit\" against the 47th president. Comey posted a photo of a single larger seashell that was painted blue with the words \"Vote Harris\" on it in October 2024. \"Saw this at the beach,\" the ex-FBI chief captioned the post. \"Ariel understands the assignment,\" he added, apparently a reference to the main character of Disney's \"The Little Mermaid.\" Comey's propensity to post images of political messages on the beach has gotten him into some hot water after the Secret Service said it was sending agents to investigate and interview Comey. THE 'DANGER' OF COMEY'S TRUMP POST CANNOT BE UNDERESTIMATED,' TULSI GABBARD WARNS The Secret Service is investigating after ex-FBI Director James Comey posted an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to show the numbers \"86 47,\" a message condemned by some as a coded message for 'a hit' on the president.(Getty Images/Fox News) Shortly after posting the image, Comey took it down and subsequently put up a separate post acknowledging the matter. \"I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,\" Comey said in his subsequent post. \"I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" Former FBI Director James Comey has been unafraid to show his political views since being dismissed in the first Trump administration.(Getty Images/AP/Fox News) The FBI, where Comey used to work before he was fired by Trump during his first term, had no comment on the matter, but it was also apparent that people at the top levels of the agency were aware of the post. Trump's new FBI director,Kash Patel,acknowledged on X that agency personnel were \"aware\" of Comey's post, in his own statement shared on X. TRUMP ADDRESSES COMEY'S '8647' MESSAGE: 'HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANT' \"We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran,\" Patel said. \"Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.\" FBI Director Kash Patel, joined at right by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, answers questions as the Senate Intelligence Committee holds its worldwide threats hearing on Tuesday, March 25.(AP/J. Scott Applewhite) Comey's Thursday Instagram post was roundly criticized, including by the president, for working to stoke political violence. \"There is no doubt thatJames Comeyhated Donald Trump,\" Ted Cruz said. \"There is also no doubt that the extreme rhetoric from the left contributes to an atmosphere of violence.\" \"If a right-winger posted this against a leftist, all hell would break loose. But because it’s James Comey—the man who weaponized the FBI against President Trump—the left is silent,\" Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles said. \"That’s unacceptable. The Left invented the term ‘stochastic terrorism’ to go after conservatives anytime they voiced a strong opinion.\" The ex-FBI chief appears to have a propensity to post his political leanings on social media. AnInstagram post, as recently as March 31, included an animated image stating, \"TRANS PEOPLE BELONG,\" while in February Comey posted \"a message from my former colleagues\" that could be considered to be aimed at Republicans and President Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Know that these people – some evil, most just followers too weak to stand up – will fade, but the need for your work will remain,\" the post said in part. \"Don't let the darkness of bad people steal the joy of public service,\" it added.",

    "article_text": "Fox News' Griff Jenkins provides details on the Arlington County board's decision to further restrict local police from cooperating with ICE officials, removing exceptions for criminal migrants. The County Board of Arlington, Virginia, voted this week to further restrict police cooperation with ICE in a move the state’s attorney general said only benefits\"illegal immigrantsthat have committed some of the most heinous acts, whether it's human trafficking or even acts of terrorism.\" Sections of the Arlington County Trust Policy were removed to eliminate \"instances in which ACPD can initiate contact with ICE regarding immigration enforcement,\" the countysaid on its website. \"Banning local police from alerting ICE, from terrorists, from MS-13 gang members, from human traffickers, that is not compassion. That's actually negligence,\" Arlington Attorney General Jason Miyares told Fox News after the vote. \"I want to be clear, this present policy does absolutely nothing to make Arlington safe. It makes it less safe. The only people that benefit from this are illegal immigrants that have committed some of the most heinous acts, whether it's human trafficking or even acts of terrorism. It does not protect the community, does not protect Arlington, does not protect Virginians.\" GOV. YOUNGKIN PROPOSES WITHHOLDING STATE FUNDING FROM VIRGINIA'S 'SANCTUARY CITIES' Federal immigration authorities make an arrest in Arlington, Va., in February.(ICE) A copy of the old Trust Policy, which the county said was first adopted in July 2022 to ensure residents can interact with the local government without fear of action by federal immigration authorities, outlined the instances in which the Arlington County Police Department could reach out to ICE. It said ACPD could contact federal immigration authorities if someone was an \"undocumented immigrant\" who \"has been identified as a gang member and is wanted or arrested for a violent felony or a criminal street gang offense,\" or if they were \"arrested for a terrorism or human trafficking offense,\" according to a copy of the policyobtained by WJLA. VIRGINIA GOV PROMISES 'FULL COOPERATION' WITH ICE TO DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS However, the updated policy no longer includes that language. \"To be clear, breaking the law is still breaking the law. This decision does not change that, and if a crime is committed, law enforcement will respond,\" Takis Karantonis, the chair of the Arlington County Board, said in a statement. \"The decision to remove Section 7 and related language comes in the wake of the federal administration’s ongoing erosion of the constitutional right to due process, which every person has regardless of their status,\" he added. \"The rhetoric and actions of this administration have led to tremendous stress and fear in our community, and we want to make sure all residents feel safe in engaging with local government, particularly with local law enforcement.\" Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the vote by the Arlington County Board a \"dereliction of duty and a betrayal of the oath they swore to protect their constituents.\"(Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkinhas come out against the vote, writing on X, \"The Arlington County Board’s latest action to prohibit Arlington Police from any cooperation with ICE, even regarding violent MS-13 gang members who are illegally here, is dereliction of duty and a betrayal of the oath they swore to protect their constituents. \"At what point did protecting violent illegal immigrants become more important than protecting your constituents?\" he added. \"The Virginia Homeland Security Task Force has been working in Arlington County, catching and arrestingviolent criminals,including MS-13 gang members. That will continue — unabated — in Arlington and around the Commonwealth.\" Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor said, \"The Democrat Party is fully radicalized against Americans.\" When asked by Fox News Digital Friday for a reaction to the vote, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, \"These sanctuary politicians are playing Russian roulette with American lives. ICE, assisted by the FBI, said it \"apprehended seven illegally present aliens during a routine enforcement operation in Annandale,\" Va., in February, which is located near Arlington County.(ICE) \"While Arlington Country sanctuary politicians work to thwart ICE, DHS will continue arresting criminal illegal aliens and getting them out of our country. Radical sanctuary politicians need to put the safety of the American people first, not criminal illegal aliens. No American wants criminal illegal aliens loose on America’s streets and neither should our leaders who represent them,\" she added. \"We find it extremely troubling that Arlington County leaders made the decision to prioritize politics ahead of public safety,\" ICE acting Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement to Fox News. \"Prohibiting local law enforcement from alerting federal authorities to the presence of an egregious hazard to their community only emboldens criminal offenders while putting people at risk.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The agency has made 17 arrests in Arlington County so far this fiscal year, and three of those arrested were confirmed MS-13 gang members.

I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence,\" Comey said. \"It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told the Associated Press that Comey is now under investigation by the Trump administration. U.S. President Donald Trump fired Comey as FBI director during his first term.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Pfluger and Lee's resolution noted that Comey had made the post while Trump was on a diplomatic visit to the Middle East, which they argue ran the risk of \"jeopardizing the President's security and invigorating our nation's enemies abroad.\" They also pointed out that there had been two known attempts on Trump's life last year during the2024 election– including the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally, where the president was shot in the ear. Lee, notably, was on the House task force investigating the Butler rally shooting. \"Having failed in his attempts to take down President Trump as one of the main architects of the Russia collusion hoax, Comey has now resorted to the unthinkable: calling for violence against our Commander-in-Chief,\" the RSC chairman told Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Republican says Biden started controversial negotiations for backup Air Force One",
    "article_text": "Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani discusses President Donald Trump’s ‘historic’ visit to the Middle Eastern nation and more on ‘Special Report.’ Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., recently claimed that widely-criticized negotiations with Qatar over a $400 millionAir Force One temporary replacementgift began under the Biden administration – not after PresidentDonald Trumptook office. \"What no one is talking about is [that] this same 747 has been in negotiations for a year,\" Mullin said on CNN Wednesday. \"The Biden administration is the one that started these conversations. It didn't start underneath the Trump administration – why? Because we need a back-up for Air Force One.\" Mullin said there is no current backup plane for Air Force One, which is about 40 years old. A recent backup was retired from service due to \"structural issues,\" the senator said. HOUSE DEMOCRAT CALLS FOR 'IMMEDIATE' ETHICS PROBE OF QATARI PLANE GIFT TO TRUMP \"The fact is, this conversation started with Qatar with Biden a year ago,\" he said. Mullin had been privy to a recent conversation with the Qataris when the information about the Biden administration's reported role was gleaned, according to a spokesperson. Mullin said he would give the media \"a pass\" for not knowing about the reported Biden-era negotiations with theDoha government. Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani dismissed the controversy in an interview with Fox News’ \"Special Report,\" noting that his country had originally purchased the plane from \"an American company\"—Boeing. \"I don't see a point out of this [debate],\" al-Thani said, adding it is a \"really unfair accusation that Qatar is trying to buy influence.\" For his part, Trump has pushed back on claims of corrupt intent in potentially accepting the gift from Doha on behalf of the U.S. He rejected allegations from Democrats like Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York, who complained to the Government Accountability office that the deal is a \"flying grift\" and violates the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause prohibiting public officers from accepting presents or titles from royalty or foreign governments. TRUMP TEASES 'VERY, VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT' AHEAD OF MIDDLE EAST TRIP, CARNEY SAYS HE'S 'ON EDGE OF MY SEAT' \"The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"It is a gift from a nation, Qatar, that we have successfully defended for many years. It will be used by our government as a temporary Air Force One, until such time as our new Boeings, which are very late on delivery, arrive.\" Trump also said it would be foolish not to acknowledge the U.S.’ cost savings in the interim. Trump said the plane would be given to the Pentagon, not himself – while Mullin and other defenders argued there was no such kerfuffle when the U.S. accepted the Statue of Liberty as a gift from the French government in the 1870s. In the Mullin interview, CNN host Jake Tapper said Congress had authorized that particular gift. After theSept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, Russian President Vladimir Putin also gave the U.S. a large teardrop-shaped sculpture memorializing the murdered Americans.

The ruling, signed by Judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk of the U.S. District Court for the Northwestern District of Texas, declares that language in the guidance that defines \"sex\" in Title VII as encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity is \"contrary to law.\" The ruling declares the same regarding \"all language defining ‘sexual orientation' and ‘gender identity’ as a protected class.\" \"Sex-based discrimination under Title VII includes employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\" part of the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance on Harassment in the Workplace reads. \"Accordingly, sex-based harassment includes harassment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including how that identity is expressed.\" US JUDGE RULES THAT BIDEN TEAM'S LGBTQ PROPOSAL WRONGLY INTERPRETED OBAMACARE PROVISION Left: President Joe Biden at the presidential inauguration in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Jan. 20, 2025; Right: A Pride flag is displayed during a Pride celebration on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 10, 2023.(Left: Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Right: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) The guidance notes that, \"The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law, are not meant to bind the public in any way, and do not obviate the need for the EEOC and its staff to consider the facts of each case and applicable legal principles when exercising their enforcement discretion.\" The ruling comes in a legal challenge lodged by the Heritage Foundation — a conservative D.C. think tank — and the state ofTexas. \"The Biden EEOC tried to compel businesses – and the American people – to deny basic biological truth,\" Dr. Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action for America, said in astatement, noting that \"thanks to the great state of Texas and the work of my Heritage colleagues, a federal judge said: not so fast.

On Inauguration Day earlier this year, PresidentDonald Trumpissued an executive order declaring it U.S. policy \"to recognize two sexes, male and female.\" That order called for rescinding guidance documents, or portions of documents, that clash with the order.

    "title": "Trump appointee Barrett challenges administration on nationwide injunctions, surprises and delights liberals",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream and ‘The Story’ panel discuss the Supreme Court hearing on birthright citizenship and judicial power. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett sparred with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer Thursday, pressing him on whether the Trump administration would follow federal court precedent. The exchange quickly became one of the day’s most talked-about moments and could reignite criticism of Barrett from Trump allies. The back-and-forth took place Thursday during oral arguments in a case related to PresidentDonald Trump'seffort to end birthright citizenship with a specific focus on whether lower courts should be able to block executive actions from taking effect nationwide. Justice Barrett, a Trump appointee, grilled Sauer about the administration's stance toward lower court rulings, which followed similar lines of inquiry from her colleagues on the bench. \"I want to ask you about a potential tension,\" she began, before stopping to correct herself. \"Well, no, not a potential tension, an actual tension that I see in answers that you gave to Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kagan.\" JUSTICE KAGAN SNAPS AT TRUMP LAWYER IN MAJOR CASE: 'EVERY COURT HAS RULED AGAINST YOU' President Donald Trump, alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, left, and Secretary of Commerce nominee Howard Lutnick, right, speaks to reporters as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund in the Oval Office of the White House Feb. 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) Barrett then asked Sauer if the Trump administration \"wanted to reserve its right to maybe not follow a Second Circuit precedent, say, in New York, because you might disagree with its opinion?\" \"You resisted Justice Kagan when she asked you whether the government would obey\" such a precedent, she said. Sauer responded, \"Our general practice is to respect those precedents. But there are circumstances when it is not a categorical practice, and that is not …\" Barrett interrupted, asking if that is the Trump administration’s practice or \"the long-standing practice of the federal government?\" Sauer replied that it is \"the long-standing policy of the Department of Justice.\" \"Really?\" she asked. SUPREME COURT TAKES ON BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP: JUSTICES SEEMINGLY SPLIT ON LOWER COURT POWERS \"Yes, as it was phrased to me, we generally respect circuit precedent, but not necessarily in every case,\" Sauer said. \"Some examples might be a situation where we are litigating to get that circuit precedent overruled and so on,\" he added later. \"That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about this week,\" Barrett stressed, pointing to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling that Trump's birthright citizenship order is unconstitutional. \"And what do you do the next day, or the next week?\" she asked. \"Generally, we follow this,\" Sauer said, which provoked a somewhat incredulous response from the justice. \"So, you're still saying generally?\" she asked him. \"And you still think that it's generally the long-standing policy of the federal government to take that approach?\" Protesters demonstrating against President Donald Trump's during the early months of his second presidential term, and President Donald Trump signing an executive order at the White House. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Thursday, May 15, on a case involving Trump's birthright citizenship executive orders.(Getty Images) The remarks sparked divided political reactions on social media, with Democratic strategistMax Burns noting, \"Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer tells Justice Amy Coney Barrett that Trump 'generally' tries to respect federal court decisions but he has the 'right' to disregard legal opinions he personally disagrees with. Coney Barrett seems to be in disbelief.\" \"John Sauer just said the quiet part out loud: unless the Supreme Court tells them directly, Trump’s team might ignore lower court rulings,\"said Seth Taylor, a 2024 DNC delegate. \"That’s not governance – that’s constitutional brinksmanship.\" \"Amy Coney Barrett (ACB) is proving once again she may the the worst SCOTUS pick ever by a Republican,\" conservative commentator and podcast host Cash Loren said on social media. \"She has a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. … Yet you can hear her disdain for the Trump administration.\" 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT Demonstrators hold up signs during a protest against President Donald Trump at the Washington Monument in Washington April 5, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Earlier this year, Barrett sided with three of the Supreme Court's liberal justices and Chief Justice John Roberts in rejecting, 5-4, the Trump administration's request toblock billions in USAID moneyfor previously completed projects. The decision sparkedfierce criticism from Trump supporters, who have attempted to label Justice Barrett an \"activist\" justice and someone who has been insufficiently loyal to the president who tapped her for the high court. Others have pointed out her track record as a reliably conservative voter and the fact the court has lifetime appointments to allow justices to ostensibly act without undue political interference. Trump later said he had no knowledge of the attacks against her, telling reporters, \"She’s a very good woman.\" \"She’s very smart, and I don’t know about people attacking her. I really don’t know.\" Trump added. The court ruling could come in a matter of days or weeks. But it will likely hinge closely on the votes of two Trump appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Barrett, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Fox News Friday. Overall, he said of the hearing, \"it got pretty sporty in there.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"There were some lively moments, at least lively for the Supreme Court,\" he said, before noting the justices to watch are Gorsuch and Barrett. \"Justice Barrett is probably the greatest concern right now for the Trump administration,\" Turley said.

    "article_text": "Senate Judiciary Committee member John Kennedy, R-La., talks to Fox News Digital about his recent op-ed, and his view on why nationwide injunctions sully the role of the judiciary. With theSupreme Court hearing its first case Thursdayrelating to nationwide injunctions – federal district court judges issuing rulings that affect the entire country – several proponents of a plan to end the practice are speaking out. Senate Judiciary Committee member John Kennedy, R-La., said it appears to be a case of the \"tail wag[ging] the dog,\" in that it is the judiciary’s job to adjudicate the law, not create it. \"When Congress makes a law, the federal judges are supposed to follow it. When the president exercises his power under Article II, judges are supposed to follow it, so long as it's lawful,\" Kennedy said. \"They can't just overturn it because they don't agree with it, and that's what a lot of these federal judges are doing.\" SEN JOHN KENNEDY: WHY SCOTUS SHOULD SEIZE OPPORTUNITY TO ELIMINATE UNIVERSAL INJUNCTIONS Sens. Tommy Tuberville, left, John Cornyn, center, John Kennedy, right(Getty) In a Fox News Opinion piece this week, Kennedy noted \"universal injunctions\" have been around since the 1960s, when judges began enjoining the government from enforcing certain policies against \"anyone, anywhere\" – adding they let a judge say \"sayonara\" to laws, regulations or even whims of a president they don’t like. Kennedy noted that there have only been 27 such injunctions from JFK through Y2K. A review showed none was lodged against Presidents George H.W. Bush or Bill Clinton – but began to creep in during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. With nearly 100 rulings against PresidentDonald Trumpin his one-and-an-eighth terms, Kennedy said some judges seem to want to \"rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday, to advance some social or economic agenda that they can't get by the voters: But the law is the law.\" \"And a universal injunction was created out of whole cloth. There's no statutory basis for a universal injunction,\" the Louisianan said, echoing the analysis in his op-ed. Given his penchant for often colorful and probing questions of judiciary appointees, Kennedy was also asked how an unfavorable ruling from the Supreme Court could affect nominee choices and further politicize the process. \"All the nominees in front of us are going to be asked about universal injunctions, I can tell you. And if they try to dodge and bob and weave and run like a hound on the treeline, when it's my turn to question them I'm not going to let them. I'm not asking how they would rule in a particular case, but I want to know what they think the legal basis is for a universal injunction, because there is none: I want to hear what they had to say.\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville – who joined Kennedy and others insupporting Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley’sJudicial Relief Clarification Act (JCRA) to end the practice – said such \"woke\" judges should consider retiring their robes. SENATOR WARNS OF ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL OVERREACH’ AHEAD OF SCOTUS SHOWDOWN \"President Trump campaigned on a promise to deport dangerous criminals and won in a landslide. In just four months, he has already delivered the most secure border in American history,\" Tuberville told Fox News Digital. \"Unfortunately, we have radical left judges who are allowing their personal beliefs to supersede the will of 77 million Americans who voted for President Trump and his agenda,\" the former Auburn football legend added. \"If a judge wants to make political decisions, they should run for office. Otherwise, they should focus on upholding the Constitution and enforcing the law.\" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, also said he supports the JCRA, callingnationwide injunctions\"a real problem.\" \"[A] single federal judge can essentially stop a popularly elected president dead in his tracks by a temporary restraining order, which doesn't just deal with the parties in front of the judge, but literally the whole nation.\" \"If the Supreme Court doesn't do it in the context of this birthright citizenship case, then Congress needs to continue to pursue this via Senator Grassley’s bill and other means.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While the case argued Thursday involves an injunction with regard to the interpretation of birthright citizenship in the law, Cornyn said that the court will determine the scope of that particular order, but that the idea of nationwide injunctions is being abused. For his part, Grassley previously told Fox News Digital that such injunctions \"are an unconstitutional abuse of judicial power.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

(Credit: Andrew Roth/The Guardian via Storyful) The Kennedy Center is seeking to revamp its family-focused programming, including through offering more explicitly faith-based content that has often been left off the center's agenda. To kick off the new focus, the Kennedy Center will be holding a free family screening of the new Angel Studios animated movie \"The King of Kings,\" which journeys through the life of Jesus from the viewpoint of a young boy who, throughout the movie, discovers the transformative power of faith. It is the first Jesus-centric show there since 2022. The \"King of Kings\" screening, which will be held on Sunday, June 1, marks a shift to providing morepro-Christian contentat the Kennedy Center. According to the center, the only recent modern production that could be considered \"Christian\" was a 2022 showing of \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" a musical from the early 1970s that some critics (at least initially, such as the late Rev. Billy Graham)considered sacrilegious.

This is family-friendly programming that we will be doing more of in the future.\" The special screening of \"King of Kings\" will mark the center's first Jesus-centric show since \"Jesus Christ Superstar,\" the Kennedy Center indicated.

    "article_text": "‘Fox News Live’ panelists break down President Trump’s visit to the Middle East and his stop at the Abrahamic Family House. PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill\" failed to pass the House Budget Committee on Friday, in what appears to be a massive blow to House GOP leaders' plans to hold a House-wide vote next week. Republican Reps. Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Ralph Norman of South Carolina all voted against the legislation. A fifth House Republican, Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania, also switched his vote from \"yes\" to \"no,\" though it was a procedural maneuver that allows him to bring the legislation up again. Smucker told reporters he was \"quite confident\" in the bill's success. House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, has directed the panel to reconvene on Sunday night at 10 p.m. for another vote. The committee met to mark up and debate the bill, a massive piece of legislation that’s a product of 11 different House committees’ individual efforts to craft policy under their jurisdictions. The result is a wide-ranging bill that advances Trump’s priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, energy, defense and raising the debt limit. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., left, and President Donald Trump.(Getty Images) Emotions ran high in the hallway outside the House Budget Committee’s meeting room from the outset, however, giving the media little indication of how events would transpire. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who had been at home with his wife and newborn baby, surprised reporters when he arrived at the Cannon House Office Building after he was initially expected to miss the committee meeting. His appearance gave House GOP leaders some added wiggle room, allowing the committee to lose two Republican votes and still pass the bill, rather than just one. But at least four House Republicans went into the meeting warning they were opposed to the bill. Shortly before the meeting was expected to begin, Roy, Norman, Clyde and Brecheen abruptly left the room while saying little to reporters on the way out. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Each came back a short while later and criticized the legislation in their opening remarks. The fiscal hawks are frustrated about provisions curbing Medicaid in the bill not going into effect until 2029, and had similar issues with the delay in phasing out green energy subsidies from former PresidentJoe Biden'sInflation Reduction Act. \"Only in Washington are we expected to bet on the come that in five years, then everything will work. Then we will solve the problem,\" Roy said during debate. \"We have got to change the direction of this town. And to my colleagues and other side of the aisle, yes, that means touching Medicaid. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, attends President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4.(Win McNamee/Getty Images) At one point, Norman came out of the room and called for the committee to recess in order to work through thefiscal hawks’ concerns. \"If they call for a vote now, it's not going to end well,\" he said, adding he was still waiting on commitments from House GOP leaders. Minutes later, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., who is not a member of the committee but had been meeting with holdouts, told reporters he wanted the legislation to advance through the Budget panel \"as soon as possible.\" When asked about Norman’s comments, he said, \"I just walked out of the meeting with him a few minutes ago as well. We're working on some questions that Ralph and others have, and we're going to be getting them answers as soon as we get them back from the Trump administration.\" Roy said on X after the vote, \"We were making progress, but the vote was called, and the problems were not resolved, so I voted no. I am staying in Washington this weekend to deliver.\" \"Medicaid Work requirements must start NOW not 2029 & the Green New Scam must be fully repealed, as President Trump called for,\" Roy wrote on X. Earlier, Trump took to Truth Social where he suggested those opposing the bill were \"grandstanders\" and he pressed Republicans to unite behind it. His message appeared to have little effect on the rebels, however — though it's notable Trump is not in Washington, and is currently en route back from a diplomatic trip to the Middle East. House Republicans are working to pass Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party controlling the House, White House, and Senate to pass broad pieces of legislation while completely sidelining the minority party. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., talks with reporters after a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 5.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) It does so by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, provided the legislation deals with spending, taxes or the national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants the legislation to pass the House by Memorial Day, with a goal of syncing up with the Senate and getting a bill to Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That's still possible if Republicans on the House Budget Committee strike an agreement to advance the legislation on Monday. Afterwards, it would head to the House Rules Committee for any potential changes, before a House-wide vote sometime later in the week. ButRepublican senatorshave already indicated they want to see some changes to the bill, meaning the House will need to hash out their differences with their counterparts in the upper chamber before the legislation is finished. The House Freedom Caucus, which the bill's four Budget Committee opponents belong to, has said its members would stay in Washington through the weekend to continue working. \"We are continuing to negotiate. We are not leaving right now. We have been making progress and are continuing to work on the legislation,\" a Freedom Caucus spokeswoman told Fox News Digital.

Zoubair Sangi, the leader of the \"Afghans for Trump\" movement, formed after the chaotic 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, said his community turned to Trump after the Biden administration’s exit left their homeland in turmoil. Now, he is urging the president to reconsider. \"The reality is that Afghanistan is not safe,\" Sangi told Fox News. \"Over the last three years, since the return of the Taliban, the country has been as dangerous as ever.\" He said theDepartment of Homeland Security’sclaim of an \"improved security situation\" fails to reflect the reality on the ground.

Their lives are in grave danger.\" Sangi added that women face especially grim conditions in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where they are banned from education and public life without a male escort. \"They view women as subservient. They treat them worse than cattle,\" he said. \"There is no freedom for ordinary Afghans. It’s a prison. People are essentially under house arrest, and they can’t escape.\" Despite his frustration, Sangi said he has not withdrawn his support for Trump – but he is pleading with him to rethink the decision. \"We do have hope that any kind of mistake that is made specifically in regards to Afghanistan will be corrected.\" He praised Trump for refusing to recognize the Taliban and ending foreign aid to Afghanistan that fell into their hands, and he urged him not to strike any deals. \"The Taliban mock America, reject your demands for the return of our $7 billion in military equipment, and harbor terrorists who threaten our homeland,\" said Sangi. \"Engaging with them isn’t America First.\" AFGHANS FOR TRUMP GROUP LOOKING TO MAKE FOREIGN POLICY — AND 2021 WITHDRAWAL — FRONT AND CENTER IN ELECTION Members and supporters of the Taliban stand on a U.S. flag as they hold a rally to mark the third anniversary of the fall of Kabul, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 14, 2024.(REUTERS/Sayed Hassib) On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security officially ended TPSfor Afghan nationals, potentially forcing more than 9,000 individuals to return to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. DHS SecretaryKristi Noemcited an \"improved security situation\" and a stabilizing economy as justification. \"This administration is returning TPS to its original, temporary intent,\" Noem said. \"We’ve reviewed the conditions in Afghanistan with our interagency partners, and they do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation.\" Afghans’ protected status is set to expire on May 20, with the program formally ending on July 12. Noem added that terminating the designation aligns with the administration’s broader goal of rooting out fraud and national security threats in the immigration system. TPS allows foreign nationals from countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters or other emergencies to live and work legally in the U.S. Then-President Joe Biden had originally designated Afghanistan for TPS following the Taliban’s takeover in 2021. While many Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the two-decade war arrived under the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program, others – including former Afghan government workers and those tied to U.S. missions – entered under TPS amid the post-withdrawal chaos. These individuals now face potential deportation.

The Taliban, he said, \"have made their thirst for retribution against those who help the United States clear. Until they demonstrate substantial behavorial changes, I urge the administration to continue prioritizing the safety of the Afghan men and women who risked their lives to help our troops.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House and DHS with requests for comment.",

    "article_text": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier shares habits and healthy foods that can help reduce the risk of breast cancer on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ A common ingredient in some foods and drinks has been linked to an increased risk ofblood cancers. Taurine — a non-essential amino acid that also occurs naturally in the bone marrow, brain, heart and muscles — was found to promote the growth of leukemia cells, according to a study by Wilmot Cancer Institute investigators at the University of Rochester in New York. The compound is also found in meats, fish and eggs, as well as someenergy drinksand protein powders. BLOOD CANCER AWARENESS: COMMON TYPES, SIGNS AND TREATMENT OPTIONS \"The key takeaway from this study is that taurine can be used by leukemia cells to promotecancer progression,\" Jeevisha Bajaj, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and a member of Wilmot’s Cancer Microenvironment research program, told Fox News Digital. \"Developing new methods to block the cancer cells’ ability to take in taurine may improve outcomes for leukemia patients.\" A common ingredient in some foods and drinks has been linked to an increased risk of blood cancers.(iStock) The scientists made the discovery by happenstance as they were investigating the bone marrow with an eye toward improving treatments forblood cancer, according to a press release from the university. \"Our finding that taurine can be produced by the bone marrow microenvironment was completely unexpected and therefore surprising,\" Bajaj said. \"No one had shown this before, and it added critical information to studies of the bone marrow microenvironment, where blood cancers arise and expand.\" KIDS WHO CONSUME ENERGY DRINKS ARE MORE PRONE TO MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, STUDY FINDS The taurine triggers cancer growth in leukemia cells by promoting a process called glycolysis, which breaks down glucose to produce energy. In particular, taurine fuels certain types of cancer that emerge fromblood stem cellsin the bone marrow, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the release stated. Acute myeloid leukemia AML, a type of blood cancer, starts in the bone marrow, the soft inner parts of bones. Taurine triggers cancer growth in leukemia cells by promoting a process called glycolysis, which breaks down glucose to produce energy.(iStock) The findings were published in the journal Nature. \"We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,\" said Bajaj. TERMINAL COLON CANCER PATIENT SAVED BY BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT \"Our work suggests that developing and testing effective drugs that can impede leukemia cells from using taurine could lead to newtreatment approachesfor these deadly cancers.\" The study did have some limitations, according to the researchers. \"We are very excited about these studies because they demonstrate that targeting uptake by myeloid leukemia cells may be a possible new avenue for treatment of these aggressive diseases,\" said the lead researcher (not pictured).(iStock) \"While we can find that taurine levels are high in the bone marrow of mice with leukemia compared to healthy mice, we do not have any evidence on taurine levels in humans with acute myeloid leukemia,\" Bajah noted. \"This is something we hope to study in the future.\" Looking ahead, the researchers also plan to study how myelodysplastic syndromes lead to acute leukemia. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Based on the findings, the scientists recommend that patients with leukemia speak with their healthcare providers before adding any new supplements or foods rich in taurine to their diet. \"Since taurine is a common ingredient in energy drinks and is often provided as a supplement to mitigate theside effects of chemotherapy, our work suggests that it may be of interest to carefully consider the benefits of supplemental taurine in leukemia patients,\" the researchers concluded in the paper. Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings. \"There is concern that high-powered energy drinks containing too much taurine could fuel leukemia cells,\" a doctor told Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"The study from the University of Rochester determined that leukemia cells in the bone marrow rely on the amino acid taurine that they don’t make themselves,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Future therapies promise to block the uptake of taurine into leukemia cells.\" Further research is needed to determine the exact process for blocking taurine, according to Siegel. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"This is preliminary, but marks an important link betweendiet and cancer.\" The study was primarily funded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, all of which are part of the National Institutes of Health. The American Society of Hematology, the Leukemia Research Foundation and Leukemia & Lymphoma Society also provided support. Some popular energy drinks list taurine as an ingredient. \"There is concern that high-powered energy drinks containing too much taurine could fuel leukemia cells,\" Siegel told Fox News Digital. \"This is preliminary, but marks an important link between diet and cancer.\" \"But at the same time, there is no evidence thatthese drinkscause the conversion of regular bone marrow cells into leukemia cells.\" As the body naturally produces taurine, additional supplementation — especially from energy drinks — is \"often unnecessary,\" according to Dr. Hooman Melamed, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon and sports medicine expert based in Marina Del Rey, California. Further research is needed to determine the exact process for blocking taurine, the experts said.(iStock) \"From aclinical perspective, I always advise patients to give their bodies what they need, but not to overload them with substances they don't,\" Melamed, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Panelists Payton McNabb and Paula Scanlan discuss the political debate over transgender athletes in women’s sports on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ FormerMinnesota Vikingsand University of Minnesota football player Jack Brewer shared a grievance with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. The AG iswaging a legal battleagainst President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice to ensure transgender athletes can continue participating in girls sports in the state. The state's ongoing defiance of Trump's executive order to keep girls sports female has resulted in a controversy involving a transgender pitcher who has dominated a girls softball season. \"Clearly, Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, has never played any major sports,\" Brewer told Fox News Digital. \"It’s like he’s never stepped foot in a real locker room, especially not one where the sport demanded true athleticism, grit and toughness. It’s embarrassing to watch a Black man stand before the nation and promote boys competing against girls.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison departs after speaking on stage during the Democratic National Convention at the United Center Aug. 21, 2024, in Chicago.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The White House has responded to the lawsuit, condemning Ellison for taking legal action to enable trans inclusion. \"Why would a grown man sue the Trump administration to allow other biological males to participate in women’s sports? This is creepy and anti-woman,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital. Brewer played four seasons for the Golden Gophers from 1998-2001, then started his NFL career with the Vikings in 2002. He also raised his children in the state. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE \"The state has veered so far off course that it’s doing the exact opposite of what it once stood for. It used to be a national leader on Title IX and women’s rights. Now, it’s destroying women’s sports, degrading women and promoting situations where men are physically dominating women,\" Brewer said. \"It’s heartbreaking for any former Gopher, any former Viking, any professional athlete who’s lived in that great city. It’s embarrassing. It’s shocking. And, to be honest, it’s just devastating.\" Reports of a trans softball pitcher winning 14 straight games heading into the playoffs and earning first-team All-State honors rocked the state in recent weeks. For Brewer, it is a difficult situation to witness as a Minnesota resident and former pro athlete. \"In any sport — especially something like softball — people can get seriously hurt. A man hits the ball harder. A man throws the ball faster. So, the idea of allowing men to compete in women’s softball — especially now, when that sport has grown in visibility and opportunity — is insane,\" Brewer said. \"Women’s softball is one of the fastest-growing sports in America. If every high school varsity baseball player decided to go play Division I women’s softball, there would be no women left on the field. Anyone who supports that agenda is either ignorant or pushing politics over people. \"And that’s exactly what Keith Ellison is doing. They don’t care about the girls. They care about fundraising and staying in power, and they’re doing it at the expense of young athletes all across America. \"President Trump understands exactly what’s happening. He said it best. If you put a bunch of MLB players on a women’s softball team, they’d win the championship.\" Ellison made the announcement of the lawsuit at a press conference after months of the state defying Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\"executive order. Ellison claimed he received notice from the Department of Justice threatening legal action if the state did not follow the executive order. \"I'm not going to sit around waiting for the Trump administration to sue Minnesota. Today, Minnesota is suing him and his administration because we will not participate in this shameful bullying,\" Ellison said. \"We will not let a small group of vulnerable children who are only trying be healthy and live their lives be demonized.\" President Donald Trump speaks during a FIFA task force meeting in the East Room of the White House May 6, 2025, in Washington.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ellison's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, argues the Trump administration does not have the authority to set states' athletic gender eligibility policies through an executive order. Minnesota is the first state to sue the Department of Justice over threats of funding cuts for allowing trans athletes to play in girls sports and the second state to sue the Trump administration over the issue. Maine filed a lawsuit against Trump after the Department of Agriculture cut funding to the state April 2, and a federal judge has already ruled the USDA must release the funding to Maine. After Trump's executive order, the Minnesota State High School Leagueannounced itwould defy federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports. Ellison's office said \"based on the plain language of the statute, educational institutions and theMinnesota State High School Leaguewould violate the MHRA by prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in extracurricular activities consistent with their gender identity.\" Vikings defensive back Jack Brewer, formerly a University of Minnesota defensive back, worked with a group of audience volunteers on kickoff mechanics Oct. 12, 2002.(Getty Images) Minnesota's state legislature failed to pass the Preserving Girls’ Sports Act in early March, which would have stated that \"only female students may participate in an elementary or secondary school level athletic team or sport that an educational institution has restricted to women and girls.\" ANew York Times/Ipsos surveyfound the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, don't think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democratic, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

The leagueannounced a new initiative titled \"No Space for Hate\" this week ahead of the season tip-off. The campaign will include the use of AI social media monitoring tools that will help the league enforce a revised code of conduct. \"As part of the comprehensive plan, the WNBA is rolling out an AI-powered technology solution to monitor social media activity, in partnership with players and teams, to help protect the community from online hate speech and harassment,\" the announcement read. Fox News Digital has reached out to the WNBA for further clarification about how the technology will be used, but has not received a response.

The new policy lists racist, homophobic, sexist, sexual, threatening or libelous content as \"subject to blocking or deletion.\" \"Repeat violations of these guidelines may result in the violator no longer being able to follow our news, comment on our posts or send us messages,\" the policy reads. \"Additionally, any direct threats to players, referees or other league and team personnel may be referred to law enforcement and may result in the violator being banned from all WNBA arenas and events.\" The league is set to put these new practices into place ahead of a season that will see phenom Caitlin Clark take on arch-rival Angel Reese on Saturday for their season-opener. Clark's Indiana Fever will take on Reese's Chicago Sky at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Saturday, renewing the hottest rivalry in women's basketball. The rivalry between Clark and Reese has been a hot bed for intense controversy, often igniting racial debates, dating back to their matchup in the 2023 NCAA championship game. Reese has lambasted Clark's fans as \"racist\" and even alleged they created AI-generated explicit images of the Sky star and sent them to her family members.

But sometimes it's very disrespectful. I think there's a lot of racism when it comes to it,\"Reese saidin the first episode of her podcast in early September. \"Multiple occasions, people have made AI-images of me naked. They have sent it to my family members. My family members are like uncles, sending it to me like, ‘Are you naked on Instagram?’ Clark had also been on the receiving end of racial comments throughout her rookie season in 2024, sometimes by figures in the mainstream media. ESPN's Pat McAfee referred to Clark as a \"white b----\" during an episode of his nationally televised show June 3 and later apologized. McAfee used the term during a discussion about how much popularity Clark was bringing to the league, compared to other players, saying \"I would like the media people that continue to say, ‘This rookie class, this rookie class, this rookie class.’ Nah, just call it for what it is. There’s one White b---- for the Indiana team who is a superstar.\" McAfee later apologized. In May, \"The View\" host Sunny Hostins said during an episode of that show that Clark's popularity was due, in part, to \"White privilege.\" In late September, Clark herself was forced to address allegations that her fans acted \"racist\" toward Connecticut Sun players during the Fever's playoff series last September.

NJTransitengineers began their strike overnight on Friday morning, affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters. While the number of travelers decreases on a typical Friday post-pandemic, there are two huge sporting events inNew Yorkon Friday night that a large chunk of attendees will need to find an alternate route. Friday kicks off the Subway Series between the New York Yankees and Mets in the Bronx, and it is not uncommon for New Jersey residents to take the train to Penn Station.

The Bronx stadium can hold more than 52,000 fans, including standing room, and with the cross-town rivalry, the number of fans will undoubtedly get close to that number. Some brave souls, however, will now have to opt to be a designated driver. However, driving into the Bronx certainly is not the worst option.

Despite the arena only being able to hold roughly one-third of the capacity Yankee Stadium can, MSG sits practically directly above Penn Station, right in the middle of Manhattan, where driving is already a pain. If the Knicks win, it goes without saying that fans will take to the streets to party, just like they have done after most playoff games. Seventh Avenue was shut down after their win against Boston in Game 4. Friday is the last Knicks game at MSG until at least Wednesday, but if Boston wins on Friday and then Game 7 on Monday, the Knicks season is over. However, the Subway Series kicks off a six-game homestand for the Bronx Bombers which stretches until Thursday. Pedestrians cross Eighth Ave. at 34th in Manhattan on Jan. 22, 2020.

    "title": "Travis Hunter gets real on his and Shedeur Sanders' NFL futures: 'We just going to work'",
    "article_text": "Nick Wright believes Travis Hunter has the talent to be the face of the NFL and reacts to his confidence in learning both playbooks, saying the rookie’s two-way potential could be game-changing. For the first time in four years,Travis Hunterand Shedeur Sanders will not be teammates when their football season begins. Hunter, the second overall pick by theJacksonville Jaguars, and Sanders, who waited two more days to hear his name called in the fifth round by the Cleveland Browns, starred together at Jackson State and Colorado during their college days. Now, they are hoping to make an impact for their respective franchises in the NFL. A big spotlight hovers over both players entering their rookie seasons for different reasons. For Hunter, GM James Gladstone has already vocalized the expectation that Hunter will be the generational talent that uplifts the team, as well as the city and game of football, during what he sees as a Hall of Fame career. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Travis Hunter, #12, meets with the media following rookie minicamp at Miller Electric Center.(Travis Register-Imagn Images) In Sanders' case, he will be put in a quarterback battle that includes Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, the Oregon product who was drafted two rounds before him last month. Hunter said he has spoken to Sanders since his slide down theNFL Draftboard, and he knows his former teammate and great friend is ready to do the exact same thing he will to start his NFL journey. ESPN STAR FIRES BACK AT CRITICISM OVER CAM WARD NFL DRAFT COVERAGE \"We just going to work, man,\" Hunter said while discussing his excitement to partner with Panini America, who will be giving him his first rookie trading card at the NFLPA Rookie Premiere in Los Angeles. \"We both got our heads down, and doing what we have to do. There’s a lot of doubters out there for him, and he’s going to go to work. I’m going to go to work and just going to do what we’ve always been doing.\" While the football world has been looking closely at how Sanders and Gabriel were competing in rookie minicamp, Hunter has exceeded the expectations the Jaguars had for him already. Tony Boselli, the Jaguars' executive vice president of Football Operations,told NFL Networkthat, while he understands Hunter is not even running in pads yet, the team has been taken back by watching him up close with his new teammates. Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Travis Hunter, #12, makes a reception during the NFL football team's rookie minicamp on Saturday, May 10, 2025 in Jacksonville, Florida.(AP Photo/John Raoux) \"We had high expectations. He's exceeded my expectations,\" Boselli said. \"You see the athlete on the field, you see how he moves, the change in direction, the body control, but it's the person that I'm most enamored with.\" As Hunter gets acclimated to his life in the NFL, he is also very aware of the leadership aspect of being a top pick. The Jaguars already have players like Trevor Lawrence, Travon Walker and Josh Hines-Allen as the veteran presence in the locker room, but Hunter knows he can be added to the mix as long as he does his job first. The same goes for Sanders with the Browns. \"We definitely got to be leaders, especially me,\" Hunter explained. \"I was the number two overall pick, so I gotta come in and be a leader. Shedeur, he’s gotta go in there and work, earn his job just like me. But he’s also got to go in there and be the head of the offense, so he’s gotta go in there and be a leader.\" Hunter said his time with the Jaguars has been \"great\" thus far, and it will only continue as OTAs will ultimately lead into training camp this summer. ONE OF ONE As Hunter continues to put in the work, he is also excited for an important milestone in his early career – seeing himself on an NFL trading card for the first time. Hunter partnered with Panini America, along with several other incoming rookies, where they will receive their first Panini NFL trading cards at the NFLPA Rookie Premiere.

One day, Hunter's rookie card could be worth quite the pretty penny.

    "article_text": "Jamal Murrayfought through an illness to score 25 points and power theDenver Nuggetspast theThunder119-107 on Thursday night, sending the series back to Oklahoma City for a decisive Game 7. Sick since Wednesday, Murray was listed as questionable for the game. He ignited the Nuggets with a four-point play to start things off and sank a step-back 3-pointer to start the fourth quarter that pushed Denver's lead to double digits for the first time. Nikola Jokicled Denver with 29 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists, andChristian Braunscored a career playoff-best 23 points to go with 12 rebounds. But it was second-year reserve guardJulian Strawtherwho ignited the Nuggets' runaway, scoring a career playoff-high 15 points, all in the second half. Strawther had a pair of 3s and a layup during a 10-0 third-quarter spurt that helped Denver take a double-digit lead, and he kept going in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets finally had a laugher in this exhaustive, physical series. Game 7 is Sunday, with theMinnesota Timberwolvesawaiting the winner after dispatching Golden State in five games. One negative for Denver:Aaron Gordongrabbed at his left hamstring late in the game and hobbled through the final few minutes. Shai Gilgeous-Alexanderled the Thunder with 32 points, including 18 after halftime despite playing with four fouls since the second quarter. But he didn’t get enough help from his usually reliable teammates to clinch Oklahoma City's first trip to the Western Conference Finals since 2016, when it lost to theWarriorsin seven games. Chet Holmgrenadded 19 points. All-StarJalen Williamsscored six points on 3-of-16 shooting. Although Lu Dort’s buzzer-beating 3-pointer gave the Thunder a 61-58 halftime lead, it was the Nuggets who swaggered through the tunnel after erasing a 12-point deficit with a 12-0 run over the final 2:05 of the first half, a run capped by Braun’s 3-pointer. The Nuggets, who won the title two years ago, finally get two days off after a grueling past few weeks. They have played every other day since April 29. The Thunder have only lost back-to-back games twice this season, once in November and once in early April. Reporting by The Associated Press.

LET'S FIX THAT FRUSTRATING PROBLEM Cloud storage services likeGoogle Drive,DropboxandMicrosoft OneDriveoffer convenient, flexible options for storing large files without consuming your laptop’s limited space. These services allow you to securely store your photos, videos and documents in the cloud, freeing up valuable storage on your device. One significant advantage of cloud storage is accessing files from any device with an internet connection, whether on your phone, tablet or another computer. Most cloud services provide a certain amount of free storage (typically between 2GB and 15GB) before upgrading to a paid plan. For instance,Google Driveoffers 15GB of free storage shared across Google services, whileDropboxprovides 2GB for free with options to upgrade for more space.OneDriveprovides 5GB for free, but Microsoft users can get additional storage through Office 365 subscriptions, granting access to the Microsoft Office suite. Additionally, cloud storage services come with features like automatic syncing and backup, making it easier to organize and safeguard your files. This can be particularly helpful for large photo and video libraries, which can be set to upload automatically from your phone or computer. With features like file versioning and collaboration tools, cloud platforms offer more than just storage  — they enhance productivity and allow seamless file sharing with friends, family or colleagues. Finally, many cloud storage providers offer encryption and other security measures to protect your files for added peace of mind. However, it would be best always to take extra precautions, such as enabling two-factor authentication and using strong, unique passwords, to ensure your data is safe.Kurt’s favorite cloud services can be seen here. After you've freed up space on your PC-whether by deleting old files, moving data to an external drive or leveraging cloud storage, it's just as important to make sure your valuable information stays secure. The following steps will help you protect your files and personal data from cyber threats and accidental loss. 1. Use strong passwords:Create unique, complex passwords for all your accounts and devices. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store secure passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. 2. Enable encryption:Encryptyour external hard drives and cloud storage accounts to add an extra layer of protection to your data. 3. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts that offer this feature, especially for cloud storage services. 4.Install and maintain strong antivirus software: Use a strong antivirus program and keep it updated to protect against malware and other security threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 5. Regularly update your operating system and applications: Keep your devices and softwareup to dateto ensure you have the latest security patches. 6. Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information when connected topublic networks, or use a VPN for added security. Using aVPN (Virtual Private Network) servicecan enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don’t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices 7. Backup your data regularly: Createmultiple backupsof your important files, including at least one offline copy. 8. Use secure file transfer methods: When sharing files, use encrypted transfer methods orpassword-protected links.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: James Comey's shell game proves he is poster boy for elitist TDS",
    "article_text": "Former Joe Manchin communications director Jonathan Knott and former NRSC senior advisor Matt Whitlock discuss the pending federal investigations of a controversial post made by former FBI director James Comey on ‘America Reports.’ Former FBI director, Instagram star, and philosopher poetJames Comeyis back in the news, folks. And that can only mean one thing: He has found a new way to humiliate himself in the name of hating President Donald Trump. This week, the oafish, disgraced lawman decided to share on social media a picture of seashells on a beacharranged to spell out \"86 47.\" Get it? Eighty-six, or cancel, and forty-seven, Trump, the 47th president. Ex-FBI CHIEF COMEY'S ‘86 47’ SOCIAL MEDIA POST CONDEMNED BY WHITE HOUSE AS BID TO PUT ‘HIT’ ON PRESIDENT He captioned the picture with the very chill and nonchalant line, \"Cool shell formation on my beach walk.\" Yeah man, like, right on. Within minutes, people not in the throes of Trump Derangement Syndrome were pointing out that, after two assassination attempts on the president, this looked an awful lot like a threat to kill him, which is technically a crime. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard pulled no punches in the wake of the seaside scandal. \"We've already seen assassination attempts,\"she told Fox News. \"I'm very concerned for his life. And James Comey, in my view, should be held accountable and put behind bars for this.\" Comey’s version of events goes something like this: \"I was strolling along the beach one day, in the very merry month of May, when much to my surprise, what appeared before my eyes, but an anti-Trump shell display.\" In a second Instagram post after deleting the photo, Comey played stupid. \"I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,\" Comey wrote. \"I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.\" This smarmy non-apology is \"sancti-Comeyous\" enough to make your skin crawl. He did nothing wrong, you see. Somehow, Comey knew it wasn't a random four-digit number, and that \"47\" was political. But heck, \"86\" could mean anything! And not fully understanding the message, he nonetheless took a picture of it and called it \"cool\" to millions of people. None of that makes any semblance of sense, especially not for the former head of America's once-hallowed, premier investigative agency. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 30: James Comey speaks onstage during Former FBI Director James Comey In Conversation With MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace at 92NY on May 30, 2023 in New York City.((Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images)) I am willing to believe that Comey has led such a sheltered existence that he’s never heard a short-order cook yell, \"86 the corned beef hash,\" but how can someone whose entire career was spent in law enforcement not know that \"86\" can also mean rubbing somebody out? And by the way, where is this beach, because just a few months ago in October, Comey, ever the avant-garde artist, posted a photo of a blue seashell with the words, \"vote Harris,\" painted on it. Is this some beach where people go to make left-wing political crafts all day? I would really like to know where this beach is so I can make sure I don't accidentally go there. If you’ll pardon the phrase, the whole thing is a little fishy. Can I prove Comey or a friend of his made this stupendously stupid seashell stonehenge that threatens Trump at least with being canceled, perhaps with far worse? No, but it doesn’t seem implausible, especially given that it's part of a set. Either way, this is a man who was once the most powerful law enforcement officer in the United States who has been reduced to posting like a teenage girl who just discovered Sylvia Plath, and what is so sad and troubling about it is that Comey has made Trump his entire identity. For years, Comey’s whole social media feed has been: \"Here I am at the beach thinking about Trump, here I am in the forest thinking about Trump, now I am by the lake, and I am thinking about Trump.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION But it isn’t just Trump that Comey is obsessed with, it's also himself, and this is where his bizarre behavior is a symptom of a more widespread disease. He sees himself as the selfless soldier, hero in the history books who stood up to fascism and blah, blah, blah. Those of us who have been paying attention know him as a liar who helped cook up the Russian collusion hoax that tied President Trump's first term up in knots for three years at a cost to taxpayers of $30 million. On Monday, James Comey will be on the Upper East Side of New York on a book tour, signing copies of his new thriller, \"FDR Drive.\" Not that I would ever suggest that has anything to do with this great man of principles’ attention-grabbing antics, but it might afford him a chance to explain himself. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Everyone at the Barnes & Noble that night will likely hate Trump just as much as Comey does. Many will take pleasure in the \"86 47\" post, whether it was meant as a threat or not. Will Comey be contrite over his ill-advised post, or will he just wink and sign books? If Comey could look the Trump haters in the eye and say, \"You know what? I went too far this week and I learned a lesson,\" then it could do a lot of good. But don't hold your breath. The next time Comey admits he was at fault for anything involving Trump will be the first.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: As Springsteen and De Niro trash America abroad, Kennedy Center thrives",
    "article_text": "Kid Rock hits back at Bruce Springsteen for calling out President Donald Trump during a concert and more on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ This week, whileBruce SpringsteenandRobert De Nirowere abroad trashing President Donald Trump in front of wealthy Europeans, everyday Americans were flocking to the Kennedy Center to enjoy fine art. It is quite a split screen to consider and, in the end, The Boss and old droopy eyes Bobby come across as looking nothing short of ridiculous. Let’s start with Springsteen, who kicked off his tour in Manchester on Wednesday night with the message for Brits. DOLLY PARTON SYMPHONY CONCERT HEADS TO DC'S KENNEDY CENTER IN EVENT ‘NO ONE WILL WANT TO MISS’ \"My home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,\" he said. Later in the show, during which presumably he also played some music, Springsteen called Trump incompetent and an authoritarian. It seems Bruce wasn't born to run, he was born to whine. Bruce Springsteen had harsh words for President Trump during a recent concert. (Photo by Debra L Rothenberg/WireImage)( Debra L Rothenberg/WireImage) Across the English Channel, which is not yet the Channel of America, De Niro was at the Cannes Film Festival receiving a lifetime achievement award, because the only thing actors do better than wearing makeup and saying things they didn't write is giving each other awards for it. Of course, De Niro could not resist providing plenty of raging bull about Trump. \"[Artists] are a threat to autocrats and fascists,\" he said. \"America’s Philistine president has had himself appointed head of one of our premier cultural institutions (the Kennedy Center). He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education.\" This last statement about the Kennedy Center drew a strong rebuke from its controversial new president,Richard Grenell. \"He’s lying,\"Grenell wrote on X. \"President Trump hasn’t cut funding for the Kennedy Center. There are a few honest reporters already reporting the massive funding INCREASE request from President Trump for the Kennedy Center. It is De Niro’s political party that is canceling shows and booing people they don’t agree with politically. We haven’t canceled shows.\" Robert De Niro blasted the Trump administration during his visit to Cannes.(Barry Brecheisen) The fact of the matter is that Grenell is absolutely right about this. It is actors from a production of \"Les Misérables\" who are refusing to perform for Trump next month, not Trump refusing to watch them. It was the producers of \"Hamilton\" who decided to cancel their Kennedy Center run, not Trump administration officials in arm bands censoring art. In fact, I don’t know if \"Hamilton\" composer Lin Manuel Miranda knows this or not, but these days it is conservatives who are far more likely to cherish his patriotic musical. Many on the left now accuse him of whitewashing America’s supposed horrible history. For the first time in decades, we have leadership at the Kennedy Center that is worried about what the audience, otherwise known as the people, want, not with indoctrinating Americans into progressive ideologies with shows nobody wants to see anyway. As it turns out, I found myself at the Kennedy Center on Thursday night to catch the National Symphony’s performance of Beethoven’s \"Missa Solemnis.\" After all, a columnist can’t survive on dive bars and Midwest diners alone. I know this will come as a deep shock to Springsteen and De Niro, but for the life of me, I could not find the fascism or autocracy. Instead, I found Americans of all ages and walks of life sitting stunned as a piece of music that has enthralled audiences for 200 years unfolded under the direction of legendary Maestro Gianandrea Noseda. It was a packed house on a Thursday night. You could see young people grabbing $10 rush tickets like I did as a student to see the Philadelphia Orchestra decades ago. Try getting into a Springsteen concert for 10 bucks. While the Boss and Bobby were being feted by Euro elites, they were still playing out their sad boomer protest fantasies born under a haze of weed smoke in 1968. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Back in April, the Kennedy Center smashed its attendance record when 11,000 attended a cheesy performance that combined art, science and drones. It is exactly the kind of programming that gives this jewel of the arts back to the people. For the first time in decades, we have leadership at the Kennedy Center that is worried about what the audience, otherwise known as the people, want, not with indoctrinating Americans into progressive ideologies with shows nobody wants to see anyway. Maybe Springsteen and De Niro should just stay in Europe and move in near Rosie O’Donnell and Eva Longoria, who already left after Trump’s election. They all think America is awful and they can all get cheering crowds overseas for trashing the red, white and blue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Here in the United States, we are not going to miss the talents of these naysayers, because we have a wealth of brilliant artists who want to share their gifts with everyone, Republican or Democrat, who know that at its best, art unites, it does not divide. So, if you find yourself in Washington, swing by the Kennedy Center and check it out. Or, wherever it is that you live, find the artists who want to speak to your soul, not to your politics. Because at long last, we are finally, once again, making space for that ancient pursuit.

    "title": "Biden's border legacy: A financial burden that will last for years",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Sean Hannity unpacks border security under the Trump administration on 'Hannity.' We’ve all been there: you go out with friends, have a great time… then they leave you stuck with the bill. After four years of reckless, ruinous and arguably illegalBiden administration policies, America will be stuck with a massive border bar tab for years to come. PresidentDonald Trumpis busy keeping his promises to secure the border, remove aliens in accordance with the law, and hold noncitizen visitors and students accountable for the promises they made when getting visas to respect our country and its rules. He’s been sued at every step by illegal aliens and their left-wing advocates. Lower-levelfederal judges– usually, but not always appointed by Democratic presidents and working in Democratic-dominated states – are ordering nationwide injunctions as a default, in cases filed on the flimsiest of legal pretexts. President Joe Biden walks off after speaking about an executive order on asylum for migrants in the East Room at the White House, June 4, 2024.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) According to former Attorney General Bill Barr, federal courts issued a total of 27 nationwide injunctions in the entire 20th century, but they’ve issued 79 against Trump alone this century. TRUMP TARGETS NORTHERN BORDER SECURITY AS CANADA'S 'OPEN BORDER' POLICIES CREATE NEW THREATS As Trump tries to enforce the law, the full scope of Biden’s border bar tab is coming to light. New York’s Roosevelt Hotelis a formerly grand Manhattan edifice that contributed to the city’s lucrative tourist trade. Biden’s policies of paroling inadmissible aliens and mass releasing them at the border brought millions who went to welcoming \"sanctuaries\" like New York. The city not only offered free housing and other benefits to illegal and quasi-legal aliens but also rarely prosecuted them for any petty crimes they committed. Mayor Eric Adams scrambled to lease hotels and other buildings, spending around $4 billion tax dollars a year in migrant support. The Roosevelt was just one of more than 200 make-shift shelters operating at the height of the crisis. TRUMP HAS A SECRET WEAPON TO DEFEAT ACTIVIST JUDGES ON IMMIGRATION Since January 2025 – contrary to what theBiden teamhad been saying for four years – the Trump administration was able to reduce illegal entry at the border by more than 90%, end illegal parole programs, resume internal enforcement, and cut off federal funding of NGOs that facilitate mass migration. New York began closing its temporary shelters. The Roosevelt is due to close as a shelter in June, but as of mid-May, there are still about 2,000 \"migrants\" there. The hotel is owned by the government of Pakistan, whose finances are in even more dire straits than ours, and which is preoccupied by resurgent conflict with India. After a couple years of occupation by indigents from around the world, most of them unused to Western habits, the Roosevelt will need complete refurbishment before it can re-open to tourists. According to one estimate, that can cost $50,000-$90,000 per room. With over 1,000 rooms, that means over $90 million for the Roosevelt alone, not counting the common areas. That’s just one of the city’s rented shelters. Who is going to pay to repair them all? New York taxpayers. DEMOCRATS' BIZARRE AFFECTION FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS Shelter costs are only part of Biden’s border bar tab. Half a millionunaccompanied alien childrenwere let in. All should be attending school unless they are working illegally or being exploited by the supposed \"sponsors\" to whom Biden’s Health and Human Services handed them. That means public school, and you’re paying for it. Half a million kids at $18,000 a year, the national average, is $9 billion a year, of which states will pay more than 90%. The healthcare costs for absorbing millions more indigents into Medicaid and Medicare are yet to be known. But given that the average alien let in under Biden is significantly less educated and skilled than the average American, expect the worst. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Lower-skilled, lower-paid workers are more likely to be enrolled in government subsidized health insurance programs. In 2024, average health care spending per person was more than $13,000. Assuming that only one in five illegal immigrants let in under Biden relies on government or charity healthcare, that’s $26 billion a year. Then there’s crime. Among the millions of economic migrants Biden let in were many thousands of career criminals and gang members. Among the thousands housed at the Roosevelt Hotel were some pimps, thieves and gang-bangers. The Venezuelan gangTren de Araguaran crews from there who mugged, stabbed and shot other migrants or local New Yorkers. They looted stores and assaulted cops. New York City spent $9.2 billion on criminal justice in 2020, and you can bet it has gone up since then. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Progressives\" will say the answer is to stop prosecuting offenders, but in recent years that recipe has only resulted inmore dangerous streetsand unhealthy living across our major cities. Belatedly, Democrats are electing candidates to office who enforce criminal law. This is good, but it will cost more money in police, prosecutors, judges and jails. Biden’s border bar tab is still racking up, as all these costs will continue until one of two things happens: an alien is removed, or he wins the legal right to remain and then pays more in taxes than he and his family consume in benefits. Both will take time, if they happen at all.

    "title": "Trump takes well-earned victory lap for Middle East peace triumphs",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down President Donald Trump's deals and actions in Saudi Arabia on 'Special Report.' Eight years ago, during the first few days of PresidentDonald Trump’sfirst term, I joined his other senior advisers in the White House Situation Room to discuss our approach to Saudia Arabia, which was then in the midst of an internal power struggle. Should we work with the older generation of Saudi leaders, with whom the U.S. has done business with for decades? Or would we take a chance on the younger generation, who were untested, but are committed to massive social and economic change. Jared Kushner made the case for the new leaders, especially Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Kushner argued they would take Saudi Arabia in a different direction -- away from the religiously and socially conservative, insular, extremist-tolerant older generation of their grandparents – and build a modern, tolerant and open society, with rights for women. They wanted to diversify the Saudi economy beyond its reliance on oil and create a modern nation focused on technology, investment and infrastructure. They would stand against Islamic extremism and work with us to destroy terrorist movements. They were open to the idea of peace with Israel as the foundation of a wilder peace in theMiddle East. TRUMP, SPEAKING IN SAUDI ARABIA, SAYS HE WANTS IRAN DEAL, WILL ADD MORE COUNTRIES TO ABRAHAM ACCORDS The choice was Trump’s, and one of his first major foreign policy decisions. He would continue his rock-solid support of Israel, but he took a bet on the younger generation of Sunni Arab leaders. He withdrew from President Barack Obama’s flawednuclear weapons deal with Iran,believing that the road to Middle East peace went through Riyadh and Israel, not Tehran. U.S. President Donald J. Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attend a signing ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.(Getty Images) This week’s trip toSaudi Arabia,Qatar and the UAE was Trump’s victory lap. His big bet in 2017 paid off. He could say with great pride, \"Before our eyes, a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past, and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos; where it exports technology, not terrorism; and where people of different nations, religions, and creeds are building cities together — not bombing each other out of existence.\" The Gulf Arab nations, led by Saudi Arabia, have accomplished extraordinary things in the last eight years, despite the cold shoulder given them during the Biden administration. They were crucial in destroying ISIS and other Islamist extremist movements. They played a major behind-the-scenes role in theAbraham Accordsbetween Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and then Morocco. While not yet a formal signatory to the Abraham Accords, Saudi Arabia is well on its way. FORMER BIDEN OFFICIALS OFFER RARE PRAISE FOR TRUMP'S BOLD MIDDLE EAST MOVES The Saudis, along with the other Gulf Arab leaders, have now urged Trump to open a dialogue with thenew leaders of Syria.He has taken another bet on peace during this trip, and is dropping crippling sanctions on Syria, to give them a \"chance at greatness.\" If Trump is right, Syria will no longer be a scourge of the region it has been for decades; using chemical weapons on its own people, hosting extremist groups bent on spreading death and destruction, and welcoming in Russian influence. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Perhaps most important of all, Trump has put a stake in the heart of American interventionist foreign policy pursued by both political parties for the last 20 years. We will no longerfight forever warsin the Middle East in a futile attempt to force them into the American mold. We will no longer give nations \"lectures on how to live or how to govern their own affairs.\" As Trump said in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly in 2017, \"We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation… TRUMP CONDEMNS 'INTERVENTIONALISTS,' PITCHES 'MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE' IN MIDDLE EAST SPEECH \"In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Our policy is Peace through Strength – which encompasses all forms of our strength, not just our military strength.

    "title": "President Donald Trump and the judiciary's conflicts are coming to a head",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on the legal challenges facing the Trump administration on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’ The more aggressive elements of President Trump’s immigration agenda have run into resistance from federal district judges. These courts question the administration’s expedited deportations of illegal Venezuelan migrants with minimal, or no, due process. But a more fundamental constitutional question lies beneath the struggle over immigration. Federal judges that block the deportations risk interference with the executive branch’s constitutional authority over foreign relations and national security. At the same time, if the White House presses his claims of unilateral power too far, it jeopardizes the deference that the judiciary has long offered presidents in their management of national security. The president and the judiciary are coming to a head because of decisions by two separate federal district judges last week. On May 1, Judge Fernando Rodriguez of Texas held that Trump could not claim power under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to remove members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang (TdA) to El Salvador. On May 6, Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Colorado agreed and also enjoined the executive branch from any further deportation of Venezuelans without a hearing before a judge. While only temporary orders, no federal courts have ever before overruled the decision of a president or congress that the United States has suffered an attack or invasion. Part of the blame for this executive-judicial conflict also rests with the Trump administration’s unprecedented use of the Alien Enemies Act. The act authorizes the president to detain and expel aliens of \"a hostile nation or government\" with which the United States is in a \"declared war\" or by which it has suffered an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The United States had only used the act during the declared War of 1812 and World Wars I and II. VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT USES TREN DE ARAGUA AS PROXIES TO UNDERMINE US PUBLIC SAFETY, FBI ASSESSMENT FINDS But on March 15, President Trump sent TdA members to El Salvador under his authority under the Act. He proclaimed that the gang was conducting an invasion or predatory incursion through \"irregular warfare\" such as \"drug trafficking\" and \"mass illegal migration\" into the United States. Trump claimed that TdA is \"closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated,\" the Venezuelan government, so as to meet the Act’s requirement of an invasion by a \"hostile nation or government.\" The White House made the extraordinary claim that a gang has risen to the level of a foreign government that is conducting an invasion or predatory incursion into the United States. Regardless of the challenge of showing this to be true factually, district judges have made the mistake of concluding this is a question for the courts to resolve. On some important questions, the Constitution reserves judgment to the elected branches of government alone. As Chief Justice John Marshall conceded in Marbury v. Madison, which first announced the power of judicial review, \"the President is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion.\" For his decisions, \"he is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience.\" His decision cannot be questioned in court because \"the subjects are political.\" These issues \"respect the nation, not individual rights, and being entrusted to the executive, the decision of the executive is conclusive.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION War raises exactly the sort of \"political questions,\" as the Supreme Court has come to describe them, that fall outside judicial competence. The Constitution vests the president with the executive power and makes him commander in chief of the armed forces. Congress has the power to raise and fund the armed forces and to declare war. The courts have no power to direct the elected branches in their exercise of these authorities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Federal courts have never questioned the decisions of the elected branches over whether a war or invasion has occurred. In the Prize Cases, for example, the Supreme Court would not second-guess President Abraham Lincoln’s awesome decision to wage war to stop secession. \"Whether the President in fulfilling his duties as Commander in Chief\" was justified in launching military operations against the South, the Court declared, was \"to be decided by him.\" The Court could declare that it must reserve to the President the decisions on the force to be used to \"the political department of the Government to which this power was entrusted.\" Following this precedent, federal judge rejected lawsuits seeking a halt to the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Afghanistan, or Iraq. But in the Texas and Colorado cases, federal judges have overturned the judiciary’s deference on war. They rejected President Trump’s claim that Venezuela had launched an invasion of the United States using TdA as an arm of its military. The federal appeals courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, must review these decisions as soon as possible. They must recognize that trial judges lack the competence to review the sensitive information and judgments necessary to make the more dire national security decisions. Courts excel at resolving cases or controversies with formal rules of pleading, evidence, and deliberation. They are ill-equipped to judge the probabilities and risks that govern the world of national security.

    "title": "How to thwart China and end European freeloading on Americans",
    "article_text": "The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses the latest on the Trump administration's trade deal with China as the president warns negotiations with the European Union will be 'nastier.' Europe is trying to pushAmerican companiesout of the European market by assaulting the U.S. with discriminatory taxes and regulations. It’s time to put a stop to their freeloading. Europe’s reckless actions embolden America’s rivals likeChinaand Russia. European bureaucrats have imposed anti-free speech regulations such as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the anti-American Digital Markets Act (DMA) as blunt instruments against U.S. workers and businesses. This results in millions of dollars in fines and taxes fueling the EU welfare state at the expense of America. The EU is biting the hand that feeds its digital economy while pretending to champion fairness. This hypocrisy must end. Europe must pivottoward collaboration with the U.S., not confrontation, to counter the long-term threat: Chinese dominance. WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES Europe’s DSA and DMA target American companies. French officials even dubbed these laws the \"GAFA tax\" as a direct critique of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. These laws impose stringent rules and hefty fines that purposefully clobber U.S. companies. While European bureaucrats claim neutrality, the bias is obvious. American firms get hit while European firms conveniently escape scrutiny. This is not regulation; it’s non-tariff protectionism disguised as principle. Europe benefits from U.S.-built platforms, including cloud services, AI models and digital infrastructure, while punishing the innovators who created them. THE EU WANTS TO CONTROL AMERICAN BUSINESSES. THIS NEW BILL MIGHT BE THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP IT Over 80% ofEurope’s digital technologiesare imported, primarily from the U.S., yet the EU seems determined to penalize the very partners fueling its digital economy. The DSA’s vague content moderation rules empower unelected bureaucrats to censor online discourse, chilling expression under the guise of combating \"harmful\" content. The Trump administration is right: At the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks alienating American innovators and undermining shared democratic values. By imposing speech controls that clash withU.S. free expression principles, Europe not only creates a rift between allies but also plays into the hands of authoritarian regimes. VANCE IS RIGHT ABOUT FREE SPEECH. THAT’S WHAT MAKES EU AND US LEFTISTS SO MAD Europe’s pursuit of \"digital sovereignty\" through initiatives called \"Gaia-X\" and \"EuroStack\" highlights its freeloading on American innovation. Gaia-X, a French-German government attempt to establish a European cloud ecosystem, has failed to match U.S. companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. EuroStack is an even costlier EU government project. It seeks to build a comprehensive European digital infrastructure, including chips and AI. It is backed by over 300 billion euros in public subsidies. EU bureaucrats rely heavily on taxpayer-funded investments to replicate what American companies achieve through private initiative. This is not true sovereignty; it’s subsidizing inefficiency while benefiting from the U.S.’s decades of investment. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION American national security is at stake as China is relentless in its pursuit to become the world’s tech superpower. Beijing is filing moreAI patentsand deploying AI at a scale that surpasses both the U.S. and Europe. Its state-driven model, unburdened by the democratic values Europe claims to uphold, poses a threat to dominating global digital infrastructure. America and Europe must stand united against this threat. A divided West only strengthens Communist China. Europe must abandon its discriminatory freeloading mindset and collaborate with America. A joint U.S.-EU tech agenda could accelerate innovation in AI, quantum computing and defense technologies with the goal of surpassing China’s authoritarian model. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Every euro spent on anti-American regulations or duplicative projects is a euro not invested in countering China’s technological ambitions.Europe’s leadersmust recognize their role in escalating trade tensions and commit to a unified front. Let us innovate together, compete together, and halt China’s march toward economic and technological dominance. The alternative – continued freeloading, fragmentation and discrimination – risks a future where both the U.S. and Europe are sidelined in the global tech race. The choice is ours.

    "title": "Trump targets northern border security as Canada's 'open border' policies create new threats",
    "article_text": "White House deputy chief for policy Stephen Miller breaks down President Donald Trump's foreign policy agenda with Canada after his meeting with its newly-elected prime minister on 'Hannity.' Canada has long been a trusted northern neighbor to the United States. But after a decade of radical progressive rule, it is clear thatCanada’s approach to border securityis putting both American and Canadian lives at risk. With the recent election of Prime MinisterMark Carney, it appears Canadians have chosen more of the same: a failed progressive agenda riddled with open-border policies. When PresidentDonald Trumpwon in 2024, he was given a mandate by the American people: secure the border and protect our communities. Under his leadership, southern border encounters have dropped to historic lows, drug seizures have surged, and violent transnational criminal networks have been dismantled. President Donald Trump meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on May 6, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP) President Trump’s decisive actions, like signing the Laken Riley Act to detain and deport criminal illegal immigrants, have restored safety and stability to American communities. TRUMP HAS A SECRET WEAPON TO DEFEAT ACTIVIST JUDGES ON IMMIGRATION But as progress is made along the southern border, we must not take our attention off the growing threats along our northern border. Canada’sopen-border policiesand lax immigration controls have made it a pipeline for criminals and traffickers seeking a new entry point into the U.S. Criminal organizations have created fentanyl and nitazine synthesis labs to bolster the drug trade. Chinese nationals have turned to the north as a way to smuggle illicit products and substances into the United States, and we’ve seen a growing presence ofMexican cartelsoperating fentanyl and nitazine synthesis labs in Canada. The northern border has quickly become a hub for drug smuggling as criminals see Canada’s weak border policies as an opportunity to infiltrate while the southern border becomes more secure. DEMOCRATS' BIZARRE AFFECTION FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS In small American towns near the northern border, additional threats have arrived. Recently in a small border town in Montana, three members of the violent Venezuelan gangTren de Araguawere arrested after being smuggled across the border. These criminals know that President Trump secured our southern border. Now they’re exploiting Canadian negligence and slipping in from the north. Communities that once felt far from the immigration crisis now find themselves on the front lines. As this threat worsens, Canada runs the risk of becoming a haven for organized crime and financial corruption. As global business leaders meet in Ottawa to discuss emerging economic challenges at the recent B7 Summit, it’s important to highlight the irony: this year’s B7 host country has become one of the most easily exploited financial gateways for international criminal organizations. HOW CANADA’S NEW PRIME MINISTER PLANS TO TAKE DOWN AMERICA AND IMPOSE THE GREAT RESET Just last year, Canada-based TD Bank Group was fined after it allowed over $670 million to be laundered through its institutions. The activity was tied to drug trafficking, human smuggling, and even terrorist financing. These weren’t isolated failures… they were systemic. And they were only exposed thanks to U.S. investigators, notCanadian authorities. Had the U.S. not intervened, it is likely these operations would still be running. Under President Trump’s first administration, I saw firsthand how shutting down unlawful border crossings and removing criminal aliens saved lives. We made our country safer, stronger and more secure. Now, the threat is evolving. And so must we. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Canada should be standing shoulder to shoulder with us in defense of liberty, safety and common values. Unfortunately, left to its own political extremism, we will continue to see more of the sameopen-borders policies. We must not let Canada’s weakness at our shared border undermine American strength. President Trump understands this. He knows that restoring America’s security requires vigilance on all of our borders. While the Biden administration turned a blind eye to Canada’s unraveling, President Trump is making northern border security a top priority. He’s not waiting for another crisis to unfold, he’s taking action now. Earlier this year, he announced new action to address the flow of illicit drugs across the northern border. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The choice is clear: continue to strengthen our borders or risk the chaos Canada has embraced. We must support President Trump in securing the northern border, holding Canada accountable, and ensuring thatcriminal organizationscannot exploit our trust or threaten Americans. The safety of our communities and the sovereignty of our nation depend on it.

The facility would reportedly span an astonishing 10 square miles and consume power equivalent to five nuclear reactors, dwarfing any existing AI infrastructure announced by OpenAI or its competitors. (OpenAI has not yet returned TechCrunch’s request for comment, but to put that into perspective, that’s bigger than Monaco.) The UAE project, developed in partnership with G42 — an Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate — is part of OpenAI’s ambitious Stargate project, a joint venture announced in January that could see OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle build massive data centers around the globe stocked with powerful computer chips to support AI development. While OpenAI’s first Stargate campus in the U.S. — already under development in Abilene, Texas — is expected to reach 1.2 gigawatts, this Middle Eastern counterpart would more than quadruple that capacity. The project is emerging amid broader AI ties between the U.S. and UAE that have been years in the making, and have made some lawmakers nervous. OpenAI’s relationship with the UAE dates back to a2023 partnershipwith G42 aimed at driving AI adoption in the Middle East. During a talk earlier that same year in Abu Dhabi, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the UAE, saying it “has been talking about AIsince before it was cool.” As with much of the AI world, these relationships are… complicated. Founded in 2018, G42 is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s national security advisor and younger brother of the country’s ruler. Its embrace by OpenAI raised concerns in late 2023 among U.S. officials, who feared that G42 could enable China’s government togain access to advanced U.S. technology. These concerns focused on G42’s “active relationships” with blacklisted entities, including Huawei and Beijing Genomics Institute, as well as ties to individuals connected to China’s intelligence efforts. Following pressure from U.S. lawmakers, G42’s CEOtold Bloombergin early 2024 that the company was shifting its strategy, saying: “All of our China investments that were previously made are already divested. Because of that, of course, we have no need anymore for any physical China presence.” Soon after, Microsoft — a major shareholder in OpenAI with its own broader interests in the region — announced a$1.5 billion investmentin G42, and its president, Brad Smith, joined G42’s board of directors.

Scheduled for May 20 to 21 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, I/O will showcase product announcements from across Google’s portfolio. Expect plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and — of course — Google’s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini. Earlier this week, Google hosted a separate event dedicated to Android updates:The Android Show. The company announcednew ways to find lost Android phones and other items,additional device-level features for its Advanced Protection program,security tools to protect against scams and theft, anda new design language called Material 3 Expressive. Here’s what else you can expect. AI is the tech du jour, and Google, like its rivals, has been investing heavily in it. A shoo-in for I/O is a new addition (or several) to Google’s flagship Gemini family of AI models.Leaksover the past few weeks suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, Gemini Ultra being Google’s top-of-the-line Gemini offering. With this upgraded Gemini Ultra may come a pricier Gemini subscription. Google offers a single premium tier, Gemini Advanced ($20 per month), to unlock additional capabilities in its Gemini chatbot, which is powered by the company’s Gemini models. But Google may soon launch two new plans,Premium Plus and Premium Pro. It’s not yet clear what benefits might be attached and how these plans might be priced relative to Gemini Advanced. Google will almost certainly talk aboutAstra, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and “agents” for real-time, multimodal understanding. Also probably on the agenda isProject Mariner, Google’s AI “agents” that can navigate and take action across the web on a user’s behalf. Folks on Xspottedreferences to “Computer Use” in the code for Google’s AI Studio developer platform, which could well pertain to Mariner. Going by the official I/O schedule, Google will have plenty to discuss following The Android Show and I/O keynote addresses. The schedule lists sessions dedicated to Chrome and Google Cloud, Google Play (the Android app store), Android development tools, and Gemma, Google’s collection of “open” AI models.

I am not in Maine. I am not in a car. I am at my desk. This isInternet Roadtrip. Internet Roadtrip is what I will call an MMORTG (massive multiplayer online road trip game). Neal Agarwal, the game’s creator, calls it a “road-trip simulator.” Every 10 seconds, viewers vote on what direction for the “car” to drive on Google Street View — or, you can vote to honk the horn or change the radio station. The direction with the most votes gets clicked, and the car continues on its scenic path to … wherever the chat decides to go. Internet Roadtrip is reminiscent of Twitch Plays Pokémon, an iconic stream from over 10 years ago in which viewers voted on what button to press as part of a collective Pokémon Red game. But Internet Roadtrip is far less chaotic — both because only a thousand or so people are playing at a time, and because we have better organizational tools than we did in the Twitch Plays Pokémon era (thank you, Discord). A radio station in Maine (WBOR) is currently curating songs for us in the in-game radio Progress on the virtual roadtrip is slow. The car moves at a pace slower than walking. Discord moderators have had to temper newcomers’ expectations, explaining that it’s pointless to suggest driving to Las Vegas from Maine, since it would likely take almost 10 months of real-world time to get there. The same goes for Alaska, but it’s not just a matter of time that’s the issue. “Google Street View works by taking multiple pictures and putting them together. In some areas of the roads leading to Alaska, there are gaps in pictures available and so we would get stuck there, were we to go to these roads,” the Discord FAQ reads. “All potential roads to Alaska have these gaps. We checked.” There is no objective on Internet Roadtrip, as opposed other Street View-based games likeGeoGuessr. Some Discord members discussed driving to Canada, which is a somewhat realistic goal, given our current position in Maine. But the destination isn’t the goal — it’s the joy of spontaneously listening to a college radio from a liberal arts school with a thousand strangers on the internet, while taking in the scenic backroads of Blue Hill, Maine.

Since Donald Trump took office, more than three dozen employees, allies, and investors of Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have taken roles at federal agencies, helping direct billions in contracts to their companies. Companies owned, founded, or invested in by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey have collected more than a dozen federal contracts totaling about $6 billion since Trump’s inauguration in January, according to aWall Street Journal analysis. And they’re actively pursuing billions more. Those appointments, which are in departments that oversee, regulate, and award business to the four men’s companies, raise a number of red flags. They could violate conflict-of-interest laws or government ethics regulations, both of which prohibit federal employees from using public office for private gain. And while it’s not unusual to install trusted allies in government roles, Musk’s network has moved in at an unprecedented rate and scale. TechCrunch has previously reported on all of thepeople in Musk’s universewho have joined him at DOGE, where he has shuttered federal agencies and slashed workforces in departments that regulate his businesses. At least19 otherswith Silicon Valley connections, be they founders or investors, have also joined DOGE. “The second Trump administration is actually the first in recent years to not impose any sort of additional ethics safeguards on high-level appointees,” Daniel Weiner, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections and Government Program, told TechCrunch. He noted thatTrump firedthe director of the Office of Government Ethics and 17 inspectors general who served as watchdogs for fraud and abuse, immediately after taking office. “It certainly does potentially increase the risk that you have people working on matters that do impact, at least indirectly, their bottom lines,” Weiner said. “But this is a long-term issue in our government that’s not unique to this administration.” Some may argue that it makes sense for employees and associates of Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey to join government agencies. Their insiders are talented individuals who are behind the cutting-edge technology the government genuinely needs, and they understand how to innovate quickly and compete globally. More serious questions arise when favoritism threatens to undermine competition, when policy is created or destroyed to protect market dominance, or when regulations that would serve the public good are waylaid to promote business interests. For instance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently retreated from pursuing rules that would restrict data brokers, despite growing privacy concerns — a shift that stands to benefit companies involved in AI, surveillance, and data analytics. Another example is DOGE’s firing ofstaffers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationwho investigate autonomous vehicle safety, including several probes into Tesla. “One of the defining structural challenges the government of the United States has right now is that we have a system in which the very wealthiest interests have so much power to shape our elections and then turn around and shape government policy,” Weiner said. Another Silicon Valley appointee, Mike Kratsios — a former Thiel employee — is now leading technology policy for the U.S. government. In an April speech, he spoke about throwing away bad regulations that “weigh down our innovators,” particularly those who are innovating in AI. “Many people in Silicon Valley tend to think that whatever worked in Silicon Valley is also going to work for administering the United States government,” Weiner said. “And as we’re seeing now, the danger is a lot of people are going to get hurt because of the assumptions they make.” “The fact that you had a successful startup after five others failed doesn’t necessarily mean you know how to run the Social Security Administration,” he continued. All of the businesses between Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey are related. Musk’s SpaceX was backed by Thiel’s Founders Fund and Andreessen’s a16z (which also invested in X and xAI). Both of those VCs also backed Anduril, Luckey’s defense startup. The overlapping network of founders, funders, and insiders extends into several federal agencies. And in many cases, those agencies are steering billions in federal contracts back to those companies. The Journal found that across Washington, people from Musk’s network, including Tesla, X, and SpaceX, are in more than a dozen agencies, from the executive office of the president and Office of Personnel Management all the way down to the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy. SpaceX employees are also in agencies that could provide the company new business. For example, the Journal reports that SpaceX senior engineer Theodore Malaska got an ethics waiver in February that lets him take a temporary job at the Federal Aviation Administration while still working at the rocket company. The FAA hasn’t given any contracts to SpaceX yet, but Malaskasaid on Xthe agency has used Starlink to upgrade a weather-observing system in Alaska. SpaceX is also the main commercial provider that transports crew and cargo for NASA. Despite national security concerns — like the company’ssecret backdoor for Chinese investmentandMusk’s reported drug use— SpaceX in April won$5.9 billionof a $13.7 billion multi-year contract from the U.S. Space Force to launch Pentagon missions. The DOD, which is currently a Starlink customer, also plans to buySpaceX’s Starshield satellites, a militarized version of the internet satellites. Employees at Thiel-backed firms have found themselves in roles in the State Department, the Office of Management and Budget, Health and Human Services, and Social Security, per The Wall Street Journal. Thiel’s Palantir has already been awarded nearly $376 million since 2020 from the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2024, the company was alsoawardedat least$1.2 billioninDepartment of Defensecontractsin 2024 and is in the running foranother $100 million deal. Anduril, Palantir, and SpaceX recently submitted a multibillion-dollar proposal for Trump’s “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which would also add to Anduril’s existing contracts with the U.S. Army. Recently, Anduril and Microsoft took over a 2021 contract worth up to $22 billion to develop AR headsets, per the Journal. An Anduril executive, Michael Obadal, has been nominated to a top role at the Department of Defense. In his ethics disclosure, he stated that he wouldretain his Anduril stockif appointed. TechCrunch has reached out to Anduril, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Palantir, and SpaceX for comment. “This sort of concentration of private wealth and political power is ultimately very risky for our economy,” Weiner said. “Because instead of the government making decisions that are intended to foster competition, foster economic growth, you run the real risk that government decisions are going to instead be structured around protecting particular companies and particular industries from full economic competition.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced the sentencing ina press release. Council and other hackers took over the SEC’s X account in 2024 to falsely announce that the agency had approved Bitcoin exchange traded funds, or ETFs, which shot up the price of the cryptocurrency before later dropping. According to the DOJ, Council and his co-conspirators performed aSIM swapattack against the cellphone account of a person who had access to the SEC’s X account, which allowed the hackers to take control of their phone number. From there, the hackers reset the password of the SEC’s X account, granting them control of the account.

Sully Omar, one of the founders of Ottogrid, announced the deal Friday in apost on X. He didn’t disclose the terms. Excited to announce that Ottogrid is joining@cohere!pic.twitter.com/FPNl9IiNW8 Ottogrid will sunset its product, according to Omar, but will give customers “ample notice” and “a reasonable transition period.” “We’re very excited to join the Cohere team and integrate Ottogrid into Cohere’s … platform,” Omar said in a statement. “Through our work with Cohere, we’re [going to] dramatically impact how people can automate their workflows, enrich their data, and scale their operations.” Cohere didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Cohere’s purchase of Ottogrid comes as the former experiences a bit of corporate turbulence.According to The Information, Cohere fell well short of revenue projections the company prepared in early 2023, missing its target for last year by 85%. The companytold Reuterson Thursday that its annualized revenue recently reached $100 million, following a strategic shift with a focus on private AI deployments for customers in sectors like healthcare, government, and finance. Ottogrid launched in 2023 as Cognosys, led by Omar and Homam Malkawi. It rebranded in October 2024 with a major platform redesign that introduced a number of new integrations, tools, and APIs. Today, Ottogrid offers a “native table interface” with AI-powered document analysis capabilities. Customers can use it to extract data from a website and save it directly to a spreadsheet, for example, or automatically enrich sales lead lists. Ottogrid managed to raise $2 million in venture capital from investors, including GV (Google Ventures), Untapped Capital, Replit CEO Amjad Masad, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Cohere co-founders Ivan Zhang and Aidan Gomez, and others prior to its exit,according to Crunchbase. As part of Cohere, Omar says that Ottogrid will focus primarily on North, Cohere’s recently launched ChatGPT-style application designed to assist knowledge workers with tasks such as summarizing documents. Updated 2:03 p.m. Pacific: In a statement, Cohere CEO Aidan Gomezsaid:“I’m super excited to bring the Ottogrid team aboard and incorporate Ottogrid’s product directly into North.

The new boat is called the Arc Coast, and it will start at $168,000. The company is taking preorders now and says the Coast will ship in 2026. The Coast is what’s known as a “center console” boat, which is often used for fishing. It’s the company’s third model, following the limited edition $300,000 Arc One and the $268,000 Arc Sport (whichI got to pilot earlier this year). That’s despitecoming out of stealth just four years ago. Arc also recently announced it’s working on an electrictug boatto be used at the Port of Los Angeles, as the startup tries to make good on founder and CEO Mitch Lee’s ambitious promise to electrify all watercraft. The company says the Coast is powered by the same 226kWh battery pack Arc designed for the Sport and is roughly the same size. That battery should last for hours — four to five, or even more, depending on how much drivers use the 400 horsepower on offer — and can power the Coast up to around 50 miles per hour. Up to 10 people can ride on board. The big difference between the Coast and the Sport, other than price, is the layout. True to its name, the “console” or helm of the boat is situated in the center, allowing for freer movement around the edges. It appears to have the same fit and finish of Arc’s other boats, which looked superb even on the production-intent Sport I drove in January. Arc has also put a lot of work into the software on the center console’s screens, which are minimalist yet rich with information. Add in all the other upsides over gas boats like no fumes, no winterization, and less noise, and it’s possible to imagine people justifying what is still an eye-watering price tag when it hits the market next year.

But here we are. A few days after Anderson announced his resignationfrom his position and the board at Aurora, he spoke to me about hisnext gig as chief product officerat GM. In short, he will oversee the entire product line of GM’s gas-powered and electric vehicles — a position that will cover the entire life cycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. Anderson couldn’t say too much; plus, he hasn’t started the job yet. Anderson did say he wouldn’t have taken the new job if Aurora had yet to launch itscommercial self-driving truck servicein Texas. Let’s jump into the rest of the news. In an absolutely wild turn of events,Luminar’s founderAustin Russellappears to have been pushed out as CEO and board chair. You canread my coverage here, which provides a bit of an overview of how this unfolded, but I know there is so much more to this story. TL;DR: If you were to only read Luminar’s Q1 earnings report, you would assume Russell was still at the helm. A separate press release, released as the company’s earnings went out, announced a leadership change and that Russell had resigned following an ethics inquiry from the board’s audit committee. Here’s what I’m hearing from a few little birds. The word “blindsided” came up more than once, and the chaos isn’t over. Luminar board memberJun Hong Heng, who is founder and chief investment officer at Crescent Cove Advisors and a mentor of Russell’s,resigned a day later. Heng was also on the audit committee.

Aurorahas had an odd couple of weeks filled with highs — driverless commercial service woohoo! — and twists — whoops,there goes a co-founder. To cap things off, Uber announced plans tooffer $1 billion in exchangeable senior notesdue in 2028 in private placement. As you might expect, stocks dropped after investors got spooked about potential dilution and what this might mean for the value of Aurora’s stock. Other deals that got my attention … AutoUnify, the latest startup that has launched out of theUp.Labs-Porschepartnership,raised $5 millionin seed money. The Santa Monica, California-based startup, which built an API to allow dealerships and service shops to communicate in real time with the manufacturers and software vendors that power their operations, has been operating quietly for about nine months. Chinese battery manufacturerCATLis far from a startup. But it’s worth noting this bananas IPO plan. The company wants to raise at least HK$31.01 billion —that’s just shy of $4 billion— in its Hong Kong listing. This is the largest listing globally in 2025. Here’s apotentialdeal that has raised some eyebrows. Federal railroad regulators are in talks withElon Musk’stunneling firm,The Boring Company, over amultibillion-dollar Amtrak project. Flock Freight, the shared truckload freight brokerage based in California,raised $60 millionin a Series E funding round led by O’Neil Strategic Capital. Susquehanna Private Equity Investments, SignalFire, GLP Capital Partners, and Bracket Capital also participated. Tesla’s plan to launch a robotaxi service in Austin next month hascaught the attention of federal safety investigators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation sent the company a detailed list of questions on its upcoming robotaxi service as part of an investigation into how the company’s “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software operates in low-visibility conditions. Recalls are starting to pop up more in the AV sector. Last week it wasZoox. NowWaymohasissued a software recallon 1,200 self-driving vehicles after some of its robotaxis were involved in minor collisions with gates, chains, and other gate-like roadway objects. WeRideseems to be trying to ramp in Guangzhou. The Chinese company said it has introducedeight autonomous robotaxi pilot operation routesin the central part of the city. The company has also started trialing fully driverless robotaxisin Abu Dhabi. General Motorshas been working on anew battery chemistrycalled lithium manganese-rich, which it says should slash costs while delivering driving range. Notably, these LMR batteries dramatically reduce the amount of nickel and cobalt compared with GM’s most advanced cells, two critical minerals that aren’t readily available from domestic sources in the United States. A footnote inLucid’s recent Q1 regulatory filing gives a bit more insight into its sales numbers. The EV maker’s record quarter got a lift fromrental sales and company leases. Slate Autohas racked upmore than 100,000 reservationsfor its customizable low-cost electric pickup truck. Everyone, let’s give a slow clap toToyotafor redesigning — and more importantly, renaming — itssole all-electric vehicle for the U.S. market. The EV, once called the bZ4X, will now simply be bZ. The original bZ4X was not well received. I’m looking forward to getting behind the wheel to see what improvements Toyota has made. Meanwhile, Toyota hasbrought back the C-HR nameplate, but this time as an EV. Hopefully this time it’s more successful. It arrives in the U.S. in 2026. Three years ago, reporter Rebecca Bellan noted thatUberwasgoing through an Amazonification. Her pitch was that the company, likeAmazon, had created a closed business loop to feed customers back into other Uber channels. Thesecond part of that evolution has started, she reported this week. Uber appears to be moving beyond its focus on transportation and working to become a convenient super app, an aggregator of services, a daily-use lifestyle platform with its best offerings tucked behind a paywall. U.S. lawmakers introduced the Supersonic Aviation Modernization Act in a bid to revise theFAA’s 52-year ban on supersonic flightover U.S. soil.

Rather than gin up a new design or try to mass manufacture smaller reactors, it wants to develop a series of reactors using existing designs. The two-year-old startupannounceda Series A last month led by Eclipse with participation from CIV, Goldcrest Capital, MCJ Collective, True Ventures, and Wonder Ventures, though it did not disclose the amount raised. Now, TechCrunch has learned that the company has secured $51.3 million in a Series A, bringing the company’s total funding to $70 million. The Nuclear Company was founded in 2023 bythree serial entrepreneurs: former AppHarvest CEO Jonathan Webb, Arcadia CEO Kiran Bhatraju, and CIV CEO Patrick Maloney. The startup is prioritizing sites that already have permits or licenses to operate. Fewer than a dozen sites fall under that rubric, according to filings forcombined operating licensesandearly site permitsat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. At the sites that are closer to groundbreaking, each can support reactors with more than 1 gigawatt of generation capacity. The Nuclear Company is aiming to develop 6 gigawatts in its first fleet. The funding round arrives as tech companies and utilities are struggling to secure power for data centers. Demand for electricity in the U.S. is expected to surge nearly 16% by 2029, according toGrid Strategies, after years of steady consumption. Data centers are a large driver; their electricity use couldquadrupleby the end of the decade. In the face of potential power shortages, tech companies have been cozying up to nuclear startups and developers. Google isworking with Kairosto build 500 megawatts’ worth of small modular reactors (SMR), while Amazon participated in a massive $700 million round to fund X-energy’s SMR plans. Meta hassolicited proposalsfrom developers to build up to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity, and Microsoft is working with Constellation Energy torestart a reactorat Three Mile Island. But nuclear power is facing headwinds, both expected and unexpected. Competition from solar power is among the former: Tech companies and data center operators have been snapping up capacity from solar farms,signing sizable deals. These farms are frequently paired with massive batteries to provide 24/7 electricity. The technology is inexpensive, and new projects can be developed in around 18 months. Nuclear may soon face other financial hurdles, too. This week, the House Ways and Means Committeepublished its draftof a reconciliation bill that would kill subsidies for nuclear power that were granted under the Inflation Reduction Act. Nuclear power plants are currently eligible for tax credits up to $15 per megawatt-hour. Most new nuclear power plants, including those on The Nuclear Company’s timeline, aren’t expected to come online until the early 2030s. Given that forecasts for the next five yearsvary wildly, massive nuclear plants entering service a decade from now could be stuck holding the bag.

The filing, submitted Thursday, reveals that Moonvalley actually landed (so far) around $53 million total from a group of 14 unnamed investors. The filing indicates that this is an additional $10 million in cash, rather than a whole new round. It brings the company’s total raised to about $124 million, estimates PitchBook, following on the heels of Moonvalley’s$70 million seed roundlast November. Moonvalley declined to comment. The wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to such an explosion of providers that the space is becoming saturated. Startups such asRunway,Lightricks, Genmo,Pika,Higgsfield, Kling, andLuma, as well as tech giants likeOpenAI, Alibaba, andGoogle, are releasing models at a fast clip. In many cases, little distinguishes one model from another. Moonvalley’s Marey model, built in collaboration with anew AI animation studiocalled Asteria, offers customization options like fine-grained camera and motion controls and can generate “HD” clips up to 30 seconds long. Moonvalley claims it’s also lower risk than some other video-generation models from a legal perspective. But where Moonvalley is attempting to differentiate itself — hence the high VC interest — is on the data it’s using to train its models, as well as the safeguards in its video creation tools. Many generative-video startups train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue thatfair-usedoctrine shields the practice, but that hasn’t stopped rights holdersfrom lodging complaintsand filing cease and desists. Moonvalley says it’s working with partners to handle licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that the company then purchases. The approach is similar to Bria’s andAdobe’s, the latter of which procures content for training from creators through its proprietary Adobe Stock platform. Moonvalley is also crafting an interface for its model. The company’s software, which it hasn’t previewed publicly yet, has storyboarding and “granular” clip adjustment tools, Moonvalley’s co-founders revealed inrecent interviews. Marey can generate videos from not only text prompts but also from sketches, photos, and other video clips,claimsMoonvalley. Naeem Talukdar, who previously led product growth at Zapier, founded Moonvalley with former DeepMind scientists Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski. John Thomas joined as Moonvalley’s COO — he and Talukdar had founded another startup, Draft, several years ago. Moonvalley also counts Asteria head Bryn Mooser as a co-founder. Many artists and creators are understandably wary of video generators, as they threaten to upend the film and television industry. A 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026. Moonvalley intends to allow creators to request their content be removed from its models, let customers delete their data at any time, and offer anindemnity policyto protect its users from copyright challenges. Unlike some “unfiltered” video models that readily insert a person’s likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its tools. Like OpenAI’s Sora, Moonvalley’s models will block certain content, like NSFW phrases, and won’t allow users to prompt them to generate videos of specific people or celebrities. “We founded Moonvalley to make generative video technology that works for filmmakers and creative professionals,” Moonvalley wrote in ablog postin March. “That means addressing fear and distrust, as well as solving technical problems that keep generative AI from being a realistic tool for professional production.” Topics AI Editor Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Spotifyannouncedlast week that it would roll out public play counts on all podcasts as a way of “helping attract new fans.” But podcasters swiftly responded with criticism of the new feature — mainly, that it would further promote podcasts that already have large audiences while making smaller shows less appealing to new listeners. On Friday, Spotifychanged courseon its plans, but did not completely eschew the idea. Now, play counts will only appear on shows with at least 50,000 plays each. Instead of showing an exact play count, the designation will only update at specific milestones, like 100,000 or 1 million plays. “We plan to roll this newly evolved version of play counts over the coming week,” the company wrote in ablog post. “This update reflects our evolving efforts to provide the best insights for creators and a clear experience for their fans.” For decades, podcast hosting platforms have not shared many public indicators of a show’s popularity — Apple Podcasts, for example, has had reviews and charts on its app, but it would be challenging for a listener to know if a show had an audience in the tens or the tens of thousands. Though Spotify takes the angle that this ambiguity is a detriment, creators have been drawn to the podcasting medium in part because it’s refreshingly different from other forms of online media. When someone clicks play on a YouTube video, for example, they are approaching the media with the existing knowledge of how many views the video has, and how many people have subscribed to that channel. But podcasting can level the playing field for more niche creators. Podcasters have also expressed frustration with the lack of a clear metric for what counts as a “play” or a “stream” among various different platforms. The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) works with podcast platforms to establish a clear metric for what is defined as a “play,” creating more consistency for dealmaking among podcasters and advertisers. But according toPodnews, the definition of what counts as a “play” is different on Spotify and YouTube — two of the most popular podcast listening platforms — than the IAB standard. Spotify said that play counts will refer to the number of times “people actively tried” the content, whereas streams and downloads only count after 60 seconds of engagement.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us OpenAI announced on Friday it’s launching a research preview of Codex, the company’s most capable AI coding agent yet. Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of the company’so3 AI reasoning modeloptimized for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 produces “cleaner” code than o3, adheres more precisely to instructions, and will iteratively run tests on its code until passing results are achieved. The Codex agent runs in a sandboxed, virtual computer in the cloud. By connecting with GitHub, Codex’s environment can come preloaded with your code repositories. OpenAI says the AI coding agent will take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to write simple features, fix bugs, answer questions about your codebase, and run tests, among other tasks. Codex can handle multiple software engineering tasks simultaneously, says OpenAI, and it doesn’t limit users from accessing their computer and browser while it’s running. Codex is rolling out starting today to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team. OpenAI says users will have “generous access” to Codex to start, but in the coming weeks, the company will implement rate limits for the tool. Users will then have the option to purchase additional credits to use Codex, an OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch. OpenAI plans to expand Codex access to ChatGPT Plus and Edu users soon. AI tools for software engineers, also known as vibe coders, have surged in popularity in recent months. The CEOs ofGoogleandMicrosoftclaim that roughly 30% of their companies’ code is now written by AI. In February, Anthropic released its own agentic coding tool,Claude Code, and in April, Google updated its AI coding assistant,Gemini Code Assist, with more agentic abilities. All that vibe coding has made the businesses behind AI coding platforms some of the fastest-growing in tech. Cursor, among the most popular AI coding tools, reached annualized revenue of around$300 millionin April and isreportedly raising new funds at a $9 billion valuation. Now, OpenAI wants a piece of the pie. The ChatGPT maker has reportedlyclosed on a deal to acquire Windsurf, the developer behind another popular AI coding platform, for $3 billion. The launch of Codex shows very clearly that OpenAI is building out its own AI coding tools, in addition. Users with access to Codex can find the tool in ChatGPT’s sidebar, and assign the agent new coding tasks by typing a prompt and clicking the “Code” button. Users can also ask questions about their codebase and click the “Ask” button. Below the prompting bar, users can see other tasks they’ve assigned Codex to do, and monitor their progress. In a briefing ahead of Codex’s launch, OpenAI’s Agents Research Lead, Josh Tobin, told TechCrunch the company eventually wants its AI coding agents to act as “virtual teammates,” completing tasks autonomously that take human engineers “hours or even days” to accomplish. OpenAI claims it’s already using Codex internally to offload repetitive tasks, scaffold new features, and draft documentation. OpenAI Product Lead Alexander Embiricos says a lot of the safety work for the company’s o3 model applies to Codex as well. In a blog post, OpenAI says Codex will reliably refuse requests to develop “malicious software.” Furthermore, Codex operates in an air-gapped environment, with no access to the broader internet or external APIs. This limits how dangerous Codex could be in the hands of a bad actor — but it may also hamper its usefulness. It’s worth noting that AI coding agents, much like all generative AI systems today, are prone to mistakes. Arecent study from Microsoftfound that industry-leading AI coding models, such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and o3-mini, struggled to reliably debug software. However, that doesn’t seem to be dampening investor excitement in these tools. OpenAI is also updatingCodex CLI,the company’s recently launched open source coding agent that runs in your terminal, with a version of itso4-minimodel that’s optimized for software engineering. That model is now the default in Codex CLI, and will be available in OpenAI’s API for $1.50 per 1M input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, more than the entire Lord of the Rings book series) and $6 per 1M output tokens. Codex’s launch marks OpenAI’s latest effort to beef up ChatGPT with additional products besides the notorious chatbot. In the past year, OpenAI has added priority access to the company’s AI video platform,Sora, its research agent,Deep Research, as well as its web browsing agent,Operator, as benefits for subscribers. These offerings could entice more users to sign up for a ChatGPT subscription, and, in the case of Codex specifically, convince existing subscribers to pay OpenAI more money for increased rate limits.

    "title": "After adding its own billing option on iOS, Apple asks Patreon to move it to an external browser",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Creator platformPatreonhas to modify its app to comply with Apple’s guidelinesafter a recent updateallowed U.S. users to make purchases via the web. The company says that its own web-based checkout option is now the default for U.S. fans, but it has to update its app so that this checkout option opens in an external browser instead, per Apple’s instruction. This creates more steps for fans who want to pay using Patreon directly, but it still allows the company to forgo having to pay Apple a 30% commission on in-app purchases. Patreonfirst updated its appshortly after a court ruling in theApple-Epiclegal battle that forced Apple tosupport external paymentsin apps published on its U.S. App Store without charging commissions. Last week, the Patreon iOS app (version 125.5.0)addedan option that let users pay via the web using a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, Venmo, PayPal, and even Apple Pay. These options appeared within an in-app browser, providing a more seamless checkout experience for Patreon users. Now, Patreon’s checkout flow opens in an external browser instead — a change Patreon made based on Apple’s feedback. In addition, the company says creators on older billing models will also be able to accept payments through Patreon’s iOS app. Previously, Apple didn’t support billing models outside of subscription billing, and it required the exclusive use of its own in-app purchases system. That limited the options for creators on legacy billing models, like first-of-the-month and per-creation billing, Patreon says. With the update, creators will be able to use those billing options on iOS, which could make a significant impact on their bottom line. Within the week, Patreon says that U.S. fans will be able to purchase memberships from these creators at the price they’ve set for their tiers in the iOS app. (However, creators will still need to offer subscription billing to sell new memberships outside the U.S.) Currently, approximately 95% of active creators are already using subscription billing, the company notes, as it allows them to use other tools like free trials, discounts, gifting, tier repricing, autopilot, and more. But now it can address the needs of the remaining 5%. Because of this new flexibility, Patreon’s deadline to switch creators to subscription billing is no longer in effect, it says. Last August, Patreon said Applehad given it a deadline to switch all creators to Apple’s iOS in-app purchase systemby November 2025 or risk removal from the App Store. “We’ve stayed in close conversation with Apple and have continued advocating for a more flexible approach — one that gives creators more time and choice,” Patreon shared in ablog post. “As a result of the recent ruling and changes on Apple’s end, the November 2025 deadline is no longer in effect, and as of today, no new deadline has been set. This means that, as of now, we can give creators more time and flexibility in when and how they switch while we simultaneously work to resolve issues that have blocked them from switching in the first place,” it said.

In a hearing Tuesday, Judge Brendan Linehan Shannon ruled the financier, a U.K.-based man named Charles Garson, lacked standing to request thesale to Canoo’s own CEObe vacated. While Garson had told the court he was willing to pay as much as $20 million for Canoo’s assets, he missed the deadline to formally submit that bid. Garson also never made it clear where he was sourcing that money from, causing the bankruptcy trustee in the case to raise concerns the bid could get blocked by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The last remaining challenge to the asset sale comes from Harbinger Motors, a commercial electric trucking startup created by a handful of former Canoo employees. Harbinger objected to the sale before it was finalized in April. The judge denied Harbinger’s objection, but the company has since appealed that decision. Jason Angelo, a lawyer for Garson, framed his client’s attempt to disrupt the sale as a “David versus Goliath type matter.” Angelo tried to make the case during the hearing that Garson’s conversations with the bankruptcy trustee — which were submitted to the court under seal — led him to believe he had until the end of April to formalize a bid. He also repeated the claims made in Garson’s original filing about the sale allegedly being unfair because the assets ultimately went to Canoo’s CEO Anthony Aquila. “I think it would make sense here to allow a redo, so to speak,” Angelo said, citing “the sincerity and earnestness” of his client. “I know that is asking a lot, I do.” Mark Felger, the lawyer representing the bankruptcy trustee, disagreed by saying there was little in dispute and the negotiations were fair. “We think it’s pretty clear-cut in terms of the facts. There’s no he said, she said,” he told the judge. “Your Honor, it’s all in the emails. I’ve read them over many, many times. I don’t see any miscommunication. I don’t see any deception. It was clear how we were proceeding. He knew there was a sale hearing on the ninth, and he chose not to file anything.” Regarding the fairness of the sale process, Felger said he and the trustee “were concerned about this insider sale [to the CEO].” “But they’re the ones who stepped up, right and we negotiated hard. We went back and forth a dozen times on that agreement,” he said. Felger also repeated the trustee’s claims, made in earlier filings and testimony, that the cost of maintaining Canoo’s assets — especially its battery packs — was costing too much money. Letting a sale process drag out for too long could damage the value of the estate, he said. Judge Shannon, after hearing the arguments from Angelo, Felger, and a lawyer for Aquila, ruled swiftly against Garson. He said the financier lacked standing to properly argue his motion to vacate the sale, since he is not owed any money by Canoo and did not submit a formal bid before the deadline. “I am sympathetic to Mr. Garson’s frustration at what I sense and am satisfied is a genuine interest to provide a superior bid and purchase these assets,” Shannon said. “But it was a complex process run by the chapter seven trustee that I don’t think Mr. Garson had a full handle on exactly what the process was, and what was necessary in order to fully engage in that process.” Shannon also pointed out it was made clear to the trustee from the beginning who Aquila was, and that his role as CEO alone did not preclude him from buying his company’s assets. “I came into the process late and had hoped for the opportunity to participate and enter my bid. While the outcome wasn’t what I’d hoped for, I respect the court’s decision and want to extend my congratulations to Tony Aquila,” Garson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

Afterwinning a decisive victory for app developersin a legal battle with Apple, forcing the tech giant to allow external payments in its U.S. App Store without charging commission, Epic Games attempted toresubmit Fortnite to the U.S. App Storeon May 9, 2025. However, Apple failed to accept its submission for a week, leading Epic Games to pull its request and try again. According to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, theupdate was pulled becauseEpic Games needs to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content, and all platforms must be updated simultaneously. The company then submitted a new version to the U.S. App Store for review on Wednesday, May 14, with the updated content. In a Friday morning post on X, Fortnite said that Apple has blocked its latest U.S. submission and has made it so Epic Games can’t release its app to the European Union, either. “Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it,” thepost from Fortnite reads. TechCrunch reached out to Epic Games and Apple for comment. Apple disputed Epic Games’ characterization of the issue. A spokesperson for Apple said the following: “We asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies. We did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces in the EC.” Updated after publication with Apple’s comment.

    "article_text": "Two firefighters who died in a blaze at an Oxfordshire business park have been named as Jennie Logan and Martyn Sadler, while a member of the public who died is David Chester. Ms Logan, 30, Mr Sadler, 38, and Mr Chester, 57, from Bicester died after explosions were heard at Bicester Motion - a former RAF base - on Thursday. Both firefighters worked at Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and Mr Sadler was also part of the London Fire Brigade, Thames Valley Police said. Two more firefighters sustained serious injuries and remain in hospital, Oxfordshire County Council said. The fire was reported at about 18:30 BST on Thursday and rapidly spread through a former aircraft hangar at the site. At its height, 10 fire crews were tackling the blaze. The police have launched an unexplained death investigation, but are not currently treating it as a criminal matter. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Metcalfe described the deaths as \"an absolute tragedy\" and said the thoughts of everyone at the force were with the families, friends and colleagues of those who had died. Officers will remain at the scene for a number of days to ensure the public remain safe. At the scene on Friday, a visibly emotional Chief Fire Officer Rob MacDougall said he spoke with \"a heavy heart\" when he confirmed the deaths. He added: \"Our thoughts are with the family friends and colleagues affected during this time. \"I'm immensely proud and grateful for the exemplary multiagency response and the unwavering bravery demonstrated by the emergency services personnel.\" London Fire Commissioner Andy Roe described it as an \"incredibly challenging day\" for UK fire services and said it highlighted the high-risk nature of their work. He said: \"This is clearly an incredibly difficult time for us all; we have lost a well-respected and much-loved colleague who exemplified courage and selflessness in the service of others. \"Our thoughts are with all the families, friends, and colleagues impacted by this tragedy. We are doing everything we can to provide support to Martyn's family and colleagues.\" He added: \"Our sincere condolences go out to Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service who also sadly lost a firefighter at this incident, with a further two colleagues in hospital.\" Bicester Motion is home to more than 50 specialist businesses, focused on classic car restoration and engineering on the former site of RAF Bicester. It was home to RAF Bomber Command in World War Two and became redundant in 2004. Bicester Motion's chairman Daniel Geoghegan paid tribute to \"the three lives that have been lost\". In a statement, he said the firefighters showcased \"the epitome of selfless service\" and had \"gone above and beyond under unprecedented circumstances\". Mr Geoghegan added that father-of-two Mr Chester, who ran family business Chesters & Sons, had \"a long history with the estate\". \"He joined us 12 years ago when we first bought the site and, with his wife and two sons, has been a pillar of our whole business community,\" he said. \"We considered him a member of our team, part of the fabric of our estate and a friend to us all.\" \"Our whole community used to say that 'Dave always had our back'. Yesterday, he was doing just that – the epitome of his selfless spirit,\" he added. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were with the families and friends of those who had died following the \"devastating news\". He said: \"The bravery of our firefighters is astounding. Hoping those in hospital make a full and swift recovery.\" Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch described it as \"an absolutely horrifying incident\", adding: \"I hope that we can get to the bottom of exactly what's caused this and make sure that it doesn't happen again.\" Sherine Wheeler, chief executive of the Fire Fighters Charity,told BBC Radio Oxfordeveryone in the firefighting community was feeling \"heartbroken\". \"It's very rare and tragic to have the loss of two firefighters alongside a member of the public and I think the impact of that is being felt deeply,\" she said. \"For a lot of people who serve in the fire service it brings the reality of the risks they hold crashing home.\" People, including members of South Central Ambulance, have left floral tributes to those affected by the incident at nearby Bicester Fire Station. Jamie Jessett, from the town, said he went to school with one of the firefighters who died. He said the fire was \"devastating\", but also that it was \"amazing\" to see the community come together to pay their respects. \"That's what we need, especially at this moment in time,\" he added.

Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was dealing with the fire on Wednesday evening. Thames Valley Police said she died in Stubbs Avenue in Headington at about 05:20 GMT on Wednesday. The head of the Fire Brigades Union said it had a \"long history\" of supporting the right to protest. Four people on the bus and the HGV driver suffered minor injuries in the crash, police said.",

    "article_text": "An extraordinary thing happened to me on a recent flight to Madrid: I unwittingly travelled under the wrong identity, becoming a potential security issue, and no one realised. I was packing for a short business trip to make a film for the BBC when I attempted to check-in online. It didn't work, so I headed to London Heathrow Airport to do it in-person. Upon arrival there, I tried once again to check myself in, this time at a self-service booth. Again I was denied, the machine flashing up an error code: \"Assistance required.\" I ended up at a check-in desk and after checking in my bag, a British Airways staff member handed me a boarding pass. Admittedly I didn't read the pass in any detail, but headed off to get processed in the security area as normal. At the gate, I was among the first passengers to board flight BA7055 departing at 10:50 on 23 April, operated by BA's Spanish partner carrier Iberia, as I was in row six. Dutifully, I handed my passport and boarding pass to a member of BA ground crew, who glanced at them both and waved me through. Once on board I realised my seat was in business class. I assumed this must have been a free upgrade, because I would of course usually have been in economy; we had chosen this flight because it was the most cost-effective option with all our filming equipment. No sooner were we off the tarmac and at cruising altitude than the delicious baked cod and chickpea stew lunch was served. Tiramisu for dessert, too. No complimentary alcohol for me though; it was a work trip. It was on arrival in the Spanish capital when things started to go wrong. As soon as I gained mobile signal on the ground, an email popped up: my return flight had been cancelled. I asked the BBC's travel provider what had happened and what the plan was for getting me home? In response, the travel company said it had been cancelled because I was a no-show on the outbound flight. I explained that I was in fact very much in Madrid and waiting - endlessly, it seemed - to collect my checked luggage from the baggage belt. After some no doubt confusing conversations between our travel team and BA, I received a further message to say the airline was adamant I had not travelled and that the boarding pass in my possession did not display the correct details. This was when I realised that the name on my boarding pass was not mine, it was a man called Huw H. The BBC is not using Huw H's full name, which was printed on the pass. His name was also printed on my luggage tags. BA claimed there was no way I could have travelled using that document as security checks wouldn't allow it - but I did. My colleague, who was seated a few rows behind me, can vouch for me being on that plane. The airline was so sure that I was not in Madrid that the BBC had to book me another seat on the flight home I was originally booked onto, at great expense. BA has since offered a £500 goodwill voucher as well as refunding the cost of the extra ticket. The security protocol for passengers boarding flights is relatively simple: ground crew must check the name on the boarding pass matches that on the passport presented. This process appears to have broken down in my case - with no one at check-in or the boarding gate identifying the discrepancy between the name on the boarding pass and my passport. So what went wrong, and who is Huw H? I tried to find out. Some internet sleuthing brought limited proof of Huw H's existence. I made a few attempts to contact accounts using his full name via various social media channels, to no avail. It's made me fear that he might not even exist. I did manage to get in touch with someone with a similar name - Jonathan Huw H - who, it turns out, flew on a BA flight on 24 April, a day after mine, landing at Heathrow, so is it possible his name was somehow floating around in the BA system? \"It's really worrying,\" Jonathan told me. My married name, which was on my booking confirmation and passport, begins with the letter H - though is very different to Huw H's surname. Could this have factored in? It's impossible to know, and BA cannot confirm anything for privacy reasons. Simon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, said it was to be expected that mistakes will sometimes happen \"in the high-pressure, deadline-strewn world of aviation\". But he added: \"This case is unusual in that the error wasn't picked up at the departure gate, where it could have been easily rectified. \"The airline needs urgently to investigate and make amends.\" Aviation security and operations expert Julian Bray added: \"There is a security issue here, in that the plane took off with an incorrect passenger manifest. \"It is wrong and shouldn't have happened. The passenger manifest should be correct as it is an important document that shows who is travelling and where. That said, as the name on the baggage tag matched the one on the boarding pass and the correct number of people were on board when the plane took off, I can see how it happened.\" Others would argue that it was not a security risk, though, because both myself and my luggage went through all the usual security checks. A spokesperson for BA, which managed my ticket as well as the Heathrow ground crew in my case, said: \"We've contacted our customer to apologise for this genuine human error. While incidents like this are extremely rare, we've taken proactive steps to ensure it doesn't happen again.\" Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority has told me it has launched an investigation into what happened. Heathrow Airport said in response to a request for comment that it was not responsible for the ground crew or anything else in my case, and security screening went ahead as normal. Iberia, whose only involvement in my journey was operating the outbound plane and cabin crew, has not responded to a request for comment. As is nothing out of the ordinary, my passport and boarding pass were not manually checked on the plane. Apologies and investigations aside, the question remains how this was ever possible in this day and age of high security. On social media there are threads about this type of thing happening around the world in the past, but the mistake was rectified before take-off as there were two people trying to sit in the same seat. What happened to me appears to be different as my name was seemingly replaced with someone who seemingly wasn't travelling to Spain that day. I'm not sure I'll ever really know what happened, but one thing is for sure - I won't ever walk away from a check-in desk without reading every detail printed on my boarding pass in future. Nine Just Stop Oil activists are sentenced for planning to disrupt Heathrow Airport last July. The aircraft still aren't commercially approved but could offer a way around Los Angeles' notoriously poor traffic. One worker broke his back and another suffered a brain bleed in falls at Heathrow Airport. The commitment from the state-owned airline comes as Boeing pushes to rebuild its business. The airport says seven million people used the hub last month, a rise of 5.9% compared to April 2024.",

    "title": "How texts from EncroChat helped uncover prison workers affair with drug boss",
    "article_text": "Kerri Pegg was considered a rising star of the prison service after a career change - but is now startinga nine year sentence. Pegg, who had spent eight years as a probation officer, was convicted of misconduct in public office and possession of criminal property for her affair with drug dealer Anthony Saunderson. She rose through the ranks quickly after joining as a graduate in 2012, and by April 2018 was in the top job at HMP Kirkham in Lancashire. But behind the scenes, it is now evident Pegg was struggling financially - with four \"maxed out\" credit cards and 6p in her savings account. Even before her move to the top job, her previous boss at HMP Liverpool had pulled her up on undeclared County Court Judgments (CCJ) - which are considered a corruption risk. But in her office in Kirkham far more serious conflict of interests was beginning to develop. Already serving his sentence was Anthony Saunderson, a career criminal from Liverpool convicted of his involvement in smuggling cocaine in shipments of corned beef from Argentina. Pegg's trial in Preston Crown Court had heard there were concerns over Pegg's relationship to Saunderson from early on in her tenure at HMP Kirkham. The \"bubbly\" and \"chatty\" prison governor would spend significant periods in her office with Saunderson - with the door closed. Whether or not Saunderson was using Pegg or their relationship was genuine - his time with her appeared to pay off in October 2018 when she approved an application for his early release on temporary licence - despite not having the authority to do so. With Saunderson a free man, they continued to spend time together on the outside. In court, Pegg said at the time she was responsible for delivering the drug strategy for six jails in the north-west of England. Saunderson, meanwhile, was developing and delivering a programme called Beating Alcohol and Drug Dependency (BADD) for inmates at several prisons. Therefore, so she told the jury, their relationship was based on professional interests which she claimed was why they stayed in touch. However Saunderson had not given up his criminal interests and in 2022 he was back in police custody - charged with being involved in an enormous injectable amphetamine production plot based out of premises in Sealand in Flintshire, north Wales. His downfall, like hundreds of other serious criminals in the UK, had been his trust in the Encrochat encrypted phone network - which was believed to be impenetrable. However after its servers were hacked in 2019, police across Europe could follow the messages of its users in real-time exposing a treasure-trove of evidence on organised criminals. Saunderson, it later emerged, was the man behind the Encrochat handles Jesse Pinkman - a reference to the meth dealer in the Breaking Bad television series - and James Gandolfini, the acclaimed actor who played Mafia boss Tony Soprano. He received a 31-year prison sentence in August 2022 for producing and dealing amphetamines as well as trafficking heroin, cocaine, cannabis, ketamine, MCAT and diazepam - plus firearms charges. But on top of his drugs business, detectives found concerning references to his relationship with Pegg. Messages between his fellow drug traffickers expressed concerns about how much time he was spending with her away from \"business\". That investigation also revealed she had accepted a £12,000 Mercedes car as a gift from Saunderson, which North Wales Police found had been paid for with 34kg of amphetamines. With enough to arrest Pegg, detectives raided her home in Wigan, Greater Manchester, and found further increasingly damning evidence. A pair of men's size 10 Hugo Boss flip-flops, clearly not the footwear of the Pegg, and a toothbrush were both tested and DNA profiles matching Saunderson were present. Pegg denied any inappropriate relationship with Saunderson in court, and said the only explanation she had for the presence of Saunderson's DNA in her flat was the fact she sometimes took her toothbrush with her to prison. The jury at Preston Crown Court did not believe her. On 8 April she was convicted of two counts of misconduct in a public office relating to her relationship with Saunderson and her failure to disclose her debts. She was also found guilty of possession of criminal property, in relation to the Mercedes she accepted from Saunderson. Judge Graham Knowles KC remanded her in custody ahead of her sentencing and told her: \"I have no choice but to send you to prison due to the gravity of your offending.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire onBBC Soundsand follow BBC Lancashire onFacebook,X, andInstagramand watch BBC North West Tonight onBBC iPlayer.",

    "title": "Trump's frantic week of peace brokering hints at what he really wants",
    "article_text": "\"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something. For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage. He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan... The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue. \"Just, wow!\" remarked one London-based ambassador. \"It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.\" So whatisgoing on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events? A good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted \"commerce not chaos\" in the Middle East, a region that \"exports technology not terrorism\". His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace. As he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US. This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs. Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance. Absent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance. Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called \"the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons\" for \"giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs\". To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these \"Western interventionists\" had \"wrecked more nations than they built\", adding: \"Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins. \"I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.\" That reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved. Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was \"fundamentally none of our business… We can't control these countries\". In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries. When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce. The centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas. Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia. It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government. Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters. Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive. This is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind). Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences. So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory. The problem is that this \"art of a deal\" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war. Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point. Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: \"If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier. \"Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,\" he wrote on social media. \"I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.\" Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person. This puzzles some diplomats. \"Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?\" one remarked to me. \"Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?\" Into this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war. Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated. What unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport. Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza? So after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear. For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims – the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant. For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability. We do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks – in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent – so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China. But that may prove an elusive ambition. If there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.

    "title": "Brits can be extradited over Tokyo jewellery heist",
    "article_text": "Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be sent to Japan following a landmark ruling. For almost a decade, Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright, 28, Joe Chappell, 38, and a third man over allegations they posed as customers to steal items worth £679,000 (¥106m) from a Harry Winston store. On Friday, chief magistrate Judge Goldspring rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition. Their case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan. No extradition treaty exists between the UK and Japan, meaning it would be the first time Japan have successfully received fugitives. Japan's initial request was rejected, but the High Court overturned the original decision following an appeal lodged by the Japanese government. In Friday's judgement - seen by the BBC - Wright, of Plumstead, and Chappell, of Belvedere, both in London, had raised concerns over prison conditions in Japan which they argued were \"arbitrary, excessive and breach international standards\". The Japanese government said the submissions were \"fundamentally flawed both legally and factually\". District Judge Goldspring, chief magistrate of England and Wales, found there was a \"prima facie case\" - enough evidence to support a charge at first glance - against Chappell and that extradition would be \"compatible\" with his and Wright's human rights. Friday's ruling follows a recent High Court judgement that the Japanese government had a case to extradite Wright, Chappell and a third man named in papers as Daniel Kelly - who is Wright's father. Japan's case against Kelly will be heard at the end of this month. He has not appeared in previous extradition hearingsdue to a conspiracy to murder case against him taking precedence. Details from January's High Court judgement state that the Japanese \"relied upon a range of evidence\" which demonstrated that Kelly, Wright and Chappell travelled to Tokyo around the time of the jewellery raid in November 2015. CCTV captured all three arriving at Narita International Airport on 18 November 2015 and staying at \"the Elm Share House\", Japanese authorities said. Ch Insp Suzuki set out a record of the investigation to the High Court which indicated the trio \"took taxis\" to Harry Winston's branch in Omotesando Hills. In their efforts to escape, the trio left a number of items behind including an Armani jacket, he said. Ch Insp Suzuki added: \"Goggles were left at the shop and a jacket was left on the route the robbers took to flee from the scene.\" A professor at the Tokyo Dental College compared ePassport images taken at Narita Airport and compared it to CCTV stills of three men taken at the Harry Winston store. \"The possibility that two (or three) persons in the relevant comparison are the same is extremely high,\" Ch Insp Suzuki said in his report, citing the professor's \"expert\" findings. As well as other DNA matches, Ch Insp Suzuki's report referred to \"expert evidence that glass shards found at the property where the three stayed that matched the glass in the display case at the jewellery shop\". Findings in the reports were challenged at the High Court by lawyers representing Wright and Chappell. The Japanese government said it would ensure that the three men would have the right to consult with a lawyer in private, have any interviews recorded and have the right not to answer any questions. Wright, once a promising footballer on the books of West Ham United and Brentford,served time in prison after being convicted in 2023 of trying to sell a Ming vasewhich was stolen from a museum in Switzerland. Subject to any further appeals, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper now has 28 days to decide whether to extradite Chappell and Wright or reject Japan's request. The job ad requires the successful candidate to play classical music to the cat on Fridays. Nine Just Stop Oil activists are sentenced for planning to disrupt Heathrow Airport last July. Rebekah Shaman took on Lambeth Council over the use of parts of Brockwell Park for music events. Two kittens were found dead in a field in Ruislip, west London, on Saturday, 3 May. Shakeil Thibou, 20, attacked Cher Maximen in front of her child with a zombie knife.",

    "title": "Eurovision final 2025: Catch up with the top five favourites",
    "article_text": "The Eurovision Song Contest reaches its grand final on Saturday night in Basel, with 26 countries fighting for the coveted glass microphone trophy. The competition feels less predictable than recent years, when acts like Loreen (Sweden, 2023) and Kalush Orchestra (Ukraine, 2022) were ordained to win before they'd even sung a note. Currently, bookmakers have installed Sweden at the top of the table for the 69th edition of the contest, with their delightfully bonkers sauna sonnet, Bara Bada Bastu. But here's the thing: A novelty number has never won. Voters typically prefer songs about triumph over adversity, and stonking great pop anthems. Ideally, they want a stonking great pop anthemabouttriumph over adversity, and there are plenty of those sprinkled through tonight's running order. We spoke to the six contestants with the best odds, to find out what makes their Eurovision entries stand out. KAJ are the first Finnish act to represent Sweden at the Eurovision, hailing from the coastal town of Vörå, where Swedish is still the main language. A comedy troupe who met at school, they've been performing together for more than 15 years – and were the surprise winners of Sweden's Melodifestivalen, where the public selects the country's Eurovision entry, earlier this year. Their song, Bara Bada Bastu, is an accordian-led tribute to sauna culture (Finland has more than three million saunas, one for every two people). \"It felt like a natural thing to sing about,\" says Kevin Holmström. \"We really like the sauna. It's universal.\" The first Swedish-language entry since 2012, the song extols the practice's stress-busting virtues. Is that why Finland is consistently ranked as the world's happiest nation, I wonder? \"It's a chicken and an egg situation,\" laughs Jakob Norrgård. \"I don't know which came first, the happiness or the sauna, but the sauna definitely brings your pulse down.\" The trio have brought a mock sauna to the Eurovision stage this year, complete with birch branches, hot coals and dancers in skimpy towels. In the lyrics, they ask, \"how long can you last?\". \"Oh, we can make it last all evening,\" confirms Jackob. \"A sauna party that lasts for hours.\" \"I like to do it with a lot of intervals,\" says Axel Åhman. \"Two to three hours, going in and out, having something to drink, maybe even snack on a sausage outside, and then go back in – just to make it a calm and long session.\" And how does Finland feel about the fact the trio are representing their neighbour and Eurovision rival? \"Finns love a bargain, so this is great,\" laughs Jackob. \"Sweden gets to pay for everything, but it's a Finnish win as well.\" Austria has the best opening couplet of the year: \"I'm an ocean of love / And you're scared of water.\" \"It's about my personal experience with unreciprocated love,\" says singer Johannes Pietsch, who performs under the name JJ. \"It felt like I was walking a one-way street.\" The 24-year-old is moonlighting at Eurovision from his day job at the Vienna State Opera, where he's had roles in The Magic Flute and Von der Liebe Tod. \"A sold-out show at the opera holds 1,600 people, so that's nothing compared to the Eurovision audience,\" he says (last year's TV broadcast was seen by 163 million people). Pietsch's song, Wasted Love, is a turbulent ballad that makes spectacular use of his counter-tenor, with an EDM twist. On stage, he performs in a ramshackle sailing boat, clinging to the mast as the ocean threatens to consume him. It's one of the night's most arresting performances, and it requires a lot of preparation. \"That's the opera singer in me, I practice every day.\" he says. \"I have to do vocal warm-ups to keep the voice active and before I go on stage, I always do ten push-ups and one-minute planks.\" Reaching the Eurovision final has been a dream since he watched Conchita Wurst win for Austria in 2014. Could he replicate that success in Switzerland? \"That would be great for Austria. I would love to do that. I would call Conchita my mother, so I'd love to make her proud.\" \"I'm surrounded by a sand storm, a sand tornado, and I'll be wearing a custom Rabanne dress.\" French singer Louane is describing the simple, but stunning, staging for her ballad, Maman. The sand is real (how she avoids inhaling it, I'll never know) but it serves a purpose: The song, which was inspired by her mother's death from cancer, is all about the passage of time. \"It's a song that says that, even through sadness and deep pain, you can finally feel fine,\" she says. Maman is technically a sequel to a 2015 song of the same name, written in the depths of Louane's despair. \"I've lost my taste for fun / I can't find meaning,\" she sang. The 2025 version includes several callbacks to the first song. For example, the original opened with the lyric: \"Lovers move from bed to bed\", but the update finds her singing, \"No more lovers, no more beds.\" Having a child of her own helped Louane lift the veil of grief. In the song, she talks about how holding her daughter's hand brought back memories of the times her mum had done the same - only this time, the pain of remembering was gone. In Maman's closing bars, we briefly hear her daughter's voice. \"She won't be here in Basel,\" says Louane. \"She's going to be watching on TV, because she's only five.\" \"But she's super proud. She keeps on telling me, 'Maman, you have to bring the trophy home. \"She's just adorable'.\" The Netherlands originally asked last year's entrant, Joost Klein – who was barred from the final after an alleged altercation with a camera operator — the chance to come back for 2025. Although he'd already written a song for the contest, he declined, saying his disqualification still \"stings\". Instead, the honour went to 21-year-old Claude Kiambe, who moved to the Netherlands from the Democratic Republic of Congo when he was nine years old. \"It wasn't always safe in Congo,\" he says. \"I couldn't afford to go to school… and I love school.\" His mum eventually managed to smuggle the family out of the country, and it's to her that his Eurovision song is dedicated. Titled C'est La Vie, it's a joyous blend of Afropop and French chanson that repeats the advice she used to give Claude and his siblings in the asylum centre in Alkmaar. \"She used to tell me, 'C'est la vie. Life is beautiful, even if it is hard sometimes.' \"So when I heard about Eurovision, I was like, 'Wait, if I go there, I want to bring that message to the world'. \"I have a lot of respect for her. She fought through life, and we're still here.\" Claude comes into the contest with a little advantage, as he's known throughout Europe for his massive 2022 hit Ladada. But he's had to pick up a new skill for Eurovision: Choreography. \"I'd only ever done one dance move before, but when I was writing the song, I was like, 'It's time for me to step out of my comfort zone and dance around'.\" Learning the choreography took three days, he reckons. \"We started at 11 and ended at nine. I wanted to know it so well that I could do it in my dreams.\" Ask Erika Vikman to describe her song, and she doesn't pull any punches. \"It's about orgasm.\" Full of pummelling techno beats and what appears to be a Welsh male voice choir, it's one of those tracks that's guaranteed to become part of Eurovision folklore, no matter where it comes in the final. Vikman was once hailed as the queen of Finland's tango scene but gave it up for pop, \"because I can't be very wild with that type of music.\" Citing artists like Madonna, Cher and Lady Gaga as inspiration, she's one of the few artists to take to the stage without dancers. \"Why? Because I'm selfish!\" she laughs. \"I want attention.\" \"No, it's because when I go the stage, I feel like a rock star, and when I feel like a rock star, I really don't need dancers, because it's owning my power and myself.\" She certainly owns the stage – ending her song atop a giant gold microphone that spurts fire as she's hoisted into the sky. Eagle-eyed viewers might notice, however, that her costume is a little less revealing than the one she wore for Finland's selection show, Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu. \"They said that it won't pass if we don't tone down something,\" she says, \"and one of the suggestions was my outfit.\" \"So I was like, 'Okay, if that, that's price to pay, we cover my butt'.\" That doesn't mean she's happy about it. \"The song is about owning your sexuality, and then someone comes and controls me, saying, 'you will ruin every child who is watching this show'. It's a double standard.\" Censorship or not, Vikman's odds of winning shortened dramatically after a barnstorming performance in the semi-finals. \"I have a feeling about it,\" she smiles. \"I can be the dark horse.\" After Thursday's semi-final, UK act Remember Monday shot up the odds... well, kind of. Formerly predicted to come 17th, they're now gunning for 11th place. But the trio - who are the first girlband to represent the UK since the 1999 - are determined to have fun, no matter what the outcome. \"This is all so surreal, beyond anything we could have imagined,\" says singer Lauren Byrne. \"It sounds so cheesy, but it is genuinely everything we've ever wanted,\" says her bandmate Charlotte Steele. \"Who gets to stand up and perform their music, with their two best friends, to millions of people? It's mental.\" \"And listen,\" adds Lauren. \"If we do really badly, we're just gonna keep coming back until we win.\" In their favour, Remember Monday's performance is chirpy and fun, drawing on their background in musical theatre. There's a dress-ripping nod to former UK winners Bucks Fizz, and their live harmonies are exquisite. \"They have an insane amount of experience,\" says Ace Bowerman, a creative director for Dua Lipa and Blackpink, who designed their staging. \"Their performance is constantly moving, and bringing the audience in. Ultimately, the energy we want to create is that people will want to be a part of this band.\" Maybe fans have underestimated Remember Monday's chances because West End show tunes are an untested quantity at Eurovision - but the UK's track record doesn't bode well. We'll have to wait and see what the hell (just) happens. Over four days on the stand, Cassie Ventura became the star witness in the trial against rapper and mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combes. The rapper's ex-girlfriend rejects defence suggestions that her accusations were financially motivated. The mysterious rock group reach the top spot with their latest, even in Arcadia.

    "title": "Ukraine and Russia far apart in direct talks, but prisoner swap agreed",
    "article_text": "More than three years into Europe's deadliest war since 1945, there was a small step forward for diplomacy on Friday. Delegations from Ukraine and Russia came face-to-face for talks for the first time since March 2022 – one month after Moscow's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. The setting was an Ottoman- era palace on the shores of the Bosphorus in Istanbul. Pressure and encouragement from Turkey and the US helped get the warring parties there. There were no handshakes, and half the Ukrainian delegation wore camouflage military fatigues – a reminder that their nation is under attack. The room was decked with Ukrainian, Turkish and Russian flags – two of each – and a large flower arrangement – a world away from the shattered cities and swollen graveyards of Ukraine. Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, told the delegations there were two paths ahead – one road leading to peace, and the other leading to more death and destruction. The talks lasted less than two hours and sharp divisions soon emerged. The Kremlin made \"new and unacceptable demands\", according to a Ukrainian official. That included insisting Kyiv withdraw its troops from large parts of its own territory, he said, in exchange for a ceasefire. While there was no breakthrough on the crucial issue of a truce – as expected - there is news of one tangible result. Each side will return 1,000 prisoners of war to the other. \"This was the very good end to a very difficult day,\" said Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Serhiy Kyslytsya, and \"potentially excellent news for 1,000 Ukrainian families.\" The swap will take place soon, said Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who led his country's delegation. \"We know the date,\" he said, \"we're not announcing it just yet.\" He said  \"the next step\" should be a meeting between Zelensky and Putin. That request was \"noted\" according to the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky – a presidential aide. He said the Russian delegation was satisfied with the talks, and ready to continue contacts. That was a change from Thursday when Russia's Foreign Ministry called President Zelensky \"a clown and a loser.\" But there are fears – among Ukraine and some of its allies – that Russia is engaging in diplomacy simply to buy time, to distract from international pressure for a ceasefire, and to try to stave off the 18th round of European sanctions. The EU says they are already in the works. And while the two sides have now sat around the table, President Trump has said the only talks that count will be those between him and President Putin. He announced on Thursday, mid-flight on Air Force One, that \"nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together.\" It's unclear when that meeting will be. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says top-level talks are \"certainly needed,\" but preparing a summit will take time. Whenever those talks happen, President Zelensky is unlikely to be invited. After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'. Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government, but Moscow's war has dragged on for more than three years. The Russian president had been challenged by Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to meet in person at the talks on Thursday. There is cautious optimism in eastern Ukraine as talks are set to take place in Istanbul. How Russia and Ukraine are placed after three years of fighting ahead of renewed peace talks.",

    "title": "Dizziness from hunger has become a constant, Gazans tell the BBC",
    "article_text": "As crowds gathered at a food distribution point in northern Gaza, six-year-old Ismail Abu Odeh fought his way to the front. \"Give me some,\" he called out. His bowl was filled with lentils, but as he made his way back, it was knocked out of his hands. He returned to his family's tent crying. An uncle who had managed to get some food later shared some with Ismail. The following day, no deliveries of water or food arrived at the displacement camp where he lives, located in a school in Gaza City, and the people gathered there were left with empty bottles and bowls. Ismail cried again. The BBC has spent the past two days speaking to people across Gaza, as Israelramps up its military actionand continues a more than 10-week total blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid. There are mounting warnings from the United Nations and others that the enclave ison the brink of famine. The Israeli government insists there is \"no shortage\" of food in Gaza and that the \"real crisis is Hamas looting and selling aid\". Government ministers have described the stoppage of aidas a \"main pressure lever\"to secure victory over Hamas and get all the hostages out. There are still 58 hostages in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel does not allow international journalists free access to Gaza, so our communication has been over phone calls and WhatsApp messages, and through trusted Palestinian freelancers who live in the territory. Those who spoke to the BBC described their struggle to find even one meal a day, with food kitchens shutting down because of the shortages and few items in the markets. Items that are still available are at highly inflated prices that they cannot afford, they said. A man running one of the remaining food kitchens in Gaza said he was operating \"day by day\" to find food and oil. Another man we spoke to said the kitchen he volunteered at had closed 10 days ago when supplies ran out, describing it as a \"disastrous feeling\". One 23-year-old woman living in north Gaza said \"dizziness has become a constant feeling\" as well as \"general weakness and fatigue from the lack of food and medicine\". Adham al-Batrawi, 31, who used to live in the affluent city of al-Zahra but is now displaced in central Gaza, said hunger was \"one of the most difficult parts of daily life\". He said people had to get \"creative just to survive\", describing through WhatsApp messages how he would over-cook pasta and knead it into a dough before cooking it over a fire to create an imitation of bread - a staple in the Palestinian diet. \"We've invented ways to cook and eat that we never imagined we'd need,\" he said. He added that the one meal a day he had been eating recently was \"just enough to get us through the day, but it's far from enough to meet our energy needs\". Elsewhere in central Gaza, in the city of Deir al-Balah, nurse Rewaa Mohsen said it was a struggle to provide for her two young daughters, aged three and 19 months. She said she had stockpiled nappies during the ceasefire earlier this year but that these would run out in a month. Speaking over WhatsApp on Thursday, she said her daughters had grown used to the sounds of bombing that would ring through the apartment. \"Sometimes I feel more afraid than them,\" she wrote, adding that she would distract her children with colouring books and toys. The next day, over voice note she said evacuation orders had been issued for her area before an Israeli strike hit a nearby building. When she returned to her home to \"clean the mess\",  she found that the doors and windows had been blown off. \"Thank God that I am still alive with my girls,\" she said. When asked if she would stay in the apartment, she responded: \"Where else will I go?\" Across Gaza, medics described the impact of the blockade on medical supplies and said they no longer felt safe at work following Israeli strikes targeting hospitals. Nurse Randa Saied said she was working at the European Hospital in Khan Youniswhen it was hit in an Israeli strikethis week, describing it as a moment of \"pure terror and helplessness\". Israel has long accused Hamas of using hospitals as covert bases and for weapons storage, which the group denies. The European Hospital is no longer operating, but Randa said staff and patients had moved to the nearby Nasser Hospital. \"Our patients are mothers, sons, daughters and siblings - just like us. We know deep in our hearts that our duty must not end, especially now when they need us the most,\" she said. Staff at Nasser and other hospitals in Gaza told the BBC the blockade meant they were running short on basic supplies like painkillers and gauze, and had to shut down some services. The US hasconfirmed that a new system for providing humanitarian aidto Palestinians in Gaza through private companies is being prepared, with Israeli forces set to secure the centres' perimeters. The United Nations has criticised the plan, saying it appears to \"weaponise\" aid. Back in Gaza City, Ismail's father said he struggled with no longer being able to provide for his six children. \"My children go to sleep hungry,\" he said. \"Sometimes I sit and cry like a little kid if I don't manage to provide food for them.\" After seven breathless days of diplomatic hurly burly, we have a clearer idea of the US president's global ideology - and the limits of his 'art of a deal'. The secretary of state's comments come as Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 114 people, according to hospitals and rescuers NYU student Logan Rozos used his speech to accuse the US of supporting a \"genocide\" in Gaza. Tuesday's strike killed 28 people, the Hamas-run civil defence said. Israel says it was a precise strike on Hamas.

    "title": "Celtic urge fans not to attend unofficial title party",
    "article_text": "Celtic are urging its fans not to take part in an unofficial \"title party\" in Glasgow after the last game of the Scottish Premiership season. Thousands of supporters are expected to descend on the Merchant City and Trongate areas of the city on Saturday after the club lift the league trophy following the game against St Mirren at Celtic Park. But Celtic have now asked fans not to attend due to safety fears and concerns from local residents and city officials. Previous gatherings have attracted anti-social behaviour, damage and disruption to the local area. The gatherings are not supported by Police Scotland or Glasgow City Council, which has said similar previous unofficial events\"robbed the public purse\" and described them as \"disruptive\". The expected unofficial celebrations will come on the same day a major Orange walk has been arranged to take place in the city, though it starts in the morning. This has been criticised by police unions, who have suggested there to will be around 500 police officers on duty in Glasgow city centre on Saturday. A Celtic spokesperson said: \"While previous celebrations involving Celtic fans have been well intentioned, unfortunately, as local community stakeholders have made clear in recent weeks, some of these have led to severe congestion and difficulties for emergency services, residents and local businesses. \"Further, without the planning, facilities and infrastructure of an organised, licensed event, the number of supporters present at previous gatherings has become so great that the safety of fans has also become an issue of real concern. \"For all of these reasons, the club would encourage supporters not to attend unlicensed large public gatherings, which do not have safety planning, facilities or infrastructure for supporters attending.\" Last year's gathering resulted in19 arrests, injuries to four police officers and a massive clean-up operation the following day. Tricia Fort, chairwoman of Calton Community Council, said previous gatherings had been \"hellish\" for some people who live around the Trongate and Glasgow Cross areas. She said: \"People who live at Glasgow Cross are moving out (for the day) because it has been so bad before. \"The city council say they can't do anything because nobody has asked them to arrange an alternative, such as Glasgow Green. \"The police are sort of left in the middle and Celtic effectively refuse to organise anything for their supporters - I firmly think they should be arranging a celebration for the fans. The club need to accept their responsibility and step up to the plate.\" A Celtic spokesperson said the club had been \"trying for some time\" to come to an alternative arrangement with city officials which might allow for a \"more suitable venue for celebratory events away from Celtic Park\". Glasgow City Council has said it has received no suggestion of any potential risks from the orange walk taking place in the city after consulting with Police Scotland. But David Kennedy, General Secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said he \"can't understand why the planners allowed this to happen\" on the same day as the expected unofficial gathering. He said: \"I'm shocked and surprised that Glasgow City Council is allowing what is happening tomorrow in Glasgow. \"It will be very difficult for the police - sunny days, high celebrations and alcohol is a great mix for the people who are there but not for those who have to police it. \"Football is a big thing in Scotland, a big thing in Glasgow and we should have proper fan zones so they can go and celebrate and be safe.\" Rose Docherty was the first person to be arrested and charged under a law banning protests outside abortion clinics. Four police officers were injured and 19 people were arrested after 25,000 fans descended on the Merchant City in Glasgow last year. Millie escaped from her garden in Lenzie and made her way onto a train bound for Glasgow Queen Street. Three of the men faced conspiracy charges and were remanded in custody after making no plea. Police looking for Josh Taplin's killer say they are not looking for anyone else and the case is closed.",

    "title": "The poison paradox: How Australia's deadliest animals save lives",
    "article_text": "With a pair of bright pink tweezers in hand, Emma Teni is delicately wrestling a large and leggy spider in a small plastic pot. \"He's posing,\" the spider-keeper jests as it rears up on its back legs. It is exactly what she's trying to achieve - that way she can suck the venom from its fangs using a small pipette. Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders. On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm. The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes. \"Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,\" Emma says matter-of-factly. Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you. While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving. So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981. The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs. In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices. There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans. Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after. \"I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,\" the 26-year-old says. \"I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical.\" \"This is curing my fear of spiders,\" he jokes. As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and \"throw themselves into danger\". Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it. \"Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,\" she says. \"[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, will… effectively save someone's life.\" All of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored. Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public. Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains. The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts. While a few drops is enough to kill, scientists need to milk 200 of these spiders to have enough to fill one vial of antivenom. A marine biologist by training, Emma never expected to spend her days milking spiders. In fact, she started off working with seals. But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even \"weirdo\", as her daughter calls her. Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies. \"Some girls arrive home to flowers on their doorstep,\" jokes Emma. \"For me it's not unusual to arrive home to a spider in a jar.\" Spiders represent just one small part of what the Australian Reptile Park does. It's also been providing snake venom to the government since the 1950s. According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 140,000 people die across the world from snake bites every year, and three times that many are left disabled. In Australia though, those numbers are far lower: between one and four people each year, thanks to its successful antivenom programme. Removing a King Brown snake from its storage locker, Billy Collett, the park's operations manager, brings it to the table in front of him. With his bare hands, he secures its head and puts its jaws over a shot glass covered in cling film. \"They are very uninclined to bite but once they go, you just see it pouring out of the fangs,\" Mr Collett says, as yellow venom drips to the bottom. \"That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more.\" Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: \"They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone.\" \"To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,\" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles. There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled \"Death Adder\", \"Taipan\", \"Tiger Snake\" and \"Eastern Brown\". The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia. This venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months. The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system. The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year. The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered. CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year – including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies. \"It's an enormous undertaking,\" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom development team at CSL Seqirus. \"First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in.\" Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania. Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites. Papua New Guinea also receives about 600 vials a year. The country was once connected to Australia by a land bridge, and shares many of the same snake species, so the Australian government gives the antivenom for free – snake diplomacy, if you like. \"To be honest, we probably have the most impact in Papua New Guinea, more so than Australia, because of the number of snake bites and deaths they have,\" says CSL Seqirus executive Chris Larkin. To date, they reckon they've saved 2,000 lives. Back at the park, Mr Collett jokes about the nickname of \"danger noodles\" that is sometimes given to his serpentine colleagues – a classic Australian trait of making light of something that gives so many visitors nightmares. Mr Collett, though, is clear: these animals should not put people off from visiting. \"Snakes aren't just cruising down the streets attacking Brits - it doesn't work like that,\" he jokes. \"If you're going to get bitten by a snake, Australia's the best place – we've got the best antivenom. It's free. The treatment is unreal.\" Oscar Jenkins, 33, is sentenced to 13 years by a Russian-controlled court in eastern Ukraine. Australia's Mitchell Starc will not return to the IPL on its resumption on Saturday, leaving him clear to prepare for the World Test Championship final. Ben Roberts-Smith says he now intends to appeal the landmark judgement in the High Court. Erin Patterson is on trial for allegedly murdering three relatives and injuring another with a toxic meal. Yang Hengjun is serving a suspended death sentence in a Chinese jail on espionage charges.",

    "title": "Rugby star Jamie Roberts 'excited' to become junior doctor",
    "article_text": "Former Wales rugby international Jamie Roberts says he is \"ready\" and \"excited\" to become a junior doctor and complete his medical training in the NHS. Twelve years after graduating from Cardiff University's school of medicine, the former British and Irish Lion will begin two years of foundation training in hospitals in south Wales. Roberts won 94 caps for Wales and was the British and Irish Lions' Player of the Series following their tour of South Africa in 2009, before being selected again for the Australia tour in 2013. The 38-year-old said rugby had given him \"some of the best experiences\" of his life and he was \"looking forward to the same in a medical career\". Roberts made his debut for Wales against Scotland in 2008, while he was a medical student. \"I always wanted to play rugby. It was a passion of mine,\" Roberts told BBC News. \"I loved the sport, I still do and it will stay with me forever. But I was a problem-solver at school. \"I love maths and I love science and I love people, I guess. And medicine was the perfect fit and ticked a lot of boxes for me.\" In the UK, medical training involves an undergraduate degree which usually takes five years to complete, followed by a two-year foundation programme when trainees become junior doctors and are paid a salary. It took Roberts seven years to complete his undergraduate degree because of his commitments with Wales, the Lions and Cardiff Blues. \"I reflect on it now and I wonder how on earth I did that. You know, the enthusiasm of youth helps. I was very busy. I was very driven,\" he said. He sat his final undergraduate exams in 2013 - the same week that he was part of a Wales side which won the Six Nations after defeating England by 30-3 - and graduated a few months later. \"You know, we won the tournament here [in Cardiff], and then a month or two later - having sat my medical finals in that Wales v England week - I got my exam results,\" he recalled. \"I guess it was the culmination of a lot of hard work over both disciplines.\" After graduating, Roberts spent the next decade focused on his rugby career, playing at centre for several clubs including Racing Metro, Harlequins, Bath, Dragons and Waratahs. But academia continued to give the aspiring doctor the escape from rugby he said he \"craved\", and he completed postgraduate degrees at both Loughborough University and Cambridge University. He became a father in 2021, before retiring from rugby the following year. \"When you finish playing rugby, you know, when people ask you what you're doing it's sometimes challenging when you can't really answer that question and you're doing random bits and bobs,\" he said. In November 2023, Roberts passed a \"return to medicine\" exam which allowed him to resume his medical training. So, in which field does he hope to specialise? \"I was obviously very interested in my own injuries. I had quite a few big ones,\" he said. \"Reconstructive surgery to quite a few of my joints, a fractured skull as well. \"Whether I can foresee a future in sports medicine, or orthopaedics, that's what I'm naturally leaning towards.\" Roberts follows in the footsteps of several other Wales internationals who turned their hands to medicine, including Dr Jack Matthews, orthopaedic surgeon JPR Williams, former captain Dr Gwyn Jones and, more recently, Hallam Amos. \"I've a massive amount of respect for everyone who works for the NHS,\" said Roberts. \"I've no doubt it's challenging at times and I've no doubt I'm going to feel that, but again that's the challenge isn't it. It rewards you in many different ways, so I'm looking forward to it.\" As one of the most familiar faces in Welsh sport, Roberts said being recognised by patients was \"always great.\" \"People love rugby in Wales. As a student that had its rewards for me - it's a great way of connecting with people and again, I'm excited by that.\" Reflecting on his sporting career, Roberts added: \"I gave the game everything I had and it roared at me in such amazing ways. \"It's given me some of the best experiences of my life and I'm looking forward to the same in a medical career.\" The parents of a student who took her own life want to make sure people are supported with their care. One mum says she was told \"it isn't the Hilton\" when asking for a pillow. Tracy Turner admitted six charges of arranging the commission of child sex offences and two charges of making indecent images of a child. Another review is under way into allegations staff allowed people into operating theatres. A leading GP says a rise in National Insurance is an \"absolute crisis\" and could see job losses.",

    "title": "'We had to be on board' last run of UK's longest train route",
    "article_text": "It is a route which has operated for more than 100 years, but for the UK's longest direct train service linking Aberdeen and Penzance it is finally the end of the line. The connection - first established back in 1921 - is 775 miles (1,247km) long. However, the packed train from the north east of Scotland on Friday morning was the last to run the route, and arrived in Cornwall more than 13 hours later at 21:40. Operator CrossCountry said the decision to end the service was aimed at a \"more efficient timetable\". One passenger, Aimee Smith, 40, had made the journey to Aberdeen specifically so as she could join the final trip south and be part of rail history. \"All good things do come to an end,\" she told BBC Scotland News. It is believed the end of the service means the connection between Aberdeen and Plymouth is now the longest direct route, at 695 miles (1,118km). Aimee, who lives in Derby, has loved trains since she was a child. \"When I was young, my granddad lived in Wigginton near Tamworth. I am one of 21 cousins and we used to meet up and obviously when you've got a load of under-12s hanging around they used to try and burn off some energy,\" she recalled. \"So we would go over to a train bridge and wave at the train drivers as they went on the line down to Tamworth. That was quite fun.\" When she heard about the end of the Aberdeen to Penzance service, she knew she had to be involved. \"I saw it come up on my phone, because I get lots of rail-related stuff,\" Aimee said. \"I thought 'oh my gosh, that's amazing'.\" Aimee travelled the reverse route to get to Aberdeen for the final journey. \"I am travelling up on the train and down on the train so I'll have seen a lot of the train line,\" she said. Aimee added that her hope was to \"meet some really nice people\", have a nice chat, and \"generally just enjoy it\", while armed with a litre of orange juice. She explained: \"I've got my book, for when it's a bit quieter, hopefully some like-minded souls, talk trains and talk philosophy. \"I'm very excited about just being there and being part of the whole experience really. It is going to be sad. I'm sure I'll look out for other long train journeys.\" Friends Danny, 24, Kieran, 22, and 18-year-old Liam could hardly contain their excitement before heading off. Danny, from Edinburgh, said: \"It's quite a cool journey to do within the rail enthusiast community as it's the longest.\" Liam, from Elgin in Moray, added: \"It's always been a bucket list thing for me, I am really excited. \"I have wanted to do this my whole life.\" Including Aberdeen and Penzance, there are 41 stops on the route, featuring cities such as Edinburgh, Newcastle and Leeds. John Labrow, 66, from Manchester, got a special T-shirt printed to mark the special occasion. \"It's probably the longest journey I've ever done by train, it's the last of a great era, \" he said. \"It's a privilege.\" He decided to get the T-shirt printed to tell the story of the journey from Aberdeen to Penzance, and have a memento of the day. The service was also removed from the timetable during the pandemic, terminating at Plymouth during 2020, and was not reinstated as the full Aberdeen to Penzance route until May 2023. Luke Iden said he learned about a \"buzz\" about the route online and decided to book the journey. The 20-year-old from Bournemouth works in rail maintenance and has always been into trains. \"I am just happy that I'm here in the moment and can always say I've done it now,\" he said. The amateur film-maker said he would be shooting footage out the window to pass much of the time. Train driver Martin Wallace was only assigned to the route in August last year. He said he was delighted to be involved in the historic trip on Friday. \"It's very exciting, isn't it,\" he said, just before departing. \"The last voyage.\" A CrossCountry spokesperson said: \"Amending our Aberdeen to Penzance service from May will mean a more efficient timetable for our train crews and a more convenient service for our customers, making a day trip from Bristol and the west of England to Penzance more viable. \"The new timetable will also deliver an additional service in each direction between Glasgow and the north east of England towards Birmingham.\" The Grade Il listed building in the city centre has stood empty since 2007. Aberdeen manager Jimmy Thelin and Dundee United and St Mirren counterparts Jim Goodwin and Stephen Robinson look forward to the battle for European qualification places in Saturday's final Scottish Premiership fixtures. Six people have been arrested and remain in custody said Derbyshire Police. A food group is seeking talks with administrators in the hope of forming a new organisation. The former home secretary says the proposal would deliver a huge boost to jobs, growth and housing.",

    "title": "Mexico accuses Youtuber MrBeast of exploiting Mayan pyramids filming permit",
    "article_text": "Mexico is seeking compensation from US YouTuber MrBeast and a production company, accusing them of exploiting the nation's ancient pyramids for commercial gain. The video \"I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples\" shows the influencer and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit from local authorities. But in one part of the video, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week,  MrBeast advertises his chocolate product as a \"Mayan dessert\" and urges viewers to buy it. Authorities said that while they had given permission for the Youtuber to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations. A spokesperson for the Youtuber told the BBC: \"No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History).\" In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site. The spokesperson also said the video was \"meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico\" and that it was \"unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures\". Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted. In the video's caption, MrBeast - whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson- thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product. The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and Chichén Itzá. At one point he says \"I can't believe the government's letting us do this.\" They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask. But heritage authorities said these were \"false assertions\" and accused the Youtuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene. \"All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,\" its statement on Monday read. Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising. \"We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation,\" she said. She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the \"knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage\" it was firmly against those who \"take advantage of the willingness of institutions\". She said INAH would consider \"administrative sanctions\" against the production company Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm. MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May. The infrastructure of humanity's journey into space may only be decades old, but some of it has already been lost. Now, \"space archaeologists\" are scrambling to save what's left. Prosecutors say they are treating the killing of 23-year-old Valeria Marquez as a femicide. Whole TV shows shot in one long take are made possible by new lightweight cameras. Rob Keating, 39, is found guilty of two counts of stalking after pursuing a social media influencer. A BBC investigation sees 13-15-year-olds shown posts about knives, bullying and death.",

    "article_text": "Rock band Sleep Token have scored their first ever UK number one album. The British group's fourth full-length release, Even In Arcadia, shot to the top of the chart after three top 40 singles in as many months. Formed in 2016, the group have never revealed their identities, wearing masks at all times and rarely speaking in public, with posts speculating about who they are regularly going viral. Critics have accused the band of using gimmicks to boost their popularity, while fans say Sleep Token's distinctive sound, which blends heavy metal with poppy, R&B elements, sets them apart. Building off their 2023 release, Take Me to Eden, which reached number three, the band now has 9.4 million monthly listeners on Spotify. The streamer said earlier this week that Even in Arcadia was its top new album, outranking releases from Kali Uchis and Pink Pantheress. Announcing the UK chart on BBC Radio 1's Official Chart Show, host Jack Saunders said it was a \"a groundbreaking rock record\". \"It's accessible enough but also loveable enough for those who do really love the genre to really keep it close,\" he said. \"I think it's brilliant.\" But not everyone is convinced. Music website Pitchfork - known for its sometimes-scathing takes - described the band as \"schmaltzy and dull\". Reviewer Eli Enis said Even in Arcadia \"feels means-tested to maximize cross-market potential\". Music critic Anthony Fantano, of The Needle Drop YouTube channel, describing it as \"boring, uninspired, and uninteresting\" and \"metal for Disney adults\". Sleep Token's previous record also had a lukewarm response from professional critics, but that didn't prevent it from being a success. The group are due to headline Download Festival in Leicestershire next month, along with Green Day and Korn. It's the first time any of the bands have topped the bill at the rock gathering. Other acts due to perform include McFly, Bullet For My Valentine, Don Broco, Alien Ant Farm, Spiritbox, Poppy and CKY. Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.

    "title": "'Quite a surprise' to spot 4ft shark swimming in river",
    "article_text": "A man has said he \"couldn't believe\" what he was seeing when he came across a shark swimming in an east Belfast river. Thomas Davidson was cycling through Victoria Park on Tuesday evening when he spotted a 4ft-long starry smooth-hound shark in the Connswater River, where the waterway meets Belfast Lough. The species of shark has been seen in other urban areas such as theRiver Thamesand theRiver Mersey estuary. Dr Patrick Collins, a marine biologist at Queen's University, said while \"it's not something you see everyday, it's not something super unusual either\". \"In the past I would occasionally have seen several 2-3lb mullet follow the tide in, but on this occasion I saw a much larger shape in the water adjacent to Airport Road,\" Mr Davidson told BBC News NI. He said this shape was \"too big to be a mullet\", so he stopped to take a closer look. \"A dorsal fin slowly broke the surface revealing that familiar profile that looked like a shark,\" he said. \"I quickly took out my phone and started to video this slow-moving fish as it meandered left and right up and downstream, getting mobbed by a few gulls. \"I couldn't believe what I was watching.\" The shark continued swimming in this section of river for about 30 minutes before moving upstream into a shadow area and Mr Davidson lost sight of it. \"I felt very lucky to witness such a lengthy sighting and was left curious as to how far upstream it might go,\" he said. TheConnswater Riverrises in the Castlereagh hills and runs northwards through east Belfast, getting wider until it reaches the sea at Belfast Lough. The river route includes the Connswater Greenway walking route and flows past CS Lewis Square and Connswater Shopping Centre. Mr Davidson said it was \"quite a surprise\" and he will \"continue to look out for it and others in the future\". This type of shark mainly eat crabs and small crustaceans, marine biologist Dr Patrick Collins said. The section of the river in Victoria Park probably contained crabs, and so this shark spotted by Mr Davidson was \"probably just having its lunch\", he explained. He said it is \"not very common to find smooth-hounds in cities, but they have been recorded in the last few years\". \"It's a little bit unusual if you're walking your dog to find one that close to the city, and that easy to see, but they're not a rare animal,\" Dr Collins continued. \"They're found fairly commonly across the UK and Ireland. It's not an unusual occurrence to have them close to an urban centre because there's sea water there. \"It's a bit like seeing a deer in farmland.\" He added thatthis type of sharkposes no risk to the public. \"Because of movies like Jaws and some other strange public perceptions coming from that, there's this idea that all sharks are dangerous animals - they're a type of fish. \"These animals pose absolutely no threat to us whatsoever.\" Mr Brown's family say it is the largest demonstration that has been held in support of their fight for a public inquiry. Mr Lynskey went missing in 1972, and republicans have claimed he was \"executed and buried\" by the IRA.

    "title": "Record lows for Man Utd & Spurs - but who's in best shape for Bilbao?",
    "article_text": "Manchester United play Tottenham in the Europa League final on Wednesday, 21 May All eyes will be on Bilbao now as Manchester United and Tottenham switch focus from their disappointing domestic campaigns and try to win the Europa League. With both sides languishing in the bottom half of the table, securing a European trophy - and a place in next season's Champions League - would ensure they finish the campaign on a high. Having lost their penultimate Premier League fixtures on Friday, there was no winning send-off before their meeting in Spain. Manchester United suffered an 18th loss of the campaign with a 1-0 defeat at Chelsea, while it was 21 for Tottenham after they were beaten 2-0 by Aston Villa. But with everything now riding on Europa League success, just how are both sides shaping up ahead of the final? Tottenham are in danger of finishing the season just one place above the relegation zone Friday night's defeats for United and Spurs continued their dismal run domestically. Tottenham have now lost 25 games in all competitions this season, the most in a single campaign in their history, while 18 league defeats for Manchester United is their most since losing 20 in 1973-74 - the last season in which they were relegated from the top flight. United have also gone eight league games without a win (D2 L6) for the first time since an 11-game stretch between December 1989 and February 1990. Spurs, meanwhile, have won just one of their last 11 Premier League games (D2 L8) since beating bottom side Southampton 3-1 in April. They've also conceded in each of their last 12 league games, their longest run without a clean sheet since 17 between August and December 2010. Both sides, though, will look to their form in Europe before Wednesday's showpiece - which has been in contrast to their domestic struggles. They are unbeaten in their last five Europa League outings, winning four of those fixtures on their way to reaching the final. Chelsea go fourth as Cucurella sinks Man Utd Villa swat aside Spurs to move into top five Ruben Amorim chose to name a strong XI at Chelsea, including starting Players' Player of the Season Bruno Fernandes The team selections made by both United boss Ruben Amorim and Spurs counterpart Ange Postecoglou for Friday's games provided some insight into their thinking for the Europa League final. Postecoglou opted to rest several of his key players as AntonÃ­n Kinsky started in goal, with Guglielmo Vicario on the bench alongside Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson, Richarlison and Pedro Porro. Amorim, meanwhile, opted to bring back his regular starters, having rested some of them for the 2-0 home loss to West Ham on Sunday, 11 May. Goalkeeper Andre Onana was not in the squad that day as Altay Bayindir started, but returned to face Chelsea. Amorim suggested after the game he was prioritising his key players feeling competitive before the final rather than feeling rested. \"We have to prepare for each competition, with five days we can rest,\" he told BBC Sport. \"We have five days to prepare [for the Europa League final], two days to fully recover and then two days to prepare. \"Of course, we are excited to be in the final. Since day one the pressure has been there, but I live quite well with the pressure. When you have the final of any cup, we show up, so we are prepared for that.\" Son Heung-min has scored 11 goals for Spurs in all competitions this season Tottenham have had the measure of Manchester United this season, beating them home and away in the Premier League and also in the Carabao Cup. They will also likely back themselves to score against the Red Devils, having hit 21 more league goals than them, despite sitting fourth from bottom with United a place above. In fact, no team outside the top six has scored more than Tottenham's 63 goals. Keeping them out, however, has been an issue with 61 league goals conceded, while United have fared marginally better with 54. Encouragement for Postecoglou will also come from a lively first-half display by Son Heung-min against Villa. The forward is looking to return to peak fitness after being sidelined with a foot injury and went close to scoring before the break. Son, 32, has lost his last two finals with Spurs and will no doubt be determined to end his trophy drought with the club after a decade. \"He is ready and available,\" Postecoglou said of Son. \"He feels like he is getting back to some rhythm.\" United, meanwhile, could only muster one shot on target against Chelsea with Rasmus Hojlund again struggling to make an impact in attack. The forward has scored just three goals in his last 15 appearances in all competitions. \"They have a problem, they have no striker,\" former Manchester United captain Roy Keane told Sky Sports. \"Hojlund looked like a young boy from the academy. He is not good enough to be the main man. United are up against it all the time.\" Playing your strongest side brings with it the risk of an important player picking up an injury that would rule them out of the final. Fortunately for Amorim i twas a risk that paid off as his team appeared to come through the Chelsea test unscathed. Instead, it was Tottenham who have more concerns after Pape Sarr went off in the first half against Villa with a back issue, although Postecoglou said he was taken off as a precaution. Spurs certainly don't need their injury issues compounding, with key players like Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison already ruled out of the Europa League final. While not solely to blame for their dreadfully poor domestic campaigns, injuries have certainly hampered both clubs. According to data from PremierInjuries.com, Tottenham have had the third worst injury crisis in the Premier League, with United the fifth. In total, Spurs had lost 1,414 days to injuries and suffered 38 separate injuries this season â both the third highest tallies in the league. United, meanwhile, had lost 1,229 days to injury â the fifth most â with 30 separate injuries, which was the seventh highest figure. However, Brighton are sat in the top 10 of the Premier League, despite having the worst injury issues so far this season. According to the data the Seagulls are top with 1,862 days lost to 44 separate injuries - as of 15 May. But despite their poor domestic form and injury concerns, everything can go out of the window for a one-off cup final. United are looking to win the Europa League for the second time in the last decade and their fifth major European trophy overall. And Keane said: \"You still have to fancy United. \"I think history carries a bit of weight. League form, there's not much between them, both have been desperate, but United's history in finals and more knowledge around the big games, that might edge it.\" For ex-Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp there's nothing between the two sides. \"This feels like a 50/50 game,\" he added. \"This is a chance for Tottenham to change history and narrative. \"Ange will become the biggest decision of Daniel Levy's life.  The league form has been diabolical but a first trophy would make it really difficult to sack him. \"If they win a cup, it is hero status.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Chelsea fate in own hands & Villa hope - six teams in top-five hunt",
    "article_text": "Marc Cucurella kept Chelsea's Champions League hopes in their own hands Chelsea have Champions League qualification in their own hands and Aston Villa moved into the top five as both teams won in the Premier League on Friday. The Blueslooked as if they were going to drop to sixth before Marc Cucurella's 71st-minute header earned a 1-0 win over Manchester United. Aston Villa,who would have had their fate in their hands had Cucurella not scored, beat Tottenham 2-0. Unai Emery's side are up to fifth, but sixth-placed Manchester City, one point below them, play Bournemouth on Tuesday (20:00 BST) in their game in hand. Chelsea know a win at Nottingham Forest on the final day would seal a Champions League spot, but seventh-placed Forest are still in the hunt themselves. Cucurella said: \"Step by step we are creating something special and now only two games left to achieve something special. \"The most important thing is it depends on us, so we have to play the game on Sunday [25 May] and then we are thinking about the [Conference League] final [against Real Betis].\" Aston Villa will probably have to beat Manchester United at Old Trafford and hope rivals drop points. \"We can get Champions League, fantastic,\" said Villa boss Emery. \"We are wishing to continue in the season we are doing. We are now in a good moment.\" England will have six teams in next season's Champions League - the top five in the Premier League and the winners of the Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham. The bonus fifth spot through the league came as a result of English teams' good performances in Europe this season - with Spain also gaining one. Arsenal host Newcastle on Sunday (16:30 BST) in a game that could go a long way to deciding another place or two. The Gunners would seal their spot with a win, while a draw would practically make it safe because of their superior goal difference. Newcastle would go up to second with a win and take them close to sealing a Champions League place. If Arsenal lose that game, they could yet finish outside the Champions League places, despite having seemingly had second place sewn up for months. However, they do play rock bottom Southampton on the final day. FA Cup finalists Manchester City have to get at least a point on Tuesday against Bournemouth to go back into the top five. While six sides wrestle over the remaining up-for-grab spots, Liverpool have long been guaranteed Champions League football and have already won the Premier League. Forest's chances are now quite slim and they visit West Ham this Sunday (14:15) knowing a defeat would end their hopes. They sit four points off the top five. The prize of a place in the Champions League has added spice to Wednesday's Europa League final between Manchester United and Tottenham in Bilbao. Both have endured wretched Premier League seasons and sit 16th and 17th respectively in the competition, but a highly lucrative crack at Europe's elite is nonetheless within touching distance. Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports: \"It's beautiful. The pressure is on Manchester City. \"It could be a big play-off between Chelsea and Forest. You could take it on another level and look at Arsenal.\" Ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane added: \"Man City should be able to deal with the scenario. Wouldn't it be amazing if Newcastle win at Arsenal? It is really exciting.\" Arsenal:Newcastle (H); Southampton (A) Newcastle:Arsenal (A); Everton (H) Chelsea:Nottingham Forest (A) Aston Villa:Manchester United (A) Manchester City:Bournemouth (H); Fulham (A) Nottingham Forest:West Ham (A); Chelsea (H) Chances of Champions League qualification, according to statisticians Opta: Arsenal: 99.8% Newcastle: 92.5% Manchester City: 87.2% Chelsea: 60% Aston Villa: 49.2% Nottingham Forest: 11.3% A good season in the Champions League can earn teams about Â£100m. Teams would get Â£16m without even needing to pick up a point. Each point they earn in the league phase pockets them an extra Â£600,000 and each place in the 36-team table is worth over Â£200,000. Each knockout round that teams reach, excluding the play-offs, means an extra Â£10m at least. Sixth place, at the moment, is the only guaranteed Europa League spot through the league - but more places are likely to become available. The winners of Saturday's FA Cup final between Manchester City and Crystal Palace (16:30) will qualify for the Europa League. However, if that is City - and they finish in a European place as seems likely - then seventh in the Premier League would become a Europa spot. Newcastle have a minimum guarantee of a Conference League place after winning the Carabao Cup - but they will hope not to need it. If the Magpies finish in a European qualifying position in the league - reaching the Champions League or Europa League - then their Conference League spot goes to the league. That will be either seventh place, or eighth place, depending on the identity of the FA Cup winners. There is a scenario where that spot becomes a Europa League place instead - if Chelsea win the Conference League final in Wroclaw and finish outside the top five. If that happened, England would not have a team in the Conference League. The Blues would be guaranteed a Europa League place at least, if they beat Betis on Wednesday, 28 May - a game which comes after the final day of the Premier League campaign. Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest are already guaranteed a European place - but it remains to be seen which competition they go into. Brentford currently occupy eighth place in the Premier League, which is more than likely to be a European place unless Palace win the FA Cup. But the Bees are only above Brighton on goal difference, with Bournemouth two points behind and Fulham four points off. Brentford host Fulham on Sunday (15:00) with the Cottagers needing to win that to have any hope of Europe.

The 25-year-old cleared 4.75m in warm and windy conditions at the Suheim bin Hamad Stadium in Qatar to finish top of the standings. Neither Roberta Bruni of Italy nor USA's Katie Moon could clear the height as they finished second and third with vaults of 4.63m. \"I absolutely have a lot of fire in me and that's a good thing ahead of the new season,\" said Caudery. She won the World Indoor title last year to become Britain's first world champion in the discipline. However, Cauderyfailed to make the finalof the event at last summer's Olympic Games in Paris. In the 1500m, Scotland's Jemma Reekie finished a credible third with a time of four minutes 7.33 seconds as Nelly Chepchirchir strode clear in 4:05.00, ahead of Kenyan team-mate Susan Ejore. Elsewhere, Amy Hunt finished third in the 100m in a time of 11.03 as she took .09 seconds off her personal best. The race was won by Tia Clayton, who outshone two-time Olympic 100m champion and Jamaican compatriot Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. The 38-year-old Fraser-Pryce was competing on the Diamond League circuit for the first time in three years, but could only finish fourth as Clayton, 20, won easily in a world-leading time of 10.92. Clayton's twin sister Tina was second in 11.02, while Fraser-Pryce, competing in possibly her final season, clocked a season's best 11.05 for fourth. Reigning men's Olympic 200m champion Letsile Tebogo produced a lacklustre performance for success in his signature event as he was almost caught on the line by Courtney Lindsey. Botswana's Tebogo ran a smooth bend but seemed to lack fluency in the home straight and glanced to his right at Lindsey as he crossed the line in a modest 20.10, one hundredth of a second ahead of the American. In the men's 800m, Tshepiso Masalela chased down Wycliffe Kinyamal to clock 1:43.11, the fastest time in the world this year. Meanwhile, Lawrence Okoye finished sixth in the discus with a throw of 65.01m, while fellow Briton Laviai Nielsen finished seventh in the 400m with a time of 52.02.

    "article_text": "Carlos Alcaraz beat Lorenzo Musetti to prevent an all-Italian final in Rome World number one Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final against Carlos Alcaraz by fighting back to beat American Tommy Paul. Playing on home clay in his first tournament since a three-month doping ban, Sinner overcame an off-key start before overcoming the 11th seed 1-6 6-0 6-3. In front of a packed and partisan centre court in Rome, the 23-year-old stretched his unbeaten run to 26 matches and moved one win away from being the first Italian men's singles winner at the tournament since Adriano Panatta in 1976. In a topsy-turvy match, Paul raced to a 5-0 lead en route to a stunning first-set success, during which Sinner made 13 unforced errors and just two winners. But the match flipped from the start of the second set as the home favourite steamrollered past Paul to win nine successive games, and the American could not recover. Earlier on Friday, Alcaraz dashed home hopes of an all-Italian final by beating Lorenzo Musetti 6-3 7-6 (7-4). Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz looks in good shape for the French Open later this month. The reigning Roland Garros champion reached a fourth final of the season by winning in straight sets in just over two hours. For Musetti, it was a fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard, including a loss when they met on clay in the Monte Carlo final last month. The 23-year-old Musetti gave up three breaks of serve and made 29 unforced errors in the first set, and was warned by the umpire after slamming his racquet into the clay. The players exchanged breaks at the start of the second set and Musetti moved 4-3 ahead with some spectacular shots, but Alcaraz broke back in game eight â causing his furious opponent to smash a ball into the stands. Alcaraz, 22, kept his cool to win the tie-break and pave the way for the final on Sunday that so many tennis fans wanted.

But Piastri pointed out that McLaren's rivals, particularly Mercedes and Max Verstappen's Red Bull, tend to improve into Saturday. \"I don't think it's just Lando and me,\" he said. \"There are a few others who will join us in the fight tomorrow so we have got to keep our heads down and find a bit more. \"Saturday has been very important pretty much everywhere this year, and Imola - regardless of what the rest of this year has looked like - is a place where qualifying means a lot.\" The top five drivers were covered by less than 0.1secs in first practice but in the second session the McLarens stretched their advantage - Alpine's Pierre Gasly was 0.276secs slower than Piastri in third place, ahead of George Russell's Mercedes, Verstappen and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. How to follow Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix on the BBC Incredible images from 75 years of F1 The presence of an Alpine in third place underlines that the headline lap times from Friday practice should not be taken too seriously, even if Norris pointed out that the French team are often strong at Imola. \"Alpine were quick,\" Norris said. \"They've always been quick here and I'm sure Red Bull will catch up, and Mercedes will be on it when they turn their engines up. But a productive Friday.\" With overtaking so difficult around Imola, qualifying positions will be important, but McLaren showed their usual strong pace over a long run. They were about 0.5secs a lap on average quicker than Verstappen, who Piastri overtook in the course of the race-simulation laps in the final part of the session. Verstappen, whose car has a small upgrade around the front of the sidepods this weekend, said: \"We definitely need a bit more to get a better through-corner balance to go faster. It's the same in the long runs. \"I got overtaken by the McLarens, so that says enough. They pull away. But even then compared to other teams it was a bit tough today.\" Leclerc's Ferrari was a match for the McLarens on race pace, and Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes was just 0.2secs off. The 18-year-old Italian, whose family home is just half an hour from the track, failed to put a lap together on the softest tyres and was 18th on the timesheets. Leclerc said: \"Our weak point is qualifying pace at the moment and we still need to work on that. \"The race pace was strong but this is a track where overtaking is very difficult. We have to focus on our qualifying pace.\" This video can not be played 'I have won more than any other driver in history' - Hamilton Lewis Hamilton, on the occasion of his first race for Ferrari in Italy, was 11th fastest in the second Ferrari after being fifth, and just 0.096secs from Piastri, in the first session. The seven-time champion said he had been happy with the car early on but between the sessions he \"changed two tiny things that shouldn't have had any effect at all, the smallest change we've probably done this year and we had some brake issues that made a massive difference, so that was then a fight with that.\" Hamilton was vague on what specifically the problem was. Asked whether it was to do with the change to a different brake manufacturer at Ferrari from the one he was used to with Mercedes for 12 years, he said: \"It's not the transition. It's the performance ofâ¦\" and then his voice trailed off. In the pool interview, which is the only driver access provided to the media on Friday, he was not pressed for an explanation. He added: \"It's a lottery. We will roll the dice. We put on one and it works, put another one on and it doesn't and we'll see. I hope tomorrow we figure something out. We're working on it for sure.\" Russell, who has had strong qualifying form this season, said that the decision to bring the softest three tyre compounds to this race could have an influence. Pirelli has widened its range to six compounds this season, introducing a softest tyre that was originally intended only for street circuits, where tyre degradation is usually low. However, it has been decided to use it in Imola to try to add an extra dimension to the grand prix, hoping the softer range of compounds might shift the race away from from the standard one-stop strategy at the track. Russell said: \"There is a lot of tyre degradation. We have the softest tyres here for the first time this season and that spices things up a bit. \"But we know McLaren generally seem to extend their advantage in those conditions. \"I had Oscar in my sights and then I didn't. He passed Max and then went off. That's just where we are at the minute as a team. We know our fight is with Max and the Ferraris.\" Williams driver Alex Albon said he did not expect strategy to change, saying the medium tyre had proved \"really good\" with \"pretty low deg\". The race runs were interrupted when Isack Hadjar, seventh fastest overall for Racing Bulls, lost his car on the exit of the Tamburello chicane and spun into the barriers. The car appeared to have escaped largely undamaged, but Hadjar became stuck in the gravel as he attempted to return to the track and the session was red-flagged. It did restart, but only in time for some drivers to do a single flying lap. Behind Hadjar in the list of fastest times, Yuki Tsunoda was eighth fastest in the second Red Bull, ahead of Albon and team-mate Carlos Sainz. Lance Stroll, given the responsibility to test Aston Martin's major upgrades, which included a new floor, was down in 17th. Team-mate Fernando Alonso, in the previous-specification car for a back-to-back comparison, was three places higher and 0.121secs quicker. Stroll said the car felt \"the same\". And although it features a new floor and engine cover, the Canadian described the upgrade as \"small changes\". The first practice session had been brought to a premature end when Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto crashed at the second Rivazza corner, flicking into the barriers pretty much front-on and damaging his front wing and nose.

    "title": "Guardiola unhappy Bournemouth game not moved",
    "article_text": "Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will be playing in their third consecutive FA Cup final on Saturday Pep Guardiola says he asked for Manchester City's Premier League game against Bournemouth to be moved from next Tuesday, believing it should \"definitely\" be played later in the week. City face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday (kick-off 16:30 BST) and host the Cherries just three days later as they attempt to finish in the Premier League's top five, having dropped down to sixth place following Friday night wins for both Chelsea and Aston Villa. Scheduling City's game against Bournemouth for next Wednesday would have clashed with the all-English Europa League final between Tottenham and Manchester United. Guardiola, though, pointed to Tottenham's Premier League game at Aston Villa being brought forward two days from the original date of 18 May to give them more time to prepare for the European final. He saw that as an indication of the league having the ability to be flexible. Asked if he would have preferred the Bournemouth game to be pushed back to the Wednesday or Thursday, Guardiola replied: \"Definitely.\" City's Spanish manager added: \"Tottenham Hotspur play against Aston Villa on Friday [because of] the Europa League final, yeah? Good decision. \"Honestly, I am not making irony or being sarcastic, the Premier League made a good decision, very good.\" This video can not be played \"It dilutes a fantastic occasion.\" Early exits from the Champions League and EFL Cup mean City will play a total of 57 games in all competitions this season. Last season they played 59, while in the 2022-23 Treble-winning campaign they had 61 games. With 60, Tottenham and United will both play more matches than any other Premier League club this season following their runs in the Europa League. City are preparing for their third straight FA Cup final, and they have also travelled to Wembley for seven consecutive semi-finals in the competition, which Guardiola called a \"huge achievement\". This season was the first time during that sequence in which City have played their FA Cup semi-final on a Sunday. In the previous six campaigns, they always had a Champions League or Premier League fixture on the preceding Wednesday. 2023-24: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Thursday (Premier League) 2022-23: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League) 2021-22: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League) 2020-21: Wednesday (Champions League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Wednesday (Premier League) 2019-20: Wednesday (Premier League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Tuesday (Premier League) 2018-19: Wednesday (Premier League), Saturday (FA Cup semi-final), Tuesday (Champions League) Guardiola said: \"We play all the time quarter-finals and semi-finals, quarter-finals and semi-finals on a Wednesday away. We play [FA Cup] semi-finals on a Saturday but this time on a Sunday and we didn't need that extra day.\" The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss suggested his side have been chosen to play FA Cup semi-finals on a Saturday so often because broadcasters feel there are \"more followers\" for the Sunday game, with Guardiola saying: \"They are tired to see us.\" The next few days will define City's season in terms of whether they pick up any major silverware and where they lie in their battle to qualify for the Champions League next season. It is why Guardiola thinks there should have been a greater willingness to nudge back City's game after the demands of a cup final. Guardiola added: \"We have been fighting against this situation for nine years - every single season. Nothing [happens]. [We are told] 'That is the deal, go'. \"We are going to play Tuesday night against an intense, physical, direct and powerful team in the Premier League like Bournemouth who are playing to qualify for the Europa Conference League. We have to deal with that. \"What I am saying, they are playing Aston Villa v Tottenham on a Friday night, this is what they should do when it is possible. It doesn't change much for us playing a Tuesday or Wednesday, but they decide and we will play here on Tuesday with our people.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Almost 300m people at risk of death through starvation – report",
    "article_text": "Acute food insecurity continues to rise at an alarming rate, with almost 300 million people at risk of death through starvation, new analysis reveals. Escalating conflict and cuts to humanitarian aid along with climate and economic shocks forced an additional 13.7 million people into chronic food insecurity last year. It is the sixth consecutive year that the number of people facing “high levels of acute food insecurity” has risen, reaching 295.3 million according to the latestGlobal Report on Food Crises (GRFC). The figure represents almost a quarter – 22.6% – of the population of 53 countries analysed by GRFC experts. “Intensifying conflict, increasing geopolitical tensions, global economic uncertainty and profound funding cuts are deepening acute food insecurity,” the report said. People facing the most chronic lack of food – ascategorisedby the UN-backedIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)– more than doubled last year. More than 95% of them lived in the Gaza Strip orSudan, although Haiti, Mali and South Sudan had significant populations suffering similar food shortages. The category – described as “catastrophe” by the IPC – is characterised by starvation, death, destitution and high rates of acute malnutrition. In Sudan, the worsening civil war led tofamine being officially declaredwith more than 24 million facing acute food insecurity. Conditions also deteriorated within the Gaza Strip, with experts last yearstating that half the populationwas projected to be suffering the IPC’s “catastrophe” scenario. “Following the closure of all crossings into theGazaStrip in early March, and the collapse of the two-month ceasefire, food access has been severely restricted,” the report said. The warnings were corroborated on Monday when thelatest reportby the IPC said Gaza’s population of about 2.1 million Palestinians was at “critical risk” of famine as theIsraeli blockadeon humanitarian aid continued. The GRFC experts identified worsening food security in 19 countries, largely fuelled by conflicts such as in Myanmar, Nigeria and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Such insecurity was, they said, aggravated by the climate crisis with worsening drought conditions expected in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia as well as Afghanistan and Pakistan. The abrupt termination of funding this year,particularly USAID, has also dismantled nutrition services to more than 14 million children in states such as Sudan, Yemen and Haiti, leaving them vulnerable to severe malnutrition and death. Even before the funding cuts, nutrition crises were detected in almost half the 53 countries examined in the GRFC report.",

    "title": "Supreme court blocks Trump bid to resume deportations under 1798 law",
    "article_text": "Thesupreme courthas rejected theTrump administration’s request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans under a rarely used 18th-century wartime law. Over two dissenting votes, the justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men who have been accused of being gang members, a designation that the administration says makes them eligible for rapid removal from the United States under theAlien Enemies Actof 1798. The court, which returned the case to a federal appeals court, had already imposed a temporary halt on deportations from a north Texas detention facility in a middle-of-the-night order issued last month. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the dissent, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas. Donald Trumpresponded on social media, with apostthat claimed: “THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” “The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do,” Trump added ina subsequent post, in which he also claimed, falsely, that the justices “ruled that the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally, are not allowed to be forced out without going through a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person.” The case is among several making their way through the courts over the president’sproclamationin March calling the Tren de Aragua gang a foreign terrorist organization engaged in an “invasion of the United States”, and as such subject to deportation under the 1798 statute. However,a recently declassified memoshowed US intelligence agencies rejected a key claim the administration made to justify invoking the wartime law – that Venezuela’s government was orchestrating the gang’s operations. The supreme court case stems from a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Texas, challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. At issue is whether people must have the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States, without determining whether Trump’s invocation of the law was appropriate. “We recognize the significance of the government’s national security interests as well as the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the constitution,” the justices said in an unsigned opinion. In a statement, Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel, said: “The court’s decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government’s attempt to hurry people away to a Gulag-type prison in El Salvador. The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance.” At least three federal judges have said Trump was improperly using the AEA to speed deportations of people the administration says are Venezuelan gang members. On Tuesday, a judge in Pennsylvania signed off on the use of the law. The court-by-court approach to deportations under the AEA flows from another supreme court order that took a case away from a judge in Washington DC and ruled detainees seeking to challenge their deportations must do so where they are held. The justices said in April that people must be given “reasonable time” to file a challenge. The court has rejected the 12 hours the administration has said would be sufficient, but has not otherwise spelled out how long it meant. The US district judge Stephanie Haines ordered immigration officials to give people 21 days in her opinion in which she otherwise said deportations could legally take place under the AEA. In its opinion, the supreme court pointed to the case ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident the administration admitted itwrongly deportedto a notorious prison in El Salvador as a result of an “administrative error”. The president and other high-ranking administration officials have repeatedly said Ábrego García would never be allowed back in the US, despite a supreme court order instructing the government to “facilitate” his return. Highlighting the administration’s argument that it was “unable to provide for the return of an individual deported in error to a prison in El Salvador”, the court concluded that the “detainees’ interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty”. “Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process right to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster,” the justices wrote. However, the court also made clear that it was not blocking other ways the government may deport people. The decision comes one day after the courtappeared troubledby an executive order Trump signed on his first day in office that seeks to endbirthright citizenship, which contradictsprecedentupholding the plain text of the 14th amendment as granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States”.",

María Del Rosario Navarro is accused of conspiring with others to provide grenades to theJalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG), a powerful Mexican crime faction that the US in Februarydesignated as a terrorist organizationalongside other criminal groups across Latin America. “The arrest of María Del Rosario Navarro Sánchez should send a clear message to people who wish to align themselves with terrorist groups that they will be sought out and held to the highest extent of the law,” the FBI director, Kash Patel, said in the statement. Navarro was also charged with “conspiracy to smuggle and transport aliens in the United States, straw purchasing and trafficking in firearms, bulk cash smuggling conspiracy, and conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute”, the justice department added. Two Mexican men are, together with Navarro, also facing gun-trafficking charges in aTexascourt. Mexico’s security minister, Omar García Harfuch, had earlier this month confirmed the arrest of Navarro, whom he described as a CJNG operator, as part of a federal-level operation in Mexico’s western Jalisco state. “The justice department thanks its Mexican law enforcement partners,” the US department added. Mexican officials have repeatedly accused the US weapons manufacturers of negligence in the sale of weapons that end up in the hands of organized crime groups. The US terrorism designations have come alongside a government crackdown on migration, with thousands of foreigners being deported to third countries in Latin America.",

    "title": "Venezuelans deported by Trump are victims of ‘torture’, lawyers allege",
    "article_text": "Lawyers for252 Venezuelans deportedby the Trump administration and imprisoned inEl Salvadorfor two months have alleged that the migrants are victims of physical and emotional “torture”. A law firm hired by the Venezuelan government said that it had been unable to visit the migrants inthe mega-prison where they are locked up. The lawyers are seeking “proof of life”, but say they have come up against a wall of silence from President Nayib Bukele’s administration and the Central American nation’s justice system. Grupo Ortega filed a habeas corpus petition with the supreme court on 24 March seeking an end to what it calls the “illegal detention” of the Venezuelans, but is still waiting for a ruling. “They are treating them like common criminals,” lawyer Salvador Ríos said, after the migrants were shown dressed in prison clothing, shackled and with shaved heads. “This is torture,” both physically and psychologically, Rios said in an interview with AFP. The lawyers delivered a letter in early May to Bukele, a key ally ofDonald Trump, requesting authorization to visit the Venezuelans, but so far without success. AFP sought a comment from the Salvadorian presidency about the case and the lawyers’ efforts, but has not received a response. Félix Ulloa, the Salvadorian vice-president, told the French media outlet Le Grand Continent that his government merely provides a “service that we could call prison accommodation”. Trump’s administration has paid Bukele’s government millions of dollars to lock up migrants it says are criminals and gang members. Trump invokedrarely used wartime legislationin March to fly migrants to El Salvador without any court hearing, alleging they belonged to theTren de Araguagang, a charge that their families and lawyers deny. The Venezuelans, as well as 36 deported Salvadorian migrants, are being held in a maximum-security prison built by Bukele to house thousands of suspects arrested during his sweeping crackdown on street gangs. Images of the Venezuelans entering the Cecot mega-prison in shackles illustrate the brutality, Ríos said. “The damage is not only physical, but also psychological,” Ríos said. In their letter to Bukele, the lawyers sought permission to interview the prisoners, either in person or virtually, which could serve as “proof of life”. They asked Bukele to release the list of the 252 Venezuelans, something that Washington has not done either. One Salvadorian migrant who was initially incarcerated in Cecot – but in April was moved to a prison farm – isKilmar Ábrego García, a US resident deported due to what the United States itself admitted was an administrative error. A Venezuelan identified in US court documents as “Cristian” was also mistakenly expelled. In both cases, US judges unsuccessfully ordered theTrump administrationto facilitate their return to the United States. Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, said this week that the situation “raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both US and international law”. “Families we have spoken to have expressed a sense of complete powerlessness in the face of what has happened and their pain at seeing their relatives labelled and handled as violent criminals, even terrorists, without any court judgment as to validity of what is claimed against them,” he said in a statement. Isael Guerrero, another lawyer with Grupo Ortega, described the detentions as “completely illegal” because the Venezuelans “are not being legally prosecuted in any court” inEl Salvador. The firm’s head, Jaime Ortega, said they were “100% migrants”. “Not a single one of them is being prosecuted” in the United States for their alleged membership of the Tren de Aragua gang, he said. The fate of the Venezuelans now depends entirely on Bukele, as “the expulsion completely nullifies US jurisdiction”, Ortega said. In April, Bukele offered to trade the 252 Venezuelans for an equal number of political prisoners held by President Nicolás Maduro’s government.",

    "title": "Latin American leaders spend millions to influence Trump’s White House",
    "article_text": "US government records revealLatin Americanleaders have spent millions hiring Washington’s top lobbyists to push for a laundry list ofrequests– from free-trade deals, security assistance and energy investments – to be heard by theTrump administration, according to an analysis by the Guardian andThe Quincy Institute. Since the lead-up to Donald Trump’s election as president in November 2024, Department of Justice records show that at least 10 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have registered their top officials and envoys as foreign principals under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (Fara). Fara aims to promote transparency by requiring those working as foreign agents to disclose their activities and compensation. “Under Trump, we’ve seen a more directly transactional approach to influencing government,” said Jake Johnston, director of international policy at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research (Cepr). “The very personal relationships that have developed with the far right in Latin America have given direct access to the White House. I wouldn’t say this influence peddling is unprecedented, but the magnitude is.” El Salvador’s president,Nayib Bukele, has arguably seen the greatest return to his three-year, $1.5m lobbyingspree. Since February, Bukele has scored an Oval Officemeetingwith Trump, a nuclear energydeal, USassuranceto help expand his country’s notorious mega-prison and an upgraded travel safetyratingfrom the state department. A lucrativecontractwith Mercury public affairs may have helped the Ecuadorian president, Daniel Noboa,securehis sought-after photo op with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, winapprovalfor increased arms shipments to tackle a devolving security situation, and rack up a positive US intelligenceassessmentabout his candidacy just days beforewinninga presidential runoffmarredby irregularities. Argentina’s Javier Milei has taken a somewhat different route to becoming Trump’s “favorite president”, spending tens of thousands todinewith Trump at Mar-a-Lago andappearing alongside Elon Muskat February’s conservative CPAC conference in Washington, easing the path toward a $20bn, US-backed IMFdealand avisitto Buenos Aires from the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, with expectations of an Oval Officevisitand a tradedealcoming soon. FromPanamatoGuyana,HondurastoHaiti, theDominican RepublictoColombia(and Venezuela’s opposition,too), leaders across the hemisphere are playing Trump’s uniquely transactionalgameto provide cover for controversial policies, position themselves electorally, and curry favor with top lawmakers and officials running policy for the next four years toward their often-overlooked countries. Key among these efforts is the Argentinian American Damian Merlo of the Miami-based Latin America advisory group, who renewed his $75,000-a-monthcontractwith Bukele for another year last June and previouslylobbiedfor Argentina’s then-candidate Milei. After winning Argentina’s December 2023 election, MileidroppedMerlo, a veteran Republican insider, to smooth things over with the Biden administration. Since then, Milei’s contact with the Trump world has only grown stronger,facilitatedby the US and Argentinian operators atTactic Global, a strategic advisoryfirmwhich helped organize the CPAC Argentina conference last December and recentlyhostedParaguay’s president, Santiago Peña, and Ecuador’s ambassador to the US at a Los Angeles reception with top Trump officials. Merlo, afixturein Trump circles whostoodbehind Bukele in the Oval Office alongside members of the Salvadorian president’s “Venezuelan shadow cabinet,” previously worked for five years as vice-president of the lobbying firm run by Otto Reich, a longtime Republican official focused on Latin America. Reich, a Cuban American,introducedanother Cuban-American lobbyist, Mauricio Claver-Carone, to Trump’s then-national security adviser, John Bolton, who brought the latter on to become the top official for Latin America policy at the national security council in 2018. Claver-Carone, who for more than a decade through the US-Cuba Democracy political action committee helpedfunnelmillions of dollars to legislators on both sides of the aisle to block increasing calls for engagement with Cuba, isnowTrump’s special envoy to Latin America, working side by side with his longtimeally, secretary of state, Marco Rubio. Sitting behind Rubio at his Senate confirmation hearing in January was anotherTrump-connectedLatin America lobbyist, retired Cuban-American ambassador Carlos Trujillo, who was widelyrumoredto be tapped for a high-level post in the new administration. Trujillo, who served as Trump’s ambassador to the Washington-based Organization of American States (OAS) and was later nominated but not confirmed to be assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, has recently taken on the Caribbean nations ofHaiti,Guyanaand theDominican Republicas his clients at Continental Strategy LLC,coincidingwith Rubio’s trips to the region. Trujillo’s firm, whichnetted$3.6m in the first quarter of 2025 and added 50 new clients since Trump’s victory, also employs the White House chief of staff Susie Wiles’s daughter, Katie, and Rubio’s former chief of staff in the Senate, Alberto Martinez. Continental was reportedlykeyto brokering the $23bn deal for a BlackRock-led consortium that included itsclientMediterranean Shipping Company to wrest control from China of strategic ports in Panama and around the globe, which Trump hailed as a step toward “reclaiming” the Panama canal, a top priority for his administration. Panama’s government, like that ofColombiaandHonduras, has retained a more ideologically mixed group of lobbyists to preserve historically bipartisan support in Congress for their foreign policy objectives, includingrestrainingthe US military presence in the Panama Canal Zone,maintainingtrade preferences for Colombian exports andstrengtheningUS-Honduran cooperation on immigration and security. To those ends, Panamahiredthe Democratic strategist Manuel Ortiz, together with the longtime TrumpallyDavid Urban, in January as part of $2.5mdealwith BGR Group, while a month before Trump’s election Colombia extended a $60,000-a-monthagreementwith Squire, Patton and Boggs, tapping a former Obama administration trade official (who has sincedeparted) and the deputy chief of staff to former Republican House speaker John Boehner. Honduras, for its part,extendeda $90,000-a-month contract with the former US ambassador to the country, Hugo Llorens, along with a state department veteran who worked in the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, Tom Shannon, as part of adealwith the lobbying giant Arnold and Porter. Latin America is by no means the region of the world whose leaders spend the most lobbying US officials, nor is it uncommon under a new US administration, Democratic or Republican, for foreign governments to seek access to freshly nominated political appointees and elected lawmakers. Yet for a region analysts say will beprioritizedunder the current administration – but has historically spentlittleto ensure that is the case – Latin America is increasing its lobbying to ensure its seat at the table, in turn becoming a prominent player in Washington’s vast foreign influence web. “Given Florida’s general involvement in this administration, specifically in foreign policy, and the state’s centrality to Latin American politics, that combines to create greater relevance and attention to the region than we’ve seen before,” said Johnston. “Now that some of these folks are in government or have direct access to government, Latin American leaders will certainly find more fertile breeding ground to pursue their interests.”",

    "article_text": "Mexico is seeking compensation from YouTube celebrityMrBeast’s production company, accusing it of using images of the country’s ancient archaeological sites to advertise a chocolate brand. A video of the social media star visiting Maya ruins has been viewed around 60m times since 10 May on YouTube, where he has 395 million subscribers. In the video, titled “I Explored 2,000 Year Old Ancient Temples,” the influencer explores the ancient Maya cities including Calakmul and Chichén Itzá in south-eastern Mexico. “I can’t believe the government’s letting us do this,” he said after entering a pyramid, prompting criticism from several users who complained that MrBeast had access to areas restricted to Mexicans. On Wednesday Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, requested clarification on the conditions under which the YouTuber was granted access. In the video, the celebrity also advertises his own brand snacks, calling them “Mayan-approved,” prompting an official complaint from the National Institute of Archaeology and History. While Mexico is “pleased that YouTubers and all the world’s young people appreciate the value of our indigenous civilisations” it “strongly condemns those who take advantage,” the institute wrote in a social media post. The permit issued to production company Full Circle Media did not authorise “the use of the image of the archaeological sites for the advertising of commercial brands for private profit,” it added.

    "title": "‘Napalm Girl’ may be work of different photographer, World Press Photo says",
    "article_text": "The World Press Photo group has suspended the attribution of authorship for one on the most famous press photographs ever taken, aftera new documentarychallenged 50 years of accepted journalism history. The photo, officially titled The Terror of War but colloquially known as Napalm Girl, remains one of the most indelible images of the US war inVietnam. Since its publication in June 1972, it has been officially attributed to Nick Ut, a Vietnamese photographer working with the Associated Press in Saigon. The AP and Ut have long maintained that Ut, then 21 years old, took the photo, which went on to win the World Press Photo of the Year award in 1973 and established Ut as a venerable photojournalist. But a recent documentary challenged that history, instead proposing that the photo, which depicts a naked nine-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc as she flees a napalm attack in the South Vietnamese village of Trảng Bàng, was taken by a man named Nguyen Thành Nghe.The Stringer, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, claimed that Nghe, a stringer for NBC who was driving that day and who often sold photos to the AP on a freelance basis, was denied credit in favor of Ut because he was not AP staff. The film prompted “deep reflection” at World Press Photo, which conducted its own investigation, the results of which were made public on Friday 16 May. The in-house analysis, conducted between January and May 2025, concluded “based on analysis of location, distance, and the camera used on that day” that “photographers Nguyễn Thành Nghệ or Huỳnh Công Phúc may have been better positioned to take the photograph than Nick Út.” The suspension only applies to the photo’s authorship, and does not rescind the 1973 Photo of the Year award. “The photograph itself remains undisputed,” the group said, “and the World Press Photo award for this significant photo of a major moment in 20th century history remains a fact.” “Based on these findings and according to our values of accuracy, trustworthiness and diversity, we draw conclusions with regards to attribution,” Joumana El Zein Khoury, the group’s executive director, said in a press release. “It is important to state that the picture itself is undisputed and it is without question that this photograph represents a real moment in history that continues to reverberate in Vietnam, the United States, and globally.” Earlier this month, the Associated Pressannouncedthat it found “no definitive evidence” to warrant changing the photo’s authorship, and released a96-page reporton the matter – itssecond in four months– based on its own internal investigation. The AP concluded that it was “possible” Ut took the photo, and found no evidence that Nguyen took it instead. The matter was unable to be proven conclusively, it added, due to the passage of time, the absence of key evidence, the limitations of technology and the deaths of several key people involved. “We left nothing uncovered that we’re aware of and we’ve done it with a great deal of respect to everybody involved,” said Derl McCrudden, an AP vice-president of global news production, in a statement. “It makes no difference to us if we changed the credit, but it has to be based on facts and evidence. And there is no definitive evidence proving that Nick Ut did not take this picture.” The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen, enlisted several witnesses to argue that Nghe sold the photo to the Saigon bureau photo chief, Horst Faas, for $20 and a print, including Nghe’s brother, who claims he brought the film to the AP; Nghe’s daughter Jannie; Carl Robinson, a longtime AP photo editor in Saigon who first contacted the film-makers; and several of Robinson’s former photojournalist colleagues. The investigators also consulted forensic experts with the French NGOIndex, who found it “highly unlikely” that Ut took the photo based on the other images AP credited to him that day. The AP conducted its own forensic investigation involving further interviews, the examination of cameras and surviving negatives from that day, and a 3D model of the scene. The resulting report revealed “inconsistencies on both sides” but concluded that buying Nghe’s story would “require several leaps of faith”, such as believing that the only time he sold photos to a western news agency, it turned out to be one of the most famous images of the 20th century. Nghe, who made a surprise appearance at the Stringer’s Sundance premiere, confirms his account in the film. Ut, meanwhile, continues to maintain his authorship, and told the AP that the dispute “has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain”. But for World Press Photo, the official author is now: unknown. “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed,” the group said. “The suspension of the authorship attribution stands unless it is proved otherwise.” This article was amended on 16 May 2025. An earlier version described Nguyen Thành Nghe in 1972 as a “driver for NBC”; he was a stringer for NBC and a freelance photographer who was driving Nick Ut on the day the photo of Phan Thi Kim Phuc was taken.",

    "title": "Are surging shark sightings and strandings linked to South Australia’s toxic algal bloom?",
    "article_text": "Shark sightings and strandings are unusually high acrossSouth Australiaamid a prolonged toxic algal bloom, but scientists say it’s too soon to link to recent shark incidents. On Thursday, a swimmer wasbitten by a sharkat Port Noarlunga beach, 30km south of Adelaide’s CBD, one of a rising number of reported sharks swimming closer to shore – with some washing up dead on beaches. On Tuesdayangel sharkswere reported dead on the Yorke peninsula, adding to the200-plus marine speciesreported killed by a toxic algal bloom that has affected large parts of SA’s coastline since March. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Scientists say it has been driven by a marine heatwave withwater temperatures up to 2C hotter than usual. Such events have become more frequent and intense due to climate change, causing widespread damage to ecosystems and fish communities In May, a 3-metre-long white shark died on Adelaide’s Henley Beach, after locals found it struggling in shallow water. It was thefourth reported white sharkstranding, with others found at Port Willunga, Ardrossan and Aldinga. Charlie Huveneers, a professor at Flinders University and expert in shark ecology and their interactions with humans, said it was likely that the unusually high number of shark observations and stranding events was connected to biotoxins from the recent algal bloom. “We will only be able to confirm this and understand which toxin might have led to these strandings once toxicology results come back,” he said. But Huveneers warned that while it might be tempting to try to link increased activity to the risk of shark bites, tracking data showed white sharks occurred along the metropolitan coast throughout the year, regardless of algal blooms. South Australia’s Department of Primary Industries said while it was examining sharks and other marine life affected by the algal bloom, there was “no scientific evidence before the government to indicate that the algal bloom might make a shark attack more likely”. “Shark encounters have always been a small but real risk for anyone entering the ocean anywhere in the world,” a spokesperson for the department said. “It is not uncommon for white sharks to utilise coastal waters in search of food, in particular juvenile and sub-adult white sharks who are primarily fish eaters. They use such near-shore areas to hunt for small sharks, rays and skates along with larger schooling fish species including salmon, mullet and snapper.” Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In 2025, the state’s marine environment has been affected by a combination of high water temperatures,lack of rainand the prolonged toxic algal bloom. “There’s been a lot of things going on, and we don’t know currently what impacts that can have on things like shark behaviour,” said Dr Briana Le Busque, University of South Australia’s environmental science program director. More broadly, she said, people were seeing first-hand how species were affected by these major ecosystem changes. “It’s being talked about a lot,” she said. Le Busque, a conservation psychologist who researches people’s perceptions of sharks, said there had been a noticeable change in public attitudes as these events played out. When the white shark washed up on Henley beach, the response from the public was noticeably different, she said. There was still fear, but also concern for the animal. “Even before it washed up – it was sort of in the shallows – we saw lots of the general population trying to help a species that, a lot of the time, people don’t necessarily like.” The shark bite on Thursday followed a fatal shark incident in January on the state’s west coast. While such incidents were “absolutely horrible”, Le Busque said, the number that have occurred in 2025 was currentlyaligned to the annual average.",

    "title": "ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, to step aside until investigation ends",
    "article_text": "The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court, Karim Khan, will take a leave of absence until an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct reaches a conclusion, the court has confirmed. Staff in the ICC’s prosecution division were told on Friday that Khan would temporarily step aside until an external investigation examining the allegations against him was completed and court authorities could consider its findings. The Hague-based court said in a statement that Khan “communicated his decision to take leave until the end” of the investigation. While Khan is on leave, the court’s deputy prosecutors will be in charge of managing the prosecutor’s office, the statement said. Khan, a British lawyer, has faced a backlash from many of his staff in recent months over his decision to resist calls from some of his most senior staff to take a leave of absence until the investigation is resolved. In an email to staff seen by the Guardian, Khan said: “In light of escalating media reports, I have made the considered decision to take leave until the completion of the investigation.” He said his two deputy prosecutors would take over his responsibilities. ICC sources said Khan’s decision followed renewed pressure earlier this week from senior court officials who urged him to step aside after new details of the allegations were published in the media over the weekend. Investigators from the UN watchdog conducting the investigation are understood to have met Khan for the first time last week, interviewing him over two days. The inquiry was announced in November after allegations emerged about his treatment of a woman who worked for him.The Guardian reportedthat the allegations include unwanted sexual touching and “abuse” over an extended period, as well as coercive behaviour and abuse of authority. Lawyers for Khan, 55, have previously said that he “denies the whole of the allegations” and said he would cooperate with the inquiry. The investigation, which is being conducted by the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS), will send its report to the president of the court’s governing body to review its conclusions. According to sources familiar with the inquiry’s terms of reference, it is also examining claims that Khan engaged in witness intimidation and retaliation against members of his staff. Khan was elected in 2021 to serve a nine-year term as chief prosecutor of the permanent court of last resort, which investigates and prosecutes individuals accused of atrocities, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a statement, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) said it welcomed Khan’s decision, describing it as “essential to protect the integrity of the court, ensure investigations continue without interference, and begin to rebuild the trust of victims, staff and the public”. “This was the only responsible decision. No one is above accountability — not even the prosecutor of the ICC,” it added. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Khan’s deputies – Nazhat Shameem Khan from Fiji and Mame Mandiaye Niang from Senegal – will assume responsibility of the prosecutor’s office of around 450 staff at a sensitive moment for the ICC. The court is bracing for a fresh round of US sanctions after Donald Trump imposed economic and travel sanctions against Khan in February in response to the court’sdecision last year to approve arrest warrantsagainst the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. The deputies will take charge of the investigation into alleged crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. Last month,the Guardian reportedthat Khan was preparing new applications for Israeli suspects in connection to alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is not clear how long Khan will be absent from the court. The OIOS investigation, now in its sixth month, has interviewed several court staff in addition to Khan and the alleged victim. If Khan is found to have committed “serious misconduct” or a serious breach of his duties, he will face a secret ballot in which the ICC’s 125 member states will vote on whether to remove him from office.",

    "article_text": "Epic Games saysFortniteis now unavailable on iPhones and iPads globally becauseAppleblocked a bid to release the popular video game in the App Store in the US and Europe. “Apple has blocked ourFortnitesubmission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,” the X account for Fortnite posted early Friday – claiming that Apple’s move would now prevent the game’s iOS availability around the world. “Sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide untilAppleunblocks it,” Fortnite said. In a statement sent to the Associated Press, Apple said it had specifically asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update “without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies”. But, the company added, it “did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces”. Fortnite’s exile from theiPhoneapp store is the latest twist in a years-long feud between Apple and Epic. Back in 2020, the video game maker filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in the US, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a month-long trial in 2021, district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruledagainst most of Epic’s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the US for the first time – threatening to undercut sizeable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for more than a decade. After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the US supreme court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month – which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems. That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the US, a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple’s latest move. Fortnite’s availability in the EU, meanwhile, was set to go in an alternative store for iPhone users – now called the EpicGamesStore. Apple cleared the way for it last year under new regulatory pressures.",

    "title": "Russia and Ukraine agree prisoner swap but peace talks fail to make progress",
    "article_text": "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a large-scale prisoner exchange but failed to reach a breakthrough during their first direct peace talks since 2022, held in Istanbul without either Vladimir Putin orVolodymyr Zelenskyy. Sitting down under pressure from the US president, Donald Trump,Ukrainehad pushed for a 30-day ceasefire before the talks. Moscow rejected this, appearing to stick to its maximalist demands, including sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty. Images from the meeting, held at the Dolmabahce Palace, were stark: a row of Russian delegates in dark suits sitting opposite Ukrainians wearing their trademark green camouflage combat fatigues. The only tangible result of the talks, which lasted less than two hours, was that the two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, the largest prisoner swap of the conflict. While the meeting appeared to achieve little toward ending the conflict, it represents a symbolic win for Putin, who refused to accept the 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies had demanded as a prerequisite for talks. The Russian leader has been engaged in a delicate balancing act with the US president, appearing to support peace talks to stay in Trump’s favour, while pushing for terms that in effect amount to Ukraine’s capitulation. The outcome is likely to be seen as a setback for Zelenskyy, coming after his bold gamble ofchallenging Putin to a direct meetingin the hope of winning favour with Washington and exposing what Ukraine describes as the Russian leader’s hollow promises to end the war. Vladimir Medinsky, the ultra-conservative head of Russia’s delegation, said Moscow was satisfied with the results and was prepared to keep talking to Kyiv. Both sides said they discussed organising a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, who have met only once, in 2019. The stalemate appears to pave the way for a US-Russia summit, after Trump undercut the talks on Thursday by saying that “nothing is going to happen” until he meets Putin personally. On Friday, the US president, who had grown increasingly impatient with the slow pace of negotiations, said he would meet his Russian counterpart “as soon as we can set it up”, raising fears in Kyiv that they could be sidelined while others decide their fate. Zelenskyy has spent the last few weeks accommodating various US demands to demonstrate his willingness to pursue peace. But Trump’s latest remarks – framing a US-Russia summit as the only path to resolving the conflict – underscored his failure to influence the US president’s thinking. Expectations were already low for the talks, with US officials playing down hopes and Moscow showing little willingness to compromise. Russia stuck to its maximalist territorial demands, insisting that Ukraine surrender areas that Moscow does not even control, according to a source in the Ukrainian delegation cited by Reuters on condition of anonymity. Ukraine’s western allies, alongside Zelenskyy, were quick to denounce Russia’s position. Keir Starmer, who was in Albania for a European summit, said the UK, France, Germany and Poland had agreed that the Russian position in peace talks was “unacceptable” and had discussed the matter with Trump. A photograph showed the country’s leaders, alongside Zelenskyy, on the phone to Trump after the failed talks. Starmer said: “We just had a meeting with President Zelenskyy and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today. And the Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time. So as a result of that meeting with President Zelenskyy and that call with President Trump we are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so.” Zelenskyy renewed his calls for sanctions on Moscow if it failed to agree to a ceasefire. “Our position – if the Russians reject a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings, tough sanctions must follow,” Zelenskyy said on X. “Pressure on Russia must be maintained until Russia is ready to end the war.” Hopes in Kyiv and among its European allies that Trump would impose tough sanctions after the failed talks were dampened by the US president indicating he wanted to meet Putin – leaving Moscow with little incentive to compromise inTurkey. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion The meeting began 24 hours later than planned after a frantic day of confusion and political theatrics. Putin, who had proposed the meeting, opted not to travel to Turkey. Instead, he sent a mid-level delegation, which led Zelenskyy to question Moscow’s seriousness, dismissing the Russian representatives as mere “theatre props”. Zelenskyy, who arrived in Ankara on Thursday, ultimately gave in to US pressure to proceed with the talks and agreed to send a delegation to Istanbul led by Ukraine’s defence minister, Rustem Umerov. “Unfortunately, [the Russians] are not serious enough about the negotiations … Out of respect for President [Donald] Trump and [the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan, I have decided to send our delegation to Istanbul now,” Zelenskyy said. Behind the brinkmanship lies a fundamental and, for now, irreconcilable divide in Zelenskyy and Putin’s approaches to peace. Ukraine has consistently demanded a full 30-day ceasefire before entering substantive negotiations. It has indicated it may be willing to accept a freeze of the frontlines and drop its attempt to join Nato, but only in return for increased western military and economic support, and security guarantees that could include European troops on the ground. Zelenskyy on Friday reiterated that his number one priority was “a full, unconditional and honest ceasefire. This must happen immediately to stop the killing and create a solid basis for diplomacy.” Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time of battlefield advances by Russian forces. The Kremlin instead has sought to frame the meeting on Friday as a continuation of the fruitless talks held in March 2022. At the time, Russia’s demands included drastically scaling back Ukraine’s armed forces, blocking it from rebuilding with western support, and imposing other sweeping restrictions on Ukrainian sovereignty. Kyiv has repeatedly rejected those terms. Medinsky, who led the Russian delegation in Turkey, is a hawkish Kremlin aide and former culture minister who has repeatedly questioned Ukraine’s right to exist as an independent nation. During the meeting, the self-styled historian, often criticised for historical revisionism, reportedly invoked Tsar Peter I’s 21-year war against Sweden as a warning to Ukraine, suggesting Moscow would outlast it in a prolonged conflict and urging Kyiv to settle on Russia’s terms.

    "title": "Week of geopolitical poker over Ukraine ends with no endgame in sight",
    "article_text": "This week began with four European leaders,standing defiantly in Kyivalongside Volodymyr Zelenskyy, issuing an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign a ceasefire now, or together with Donald Trump we will force you to do so, with sanctions and other tough measures. Over the subsequent days, there followed a series of offers, counter-offers, ultimatums and deflections, in a dizzying week of high-stakes diplomacy that often seemed to resemble a geopolitical poker game. Yet by theend of the weekthere was no ceasefire and no sanctions. Various sets of talks were held in Turkey, for which nobody had much hope of a breakthrough, and the path to peace looked as unclear as it had done a week earlier. Halfway through the week, the Guardianspent an hour with Zelenskyy, with three other European journalists, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv. He had just made the surprise announcement that he would travel to Turkey for talks, and challenged Putin to join him. It was a dramatic raising of the stakes and we asked if he felt a bit like he was playing poker. He said: “With several people at once.” The week started well for Zelenskyy, with a quartet of Europeans – Britain’s Keir Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron, the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and Poland’s Donald Tusk, all descending on Kyiv. The five men huddled on a sofa as Macron calledDonald Trump, who had just woken up. Trump, the Guardian understands, was pleased the five had met but did not offer any firm commitments to sign up to sanctions if Putin did not agree to a ceasefire. Nonetheless, in an open-air press conference outside the Mariinskyi Palace in Kyiv, Macron and Starmer portrayed the call as if everyone was on the same page. They gave Putin an ultimatum, until Monday night, to begin a ceasefire. “If he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence,” said Starmer. The ball was now in Putin’s court, although all past experience suggested the Russian leader would not react well to an ultimatum, particularly not the day after overseeing abombastic military paradeto mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, an event that has become the foundation myth for his nationalist idea of Russian identity and has been used to justify the invasion of Ukraine. An early sign that Putin’s response might not be positive came from Dmitry Medvedev, formerly Russia’s president and now its loudest nationalist troll on X. “They are blurting out threats againstRussia… You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses,” he wrote on X. Still, Putin’s is the only important reaction in Moscow these days and he was apparently about to give one live. Western television correspondents, a few of whom were still in Moscow after the Victory Day parade, were called into the Kremlin for a press conference where Putin was expected to give his response to the Starmer-Macron-Merz-Tusk ultimatum. It was close to 2am by the time Putin appeared, and the press conference had been downgraded to a prepared statement, apparently written by Putin himself. He scorned the idea that the west thought it could talk to him using ultimatums, and claimed disingenuously that Russia had always offered ceasefires and Ukraine had been the side to turn them down. Instead of a ceasefire now, he said, let’s start talking. He even named a date and a place: Istanbul on Thursday. Putin’s offer of talks flew in the face of what the western leaders had demanded. Starmer, Merz and Macron had been clear in Kyiv – a ceasefire had to come first, “no ifs or buts”, otherwise sanctions would be applied. They had made it clear that Trump was onside with this plan. But perhaps inevitably, the US president responded by putting pressure on Kyiv. “Ukraine should agree to this, IMMEDIATELY,” he wrote on Truth Social. “HAVE THE MEETING, NOW!!!” There was at least a somewhat positive coda to his message, that if after the meeting it was clear a deal was not possible, western leaders would “proceed accordingly”. But it was hardly the tough talking to Putin that the Europeans had hoped to extract from Trump. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Soon after, Zelenskyy raised the stakes once again with his suggestion of a top-level summit. “We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow,” he wrote in a statement. But he added a twist. “I will be waiting for Putin in Türkiye on Thursday. Personally. I hope that this time the Russians will not look for excuses.” It was a dramatic challenge that seized the initiative from the Russian leader. If Putin’s goal had been to deflect the demand for ceasefire with a faux-constructive offer, Zelenskyy was now calling his bluff. He did it remarkably quickly, too, suggesting it was not a move agreed with western allies. “If you read carefully, I spoke about both the ceasefire and about a meeting,” he said, when asked about it in the interview. “I formulated my words exactly like this. I can’t tell you why I did this. But I knew exactly what I was doing,” he added, enigmatically. Zelenskyy, like many world leaders now, has to calibrate his words carefully to make sure not to offend Trump. “We are putting on a theatre performance for just one audience member,” said a Ukrainian security source this week. It can sometimes be an excruciating dance, but if it goes wrong, as it did for Zelenskyy in the White House in late February, the consequences can be even worse. Putin was never likely to show up in Turkey, but a three-day silence from the Kremlin before this was confirmed suggested he was at least considering various options. In the end, he sent a negotiating team to Istanbul led by Vladimir Medinsky, a former culture minister with a sideline in writing pseudo-history books about the west’s long-running mission to destroy Russia. By Thursday evening, Zelenskyy was in Ankaracomplainingthe Russians had not shown up; Medinsky was in Istanbul complaining the Ukrainians hadn’t shown up; Putin was in the Kremlin saying not much at all; and Trump was coming to the end of his lavish Middle East tour and still hinting there could be an 11th-hour meeting with Putin. On Friday, negotiations between a Ukrainian delegation and Medinsky’s Russian group did finally happen. But they were over in less than two hours, producing a prisoner exchange but apparently little else, with the Russian side reportedly insisting on maximalist demands. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, dismissed the negotiations (which Ukraine had attended only because the Americans insisted) as pointless and at a “logjam”, and echoing the US president, said it would probably take a meeting between Trump and Putin to end the conflict. The week ends with no sign of a lasting peace being any closer, and little talk of the US implementing the tough measures that Starmer and Macron had promised against the Russians. In a neat piece of symmetry, Zelenskyy and the other four European leaders again called Trump, this time from a summit in Tirana. “We are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so,” said Starmer, in what could hardly be described as a wall of solidarity against the Kremlin. Trump, in his comments this week, has sounded excited about the prospect of a bilateral meeting with Putin, and has made little reference to any potential negative consequences for Russia. Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy said he felt confident if cautious while sitting at the geopolitical poker table. The Ukrainian president said: “I’m in general a confident person. Though in negotiations there should always be doubts … You have to have some reflections, to be able to step to the side, to veer off the fast-moving track everyone else is on.” The problem for Zelenskyy – and for Europe more broadly – is that all the carefully calibrated poker plays count for nothing if it turns out Trump is not even bothering to follow the game, but instead playing his own game, according to his own rules.",

    "title": "Israel launches major offensive in Gaza after airstrikes that killed more than 100",
    "article_text": "Israel has announced a major new offensive in Gaza after launching a wave of airstrikes on the territory thatkilled more than 100 people, in what it said was a fresh effort to force Hamas to release hostages. In a statement late on Friday, theIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) said they had “launched extensive attacks and mobilized forces to seize strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, as part of the opening moves of Operation Gideon’s Chariots and the expansion of the campaign in Gaza, to achieve all the goals of the war in Gaza”. The announcement came asDonald Trumpfinished a visit to the region that included stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates but not Israel. Earlier on Friday,Donald Trump acknowledged that people are starving in Gazaand claimed the US would have the situation in the territory “taken care of”. The US president told reporters in Abu Dhabi: “We’re looking atGaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.” But discussions on the longer term future of Gaza have faltered. On Thursday, Trump described his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”, a possible reiteration of aplan he put forward in Februaryfor the US to take control of the Palestinian territory to allow for its reconstruction as a luxury leisure and business hub. There had been widespread hope that Trump’s visit to the region could lead to a fresh pause in hostilities or a renewal of humanitarian aid toGaza. Instead, the raids and bombardmentover the past 72 hourshave raised the levels of violence higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to that seen in the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza aftera fragile ceasefire collapsed in March. Gaza’s civil defence agency said strikes on Friday killed 108 people, mostly women and children, and some officials in the Palestinian territory put the number killed by Israeli attacks in recent days as high as 250 or 300. At least 48 bodies were taken to the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, and 16 to Nasser hospital after strikes on the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis, health officials said. In Jabaliya, a neighbourhood in the north of Gaza that has seen heavy bombardment for weeks, women sat weeping beside 10 bodies draped in white sheets that were lined up on the ground amid rubble. Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, said she had been awoken by a pre-dawn attack on northern Gaza. “We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us … everyone started running … there was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses,” she said. Israel’s military said its air force had struck more than150 “terror” targetsacross Gaza. Hamas still holds 57 of about 250 hostages seized in its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Israel says the blockade and intensified bombardments since mid-March are intended to put pressure on the militant organisation to secure the release of the hostages. Fewer than half are believed to be still alive. Israel’s retaliatory military offensive has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the health ministry there. A ceasefire that came into effect in January broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to a definitive end to the war. Some of the heaviest Israeli strikes earlier this week were aimed at the current commander of Hamas in Gaza, who, Israeli officials said, was sheltering in tunnel systems under a big hospital complex in Khan Younis. Hamas has denied repeated Israeli accusations that it uses civilians as human shields. Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists for the new offensive, in which troops will hold on to seized territory and which will lead to a significant displacement of the population,Benjamin Netanyahu has said. Israeli ministers have spoken of “conquering” Gaza. Hamas on Mondayfreed Edan Alexander, the last living US citizen it held, after direct engagement with the Trump administration that left Israel sidelined. As part of the understanding with Washington regarding Alexander’s release, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, said the group was “awaiting and expecting the US administration to exert further pressure” on Israel “to open the crossings and allow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid”. Israeli officials have consistently denied the tight blockade imposed on the devastated territory more than 10 weeks ago has caused hunger and Trump’s comments will be seen as further evidence of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel’s closest ally. Israel, which claims Hamas systematically loots aid to fund its military and other operations, has put forward a plan to distribute humanitarian assistance from a series of hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and protected by Israeli troops. The US has backed the plan, which has been described as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful by aid agencies because it could lead to the mass forced transfer of populations. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, on Thursday acknowledged the criticism and said Washington was “open to an alternative if someone has a better one”. The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been set up to manage the scheme, announced on Wednesday that it would begin operating by the end of the month and that it had asked Israel to lift its blockade to allow aid to reach the territory immediately. Aid agencies have warned that any delay will cost lives, and that cases of acute malnutrition, particularly among young children, are soaring. UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said on Friday that time should not be wasted on the US proposal to deliver aid to Gaza, saying the UN has a proven plan and 160,000 pallets of relief ready to enter the Palestinian enclave now. “We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself,” he said. “We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.” Polls in Israel show widespread support for a new ceasefire to secure the hostages’ release, but local media reports quoted statements from anonymous Israeli and regional officials downplaying any likelihood of a breakthrough. Israel’s main group representing the families of hostages still being held in Gaza said on Friday that Netanyahu was missing a “historic opportunity” for them to be released. Recent days have seen violence intensify in the occupied West Bank and new launches of missiles at Israel by the Yemen-based Houthi militia. Israel struck Yemen’s Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salif on Friday, continuing its campaign to degrade Houthi military capabilities.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trump has said people are starving in Gaza and the US would have the situation in the territory “taken care of” as it suffered a further wave ofintense Israeli airstrikes. On the final day of his Gulf tour, the US president told reporters in Abu Dhabi: “We’re looking atGaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving.” Israeli officials have consistently denied the tight blockade imposed on the devastated territory more than 10 weeks ago has caused hunger and Trump’s comments will be seen as further evidence of tensions betweenBenjamin Netanyahuand Israel’s closest ally.

Instead, the raids and bombardmentover the past 72 hourshave raised the levels of violence higher than for several weeks, with the death toll coming close to that seen in the first days of Israel’s renewed offensive in Gaza aftera fragile ceasefire collapsed in March. Gaza’s civil defence agency said strikes on Friday killed 108 people, mostly women and children, and some officials in the Palestinian territory put the number killed by Israeli attacks in recent days as high as 250 or 300. At least 48 bodies were taken to the Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza, and 16 to Nasser hospital after strikes on the outskirts of the central town of Deir al-Balah and the southern city of Khan Younis, health officials said. In Jabaliya, a neighbourhood in the north of Gaza that has seen heavy bombardment for weeks, women sat weeping beside 10 bodies draped in white sheets that were lined up on the ground amid rubble. Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, said she had been awoken by a pre-dawn attack on northern Gaza. “We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us … Everyone started running … There was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses,” she said.

    "title": "Trump agrees deal for UAE to build largest AI campus outside US",
    "article_text": "TheUnited Arab Emiratesand the United States have signed an agreement for the Gulf country to build the largestartificial intelligencecampus outside the US, one of several deals around AI made duringDonald Trump’s visit to the Middle East. But the agreement has also raised concerns, since it would have faced restrictions under the previous administration over Washington’s fears that China could access the technology. The agreement to build the campus would give the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips. The US and the UAE did not say which AI chips could be included in the data centers, but sources told Reuters the UAE could be allowed to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips each year starting in 2025. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, was seen in televised footage conversing with Trump and the UAE president, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, at a palace in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. The agreement is a major win for the UAE, which has been trying to balance its relations with its longtime ally the US and its largest trading partner, China. The Gulf state has been spending billions of dollars in a push to become a global AI player. But it had limited access to US chips during the presidential administration of Joe Biden. The deal reflects the Trump administration’s confidence that the chips can be managed securely, in part by requiring datacentres to be managed by US companies. The US has been at the forefront of AI technology and innovation, but over the past year China has emerged as a serious competitor. Despite Trump’s confidence, some worry that striking deals with Persian Gulf countries could further diminish the US’s grip on the burgeoning tech. There’s also the fear that China would be able to access these datacentres for its own benefit. Top CEOs from AI and chip companies, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Nvidia’s Huang, appear to support such a deal. It could bring their products to an even larger world stage and they stand to profit immensely. The AI agreement “includes the UAE committing to invest in, build or finance US datacentres that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE,” the White House said. “The agreement also contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States, including strong protections to prevent the diversion of US-origin technology.” Central to the agreement announced on Thursday is the 10 sq mile (25.9 sq km) AI campus in Abu Dhabi with 5GW of power capacity for AI datacentres, the US commerce department said. The campus will be built by Abu Dhabi state-backed firm G42, but the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said in a release that “American companies will operate the datacentres and offer American-managed cloud services throughout the region”. The US fact sheets also described chip company Qualcomm working on an AI-related engineering centre and that Amazon Web Services, the cloud unit of the tech and commerce company, would work with local partners on cybersecurity and fostering cloud adoption. The US has pursued protectionist policies for years to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors, including ensuring that the chips do not end up in the country via third parties. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Regulations are easing under Trump, whose AI czar, David Sacks, said in Riyadh on Tuesday that the Biden administration’s export controls were “never intended to capture friends, allies, strategic partners”. Granting the UAE more access to the most advanced chips, manufactured by firms such as Nvidia, marks a major turnaround. “This shift enables [the UAE] to deepen its technology partnership with the US while still preserving trade ties with China,” said Mohammed Soliman, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “It doesn’t mean abandoning China but it does mean recalibrating tech strategy to align with US standards and protocols where it matters most: compute, cloud and chip supply chains,” he said. AI was top of the agenda when Bin Zayed Al Nahyan visited Washington in December in the final days of Biden’s presidency. G42 and MGX, the state-linked vehicles picked to drive the UAE’s AI investment push, have also invested in US firms such as OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, while Microsoft last year agreed to invest $1.5bn in G42. The two companies said the deal was backed by security assurances, and under US pressure, G42 had previously begun ripping out Chinese hardware it was using and sold off Chinese investments. Still, major Chinese firms like Huawei and Alibaba Cloud are present in the UAE, and organised AI chip smuggling to China was tracked out of countries including Malaysia, Singapore and the UAE, a source told Reuters in February.",

    "title": "Police name victims of blaze at former RAF base in Oxfordshire",
    "article_text": "The three people who died in a fire at a former RAF base inOxfordshireon Thursday have been named by police. Firefighters Jennie Logan, 30, and Martyn Sadler, 38, died after explosions were heard at Bicester Motion, a business park and former RAF base, Thames Valley police said. David Chester, 57, from Bicester, was also killed, the force added. In a statement on Friday evening, Thames Valley police said: “The families are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers. “We have commenced an unexplained death investigation, led by our major crime team. This is currently not a criminal investigation, but we will follow the evidence as our inquiries continue. “We will continue to have officers at the scene for a number of days to ensure the public remain safe. “The fire and rescue service is still at the scene, dampening down the fire. Once the scene is safe, our investigators will be able to carry out inquiries at the location.” Two further Oxfordshire fire and rescue service firefighters suffered serious injuries and are in hospital, Oxfordshire county council has said. Tim Metcalfe, assistant chief constable at Thames Valley police, said: “This is an absolute tragedy and my thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone at Thames Valley police, are with the families, friends and colleagues of Jennie Logan of the Oxfordshire county council fire and rescue service, Martyn Sadler of the London fire brigade, and member of the public David Chester, who have died in this incident.” Bicester Motion, home to more than 50 specialist businesses focused on classic car restoration and engineering, is located at the site of RAF Bicester, a former bomber station. A spokesperson for the business park said everyone there considered Chester “part of the fabric of our estate and a friend to us all”. Chester was the proprietor of a family-run fencing and groundworks company, Chester & Sons. The Bicester Motion spokesperson said: “Whenever you had a question, you would ‘just ask Dave’, not just him but his whole family as they all cared about this place just as much as we do. “Our whole community used to say that ‘Dave always had our back.’ Yesterday, he was doing just that – the epitome of his selfless spirit.” People laid flowers at the scene on Friday. One bunch was left by a family with a note that read: “Sending all our love to those who lost their lives and to those who did not think twice about making that sacrifice to help others. “Thinking of the fire service, their families, friends and the wider community and all those services who came to help. Rest easy.” Another said: “Thank you for your service.” Amy Angeletta said she had laid flowers out of a sense of community. “People have lost their lives and it’s quite a close-knit community here,” she said. “It’s just to pay your respects. The area has a very lovely friendly atmosphere. At a time like this, it just feels like everybody pulls together.” Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion A plaque had also been placed in the memory of those who died bearing the names of Oxfordshire fire and rescue service and Bicester Motion. It read: “Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected by the sad loss of two firefighters and the member of the public. Love from the Bicester community.” Keir Starmer paid tribute to the two firefighters who died. “Devastating news,” he posted on X. “My thoughts are with their families and friends. The bravery of our firefighters is astounding. Hoping those in hospital make a full and swift recovery.” Ten fire and rescue crews were called to tackle the fire, which started on Thursday at 6.39pm and prompted a major response and warnings for residents to stay indoors. The fire was under control on Friday morning, the council said. Other support appliances remained on scene, including a hydraulic platform, a water carrier, a command unit and a high-volume pumping unit. The commissioner of London fire brigade, Andy Roe, said: “This is clearly an incredibly difficult time for us all; we have lost a well-respected and much-loved colleague who exemplified courage and selflessness in the service of others. “Our thoughts are with all the families, friends, and colleagues impacted by this tragedy. We are doing everything we can to provide support to Martyn’s family and colleagues. “It has been an incredibly challenging day for the UK fire and rescue service. This incident highlights the high-risk nature of the service we provide every day.” Vikas Talwar, 40, who lives near Bicester Motion, could see the fire from the street corner outside his house. He said: “There was a lot of smoke yesterday. Lots of people were gathering here on the corner but a lot of smoke was coming out. “There was flames on the roof, on the top of the roof, and a huge big cloud of smoke in the air. I could see it from this corner near my house.” Speaking of those who died in the fire, he said: “It’s so sad. It’s very heartbreaking. We have sympathy with the people involved. “I can see there was a quick reaction by the fire brigade and ambulance teams when they came in. I saw the air ambulances in the air in the evening.”",

    "title": "Campaigner wins court case over festivals in south London park",
    "article_text": "A campaigner who argued that music festivals held in a southLondonpark unfairly cut off large sections of the space and made it a “mud bath” has won a court case that could result in events being banned there this summer. The Protect Brockwell Park (PBP) group, which includes the actor Mark Rylance, complained about walls being erected in the park, and noise and environmental damage, leading to a tense debate about the use of public space, nimbyism and the importance of summer cultural events. Rebekah Shaman, who lives in the area and is a member of the PBP, took legal action against Lambeth council, which was heard in the high court this week, urging it to review holding large-scale events in Brockwell Park. The ruling could affect events held by Summer Events Limited, including Wide Awake, Mighty Hoopla, Field Day and City Splash, which are due to take place over the summer. The challenge was over whether the council’s decision to certify the planned use of the land as lawful was correct. Under permitted development rules, a temporary change of use is allowed for a total of 28 days each calendar year, but the Brockwell Park festivals run over 37 days and were due to begin on 23 May. The high court judge Mr Justice Mould ruled in Shaman’s favour, saying the council’s decision to grant the certificate to the festival organisers was “irrational”. Rylance said the victory was “wonderful news”. In a statement issued by PBP, he said: “Wonderful news. Brockwell Park will be open to all for free again this summer. No walls. No trucks. “The grass, and trees and plants will have a chance to recover from the years of abuse. “Now let’s help revive the beloved Lambeth country fair as it used to be, open to all. Congratulations to all who worked so devotedly to achieve this decision. “Every small victory for nature makes a difference.” Before the hearing, PBP said in a statement: “These large-scale, high-impact commercial festivals are damaging Brockwell Park’s ecology, heritage and community value. The park is being overused and under-protected.” The group also led protests in the park. In written submissions, Shaman’s barrister, Richard Harwood KC, said that in the past few years the park had “increasingly” been used for large commercial events, with “substantial” parts being fenced off and damage being caused to the ground. “Due to inclement weather over the weekend of one of the commercial events, the park effectively became a mud bath,” Harwood added, referencing an event in 2024. Billed as theBattle for Brockwell Park, the ruling highlighted tensions between residents who support and oppose the events, which bring hundreds of thousands of people to the south London park in the summer months. “I await the arrival of the park’s music festival season with dread,” wrote the author Rebecca Tamáslast year. Another group called SayYesLambeth argued that the events were a key part of south London’s cultural offering. The group’s tagline was: “Fighting for culture, joy and community in Lambeth.” In the lead-up to the case, a member of SayYesLambethtold Londoncentric: “Our whole scene and culture is about to be deleted because of people who complain about noise when they live in central London.” The group described the case as a battle between “a small but powerful group” and “the young people, the renters, the workers, the small businesses [and] the creatives”. Earlier in the hearing, Mould said: “It is for the planning authority to decide, pending the outcome of this challenge, what decision it should or should not take.” Mould refused initial applications for permission to appeal from Lambeth council and Summer Events Limited, although they can ask the court of appeal for permission to challenge the decision directly. A Lambeth council spokesperson said on Friday: “We are currently assessing the impact of this judgment and determining next steps.”",

    "title": "‘Something a bit naughty’: British snackers fall for the posh crisp",
    "article_text": "When it comes to crisps, British appetites have traditionally been sated by a packet of Frazzles or a bag of Skips. But, according to chefs, supermarket insiders and social media, 2025 is gearing up to be the summer of the posh crisp. Jay Ledwich, a crisp buyer at Waitrose, said demand for premium and unusual flavoured crisps was “soaring”. This week, the shop became the exclusive British supermarket stockist of what it is tipping to be the next viral hit in crisps – a fried-egg flavour from the Spanish specialist Torres. It follows other savoury sensations from the brand, including black truffle, caviar, and sparkling wine flavours. Crisps’ popularity isn’t limited to the snack aisle. The fashion brand Balenciaga is selling a£1,450 glossy “salt and vinegar” leather pouchand a £625“spicy chili” crisp charm. It follows Anya Hindmarch’s sequinned Walkers crisps bag, originally released in 2000 andnow housed in the V&A. This week the US brand Lay’s released its new campaign that stars football legends including Lionel Messi munching on its classic salted crisps. Elsewhere, at parties, traditional blinis are out. Instead at-home cooks are whipping up crisp canapés – such as Pringles topped with a dollop of sour cream and caviar. Millennials have swapped the customary bottle of bubbles for the host for a£26 tin of Bonilla’s sea salted crisps. Online, there are viral recipes for chocolate biscuits topped with salty crisp crumbs. The American chef Alison Roman suggests serving marinated anchovies with Kettle-style crisps, while the Spanish chef Ferran Adrià proposes folding plain crisps into whisked eggs for a speedy take on a tortilla Española. At hipster-filled bars, natty orange wines are served with bowls of salted crisps topped with Serrano ham. The Greek-inspired restaurant Oma and its sister restaurant Agora in Borough Market, south-east London, feature homemade hot crisps on the menu. The chef/owner David Carter, who fries agria potatoes in rapeseed oil before flavouring them with everything from garlic to kombu dashi,said the idea stemmed from wanting “something a bit naughty when you sat down”. After trying out fava and chickpeas, he settled on “the humble crisp”, which he said ticked the salty, spicy and crunchy boxes. Over at Toklas restaurant on the Strand, its take on mussels escabeche features crisps instead of bread. The head chef, Chris Shaw, described the British as having “a sort of love affair” with crisps. He argued it played into nostalgia. “We’ve all had them as part of a packed lunch. Or as a kid on holiday. There are good crisps [and] shit crisps. But they all bring you back to a moment.” At £4.95 for a 125g packet, Torres sits at the upper end of the upmarket crisp market but flavours beyond the standard ready salted are booming across the crisp category. Marks & Spencer recently introduced a black truffle version (£3.75 for 125g) to its own label collection. Kettle’s latest range includes asriracha mayo versionand dill pickle and jalapeño (£2.40 for 125g). At Tyrells, you can pick from Wensleydale and cranberry to roasted chicken and sage (from £2.75 for 150g). There are also specialist snack sites that stock smaller British brands, such asTaste of Game, which does a smoked pheasant and wild mushroom crisp. Natalie Whittle, the author ofCrunch: An Ode to Crisps, said the trend reflected a wider cost of living challenge: “Crisps have always had a kind of chameleon ability to be high or low in the supermarket food aisles.” For those dining out less, Whittle said crisps offered an opportunity to enjoy “something a bit more cheffy” at home. The writer sometimes invited a friend over for just a bag of posh crisps and a glass of wine. “It is fun to break the monotony and rigid doctrine of making meals all the time,” she said. However, for some, tradition would always trump the novel. While Shaw said he enjoyed “the strange sulphur” flavour from Torres fried-egg crisps, his favourite was still “an acidic numbing” packet of pickled onion Monster Munch.",

    "title": "MPs opposed to assisted dying criticise ‘distasteful’ Esther Rantzen claims",
    "article_text": "MPs opposed to assisted dying have criticised “distasteful” claims from the prominent campaignerEsther Rantzen, who argued many are fighting against the changes to the law because of secret religious views. Rantzen made the remarks in a letter urging MPs to back the “strong, safe, carefully considered bill” to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. A string of MPs opposed to assisted dying strongly objected to Rantzen’s claims that they had “undeclared personal religious beliefs which mean no precautions would satisfy them”. During a five-hour debate on Friday, MPs voted to change the bill to provide an opt-out for healthcare workers from being involved in assisted dying – extending the exemption from just doctors. Its sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, also agreed in principle to an amendment to stop those who are voluntarily refusing food and drink being eligible for assisted dying in a move to protect those suffering from eating disorders. A vote in November saw a majority of 55 MPs support the bill, and since then, the issue has divided MPs who are thought to be narrowly in favour, with strong feelings on both sides. Jess Asato, a Labour MP, was one of those who took issue with Rantzen’s claims, calling on the bill’s sponsor to condemn the remark for being “distasteful and disrespectful”. Florence Eshalomi, another Labour MP, also raised the issue, saying it was “frankly insulting to disabled people, hardworking professionals up and down the country who have raised many valid concerns about this bill, to have it dismissed as religious beliefs”. They were backed by Kieran Mullan, the shadow justice minister, who said: “Some high-profile campaigners have made unhelpful remarks. Although I am not religious, I was concerned to see the clumsy criticism of those whose objections to the bill are thought to be centred in their religious beliefs.” Rantzen, alongtime supporter of assisted dying, was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer in 2023. She was thought to have just weeks to live, but last year started using a “wonder drug” that helped her survive against the odds. Her daughter revealed in March thatthe former Childline founder’s drugs were no longer working. It meant she was no longer well enough to travel to Dignitas in Switzerland. Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the legislation, said she had not seen Rantzen’s recent remarks, and argued the changes would make the bill more workable and strengthen its protections. She said assisted dying must be legalised to avoid terminally ill people acting out of desperation or making traumatic trips to Switzerland. Its supporters say the bill has returned with strengthened safeguards after being amended in committee earlier this year. But opponents have complained the bill does not have enough protections and has been rushed through, with the criticism coming days aftertwo royal medical colleges voiced their doubts on the legislationin its current form. Some MPs are also unhappy about what they see as the chaotic way the legislation has been debated. Many MPs who tabled amendments did not get the chance to speak, and in the end only two amendments were put to the vote. The first amendment exempting healthcare workers passed, and a second amendment put forward by the Tory MP Rebecca Paul was rejected. This would have prevented employees from providing assisted dying while working for an employer that has chosen not to take part in the process. The eating disorder amendment was not chosen for a vote, but Leadbeater said she accepted it in principle and it would be supported at a later stage. Naz Shah, a Labour MP and opponent of the bill, had proposed the amendment, and was unhappy at the process, saying: “Unbelievably I wasn’t told by the sponsor that my amendment would be accepted until we were sitting in parliament. There was ample opportunity for me to be told and I had no knowledge of any proposed changes in advance. This bill is profoundly important and this chaos does a disservice to parliament and to our constituents. We shouldn’t be playing games with people’s lives like this.” Another MP said the votes on Friday were “just skirmishes” and the showdown that makes clear whether any support has ebbed away from the bill is still weeks away. But they said many MPs were exasperated at the process that meant they felt issues were not getting sufficient time for debate. Mike Reader, a Labour MP, said: No matter your views on the terminally ill adults (end of life) bill, also known as assisted suicide or assisted dying, people must agree that the time that’s been allocated to debate the proposed amendments to the bill is not adequate. I’m disappointed that there appears to be a campaign to rush this through, backed by some significant and well-funded lobby groups.” The debate was marked by protests on both sides, with more than 100 people gathered outside parliament with placards. Addressing a group in parliament, including Dame Esther’s daughter Rebecca Wilcox, Leadbeater became emotional, saying she gets upset “when we get obsessed with parliamentary procedure, when this is actually about human beings, and that’s what I find upsetting, because I think it’s not about a green book, or it’s not about a piece of paper”.",

    "title": "Ten people break out of New Orleans jail, including man convicted of killings",
    "article_text": "Ten people in custody at theNew Orleansjail, including a man convicted of four killings, escaped early on Friday morning. While at least three were apprehended within hours, the escapes prompted local, state and federal officials to launch a “full-scale search operation” for eight who remained at large Friday night – and to warn community members to be on the lookout for “armed and dangerous” individuals. “Folks, take it seriously,” theNew Orleanspolice superintendent, Anne Kirkpatrick, said at a news conference late on Friday morning. Sheriff Susan Hutson, whose agency operates the jail, said: “We are urging the public to remain alert.” At first, officials said 11 people had escaped. But during a press conference on Friday afternoon, the New Orleans sheriff clarified that one man, who authorities thought had escaped, was in a different cell. The 10 inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center (OJC) are accused of a variety of crimes, including weapons charges, attempted murder, domestic abuse and murder. The sheriff confirmed that one inmate had been caught as of Friday. Louisiana state policesaidon X that they had caught one of the alleged escapers after a brief foot chase in New Orleans’s well-known French Quarter neighborhood. The Orleans parish sheriff’s office latershared Instagram imagesof the arrest of another man who was captured around 7.30pm in the 3500 block of Second Street. Citing sources, local news stationsWDSUandWVUEreported a third escaper had been arrested at about 9pm local time. The inmates reportedly tore off the toilet-sink appliance in one of the cells, escaped through there and exited the facility through a loading dock, security camera footage reveals, Hutson said. While the sheriff said “defective locks” were a factor in the escape, she added that “there’s no way” the inmates could have left the facility without “a lapse in security”. “It’s almost impossible, not completely, but almost impossible for someone to get out of this facility without help,” she said. Among the escapers was Derrick Groves, who in October was convicted of fatally shooting two people while wounding two others in New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood on 13 February 2018 as the city celebrated Fat Tuesday. Jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder and attempted murder. Though murder carries mandatory life imprisonment, Groves had not been sentenced in the case. For one, his attorney was suspended from practicing law for two years for admittedly taking money from clients during a previous suspension as well as billing another client more than $9,000 for unperformed legal work. Furthermore, the defense had until 28 May to file post-conviction pleadings – and prosecutors had until 24 July to respond. Separately, after his murder convictions, Groves pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter in connection with a double slaying in 2017 – and an unrelated charge of battery of a correctional facility employee filed against him in April 2024. The inmates purportedly escaped at midnight, but facility guards did not notice they were gone until 8.30am local time during a routine headcount. Hours after officials announced the escape, a criminal justice source provided the Guardian with a photo showing a window-size hole in the wall of an OJC cell leading to the outside. Handwritten messages left around the hole included ones reading “Fuck OPSO”, referring to the Orleans parish sheriff’s office in charge of the jail, and “suck my dick OJC”. “We innocent,” read another message. Another, which was misspelled, had an arrow pointing down to the hole in the cell wall and read: “To easy lol.” Still another said, “Catch us when you can.” Authorities did not immediately comment on the photo, which numerous media outlets had reported on by Friday evening. Officials did not take any questions at the news conference but said the FBI, US marshals and state troopers were helping the city’s police department and sheriff’s deputies search for the escapers. Louisiana’s attorney general, Liz Murrill, said her office would “thoroughly review” exactly how the breakout occurred once everyone had been captured. Hutson added: “We are launching a full investigation to determine how this escape occurred, including reviewing facility protocols, staff performance and physical security measures … Any lapses or failures that contributed to this incident will be addressed swiftly and with full accountability.” The Orleans Justice Center was previously known as the Orleans Parish prison. It has long been the subject of scrutiny by the justice department over allegations of civil rights violations, leading to areform pact with the federal governmentin 2016. An independent monitor tracks the jail’s compliance with the reform pact, which is known as a consent decree. Donald Trump’s administration recentlyordereda review of all consent decrees affecting law enforcement agencies in the US, calling them “political handcuffs that make aggressively enforcing the law impossible”. The administration said the goal of the review was to determine whether it made sense to modify, rescind or move “to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions”. Murill told WDSU that Friday’s events did not “bode well” for the jail’s consent decree. Friday’s escapes occurred less than two weeks after New Orleans voters reapproved – by the thinnest of margins – a property tax funding maintenance, staffing and certain programs at the sheriff’s office in charge of the city’s jail. An initial count reportedly found the tax renewal passed by two votes after more than 24,000 ballots had been cast. A recount subsequently found the tax renewal passed by four votes. A statement that Hutson provided to the news media after the recount promised she would ensure her office would “continue to ensure our deputies are well-equipped and provide transformative justice so that detainees leave better than they came”. “Progress is evident more every day,” the statement said. This article was amended on 16 May 2025 to update the number of people who escaped as well as how many had been caught, based on newer information.

    "title": "Moody’s strips US government of top credit rating",
    "article_text": "Moody’s Ratings has stripped the United States government of its top credit rating, citing successive governments’ failure to stop a rising tide of debt, a surprise move that could complicate President Donald Trump’s efforts to cut taxes and send ripples through global markets. On Friday, Moody’s lowered the rating from a gold-standard Aaa to Aa1. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” it said as it changed its outlook on the US to “stable” from “negative”. But, it added, the US “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.” Moody’s is the last of the three major rating agencies to lower the federal government’s credit rating. Standard & Poor’s downgraded federal debt in 2011, and Fitch Ratings followed in 2023. In a statement, Moody’s said, “We expect federal deficits to widen, reaching nearly 9 percent of [the US economy] by 2035, up from 6.4 percent in 2024, driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation.’’ Extending President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a priority of the Republican-controlled Congress, Moody’s said, would add $4 trillion over the next decade to the federal primary deficit, which does not include interest payments. White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the downgrade via a social media post, singling out Moody’s economist, Mark Zandi, for criticism. He called Zandi a political opponent of Trump. “Nobody takes his ‘analysis’ seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung said. Stephen Moore, former senior economic adviser to Trump and an economist at Heritage Foundation, called the move “outrageous”. “If a US-backed government bond isn’t triple A-asset, then what is?” he told Reuters. The Department of the Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency. A gridlocked political system has been unable to tackle the huge deficits that the US has accumulated. Republicans reject tax increases, and Democrats are reluctant to cut spending. On Friday, House Republicans failed to push a big package of tax breaks and spending cuts through the Budget Committee. A small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers, insisting on steeper cuts to Medicaid and President Joe Biden’s green energy tax breaks, joined all Democrats in opposing it – a rare political setback for the Republican president. Since his return to the White House on January 20, Trump has said he would balance the budget while his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has repeatedly said the current administration aims to lower US government funding costs. Trump’s attempts to cut spending through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have fallen far short of its initial goals. And attempts to raise revenue through tariffs have sparked concerns about a trade war and global slowdown, roiling markets. Left unchecked, such worries could trigger a bond market rout and hinder the administration’s ability to pursue its agenda. The downgrade, which came after market close, sent yields on Treasury bonds higher, and analysts said it could give investors a pause when markets re-open for regular trading on Monday. “Very surprising. This is big – markets were not expecting this at all,” said Tom di Galoma, managing director of rates and trading at Mischler Financial in Utah.",

    "title": "US Supreme Court blocks the Trump administration’s use of Alien Enemies Act",
    "article_text": "The United States Supreme Court has granted an emergency petition from a group of migrants in Texas, barring the use of an 18th-century wartime law to expedite their removals. Friday’s unsigned decision(PDF)is yet another blow to the administration of President Donald Trump, who has sought to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly deport undocumented immigrants out of the US. Only two conservative justices dissented: Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. While the high court has yet to rule on the merits of Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, it did issue “injunctive relief” to Venezuelan migrants faced with expulsion under the centuries-old law. “We have long held that ‘no person shall be’ removed from the United States ‘without opportunity, at some time, to be heard’,” the court majority wrote in its ruling. It reaffirmed aprevious opinionthat migrants in the US areentitled to due process– in other words, they are entitled to a fair hearing in the judicial system – before their deportation. Friday’s case was brought by two unnamed migrants from Venezuela, identified only by initials. They are being held in a detention centre in north Texas as they face deportation. The Trump administration hasaccused them, and others from Venezuela, of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. It has further sought to paint undocumented migration into the US as an “invasion” and link Tren de Aragua’s activities in the US to the Venezuelan government, an assertion that a recently declassified intelligence memo disputes. That, the Trump administration has argued, justifies its use of the Alien Enemies Act, which has only been used three times prior in US history – and only during periods of war. But Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act has spurred a legal backlash, with several US district courts hearing petitions from migrants fearing expulsion under the law. Multiple judgeshave barredthe law’s use for expedited removals. But one judge in Pennsylvania ruled the Trump administration could deploy the law – provided it offer appropriate notice to those facing deportation. She suggested 21 days. The Supreme Court on Friday did not weigh in on whether Trump’s use of the law was merited. Instead, its ruling – 24 pages in total, including a dissent – hewed closely to the issue of whether the Venezuelans in question deserved relief from their imminent deportation under the law. The majority of the nine-justice bench noted that “evidence” it had seen in the case suggested “the Government had in fact taken steps on the afternoon of April 18” to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, even transporting the migrants “from their detention facility to an airport and later returning them”. The justices asserted that they had a right to weigh in on the case, in order to prevent “irreparable harm” to the migrants and assert their jurisdiction in the case. Otherwise, they pointed out a deportation could put the migrants beyond their reach. Justice Brett Kavanaugh went a step further in a separate opinion, calling on the Supreme Court to issue a final and binding ruling in the matter, rather than simply grant this one petition. “The circumstances call for a prompt and final resolution, which likely can be provided only by this Court,” he said, agreeing with the majority’s decision. Thomas and Alito, in their dissent, argued the Supreme Court had not afforded enough time to a lower court to rule on the emergency petition. In the aftermath of the ruling, Trump lashed out on Truth Social, portraying the Supreme Court’s majority as overly lax towards migrants. “THE SUPREME COURT WON’T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” Trumpwrotein the first of two consecutive posts. In the second, he called Friday’s decision the mark of a “bad and dangerous day in America”. He complained that affirming the right to due process would result in “a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person”. He also argued that the high court was preventing him from exercising his executive authority. “The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do,” hewrote, imagining a circumstance where extended deportation hearings would lead to “bedlam” in the US. His administration has long accused the courts of interference in his agenda. But critics have warned that Trump’s actions – particularly, alleged efforts to ignore court orders – are eroding the US’s constitutional system of checks and balances. In a statement after the ruling, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) praised the court’s decision as a bulwark against human rights abuses. “The court’s decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government’s attempt to hurry people away to aGulag-type prison in El Salvador,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance.” The Supreme Court currently boasts a conservative supermajority, with six right-leaning judges and three left-leaning ones. Three among them were appointed by Trump himself. Those three sided with the majority.",

    "title": "European leaders consult Trump to align response to Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "European leaders have agreed to step up joint action against Russia over its failure to agree to aceasefirewith Ukraine at a meeting on Friday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, following talks with United States President Donald Trump. As the Russia-Ukraine talks concluded in Istanbul on Friday, Starmer and fellow leaders from France, Germany and Poland – together with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – called the US president from a summit in Albania to discuss “developments” in the negotiations, Starmer said. Thetalks in Istanbulwere the first direct talks between officials from the rwo sides for more than three years. They lasted less than two hours, and the sides agreed to the biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war in 2022, but failed to make a major breakthrough on a ceasefire. “We just had a meeting with President Zelenskyy and then a phone call with President Trump to discuss the developments in the negotiations today,” Starmer said from Albania’s capital, Tirana, where leaders of dozens of European countries were gathered for the European Political Community summit. “And the Russian position is clearly unacceptable, and not for the first time. “So as a result of that meeting with President Zelenskyy and that call with President Trump, we are now closely aligning our responses and will continue to do so.” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that if Putin continued to reject a ceasefire, “we will need to have a response and therefore escalate sanctions”, which, he said, were being “reworked” by European nations and the US. Macron said it was too early to provide details on the “reworked” sanctions, but European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to “increase the pressure”. She said on Friday that the measures would target the shadow fleet of ageing cargo vessels that Russia is using to bypass international sanctions and the Nord Stream pipeline consortium. Russia’s financial sector would also be targeted. Earlier, Zelenskyy had said that Ukraine was committed to ending the war, but urged the European leaders to ramp up sanctions “against Russia’s energy sector and banks” if Putin continued to drag his feet in talks. “I think Putin made a mistake by sending a low-level delegation,” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said as he arrived at the Tirana summit. “The ball is clearly in his part of the field now, in his court. He has to play ball. He has to be serious about wanting peace.”",

    "title": "‘I cannot stand by’: Former ambassador denounces Ukraine shift under Trump",
    "article_text": "A recent United States ambassador to Ukraine has published an opinion column explaining her decision to resign her post, and criticising President Donald Trump for siding with Russia over Ukraine. On Friday, former diplomatBridget Brinkpublished an article in the Detroit Free Press, a newspaper in her home state of Michigan, expressing concern about current US foreign policy. The US has long been an ally of Ukraine, and since 2014, it has provided thewar-torn countrywith military assistance, as it fends off Russia’s attempts at invasion and annexation. But Brink wrote that there has been a shift since President Trump returned to office for a second term in January. “I respect the president’s right and responsibility to determine U.S. foreign policy,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, the policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia.” Brink pointed out that her time at the US Department of State included roles under five presidents, both Democrat and Republican. But she said the shift under the Trump administration forced her to abandon her ambassadorship to Ukraine, a position she held from 2022 until last month. “I cannot stand by while a country is invaded, a democracy bombarded, and children killed with impunity,” she said of the situation in Ukraine. “I believe that the only way to secure U.S. interests is to stand up for democracies and to stand against autocrats. Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement.” Brink’s position as ambassador has spanned much of the current conflict in Ukraine. After annexing Crimea and occupying other Ukrainian territories starting in 2014, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Brink assumed her post that May. But the slow-grinding war in Ukraine has cost thousands of lives and displaced many more. While campaigning for re-election in 2024, Trump blamed the war’s eruption on the “weak” foreign policy of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. He also pledged to end the war on his first day back in office, if re-elected. “I’ll have that done in 24 hours. I’ll have it done,” Trump told one CNN town hall in 2023. Since taking office, however, Trump has walked back those comments, calling them an “exaggeration” in an interview with Time Magazine. Still, his administration has pushed Ukraine and Russia to engage in peace talks, as part of an effort to end the war. How those negotiations have unfolded under Trump, however, has been the source of scrutiny and debate. Ukraine and its European allies have accused Trump of sidelining their interests in favour of his one-on-one negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They also have criticised Trump and his officials for seeming to offer Russia concessions even before the negotiations officially began. On February 12, for instance, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told an international defence group in Brussels that Ukraine may never regain some of its occupied territory. “We must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,” he said, adding that membership in the NATO military alliance was also unlikely. “Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.” Trump has gone so far as toblame Ukraine’s NATO ambitionsas the cause of the war, something critics blast as a Kremlin talking point. Amid the negotiations, the relationship between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has grown increasingly testy. Already, during his first term, Trump faced impeachment proceedings over an alleged attempt to pressure Zelenskyy by withholding military aid. During his second term, though, Trump upped the ante, calling the Ukrainian president a “dictator” for not holding elections, something prohibited under Ukraine’s wartime laws. Onepublic displayof frustration came in the White House on February 28, when Trump shouted at Zelenskyy,calling him “disrespectful”during a gathering with journalists. The US president also used the appearance to defend his warm relationship with Russia’s president. “ Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,” Trump told Zelenskyy. The shouting match led to a brief suspension of US aid andintelligence sharingwith Ukraine. In the months since, their two countries have agreed to a deal that would establish a joint investment fund that would allow Washington access to Ukraine’s mineral resources — a long-desired Trump goal. The US president has voiced concern about the amount of money invested in Ukraine’s security, with Congress appropriating more than $174bn since the war began in 2022. He has also argued that a US mining presence would help deter foreign attacks in Ukraine. But peace between Russia and Ukraine has remained elusive. Talks between the two warring parties on Friday ended after less than two hours, though they did agree toan exchange of 1,000 prisoners each. In her op-ed column, Brink was clear that she held Russia responsible for the ongoing aggression. “Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, it has done what can only be described as pure evil: killed thousands of civilians, including 700 children, with missiles and drones that hit their homes and apartments in the dead of night,” she wrote. She added that Europe has not experienced “violence so systematic, so widespread and so horrifying in Europe since World War II”. Brink warned that, if the US did not stand up to Russia, a domino effect could occur, paving the way for military assaults on other countries. “If we allow Putin to redraw borders by force, he won’t stop with Ukraine,” she wrote. “Taken at his word, Putin’s ambition is to resurrect an imperial past ― and he can’t do that without threatening the security of our NATO allies.”",

    "title": "FA Cup Final 2025: Guardiola sees win as ‘massively important’ to Man City",
    "article_text": "The FA Cup was not Manchester City’s top priority this season, but now that they are in a third straight final, the club will go all out to win the trophy at Wembley, manager Pep Guardiola said. City have had a “horrific season” in the words of striker Erling Haaland, with Guardiola’s side falling by the wayside in the Premier League title race while they were also eliminated in the Champions League knockout phase playoffs. City are fourth in the Premier League and yet to secure Champions League qualification for next season – winningthe FA Cup when they face Crystal Palaceon Saturday may not be enough to salvage their campaign. “That is the problem, right? The FA Cup now is not the first choice. Of course, we want it. Once we are here, of course, we want the trophy. It is massively important,” Guardiola told reporters on Friday. “It was a disappointment last season [losing in the final to Manchester United]. But I’m pretty sure we’ll perform well, and we are going to compete against them. “It’s the final of the FA Cup, it’s an honour and a privilege. Third time in a row being there, and we have to perform well. We travel to London to win the title.” Guardiola also praised Oliver Glasner’s Palace, who knocked out fellow Premier League sides Fulham and Aston Villa to reach the final. Palace, who are 12th in the league table, are seeking their first major trophy, having fallen in the final in 1990 and 2016, losing to Manchester United on both occasions. “It is a fantastic team. They have had a really good second part of the season. They have had more than a year with Oliver working with the same players,” Guardiola said. “They are a threat because they have quality. [Striker Jean-Philippe] Mateta is strong and the quality in [Eberechi] Eze is obvious and, of course, the pace from [fellow forward Ismaila] Sarr … [Adam] Wharton is a really good holding midfielder. “They are well structured defensively and their set-pieces are one of the best in the Premier League.” The quiet confidence seeping out of Crystal Palace’s training ground before the final against Manchester City was summed up by manager Oliver Glasner on Friday. “We’re focused on what we want to do at Wembley. We analysed Man City, but 90 percent, we were talking about us,” Glasner, who will become the first Austrian to lead a team in an FA Cup final, told reporters. “This is what we can influence. We can influence our performance. We can influence what we want to do in and out of possession. And the focus was on our game. We have a lot of confidence and looking forward to the final.” Palace may be 12th in the Premier League, but have matched their record points tally with two games still to play. In the FA Cup, they have clicked impressively, winning 3-0 at Fulham in the quarterfinals and then beating Villa by the same margin at Wembley in the semis. Now, they have one last obstacle to get over and claim the south London club’s first major trophy in its 120-year history. Palace drew 2-2 with City at Selhurst Park in the league and led 2-0 in the return fixture, only to lose 5-2. They also lost 4-2 last April, a couple of months after Glasner took charge. Scoring goals against Pep Guardiola’s team has not been a problem, but Glasner knows they will need to adjust defensively to give themselves the best possible chance at Wembley. “In every single game [against City] we scored two goals, but we just had one draw, because we conceded four, two and five, so we have to make a few adjustments in our defending,” he said. “Because when you concede five, it’s tough to win, but when you score two, you should be able to win. “So, we have confidence that we will create our chances, we will create our situations to score goals, but we have to do better in defence, and I don’t mean the back three or the back five. So as a team, maybe we have to adjust a few things, and this is what we want to do tomorrow.” Palace fans, hoping it will be third time lucky in Cup finals after defeats in 1990 and 2016, produced a wall of sound and colour in the semifinal against Villa and are bound to give their side passionate support again on Saturday. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson was one of several Palace players to donate to a fundraising campaign for a giant “tifo” against Villa, and another 45,000 pounds has been raised for one to be unfurled before Saturday’s Wembley showdown. “The one against Villa was top class,” said Henderson. “I don’t know what they are going to do with 40-odd grand – but I’m excited to see it.”",

    "title": "World Bank says Syria eligible for new loans after debts cleared",
    "article_text": "The World Bank says it will restart operations in Syria following a 14-year pause after the country cleared more than $15m of debt with financial backing fromSaudi Arabia and Qatar. The United States-based institution announced on Friday that Syria no longer has outstanding obligations to the International Development Association (IDA), its fund dedicated to low-income countries. Earlier this week, Saudi Arabia and Qatar paid off Syria’s outstanding debts of approximately $15.5m, paving the way for renewed engagement with international financial bodies. “We are pleased that the clearance of Syria’s arrears will allow the World Bank Group to reengage with the country and address the development needs of the Syrian people,” the bank said. “After years of conflict, Syria is on a path to recovery and development.” The bank is now preparing its first project in Syria, which will focus on improving electricity access — a key pillar for revitalising essential services like healthcare, education, and water supply. Officials said it marks the beginning of expanded support aimed at stabilising Syria andboosting long-term growth. The bank’s announcement coincides with a dramatic shift in US policy towards Damascus. US President Donald Trumpannouncedon Tuesday that Washington would begin lifting sanctions imposed on Syria, including measures under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. On Wednesday, Trump met Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa on the sidelines of the GCC summit in Riyadh, marking a historic breakthrough in relations between the countries and the first such meeting between the two nations’ leaders in 25 years. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that waivers would be issued, easing restrictions on entities previously penalised for dealings with the now former administration of Bashar al-Assad, which was toppled in December. “Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist and banking expert,toldAl Jazeera. “The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.” The moves represent a significant moment in Syria’s reintegration into the global financial system after 13 years of civil war and isolation. In April, a rare meeting was held in Washington involving officials from Syria, the IMF, the World Bank, and Saudi Arabia. A joint statement issued afterwards acknowledged the dire state of Syria’s economy and promised coordinated efforts to support its recovery. The International Monetary Fund has since named its first mission chief to Syria in more than a decade. Ron van Rooden, previously involved with IMF operations in Ukraine, will lead the Fund’s renewed engagement. Martin Muehleisen, a former IMF strategy chief, noted the urgency of providing technical assistance to rebuild Syria’s financial institutions. “Those efforts could be funded by donors and grants in-kind,” he told the news agency Reuters, adding that some support could begin within months. Al-Assad was toppled after a lightning offensive by opposition fighters led by the Hay’et Tahrir al-Sham armed group last December. Syria’s new government has sought to rebuild the country’s diplomatic ties, including with international financial institutions. It also counts on wealthy Gulf Arab states to play a pivotal role in financing the reconstruction of Syria’s war-ravaged infrastructure and reviving its economy. Thegovernment, led by interim President al-Sharaa, also wants to transition away from the system that gave al-Assad loyalists privileged access to government contracts and kept key industries in the hands of the al-Assad family.",

    "title": "Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ at a crucial juncture",
    "article_text": "United States House Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill”, a wide-ranging tax and spending legislation, is at a crucial moment. Thenearly 400-page legislationproposes sweeping changes which include extending the 2017 tax cuts, slashing taxes for businesses and individuals, and enacting deep cuts to social programmes like Medicaid and SNAP. While Republicans tout the bill as a boon for economic growth and middle-class relief, nonpartisan analysts warn it could add trillions to the national debt and strip millions of Americans of medical and food assistance. The bill will be voted on by the House Budget Committee today and, if passed, will be voted on the floor next week. The most substantive part of the bill is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The tax bill would add at least an additional $2.5 trillion to the national deficit over the next 10 years and decrease federal tax revenue byroughly $4 trillionby 2034. Passing the legislation will also raise the debt ceiling, which sets the amount of money the government can borrow to pay for existing expenditures, by $4 trillion, a sticking point for hardline Republicans who want deeper cuts. Here are some of the key measures in the proposed bill in its current form. The bill increases standard deductions for all Americans. Individual deductions will increase by $1,000, $1,500 for heads of households, and $2,000 for married couples. The bill extends the child tax credit of $2,000, which would otherwise have ended with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts at year’s end. It bumps up the child tax credit by $500 per child for this tax year and runs through the end of 2028. It also includes a $1,000 savings account for children born between December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2029. The legislation would also allow families to annually contribute $5,000 tax-free. There is a new tax deduction for Americans 65 and older. The new bill would give a $4,000 annual deduction starting this year for people making a gross income of $75,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a married couple. If passed, the rule would take effect for the current tax year and run until the end of 2028. “It will just make tax paying more complicated and more uncertain when a lot of these things ultimately expire,” Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute, told Al Jazeera. Another provision in the bill modifies state and local tax (SALT) deductions. It allows filers to be able to write off some of what they paid in local and state taxes from their federal filings. Under the 2017 tax act, that was capped at $10,000, but the new legislation would raise that to $30,000. Some Republicans, particularly those in states with higher taxes like New York and California, have been pushing to raise the cap or abolish it altogether. However, they have faced fiscal hawks and those who see the increases as relief for those already wealthy. The bill includes an increased benefit for small businesses that allows them to deduct 23 percent of their qualified business income from their taxes, up from the current 20 percent. There is also a call for no taxes on overtime pay for select individuals. It would not apply to people who are non-citizens, those who are considered “highly compensated employees,” and those who earn a tipped wage. The bill, however, also eliminates taxes on tips, a critical campaign promise by both Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. The bill would allow people who work in sectors like food service, as well as hair care, nail care, aesthetics, and body and spa treatments, to specifically deduct the amount of tipped income they receive. At the federal level, employers will still not be required to pay tipped workers more than thesubminimum wage of $2.13hourly. The intention is that workers will be able to make up the difference in tipping the receipt from customers. The legislation calls to make $880bn in cuts to key government programmes with a focus mostly on Medicaid and food stamps. The CBO found that more than 10 million people could lose Medicaid access and 7.6 million could lose access to health insurance completely by 2034 under the current plan. Even far-right Republicans have called out the Medicaid cuts. In an op-ed in The New York Times this week, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said the cuts are “morally wrong and politically suicidal”. According to a new report from One Fair Wage shared with Al Jazeera, tipped workers could be hit especially hard, as 1.2 million restaurant and tipped workers could lose access to Medicaid. “A no tax on tips proposal, which is like a minuscule percentage of their income and doesn’t affect two-thirds of tips workers because they don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, is just nowhere near enough to compensate for the fact that we’re going to have millions of these workers lose the ability to take care of themselves, in some cases go into medical debt, in many cases just not take care of themselves,” Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group for restaurant workers, told Al Jazeera. The bill also introduces work requirements to receive benefits, saying that recipients must prove they work, volunteer or are enrolled in school for at least 80 hours each month. At the same time, the bill also shortens the open enrolment period by a month for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare. This means people who have employer-funded healthcare and lose their job might lose eligibility to buy a private plan on the healthcare exchange. “It’s taking folks like 11 to 12 weeks to find a new job. The worse the labour market gets, that number will tick up. If you’re unemployed for three months, you get kicked off Medicaid,” Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. “Then, if you try to go buy a plan on the ACA marketplace, you are no longer eligible for subsidies … which I think is really cruel.” Other major proposed cuts will hit programmes like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme or SNAP, which helps 42 million low-income individuals afford groceries and comes at a time when food costs are still 2 percent higher than a year ago. The CBO found that 3 million people could lose SNAP access under the new plan. The bill would also force states to take up more responsibility in funding the programmes. States would be required to cover 75 percent of the administrative costs, and all states would have to pay at least 5 percent of the benefits — 28 states would need to pay 25 percent. “States are now going to be on the hook for billions of dollars in funding for these two vital programmes. They have a tough choice. One is, do they cut funding from others like K-12 education, roads, veteran services, etc, to cover this gap, or do they raise taxes so that they can raise more revenue to cover this gap,” Pancotti added. Under the current law, the federal government is solely responsible for shouldering the cost of benefits. The proposed cuts would save $300bn for the federal government but hit state budgets hard. The bill would also cut the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases and $4,000 for a used EV, a move which could hurt several major US automakers that are already reeling from the administration’s tariffs on automobiles. General Motors pumped billions into domestic EV production in the last year, which has included a $900m investment to retrofit an existing plant to build electric vehicles in Michigan and alongside Samsung, the carmaker invested $3.5bn in EV battery manufacturing in the US. In February, Ford CEO Jim Farley said that revoking the EV tax credit could put factory jobs on the chopping block. The carmaker invested in three EV battery plants in Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. The federal government under the administration of former President Joe Biden paid out more than $2bn in EV tax credits in 2024. The proposed legislation would also give the Trump administration authority to revoke the tax exempt status of nonprofit organisations that it deems as a “terrorist supporting organisation”. It would give the secretary of the treasury the ability to accuse any nonprofit of supporting “terrorism”, revoke their tax exempt status without allowing them due process to prove otherwise, which has raised serious concerns amongst critics. “This measure’s real intent lurks behind its hyperbolic and unsubstantiated anti-terrorist rhetoric: It would allow the Treasury Department to explicitly target, harass and investigate thousands of U.S. organizations that make up civil society, including nonprofit newsrooms,” Jenna Ruddock, advocacy director of Free Press Action, said in a statement. “The bill’s language lacks any meaningful safeguards against abuse. Instead it puts the burden of proof on organizations rather than on the government. It’s not hard to imagine how the Trump administration would use it to exact revenge on groups that have raised questions about or simply angered the president and other officials in his orbit.” The bill would introduce new taxes on colleges, including a varying tax rate based on the size of a university’s endowment per student with the highest at 14 percent for universities with a per student endowment of more than $1.25m but less than $2m and 21 percent for those of $2m or more. This comes amid the Trump administration’s increased tensions with higher education. In the last week, the Trump administration pulled$450m in grants to Harvardon top of the $2.2bn it pulled in April — a move which will hinder research into cancer and heart disease, among other areas. Harvard has an endowment of $53.2bn, making it one of the richest schools in the country. The legislation would also increase funding for a border wall between the US and Mexico, which the administration has argued will help curb undocumented immigration. However, there is no evidence that such a wall has deterred border crossings. A 2018 analysis fromStanford Universityfound that a border wall would only curb migration by 0.6 percent, yet the bill would give more than $50bn to finish the border wall and maritime crossings. The bill would also provide $45bn for building and maintaining detention facilities and another $14bn for transport.",

    "title": "Five key takeaways from US President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Three days, three countries, hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and a geopolitical shift in the United States’s approach to the region: Donald Trump’s trip to the Middle East has been eventful. This week, the United States president visited Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in the first planned trip of his second presidency, after attendingPope Francis’sfuneral last month. Trump was visibly gleeful throughout the trip as he secured investments, criticised domestic political rivals and heaped praise on Gulf leaders. The word “historic” was used more than a few times by US officials to describe the visits. With Trump returning to the White House, here are five key takeaways from his trip: Addressing an investment summit in Riyadh, Trump promoted a realist approach to the Middle East — one in which the US does not intervene in the affairs of other countries. He took a swipe at neoconservatives who oversaw the USwars in Iraqand Afghanistan, as he lauded Gulf leaders for developing the region. “This great transformation has not come from Western intervention or flying people in beautiful planes, giving you lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,” he said. “The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing todevelop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities.” Trump built his political brand with his “America First” slogan, calling for the US to focus on its own issues instead of helping — or bombing — foreign countries. But his words at the investment summit marked a stern rebuke of the neo-cons who dominated Trump’s Republican Party a decade ago. “In the end, the so-called nation-builders wrecked far more nations than they built, and the interventionists were intervening in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,” Trump said. It is rare for US presidents to travel to the Middle East and not visit Israel, but Trump omitted the US ally from his itinerary as he toured the region. Skipping Israel was seen as a reflection of the deteriorating ties between the US administration and the government of Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu. This week’s trip also came in the context of several moves perceived as evidence of the US marginalising Israel. The US has continued to hold talks with Israel’s rival Iran, announced a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, and conducted unilateral negotiations to release Israeli soldierEdan Alexander, a US citizen, from Hamas captivity. Moreover, while touring the Gulf, Trumpdid not use his remarks to prioritisethe establishment of formal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which had been a top goal during his first term. It remains unclear how Trump’s decisions will affect the “special relationship” between the two allies, but experts say it is becoming increasingly apparent that the US no longer views the Middle East solely through the lens of Israel. “Is it a tactical problem for Netanyahu and the entire pro-Israel lobby? I think it is,” Khaled Elgindy, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University, said of Trump’s shift. “It does throw a wrench in the machinery because it is a president who is showing openly daylight with Israeli decision-making, and not just in rhetoric, but acting on it — leaving Israel out of the process.” With that chasm emerging, some Palestinian rights advocates had hoped that the US president’s trip to the region would see Washington pursue a deal to end Israel’s war on Gaza. But as Trump marvelled at the luxurious buildings in the Gulf, Israel intensifiedits bombardmentto destroy what’s left of the Palestinian territory. No ceasefire was announced, despite reports of continuing talks in Doha. And Israel appears to be pushing forward with its plan to expand its assault on Gaza as itcontinues to block aidfor the nearly two million people in the enclave, leading to fears of famine. United Nations experts and rights groups have described the situationas a genocide. But despite preaching “peace and prosperity” for both Israelis and Palestinians, Trump made no strong push to end the war during this week’s trip. On Thursday, Trump suggested that he has not given up on the idea of depopulating Gaza and turning it over to the US — a proposal that legal experts say amounts to ethnic cleansing. “I have concepts for Gaza that I think are very good. Make it a freedom zone,” he said. “Let the United States get involved, and make it just a freedom zone.” In a move that surprised many observers, Trump announced from Riyadh that he will offer sanction relief to Syria, as the country emerges from a decade-plus civil war. Trump also met with interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa anddescribed himas a “young, attractive guy”. A wholesale lifting of sanctions was not expected, in part because of Israel’s hostility to the new authorities in Syria. Israeli officials often describe al-Sharaa, who led al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria before severing ties with the group, as a “terrorist”. But Trump said he made the decision to lift the economic penalties against Syria at the request of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” the US president said. The White House said on Wednesday that Trump had a list of requests for al-Sharaa, including establishing diplomatic relations with Israel and deporting “Palestinian terrorists”. Removing US sanctions, which had been imposed on the government of former PresidentBashar al-Assad, is likely to be a boost for the new Syrian authorities, who are grappling with an ailing economy after years of conflict. “Lifting sanctions on Syria represents a fundamental turning point,” Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist,told Al Jazeera. “The Syrian economy will transition from interacting with developing economies to integrating with more developed ones, potentially significantly reshaping trade and investment relations.” In Saudi Arabia, Trump declared that he wants a deal with Iran — and he wants it done quickly. “We really want them to be a successful country,” the US president said of Iran. “We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. This is an offer that will not last forever. The time is right now for them to choose.” Trump warned Iran that, if it rejects his “olive branch”, he would impose a “massive maximum pressure” against Tehran and choke off its oil exports. Notably, Trump did not threaten explicit military action against Iran, a departure from his previous rhetoric. In late March, for instance, he told NBC News, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.” Iran says it is not seeking nuclear weapons and would welcome a stringent monitoring programme of its nuclear facilities. But Israel and some hawks want the Iranian nuclear programme completely dismantled, not just scaled back. US and Iranian officials have held multiple rounds of talks this year, butTehran saysit has not received an official offer from Washington. And Trump officials have not explicitly indicated what the endgame of the talks is. US envoySteve Witkoffsaid last month that Iran “must stop and eliminate” uranium enrichment, but days earlier, he had suggested that enrichment should be brought down to civilian energy levels. Several Gulf countries, including the three that Trump visited this week, have welcomed the nuclear negotiations, as relations between Iran and its Arab neighbours have grownmore stablein recent years. Before entering politics, Trump was a real estate mogul who played up his celebrity persona as a mega-rich dealmaker. He appears to have brought that business mindset to the White House. While in the wealthy Gulf region, Trump was in his element. He announced deals that would see Saudi Arabia, Qatar andthe UAEbuy US arms and invest in American firms. According to the White House, Trump secured a total of $2 trillion in investments from the Middle East during the trip. And his administration is framing the deals as a major political and economic victory for Trump. “While it took President Biden nearly four years to secure $1 trillion in investments, President Trump achieved this in his first month, with additional investment commitments continuing to roll in,” the White House said. “President Trump is accelerating investment in America and securing fair trade deals around the world, paving the way for a new Golden Age of lasting prosperity for generations to come.”",

    "title": "Israel launches strikes on two Yemen ports",
    "article_text": "Israel says it has launched strikes on the Yemeni ports of Hodeidah and as-Salif in response to the Houthi rebels firing missiles towards Israel, days after the Yemeni group agreed a truce with the United States. The Israeli military said it carried out strikes on “terrorist infrastructure” on Friday, saying on X that the two ports had been used by the Houthi rebel group to “transfer weapons”. Al Masirah TV, a Houthi-affiliated outlet, also reported Israeli strikes on the two ports. The extent of any damage was not clear, and there no immediate reports of casualties. The Houthis have carried out a campaign of attacks against Israel in self-proclaimed solidarity with Palestinians after Israel launched its assault on Gaza in October 2023. Israel has carried out strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen’s main airport in Sanaa and killed several people. Friday’s attacks were the first since US President Donald Trump agreed to aceasefire dealwith the Houthis earlier this month, with the US halting its attacks on Yemen and the group agreeing to end its attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Israel was not included in that agreement, and its military said it intercepted several missiles fired from Yemen towards Israeli airspace this week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that the attacks are “just the beginning”, describing the Houthis as “just a tool”, alleging that Iran was “behind them”. “We will not stand idly by and allow the Houthis to harm us. We will strike them with greater force, including at their leadership and all the infrastructure that enables them to attack us,” he said in a statement posted on the government’s social media account. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz pledged to “hunt down and eliminate”Houthileader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi if the rebel group continued “to fire missiles at the State of Israel”. Alluding to recent Houthi attacks on Israel, Katz indicated leader al-Houthi would meet the same fate as Hamas commandersMohammed DeifandYahya Sinwarin Gaza, Hamas political chiefIsmail Haniyehin Iran, and Hezbollah leaderHassan Nasrallahin Lebanon – all killed in Israeli attacks over the last year. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Jordan’s capital Amman, said that since Israel broke a ceasefire agreement with Hamas back in March – killing almost 3,000 since then, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry – the Houthis had launched “at least 34 different projectiles” towards Israel. She said that Israel’s policy “moving forward” would be to strike back. “For every missile that’s fired, they’re going to be conducting these types of air strikes,” she said.",

    "title": "Breaking down a deadly week in Gaza as Israel kills hundreds",
    "article_text": "More than 19 months into its war on Gaza, Israel shows few signs that it is relenting. The last week has shown the opposite, an intensification of violence across the besieged Palestinian territory, leaving hundreds dead, and hundreds of thousands terrified of what comes next. This was a week where United States President Donald Trump toured the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. There had been hope that some kind of ceasefire deal would be announced, or that the US would put more pressure on Israel to seriously come to the negotiating table. That was particularly the case after Hamas released a US-Israeli captive on Monday without demanding anything in exchange. Ultimately, none of that happened, with Trump returning to his idea of US involvement in the future administration of whatever is left of Gaza, while acknowledging that Palestinians there were starving. Israel also intercepted a number of missiles fired by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, before attacking Yemen itself on Friday. Lets take a closer look at a week that has devastated Gaza, and left Palestinians there feeling even more abandoned. According to figures compiled by Al Jazeera, at least 370 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday. The violence has been particularly deadly in the second half of the week, with medical sources reporting the killing of at least 100 Palestinians on Friday, and 143 on Thursday. Many of those killed have been women and children. These are some of the worst single-day death tolls since the beginning of the war in October 2023. The killings put the total death toll reported by the Gaza Ministry of Healthmore than 53,000, although the territory’s Government Media Office’s death toll now sits at more than 61,700, as it includes thousands of Palestinians still under the rubble who are presumed dead. Israeli attacks have targeted the whole Gaza Strip, with a particular focus on the north. Hospitals have also repeatedly been bombed by Israel. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has been caused by Israel’s complete blockade of the entry of all food and medication to the Strip since March 2, a decision it made when the ceasefire was still ongoing, and one that goes against international law. A report released on Monday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) initiative said that the Gaza Strip was “still confronted with a critical risk of famine”, withhalf a million people facing starvationand 93 percent of its more than 2 million population at severe risk. People are already starving to death – Gaza authorities last week said that 57 people had died as a result of starvation. Trump acknowledged that “a lot of people are starving” in Gaza and said that the US was “going to get that taken care of”, but provided few details. The US has backed a new body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that it says will start work in Gaza by the end of the month. But the plan has been rejected by the United Nations and other humanitarian groups, who say that the plan would lead to more displacement for Palestinians in Gaza, as it would only disperse aid in some areas of Gaza, and set a dangerous precedent for the delivery of aid in warzones. The UN has reiterated that it has the capacity to deliver aid across Gaza, but is being prevented from doing so by Israel. It says it has enough aid ready to deliver to feed all of the Palestinians in Gazafor four months, if Israel allows its trucks in. Palestinians in Gaza have been recounting the horrors of the past week, desperately calling for the world to act and stop Israel’s bombing. In northern Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, one of the worst hit areas, one civilian had a simple message – “either kill us or let us live.” “All of [the strikes] were targeting civilians. All the houses are being bombed – everything is gone,” Ahmed Mansour told Al Jazeera. “What is a person supposed to do? They’re all making a joke out of us. I’m heading to the coast now. We’ve been displaced more than 50 times – either kill us or let us live.” Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, also called on Friday for the US to put more pressure on Israel to open the crossings into Gaza and “allow the immediate entry of humanitarian aid – food, medicine and fuel – to the hospitals in the Gaza Strip”. The Israeli government has made it clear that it is unwilling to agree to a deal that would end the war in return for the release of all the Israeli captives still held in Gaza, despite widespread domestic support for such a deal. Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks of total victory against Hamas, although it is difficult to see what that would entail. Instead, the war drags on, and Netanyahu said on Monday that preparations were continuing for “an intensification of the fighting”. Last week, he said that Israel was planning for the “total conquest” of Gaza. Trump left the Middle East this week with no ceasefire deal agreed, only saying, “We’re going to find out pretty soon” when asked whether a deal was in place for the return of Israel’s captives. Meanwhile, the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz reported that Israel’s position was “rigid” and that the US had “lost interest”. A source told the newspaper that US envoy Steve Witkoff was “no longer involved”. “He’s waiting to hear what we want, and since we don’t want anything, he has nothing left to do,” the source said.",

    "title": "NJ Transit workers go on strike after wage increase talks stall",
    "article_text": "New Jersey’s commuter rail engineers are on strike after negotiations for higher wages failed to materialise, leaving trains idle for commuters in the third-largest transit system in the United States for the first time in more than 40 years. The strike began on Friday after The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, which represents 450 NJ Transit engineers who drive the agency’s commuter trains and agency management, broke off talks late Thursday after an unsuccessful 15-hour bargaining session. The labour clash came weeks after negotiators had agreed on a potential deal in March, but the union’s members voted overwhelmingly to reject it. NJ Transit has said it cannot afford the pay rises that the engineers are seeking because 14 other unions that negotiate separate labour contracts with the agency would demand the same, higher wage rates for their members. The union pushed back on the gripe and has said that “NJT claims it doesn’t have the money to pay engineers a salary in line with industry standards, but somehow found a half-billion dollars for a new and unnecessary headquarters.” New Jersey Transit opened a new headquarters earlier this year. The union has said it is simply aiming to raise the engineers’ salaries to match those at other commuter railroads in the region. “They [rail engineers]  have gone without a raise for six years and have been seeking a new contract since October 2019,” the union said in a statement. NJ Transit says the engineers currently make $135,000 on average and that management had offered a deal that would yield an average salary of $172,000. But the union has disputed those figures, saying the current average salary is actually $113,000. The parties have exchanged accusations of bad-faith bargaining. The strike means that hundreds of thousands of daily passengers in New Jersey and New York are without service. NJ Transit said its rail system began its shutdown at 12:01am local time Friday. In a news conference, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and NJ Transit’s Chief Executive Officer Kris Kolluri told reporters talks had paused but that management remained willing to resume negotiations at any time. “We must reach a final deal that is both fair to employees and affordable,” Murphy, a Democrat, told reporters. “Let’s get back to the table and seal a deal.” Murphy and Kolluri said the US National Mediation Board had reached out to both sides to propose reopening talks on Sunday morning, or sooner if the parties wished. The union statement made no mention of when talks might be restarted. Protests began at several locations across the rail system, including NJ Transit’s headquarters in Newark, Penn Station in New York City, and the Atlantic City rail terminal. The governor and the NJ Transit CEO also outlined contingency plans for dealing with the work stoppage, the first transit strike to hit New Jersey since a three-week walkout in 1983. The looming strike had already prompted the agency to cancel trains and buses to MetLife Stadium for pop star Shakira’s concert last night and again for this evening. In an advisory, NJ Transit encouraged commuters to work from home starting on Friday if possible. The agency said it would increase bus services on existing lines and charter private buses to operate from several satellite lots in the event of a rail strike but warned buses would only be able to handle about 20 percent of rail customers. Kolluri said last week that the union was “playing a game of chicken with the lives of 350,000 riders”. “We have sought nothing more than equal pay for equal work, only to be continually rebuffed by New Jersey Transit,” Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman, said earlier this week.",

    "title": "Attacker who stabbed author Salman Rushdie sentenced to 25 years in prison",
    "article_text": "The man who stabbed authorSalman Rushdie, leaving him blind in one eye, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison, the maximum term possible in the case. Friday’s sentencing hearing was the culmination of arelatively swift trialthat began on February 4. There was little ambiguity about the central events underlying the case: In August 2022, a 24-year-old named Hadi Matar rushed the stage of an amphitheatre where Rushdie was delivering a public lecture for New York’s Chautauqua Institution. Matar stabbed Rushdie approximately 15 times, delivering cuts to his neck, body and head. After being airlifted to a hospital, Rushdie eventually lost sight in one eye. Another speaker — Henry Reese, who runs a nonprofit for writers in exile — also received injuries, including a stab wound. Rushdie, now 77,testifiedin the state-level trial against Matar. “He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing,” the novelist said. He added that he thought at first he was being struck by fists, not a knife. It was only later that he realised the severity of his situation: “I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes.” The injuries resulted in Rushdie undergoing painful surgeries, including to seal his blinded eye. He spent months in recovery. “I’m not as energetic as I used to be. I’m not as physically strong as I used to be,” he told the court. On February 21, after less than two hours of deliberation, a jury in western New York found Matar bothguilty of attempted murderfor his attack on Rushdie and of assault for the injuries to Reese. In Friday’s hearing, Matar received 25 years for the attempted murder sentence and seven for the assault on Reese, to be served at the same time since the attacks happened at the same time. Rushdie, a British American novelist, was born in India to a Muslim family. His books have won wide acclaim: His novel Midnight’s Children earned the Booker Prize, a top literary honour awarded each year to a work of English-language fiction. But it was his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses, in 1988 that stirred up lasting controversy, specifically for passages deemed blasphemous to Muslims. By 1989, Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie’s death. The announcement sent Rushdie into hiding, and the British government assigned him round-the-clock protection. Deadly protests accompanied the novel’s publication, and bookstores, along with those close to Rushdie, faced violent attacks. Before Friday’s sentencing, Matar also delivered a statement to the court voicing his opposition to Rushdie and his work. “Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,” said Matar. “He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don’t agree with that.” Later, outside the courtroom, defence lawyer Nathaniel Barone took questions about whether his client felt regret or remorse about his actions. “ I think that’s a fair question, and I can’t answer that,” he responded. “All I can tell you is that I think that, unfortunately, people make bad decisions, and it’s something that certainly they regret or they’re remorseful about, but they may have a difficult time expressing that for whatever reasons.” Barone added that he felt Matar would have acted differently in hindsight. “ I know, if he had the opportunity, he would not be sitting where he is sitting today. And if he could change things, he would.” Matar’s defence team had sought a lesser sentence of 12 years in prison and plans to appeal the verdict, arguing that the prosecution did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to kill Rushdie. Barone also questioned the intense level of scrutiny on the case, calling it a “publicity sponge”. He argued that his client was denied the presumption of innocence due to any suspect. The prosecution, however, praised the sentencing hearing’s outcome as justice for the pain Rushdie continues to endure. “He’s traumatised. He has nightmares about what he experienced,” Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said after the hearing. “Obviously, this is a major setback for an individual that was starting to emerge in his very later years of life into society after going into hiding after the fatwa.” In explaining to the judge why he was pushing for the maximum sentence, Schmidt said that Matar “designed this attack so that he could inflict the most amount of damage, not just upon Mr. Rushdie, but upon this community, upon the 1,400 people who were there to watch it”. Separately, Matar, now 27, faces three counts of federal terrorism-related charges in the US, including providing material support to terrorists and committing terrorism that transcends national boundaries. “We allege that, in attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in New York in 2022, Hadi Matar committed an act of terrorism in the name of Hezbollah, a designated terrorist organization aligned with the Iranian regime,” former US Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. Iran, however, has denied involvement in Matar’s attack on Rushdie. Rushdie, meanwhile, has channelled his experiences from the attack into a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.",

    "title": "ICC prosecutor to step aside until probe into alleged misconduct ends",
    "article_text": "The chief prosecutor of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, has taken a leave of absence pending the conclusion of UN-led investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Khan’s office said on Friday that he had informed colleagues he would step aside temporarily until the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) wraps up its probe. The OIOS has been conducting the external investigation since December, following complaints raised with the ICC’s oversight body. The ICC said that Khan would remain on leave until the inquiry concludes, though a timeline for its completion remains unclear. During his absence, the court’s two deputy prosecutors will assume his responsibilities. Lawyers for Khan said he rejected all claims of wrongdoing and had only stepped aside temporarily due to intense media scrutiny, which had made it difficult for him to carry out his work effectively. “Our client remains the prosecutor, has not stepped down and has no intention of doing so,” UK-based law firm Carter-Ruck said in a statement. Khan’s decision to step aside temporarily follows months of growing pressure from human rights groups and some court officials, who had urged him to withdraw while the investigation was ongoing. “Stepping aside helps protect the court’s credibility and the trust of victims, staff, and the public. For the alleged victim and whistleblowers, this is also a moment of recognition and dignity,” said Danya Chaikel of human rights watchdog FIDH. The court has not confirmed when the OIOS investigation will conclude, but the case comes at a time of rising global scrutiny of the ICC’s role and credibility. The decision comes as the court is pursuing high-profile investigations, including into Russia’s assault on Ukraine and Israel’s war on Gaza. Khan requested arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin for thealleged unlawful deportationof Ukrainian children, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant foralleged war crimesin Gaza. The United States, a vocal critic of the court’s recent moves,imposed sanctionson Khan over his pursuit of Israeli officials. ICC leadership has since warned that such political attacks could endanger the institution’s survival.",

    "title": "Charter Communications to buy rival Cox for $21.9bn",
    "article_text": "Charter Communications has agreed to buy its rival Cox Communications for $21.9bn in a deal that would unite the two of the largest cable and broadband operators in the United States as they battle streaming giants and mobile carriers for customers. The deal, announced on Friday, comes more than a decade after the companies reportedly abandoned an earlier merger attempt. Since then, pressure has intensified on cable companies, with wireless carriers attracting broadband customers with aggressive plans, while millions ditch traditional pay-TV for streaming. The companies said they expect to realise $500m in cost savings within three years of the deal’s expected close in mid-2026. Under the cash-and-stock deal, Charter will take on about $12.6bn of Cox’s net debt and other obligations, giving the transaction an enterprise value of $34.5bn. Cox Enterprises, the family-owned parent of Cox Communications, will own about 23 percent of the merged entity, with its CEO Alex Taylor serving as chairman. The combined firm will rebrand as Cox Communications within a year of the deal’s close, with Charter’s Spectrum being the consumer-facing brand. It will keep its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, while maintaining a big presence at Cox’s campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The merger with Cox – one of the biggest deals globally this year – will aid Charter’s push to bundle broadband and mobile services, helping it fend off competition from carriers. Analysts have said Charter’s strategy of combining internet, TV and mobile services into a single, customizable package has shown merit, but it needs scale as cable firms rely on leasing network access from major carriers to offer mobile plans. “This combination will augment our ability to innovate and provide high-quality, competitively priced products,” said Charter CEO Chris Winfrey, who will head the combined company. The Spectrum-owner has a market value of nearly $60bn. On Wall Street, Charter’s stock rose on the news of the potential merger. As of 12:00pm ET (16:00 GMT) the stock is up 1.66 percent since the market opened. The merger will be among the first major tests of M&A regulation under the administration of US President Donald Trump, as it would create the largest US cable TV and broadband provider with about 38 million subscribers, surpassing current market leader Comcast. It will likely be reviewed by the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division. Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater, who leads the division, has made it clear she intends to focus on mergers that decrease competition in ways that harm consumers or workers. EMarketer analyst Ross Benes said the merged entity would be the largest US pay-TV operator, but the “ISP (internet service provider) side of the business is more consequential” for consumers, potentially positioning it as a regional monopoly. Winfrey echoed Trump’s “America First” employment priorities and said the deal would bring Cox’s customer service jobs back from overseas, but he did not specify how many. Charter’s customer service teams are already based entirely in the US. “This is the first big corporate move (in the same sector) to happen under the new Trump administration so … will set the tone for other potential moves or not,” said PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore. Charter and Cox had also discussed a merger in 2013 before shelving the plan, according to media reports. But speculation had risen again in recent months after cable billionaire John Malone said in November Charter should be allowed to merge with rivals such as Cox, shortly after Charter agreed to buy his Liberty Broadband. Liberty Broadband shareholders will receive direct interest in Charter under the terms of the deal with Cox.",

    "title": "In Istanbul, Russia plays chess while the West is stuck in make-believe",
    "article_text": "As Russian and Ukrainian delegations descended on Istanbul on Friday in an attempt to end the three-year war in Ukraine, the contrast between the two parties in the conflict couldn’t be starker. One seemed assured, methodical – clear about its goals. The other, scattered and uncertain. Russia’s position on the contours of a potential settlement has long been clear – aside from its calculated ambiguity on territorial matters, which it maintains as leverage. Moscow continues to push for a return to the Istanbul agreements, derailed – as we now know – by the UK and US in the spring of 2022. At the same time, it demands to retain the territories it has occupied since then – and possibly more, though how much more remains deliberately undefined. The position of the pro-Ukrainian coalition, by contrast, is chaotic. The United States has adopted an almost neutral stance, while Ukraine and its European allies are working to prevent Washington from pressuring Kyiv into what they view as a premature and unjust peace. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that the Trump administration is open to any mechanism that could bring an end to the conflict. Meanwhile, Ukraine and its European partners are insisting on a 30-day ceasefire as a precondition for entering peace talks. Just before the Istanbul negotiations began, Ukraine declared that its delegation would not discuss anything with the Russians until a ceasefire was agreed upon. European countries supported that demand, with threats of severe sanctions they claimed they were prepared to impose. Whether Ukraine would ultimately drop this demand remained the key point of uncertainty as direct talks commenced in Istanbul on Friday afternoon. When the negotiators emerged from the venue and faced the press, they left that question unanswered. The two parties agreed to continue the talks, but ceasefire remains on the table – perhaps as a face-saving measure that would keep Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on board. The Russians are extremely unlikely to agree to any ceasefire until they see a clear path to the final deal. But the goal of this ceasefire game was all too transparent – especially to its intended audience: Donald Trump’s administration. A ceasefire clearly works against Russia, whose main leverage in the negotiations is the slow but steady advance of its troops along the 1,000+ km front line. The Ukrainian and European demand was designed to be rejected. Its real purpose is to derail the talks, pit Trump against Putin, and revive the longstanding strategy of trying to defeat Russia through a combination of enhanced military support for Ukraine and new economic sanctions on Moscow. This strategy isn’t new – and it has already cost Ukraine dearly over the past three years: Vast territory and critical infrastructure have been lost, hundreds of thousands killed, and 6.9 million people, mostly women and children, have left the country – likely for good. In response to what it sees as manipulation, Russia sent a delegation of lower-than-expected political stature, but including top-level military and diplomatic experts capable of discussing all technical aspects of a possible deal. The message: Moscow is ready for substantive negotiations – if they move beyond performative ultimatums. Russia’s position on the contours of a settlement hasn’t shifted since the previous Istanbul talks in spring 2022, when it insisted on a neutral Ukraine with a cap on the size of its military. The only difference now is territory. Under the 2022 Istanbul framework, Russia would have withdrawn to the lines of contact as they existed before the full-scale invasion. Now, it claims the territory seized since then – and maintains strategic ambiguity over the parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia still under Ukrainian control, using them as bargaining chips. Since the full invasion began, Moscow has viewed territorial occupation as a form of punishment for what it sees as Ukraine’s intransigence. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova put it bluntly on Thursday: “Ukrainian territory shrinks every time Ukraine rejects negotiations.” But territory is not the Kremlin’s main objective in Ukraine. Its central goal is to draw a hard red line against further Western military expansion near its borders – hence its demands to restore Ukraine’s neutral status and reduce the size of its armed forces to a bare minimum. Moscow, however, is open to the idea of Ukraine joining the EU – not least because that prospect remains highly unlikely, as countries like Poland and others in Eastern Europe see Ukraine’s agricultural sector as a threat to their economic stability. Given the current battlefield situation, the war can only end on Russian terms – harsh and unjust as they may appear. The daily gains of Russian troops and Ukraine’s slow territorial losses underscore this point. Every delay in peace talks results in a smaller Ukraine. Putin is acting like a political racketeer – much like those who ran St Petersburg during his formative political years: The longer you resist, the more you pay. But a deal on these terms would be extremely difficult to sell – to Ukrainians and to Europeans, who have also endured significant economic fallout from sanctions on Russia. The inevitable question arises: What, then, did Ukrainians fight and die for over the past three years? They could have secured a far better deal under the Minsk agreements in 2015 – or even the failed Istanbul deal in 2022. What kept Ukraine in the fight was the illusion – cultivated by the military-industrial complex and psychological operations on social media – that a nuclear power like Russia could be decisively defeated. The fear of being exposed as a major contributor to Ukraine’s suffering – alongside Russia – is what now drives European politicians to keep digging a deeper hole for Ukraine and its leadership, rather than admit (or quietly reframe) defeat in a war that, as President Trump rightly states, should never have happened in the first place. But nearly all the cards are now on the table. Illusions are being discarded one by one. The idea, floated by France and the UK, of deploying NATO troops in Ukraine has been all but shelved – it would escalate the conflict from a proxy war to a direct NATO-Russia clash. Meanwhile, the EU is preparing to reduce duty-free trade quotas on Ukrainian imports, which had helped sustain Ukraine’s economy for the past three years. This is a telling sign that Brussels no longer sees continued war as a realistic path forward. One of the last-ditch efforts to shift the course of events is under way in the Baltic Sea, where Nordic and Baltic states are attempting to open a second front in the Ukraine war by targeting the so-called Russian “shadow fleet”—oil tankers that help Moscow circumvent Western sanctions. But the most recent attempt to board one such vessel ended with a Russian fighter jet violating Estonian airspace – a clear warning of what could come next. The West is not prepared for a confrontation with Russia – let alone the nuclear conflict that would almost certainly follow. But there is no shortage of alternative, win-win strategies. Ukraine stands to gain the most from peace – once it is firmly established. The real losers would be the political class and security elites who invested so heavily in illusory outcomes.

This latest PowerToy is designed for Windows developers and power users. byTom Warren Microsoft has quietly launched an updated Spotlight-like launcher app for Windows that provides quick access to commands, apps, and development tools. The software maker originally launched itsPowerToys Run launcherfor Windows 10 nearly five years ago, and the updated version —Command Palette— now includes search for apps, folders, and files, calculations, system commands, and much more. Command Palette is available for any Windows user from thePowerToys app, but it looks like Microsoft is now targeting this particular utility at power users and developers. You use Command Palette to access Windows commands or launch command prompts and shell shortcuts. Command Palette also has the ability to quickly open websites, web searches, and search through folders and files like you’d expect from a Spotlight- or -Alfred-like interface. Microsoft has also moved its previous Window Walker PowerToy into Command Palette so you can easily switch between open windows. The most interesting part about Command Palette is that Microsoft has made it fully customizable thanks to extensions support so you can add additional commands and features beyond what’s available by default. The PowerToys Command Palette has been available since early April, and you can activate it using the Win+Alt+Space shortcut once it’s installed. Microsoft says “Command Palette is intended to be the successor of PowerToys Run,” but both are still available for now. Microsoft made some tweaks and changes to Command Palette this week ahead of its Build developer conference on May 19th.

You’ll soon be able to pin up to three of your recently played games or apps to the homescreen. “These pins will stay near the front of the list as you launch other things, giving you quick access to your go-to titles,”explains Eden Marie, principal software engineering lead for Xbox experiences. If you don’t want to see system apps listed on the homescreen, you’ll be able to disable these to focus solely on games and apps. If you really want to take customization a step further, you’ll also soon be able to reduce the number of visible tiles in the recently played games and apps list. Microsoft says it’s “refining this setting” and it’ll be available to Xbox Insiders soon. Microsoft is making these Xbox Home interface changes because fans have requested more customizability. “We’ve heard from many of you that Home should feel more like your space,” says Marie. “Whether it’s surfacing your favorite games, hiding what you don’t use, or simply making Home feel less crowded, this update is a direct response to that feedback.” Microsoft previously tested abig overhaul of the Xbox Home UIin 2022, before shipping it broadly to Xbox owners in 2023. The software maker made more room for backgrounds, quick access to games, the store, and settings as part of the UI overhaul.

Epic says the game is ‘offline’ on iPhones after Apple rejected its App Store resubmission. But Apple says it didn’t take action to pull the game from alternative marketplaces. byDominic Preston Fortnitemaker Epic Games has announced that Apple has blocked the game’s return to iOS. Following the rejection,Fortniteis no longer available on iPhones and iPads even in the European Union, where it had previously been available to download through the Epic Games Store. “Apple has blocked ourFortnitesubmission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,” the company posted on theofficialFortniteX account. “Now, sadly,Fortniteon iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.” The Vergehas confirmed that the game is no longer available to download on iOS from the Epic Games Store or the alternative marketplace AltStore PAL in the EU, where it had previously been available. However, according to Apple, that isn’t its doing. “We asked that Epic Sweden resubmit the app update without including the US storefront of the App Store so as not to impactFortnitein other geographies,” Apple spokesperson Olivia Dalton tellsThe Verge. “We did not take any action to remove the live version ofFortnitefrom alternative distribution marketplaces.” Fortnitereturned to iOS in the EU last year, but only through those two storefronts, and not Apple’s App Store. The return was made possible by theEU’s Digital Markets Act, which required Apple toallow third-party app storeson iOS. Epic hadresubmittedFortniteto the US App Storethis month following arecent rulingin Epic’s lawsuit against Apple. That ruling prohibited Apple from restricting developers’ ability to link to external payment systems, one of the issues that had started theirlong-running legal battle. Epic was forced to use itsSwedish developer accountto resubmit the game, as itsUS account was terminatedin 2020 when it first broke Apple’s rules by introducing its own in-app payments to the game. This week Epic CEO Tim Sweeneyannouncedthat the company had pulled its previousFortnitesubmission and submitted a new version that included an update due to release today, noting that “all platforms must update simultaneously.” He’s since taken to X repeatedly to complain thatunofficialFortniteknock-offshave been allowed into the App Store whileFortnitehasn’t,claimingthat Apple’s app review process has been “weaponized by senior management.” Update, May 16th:Added comment from Apple.

    "article_text": "Verizon is reacquiring some of the fiber business it sold to Frontier in 2015. Verizon is reacquiring some of the fiber business it sold to Frontier in 2015. byEmma Roth Verizon’s $20 billion deal to acquire the fiber internet provider Frontieris officially happening. On Friday, the Federal Communications Commissionsigned off on the merger, which will allow Verizon to “upgrade and expand” Frontier’s existing fiber networks. Verizon expects to bring fiber to 1 million homes each year following the acquisition. The deal went through after Verizon “committed to ending DEI-related practices,” according to a statement by FCC Chair Brendan Carr. The Interceptreports that ina May 15th letter to Carr, Verizon’s chief legal officer, Vandana Venkatesh, outlined what it’s walking away from. Because “Verizon recognizes that some DEI policies and practices could be associated with discrimination,” it will no longer have any HR roles or teams focused on DEI, remove references to the term from employee training materials, as well as goals for diversity in its supplies, representation of women and minorities in its workforce. In the letter, Venkatesh says that now Verizon’s public messaging is going to “remove references to ‘DEI’ or ‘diversity, equity and inclusion.’” When Verizon’s consumer chief, Sowmyanarayan Sampath, appeared onDecoderlast month, we asked him aboutwhether it would fight the FCC imposing regulatory requirementsagainst its diversity initiatives with a decade’s worth of lawsuits, the same way it fought net neutrality. It didn’t. Earlier this year, Carrcriticized Verizon’s “lack of progress”on getting rid of policies related to DEI — or Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion — and suggested that theagency won’t approve dealsif companies keep these policies in place. T-Mobile similarlyclosed its acquisition of the fiber provider Lumosafter tweaking mentions of DEI on its website. Through the merger, Verizon will also be able to claw back some of its fiber businessafter it sold parts of its wireline operations, including Fios fiber internet connections, to Frontier in 2015. Carr said the merger will allow fiber to come to more communities, including rural ones. BEAD, a Biden-era initiative, was supposed to pay fiber providers to bring high-speed internet to rural areas, buta report fromThe Washington Postsuggeststhat the “money isn’t flowing.” Update, May 16th:Added additional details from Verizon’s letter to the FCC andDecoder.

    "title": "FDA greenlights marketing of first Alzheimer's blood test for some patients",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 16, 2025 / 4:14 PM EDT/ CBS News The Food and Drug Administration has greenlit Japan-based test manufacturer Fujirebio to begin marketing its blood test for helping doctors diagnoseAlzheimer's diseasein some patients, clearing the way for wider availability of the approach. Fujirebio's test works with the company's Lumipulse equipment, which the company says is already \"widely available in clinical laboratories\" around the U.S. Fujirebio describes Lumipulse as a \"fully automated\" system that can run 120 tests an hour on blood and other samples. The test works by measuring two kinds of proteins in the blood that are associated with whether the brain has built upamyloid plaques, which research has linked to Alzheimer's disease. \"Today's clearance is an important step for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, making it easier and potentially more accessible for U.S. patients earlier in the disease,\" Dr. Michelle Tarver, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in astatement. Not all people should take Fujirebio's new test. The FDA says that it is \"intended for patients presenting at a specialized care setting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline\" and is limited for adults ages 55 and older. The agency says that Fujirebio submitted data from a study of 499 blood plasma samples of adults who had cognitive impairment, comparing the results from the blood test with the alternative ways that doctors can check for amyloid plaques building up in the head: brain scans and tests of spinal fluid. In 91.7% of studied patients who tested positive in their blood, they also had amyloid plaques that showed up in a brain scan or a test of spinal fluid. The share of negative results that matched with these other tests was also high, at 97.3% of patients. \"We designed our Lumipulse G pTau 217/β-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio test to help physicians and patients with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline obtain an AD diagnosis much earlier when interventions are more effective,\" Fujirebiosaidin a release last year, after it submitted its regulatory filing to the FDA for the test. The FDA's sign-off on marketing for Fujirebio's test comes years after other blood tests for Alzheimer's have already begun sales, without this kind of approval from the agency. Experts have been wary about someprevious blood testsfor diagnosing Alzheimer's, which were being sold under differentregulationsthat govern tests that are created by individual laboratories doing high complexity testing. Last year under the Biden administration, the agency hadsought tocrack down on these other \"laboratory developed tests\" being sold to diagnose Alzheimer's and other health issues, which FDA officials argued should be subject to stricter federal oversight. \"The FDA's approach was developed half a century ago when tests made and used in single labs were generally simple, often made to address local individual needs, and mostly manufactured in small volumes,\" federal health officialssaidin January. In defending the move, the FDAcited asan example a past submission from a test that failed to earn the agency's marketing authorization for helping to diagnose Alzheimer's, but was still able to be sold in the U.S. market by the laboratory. \"Many treatable conditions have symptoms similar to AD or another form of dementia. Without sufficient information to demonstrate adequate validation, a test's performance is unknown, which may put patients at risk of harm due to inaccurate results,\" the agency said. A lawsuit backed by the American Clinical Laboratory Association successfullychallengedthe FDA's new rule on the laboratory developed tests, persuading a federal judge in Texas earlier this year to toss out the regulation. \"This is a victory that protects patient access to critically needed testing services and removes burdensome regulations that would have undermined the clinical laboratory system in this country,\" the group said after the ruling in March.

    "title": "What NJ Transit riders need to know to get around during the strike",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 16, 2025 / 12:19 PM EDT/ CBS New York NJ Transit engineers went on strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday, bringing train service to a screeching halt. NJ Transitrail service is fully shut down, along with Metro-North's west of Hudson service. The strike is expected toinconvenience more than 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit suggests people work from home, if possible, andNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphysaysall options are on the table, even a state of emergency. \"Over the past several weeks and months, we have been working around the clock to avoid this strike and keep NJ TRANSIT operating at full capacity. As always, our single-highest priority has always been to provide the best possible service to our state's commuters and taxpayers,\" Murphy said in a statement Thursday night. \"This strike will upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of New Jerseyans. My message tonight to our locomotive engineers is this: the path to a new contract will be paved at the negotiating table, not the picket line.\" The agency andBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen(BLET)have been at odds over pay raises. The union, which represents about 460 engineers, says the competition pays more and the cost of living has gone up. Workers say they haven't gotten a pay raise in five years. NJ Transit said the union walked away from the last deal of $49.82 an hour — 10 cents less than Long Island Rail Road engineers. But the union said that's misleading, as LIRR engineers are working without a contract. \"This is not something that we undertake lightly. We completely understand the impact that a strike can and will have on all the commuters of New Jersey,\" BLET General Chairman Tom Haas said Thursday. \"But ultimately, let's be clear, this rests at the feet of New Jersey Transit. They could have avoided this. They could have avoided this for the last five and a half years.\" Both sidesnegotiated for six hours Wednesdaybut were unsuccessful, andnegotiations continued all day Thursday, butno deal was reached. They also went to Washington, D.C., earlier this weekto meet with a federal mediator. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri described the conversations as constructive, saying any deal must be \"fair and fiscally responsible.\" The last NJ Transit strike in 1983 lasted about three weeks. There was a potential strike in 2016, but it was averted one day before it was slated to start. NJ Transitcame up with a contingency planahead of the strike, including additional bus service on 19 routes. But the agency's chief executive warned the plan can only handle about 20% of daily train riders. Starting Monday, NJ Transit is enhancing peak service on the following New York bus routes: Commuters can also take Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail or ferry service. NJ Transit says rail tickets and passes will be cross-honored on its bus and light rail lines, but will not be accepted on the other carriers. Those customers will have to buy a separate ticket.CLICK HEREfor more information. The MTA is cross-honoring Metro-North west of Hudson service for customers on the Port Jervis and Pascack Valley lines.CLICK HEREfor more information. NJ Transit is adding four more Park-And-Ride locations in Secaucus, Hamilton, at the Woodbridge Center Mall and the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel. Regular parking fees and hours remain in effect at NJ Transit train station parking facilities. Lyft says it's working to increase the number of drivers to meet demand, and Uber says it notified customers about increased fares and wait times. New York City'sOffice of Emergency Management saidit is coordinating with NJ Transit and other partner agencies. \"In the event of a strike, NYCEM will deploy dedicated staff to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey Emergency Operations Center to support real-time monitoring and response, tracking commuter impacts, traffic conditions, and disruptions,\" the agency said, in part. \"We're working with the Port Authority, NYPD, and NYC DOT to ensure additional traffic personnel are in place at key transit hubs and intersections.\" New Yorkers can text NOTIFYNYC to 692-692 to receive alerts. \"New Yorkers, in light of the anticipated rail service disruptions in New Jersey, I want you all to know that we are monitoring the situation for any impacts and there will be shuttles in place to try and mitigate crowding,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adamswrote on social media. The strike comes as concertgoers head to MetLife Stadium for two Shakira concerts on Thursday and Friday night. NJ Transitpreemptively canceled train servicefor Thursday's show to avoid the risk of people not being able to make it back home after the clock struck midnight. Beyonce's \"Cowboy Carter\" tour isalso scheduled at the stadiumin two weeks. Her shows are set for May 22, 24, 25 and 28 around Memorial Day weekend.

    "title": "Why U.S. citizen children sent with their deported moms can't come back easily",
    "article_text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Denisse Parra Vargas' three children — two of them American citizens and one born in Mexico — in Texas last week and, because authorities deported their mother,sent them out of the United States too. The administration has responded to blowback from the children’s expulsions andthose of otherU.S. citizen minors, including a child with cancer andone recovering from a rare brain tumor,by saying the mothers were in the U.S. illegally and chose to take their children with them.The families and their attorneys vehemently disagreethat the mothers had a choice. Secretary of State Marco Rubiosuggested in an interview April 27 on \"Meet the Press\" that the children’s situations are easily fixed. “If those children are U.S. citizens,” he said, “they can come back into the United States if there’s their father or someone here who wants to assume them.” While attorneys, advocates and researchers agree that U.S. citizens  generally have the right to return, they said suggestions that the children can just easily come back to the U.S. gloss over the barriers and difficulties of what that would entail. There are many hurdles that families would need to overcome for their U.S. citizen children to be able to return, according to Mich P. González, co-founder of Sanctuary of the South, an immigration and LGBTQ civil rights cooperative. His group and its member organizations has been assisting twofamilies whose mothers were deported from Florida and their children, including three U.S. citizens, who were sent with them. González said ICE often confiscates identification documents when deporting people. For example, the 2-year-old U.S. citizen daughter of the Honduran mother González represents had her passport taken away before she left, he said. That means the family would have to get the necessary paperwork from the U.S. to prove the child was born there. In many cases, U.S. citizen children don’t have passports in the first place, which are required when returning to the U.S. from a foreign country by air. Children younger than 16 arriving from Canada or Mexico, if they don't have passports,must have original birth certificates or other specific documentsto return to the U.S. “They don’t have passports, the two children only have their birth certificates,\" said Naiara Leite Da Silva, the attorney representing Parra Vargas. \"Not sure if mom has the original or a copy, but she only has the birth certificates, so it would entail a long and convoluted process before they could potentially come back.” Finding an authorized guardian who is a U.S. citizen and can travel with the child can also be difficult, González said. Families would have to come up with the money to cover the costs of flying their children back to the U.S. or covering the cost of a guardian at a time when they may be financially strained, attorneys said. One of the biggest complications right now, according to González, is any potential risk for the U.S.-based guardian to travel outside the country to go get the child. The administrationhas ratcheted up the power of border authorities to determine who should be admitted back into the country, even those with legal immigration status. “You can risk being stranded outside the United States,” González said. Activists and attorneys said that the nation's focus should be on whether the children should have been expelled in the first place. They argue that the parents may have had options for remaining in the U.S. had they been given a chance to consult with an attorney. In some of the recent cases, attorneys have pointed out that parents could have at least settled the question on whether their children should remain in the U.S. and with whom, before their deportation. Leite Da Silva said the Parra Vargas' family “strongly opposes the government narrative that it was the family’s choice to keep the children with them ... they never had the choice of leaving their children in the United States.\" Because of that, she refers to the children as \"forced expatriates.\" She said Parra Vargas was “entrapped” because the family alleges they were told to come in for an asylum interview where they would get work authorization papers,  and they were told to bring the children with them. According to the attorney, once they were at the appointment and were told they were to be deported, they weren't allowed to communicate with family members who were in the Pflugerville processing center parking lot and who were legal residents and could have kept the children. In response to questions from NBC News, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated via email that if an immigrant in the country illegally is subject to detention, they “will almost assuredly be detained.” DHS had previously stated that Parra Vargas had a deportation order after she failed to appear at a 2019 immigration hearing. McLaughlin repeated DHS’ previous statements that parents illegally in the country can “take control of their departure” and leave using an app created by the administration and that the administration is offering those who leave $1,000 and a free flight. ICE adopted procedures during the Obama administration — Trump border czar Tom Homan was acting ICE director at the time — to give families time to decide what to do about their citizen children, said Sirine Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project. She added that one of the mothers deported from Florida had said she didn’t want her U.S. citizen children to have to leave the country. The parents' decision to keep their child with them or send them back to the U.S.  is not so easily reached. Parents have to consider whether leaving them behind, sending their child back to the U.S. or even the act of traveling without their parent could further traumatize their child, González said. One of the children sent out of the country when her mother was deported to Mexico is 11and is recovering from a brain tumor. “Think about yourself when you were 11. Now think if you had a brain tumor and think about whether you could get to another country without your parents. Would that be feasible for you? We should not be asking kids to do something like that,” said Rochelle Garza, chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and  president of the Texas Civil Rights Project. Advocates and attorneys are working to petition for humanitarian parole to get the family members who are not citizens back in the U.S. with the girl. In general, people who have been deported are not allowed to return to the U.S. for a stretch of time from three years to 10 years, depending on how long they were in the U.S. without legal authorization. Generally, parents are more willing to allow older U.S. citizen children, more so than younger children, to remain in the U.S., said Wendy Cervantes, director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, an anti-poverty group. In some of those cases, older children become guardians to younger siblings. “I’ve seen cases where families are broken up and the older kids stay here and they might stay with an uncle or an aunt and in some cases if they are close to being 18, they actually are the ones left to care for other children, to keep the house that maybe was purchased (by the parents) and they become these super young adult caregivers,” Cervantes said. With younger children who are forced to live in their parents’ homeland either by U.S. government policy and their parents’ decisions, a return to the U.S. could be years away. And much can happen in those years. U.S. citizen children who have been deported can face some immediate setbacks when they get to their parents’ home country, saidVictor Zúñiga González, a professor of sociology at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, who has studied the migration of U.S.-born children to Mexico and Central America for nearly three decades. In addition to adjusting to language and cultural issues, U.S.-born children could have their school enrollments delayed by lack of documentation to establish their legal Mexican citizenship, which is needed to attend school. Mexico grants citizenship to children born abroad to Mexican parents, but official certification is required, a process that Zúñiga said takes less time in the U.S. than in Mexico. Parents can face similar issues in other countries, Cervantes said. In Guatemala, requirements for notarized school documents — a process that differs than in the U.S. — can delay school enrollment. The population of U.S.-born children living in Mexico between 2000 and 2015 doubled, according to Erin Hamilton, a University of California Davis sociology professor. In her study of U.S.-born children living in Mexico in 2014 and 2018, she found 1 in 6, or about 80,000 to 100,000, were there because one or both of their parents were deported, which she and her research colleagues termed \"de facto deported.\" Hamilton found the \"de facto deported\" children were more likely to be economically disadvantaged than U.S.-born children who migrated to Mexico for other reasons. They also were less likely to be enrolled in primary school and 70% children had no health insurance,  compared to 53% of the other U.S.-born children. Garza, the civil rights commission chair, asked whether \"we really want to have the conversation that it’s OK to remove certain U.S. citizens from the country ... creating this fiction that they can come back if they want to.\"",

    "title": "Long Island brothers with no criminal history get deported to El Salvador, lawyer says",
    "article_text": "Two Long Island brothers were left shocked and confused after federal agents had them deported to El Salvador, as their lawyer called it unfair they had been removed from “the only home they have ever known” despite having done nothing wrong. “We are not a threat to the country. We are not criminals,” said Jose Lopez, 20. He and brother Josue, 19, spoke from El Salvador to reporters via an internet link set up at their lawyer’s East Islip office on Thursday. “We did nothing bad,” added Josue Lopez. “We always followed the law.” The brothers from Central Islip were detained by federal immigration agents in March, their lawyer Ala Amoachi said. It occurred during what the brothers believed was a routine visit to Federal Plaza in Manhattan. The young men were later moved first to a facility in upstate New York, then to Louisiana. On May 7, they were placed on a plane for El Salvador. “When they closed the door of the airplane, I wanted to cry. It was over,” Jose said. The Lopez brothers were 10 and 11, their lawyer said, when their mom brought them across the U.S. border in 2016. The family applied for asylum, claiming they were trying to escape violent gangs in El Salvador. “The public should recognize these children came with no control over their circumstances. This is the only home they have ever known,” said Amoachi. Over the next nine years, Amoachi said immigration officials denied the brothers’ asylum request three times. But they continued to pursue other avenues to remain in the country and checked in regularly with immigration officials. “They are good people,” the boys’ mother, Alma Lopez, said through a translator. Alma Lopez remains in the U.S. with another son who is said to be disabled. “I just ask that they have another opportunity to return to this country,” the mother said. During their time in the U.S., the brothers built lives in Georgia and on Long Island. Josue was due to follow in his older brother’s footsteps and graduate from a Georgia high school later this month. The media office for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement did not respond to an email for comment on this case. “I was hoping for them to see us for who were are right now, what we have done,” Jose Lopez said. The brothers’ lawyer said she will continue to pursue their case, hoping to reverse the deportation on humanitarian grounds. She has posted a petition on change.org, asking for their return. For now, the Lopez brothers have been living with a family friend in El Salvador, saying they are afraid to leave the home and are worried about their future plans to work as a welder or financial planner. “I still have faith and hope we might get a second opportunity to get back to the country and pursue the dreams we have,” Jose Lopez said.",

    "article_text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are issuing contracts so quickly to carry out President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants that the speed appears to be causing some of those contracts to be revoked, experts and contractors tell NBC News. At least one of the contracts was no-bid and went to a firm run by people who served in Trump’s first administration. ICE recently terminated a $73 million no-bid contract to provide staffing support for its offices days after a competitor filed an objection accusing the company that won the contract of exerting “improper influence” in securing it and accusing the agency of “unethical contracting.” It was at least the second contract recently awarded to rapidly implement Trump’s plan for mass deportations that was quickly terminated. And it was one of several contracts that government contracting experts say raise questions about the speed with which ICE is sending money out the door. Three sources inside the government contracting industry said the recent terminations have fueled chaos and financial losses in companies that started hiring to fulfill contracts that were unexpectedly terminated. DHS published a notice that Universal Strategic Advisors was awarded the $73 million contract on staffing on April 13. But six days before the award was made public, a competing company that had heard of the no-bid contract filed an objection known as a “bid protest” with the Government Accountability Office. The protest effectively paused the contract, which is standard practice while a protest is pending. Timothy Robbins, a former top ICE official who worked under current border czar Tom Homan, was CEO of Universal Strategic Advisors until March, according to his LinkedIn, which says he remains a principal at the company. According to a bio that was on the company’s website earlier this year, Robbins served as ICE’s executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations. Prior to winning the $73 million staffing contract, the company had been the primary contractor on just one federal contract, according to public contracting data on USAspending.gov — a $1 million contract from the General Services Administration. It is listed on the site, however, as having been a subcontractor on several federal contracts that together totaled $10.4 million. Nathan Young, a retired ICE officer who runs Utah-based Raven Investigations & Security Consulting, filed the objection to the contract. After Young submitted an unsolicited bid to ICE in late January, he learned that Universal Strategic Advisors was the only company that was invited by DHS to submit a proposal for staffing support. Once he discovered that he filed his objection. Young told NBC News he did not think he had a chance of winning the contract but said he felt that how it had been awarded was problematic.“It looked kinda shady and I thought it needed another look.” On April 18, just over a week after Young objected, the contract was canceled, according to the GAO. It’s unclear if the bid protest had anything to do with the cancellation, and DHS did not respond to a question about why it was canceled. Because the contract was terminated, the GAO has dismissed as moot its review of how the decision was made. In a printed decision, though, it did criticize Young for using AI to assist him in writing a response to requests for dismissals by the government and Universal Strategic Advisors, which the GAO said led him to cite nonexistent decisions and quotes. Young conceded that he used AI to assist in writing the bid protest. Universal Strategic Advisors did not respond to requests for comment. In its initial response to the bid protest, DHS argued that the objections by Young were improper and “speculative” and failed “to state a detailed basis for protest.” Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog group, said the Universal Strategic Advisors contract raises questions about the speed with which ICE is making decisions, as do other recent decisions by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, under which ICE falls, regarding awarding business to boost deportations. “Getting to an award shows the contract was being taken very seriously,” said Amey. He also said that it is unusual for a contract to be canceled while another company is protesting, because generally they just wait for the process to play out. A source familiar with government contracting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, concurred, saying that canceling a contract days after it was awarded is unusual in part because it takes time and resources to award a contract in the first place. When soliciting bids to launch a $200 million campaign that encourages people in the U.S. illegally to self-deport, the Department of Homeland Security limited the competition to only three companies, claiming the move was necessary due to “unusual and compelling urgency” related to the emergency at the border, according to a document it posted online. Thecampaignhas so far spent at least $11.5 million on TV and digital ads in the U.S., according to AdImpact, a company that tracks advertising. Contracts were ultimately awarded to two companies: People Who Think LLC and Safe America Media LLC. DHS justified the limited competition, saying that the winning companies “possess extensive expertise, have established relationships domestically and internationally for media buying and campaign placement, and are able to immediately support this requirement,” according to a public contracting document. In fact, Safe America Media LLC was just 13 days old. It was formed in Delaware on Feb. 6, according to public records. Less than two weeks later, the start-up won its first federal contract worth up to $62 million. A DHS spokesperson did not respond to a question about how long Safe America Media has been in business. Safe America Media is registered to Mike McElwain, a longtime GOP strategist. The business address appears to be his home address in Northern Virginia. McElwain did not respond to requests for comment. “I do have concerns,” said Amey, of the watchdog group. “Did they start as a company and was it steered in their direction because of their connection to the administration? If they have ties to the administration, are we really picking the best and the brightest or are we picking companies that are favored by the administration?” In response to questions about the contract, a DHS spokesperson said in an email: “Following a competitive process with multiple companies competing to deliver the best service, product, and price for American taxpayers,Safe America MediaandPeople Who Thinkboth earned a shared contract for this targeted national and international campaign that warns illegal aliens to leave our country now, self deport, and not to enter our country illegally or face deportation.” The spokesperson added that multiple career government officials oversaw awarding of the contracts. Democratic members of Congress say they are nowinvestigatingthe awarding of the contract. The TV and digital ads feature DHS Secretary Kristi Noem speaking directly to the camera and differ from previous DHS ad campaigns. For example, since 2010, DHS has run a multifaceted public awareness effort in the U.S. called the Blue Campaign to stop human trafficking. It includes Spanishdigital adsencouraging neighbors to report trafficking as well as ads in airports, hotels and rideshare windows. Anothercampaignstarted under President Joe Biden sought to discourage migrants from making the treacherous journey across the border saying in Spanish, “Say no to the coyote” with messages like, “The coyote took our children from us.” Those ads were sent directly to migrants via mobile devices on social media and other digital platforms. In contrast, by the end of April, 85% of the ads that had aired for Trump’s self-deportation push were in English, according to data from AdImpact. The Spanish ads appeared to have used Spanish subtitles as opposed to audio in Spanish. The ads have aired around the country where migrants are, but they have also aired in West Palm Beach, Florida, which is the country's 38th-largestmedia market and also home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. “It strikes me as a political campaign ad,” saidDan Hiaeshutter-Rice, assistant professor of advertising and public relations at Michigan State University, who said the imagery in the ads is evocative to Americans who are concerned about the negative impacts of immigration as opposed to motivating an immigrant to leave the United States, “Is that an effective message for people who enter the country illegally? That doesn’t seem to be the kind of goal they are going after.” A DHS spokesperson said that, in addition to TV, radio and digital ads, there will be ads in multiple countries and regions in various dialects. “Ads will be hyper-targeted, including through social media, text message and digital to reach illegal immigrants in the interior of the United States, as well as internationally,” the spokesperson said. It’s unclear how successful DHS’s self-deportation campaign has been to date. The CBP Home App, which is promoted in the ads, allows immigrants to document their self-deportation. Since the app was relaunched on March 10, there have been 125,000 downloads according to Appfigures, an app tracking company.  Half of the downloads in 2025 have been from people in Mexico and not from the United States, according to the data. Homan said last week on Fox News that 7,000 immigrants have self-deported to date. NBC News previouslyreportedon another terminated contract, this one worth $3.8 billion, under which a company called Deployed Resources was to build a tent facility that ICE could use to hold thousands of immigrants at Fort Bliss, an Army base in Texas. That contract was awarded on April 10 and canceled within a week. It is now, according to three sources familiar with the decision, being offered as two separate bids: one for the building of the facility and one for running it. It is not clear why the deal was suddenly terminated and put back out as two separate contracts. Sources familiar with ICE detention settings said that brick-and-mortar ICE detention centers take longer to build than tent facilities, but that they are better equipped to detain immigrants for long periods. ICE also recently downsized a request for proposal seeking bids on a contract worth $45 billion posted in early April to manage and oversee the creation of new ICE detention facilities. Earlier this month ICE scaled the contract back to $10.5 billion according to public contracting documents. DHS did not respond as to why the size of this contract was reduced.",

    "title": "Moody's downgrades United States credit rating on increase in government debt",
    "article_text": "Moody’s Ratings cut the United States’ sovereign credit rating down a notch toAa1 from the Aaa, the highest possible, citing the growing burden of financing the federal government’s budget deficit and the rising cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates. “This one-notch downgrade on our 21-notch rating scale reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” the ratings agency said in a statement. The decision to lower the United States credit profile would be expected, at the margin, to lift the yield that investors demand in order to buy U.S. Treasury debt to reflect more risk, and could dampen sentiment toward owning U.S. assets, including stocks. That said, all the major credit rating agencies continue to give the United States their second-highest available rating. The yield on the benchmark10-year Treasury noteclimbed 3 basis points in after-hours trading, trading at 4.48%. TheiShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETFfell about 1% in extended trading, while theSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trustfell 0.4%. Moody’s had been a holdout in keeping U.S. sovereign debt at the highest credit rating possible, and brings the 116-year-old agency into line with its rivals. Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. to AA+ from AAA in August 2011, and Fitch Ratings also cut the U.S. rating to AA+ from AAA, in August 2023. “Successive U.S. administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s analysts said in a statement. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.” The U.S. is running a massive budget deficit as interest costs for Treasury debt continued to rise due to a combination of higher rates and more principal debt to finance. The fiscal deficit in the year that began October 1 is already running at $1.05 trillion, 13% higher than a year ago. Revenue from tariffs helped shave some of the imbalance last month. The Moody’s downgrade came as the GOP-led House Budget Committee on Friday rejected a sweeping tax cut package as part of President Donald Trump’s agenda, including extending tax cuts enacted in 2017. Moody’s officially rated U.S. bonds in 1993 for the first time, but had assigned a “country ceiling rating” of AAA on the U.S. since 1949. — With additional reporting by CNBC’s Christina Cheddar-Berk and Scott Schnipper",

    "article_text": "Natalie Nakase, the WNBA’s first Asian American head coach, is channeling the spirit of a Valkyrie woman warrior as the season gets underway Friday. With Nakase, 45, on their team, the Golden State Valkyries are making waves as the WNBA’s first new team in the league in more than 15 years. Nakase told NBC News she’s had to fight her whole life to get where she is now. “I’ve always been the only girl walking into the NBA gym and all guys — it’s the same,” Nakase said. “No big deal.” The addition of the Valkyries marks thefirst new WNBA teamsince the Atlanta Dream in 2008. Fans outside of the stadium — young and old, all clad in purple and black Valkyries gear — said Asian American representation in the WNBA is inspiring. Nakase is a third-generation Japanese American. After playing as a walk-on for the University of California, Los Angeles Bruins and as a professional for one year in Germany, she worked her way up the ranks with the Los Angeles Clippers. Beginning as an intern, she eventually worked as assistant coach for the team. From there, she led the Las Vegas Aces WNBA team to back-to-back titles. As a basketball professional who’s 5 feet, 1 inch — and three-quarters, she adds — tall, Nakase hasn’t exactly had it easy in the sport, but she jokes, “It doesn’t matter how tall you are.” She also said she’s been motivated by her dad. “The reason I’m here is because of my dad,” Nakase said. “I was really lucky to have a parent that not only loved me unconditionally, but he pushed me beyond my limits.” Nakase said that she feels a heightened sense of responsibility now that she’s head coach of the Valkyries, adding, “You’re impacting lives.” Amid the expansion draft, Kaitlyn Chen, thefirst Taiwanese AmericanWNBA draft pick, was cut from the Valkyries in a controversial move Wednesday. Chen had just won the NCAA championship with the University of Connecticut when she was drafted. Nakase didn’t respond to a request for follow-up comment on the cut.",

    "title": "At least 5 killed, 35 injured, more than 5,000 homes affected in suspected St. Louis-area tornadoes",
    "article_text": "At least five people were killed when severe weather, including two possible tornadoes, swept through St. Louis, Missouri, on Friday afternoon, authorities said. Speaking at an evening news conference, city officials said over 5,000 homes may have been affected by the afternoon's outbreak of severe weather. A spokesperson for both St. Louis Children's Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital said the facilities have received at least 35 patients in total, with the children's facility getting 15 and Barnes-Jewish seeing at least 20, possibly 30 who were injured as a result of the severe weather. The spokesperson said all but two patients at the children's facility were expected to be released Friday night; one was reported earlier to be in critical condition. Some of those at Barnes-Jewish were to be released, while others were said to be in serious condition, the spokesperson said. At the late news conference, Mayor Cara Spencer announced that the number of fatalities has risen from four to five. She had said earlier that two of the dead were killed in North City, where a vortex was reported. A northern swath of the city from Forest Park to the northern boundary was subject of a curfew through 6 a.m., the mayor said. Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said severe weather hit about 20 square blocks of the city. St. Louis police spokesperson Mitch McCoy said search-and-rescue operations were still underway with the help of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and surrounding county first responders. \"It’s all hands on deck to rescue as many people as we can and save lives,\" he told NBC affiliateKSDK of St. Louis. Search crews will find much darkness in the city, with more than 40,000 utility customers in the St. Louis region without power Friday night, according to utility trackerPowerOutage.us.Missouri has more than 97,000 customers in the dark, according to the site. The tornado was reported after 2:30 p.m. in the city near Forest Park and moving east toward Granite City, Illinois, said National Weather Service meteorologist Marshall Pfahler. Its force level is unlikely to be known until Saturday when weather service spotters are able to get to the scene and measure damage, tracks and other elements of the vortex, he said. The weather service office that covers St. Louislater said on X, \"Damage reports and radar imagery suggest a tornado likely occurred across parts St Louis this afternoon. We will have a survey team on the ground tomorrow to confirm and assign a rating.\" KSDK reported that two tornadoes may have touched down in the region on Friday. The National Weather Service said it was working to confirm the second twister. The station reported that a man was rescued from the rubble of a home after an hourslong operation. The residence was most likely smashed by a tornado or the severe weather's associated potent winds in the area Friday, the station said. \"Considering the building collapsed on him, he's doing great,\" a fire official said after the man was pulled out. The man had sought shelter in the home and ended up stuck inside, possibly in a pantry, KSDK said. Coverage from the region included imagery of a decimatedHarlem Tap Room, a historic bar on the city's north side that has been at the same location for roughly 80 years. A witness who was in the bar told KSDK that a fellow patron's warning and the establishment's flickering lights preceded his move and that of others there to the rear of the building, which he said likely saved lives. St. Louis city officials and police asked the public to stay put on Friday as they respond to the storm's effects. Utility Spire energy, which serves 1.7 million customers in the region, said there is \"severe damage\" to homes. Video of the damage showed toppled brick walls and downed tree limbs and power lines in the region. The nearby city of Clayton said its City Hall is closed as it coordinates a response to the severe weather. The worst of the weather seemed to have passed St. Louis late in the afternoon, although federal forecasters said a dry night could be followed by the return of thunderstorms on Saturday. The vortexes were products of a fast-moving low pressure system headed east-northeast from its location over parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Missouri, a region under tornado watch until 10 p.m. The cool, winter-like storm is clashing with a heat wave to the southwest, producing unstable air and eruptions of thunderstorm activity. Severe weather, including 11 unconfirmed tornadoes, was reported Thursday in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois, according to the weather service and NBC News forecasters. A Beyoncé concert at Chicago's open-air Soldier Field on Thursday was delayed because of the weather. Spectator video showed a ferocious downpour ahead of the show.",

    "title": "Ohio Republicans introduce 'Natural Family Month' bill, excluding LGBTQ families",
    "article_text": "More than two dozen Ohio lawmakers are supporting a bill that would designate the weeks between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day “Natural Family Month.” Thoughthe bill, introduced by Republican state Reps. Josh Williams and Beth Lear, doesn’t define “natural family” in its text, critics say it is intended to exclude LGBTQ families and promote marriage and childrearing between heterosexual, monogamous couples only. When asked whether “Natural Family Month” will also recognize gay couples and parents with adopted children, Williams said in an emailed statement to NBC News that “the purpose of the month is to promote natural families—meaning a man, a woman, and their children—as a way to encourage higher birth rates.” He added, “This is not about discriminating against other family structures, but about supporting the one most directly tied to the creation and raising of children.” Lear did not return a request for comment. After introducing the bill earlier this week, Williams and Learsaid in joint statementsthat the initiative is intended to promote child rearing. “At a time when marriage is trending downward and young couples are often choosing to remain childless, it’s important for the State of Ohio to make a statement that marriage and families are the cornerstone of civil society, and absolutely imperative if we want to maintain a healthy and stable Republic,” Lear said. As of Friday,the bill had 26 additional Republican co-sponsors. Dwayne Steward, the director of statewide LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Ohio, told a local queer news site that the bill is both bad policy and a “calculated act of strategic erasure.” “It not only invalidates the existence of single parents and countless other caregivers, but it takes direct aim at LGBTQ+ families across our state,” Stewardtold the Buckeye Flame. “The so-called ‘Natural Family Foundation,’ the group pushing this legislation, has made their ideology clear: if you’re not a heterosexual, monogamous couple with children, you don’t count as a family at all.” Steward, who did not immediately return NBC News’ request for comment, added, “As an adoptive parent, myself, I feel this erasure personally. This bill is not just offensive; it’s dangerous.” Severallocal news websites, including the Buckeye Flame, reported that the Natural Family Foundation, a conservative advocacy group that isagainst same-sex marriageand promotesfamilies with a “clear male leader,” wasinvolved in lobbying for the bill. The foundation did not immediately return a request for comment. Last year, Ohioconsidered eight billstargeting LGBTQ people, according to a tally by the American Civil Liberties Union. Two of those — a provision that requires school personnel to notify parents of “any request by a student to identify as a gender that does not align with the student’s” birth sex, and a measure that prohibits certain transition-related medical care for minors — became law.",

    "article_text": "This is a free article forDiddy on Trialnewsletter subscribers.Sign upto get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs’ federal trial. Casandra Ventura, the R&B singer and model who dated Diddy on-and-off for 10 years, returned to the witness stand for a fourth grueling day Friday. Ventura, who is eight months pregnant, faced another round of cross-examination from the rapper’s lawyers, who have attempted to portray her as a willing participant in the rapper’s drug-dazed “freak offs.” Ventura was excused as a witness around 3:20 p.m. ET. The day’s other marquee witness wasDawn Richard,a former member of two of Diddy’s musical acts: Danity Kane and Diddy — Dirty Money. Richard testified that she witnessed Diddy beat Ventura in 2009. Richard said Ditty struck Ventura with a skillet, kicked and punched her, and dragged her up some stairs. Diddy was highly engaged during Estevao’s sometimes disjointed cross-examination of Ventura. The rapper, dressed in a cream-colored shirt and khakis, frequently leaned forward to read the live transcript of Ventura’s testimony on a monitor, whispered with lead attorneyMarc Agnifilo, and passed notes to Estevao while she questioned his ex-girlfriend. Ventura answered questions calmly. She briefly broke down crying at the end of prosecutorEmily Johnson’s redirect, grabbing a tissue as she told jurors that Diddy hit her during “freak offs.” In another notable moment, Ventura described her feelings for the rapper: “I don’t hate him. I have love for the past, and what it was.” In other news:Judge Arun Subramanianrepeatedly expressed annoyance with lawyers on both sides today. When the jurors were out of the room, Subramanian scolded prosecutors for objecting to cross-examination questions without specifying their grounds. He also seemed irritated with the defense team’s start-and-stop presentation of evidence. “We are not going to proceed in this fashion,” Subramanian said. Subramanian profusely thanked the jurors for their first week of service before court adjourned. “You are the bedrock for democracy,” the judge told the panel of eight men and four women. He encouraged the jurors to watch the Yankees and the Knicks over the weekend. In the final minutes of Ventura’s time on the stand, she testified that she expects a $10 million settlement from the hotel where Diddy beat her in 2016. (The incident was recorded on a hotel security camera.) She said on cross-examination that there were many career benefits to being Diddy’s girlfriend. She attended the Met Gala, she had access to other stars (such asKid Cudi,Nicki Minaj,Lil WayneandRick Ross) and she got precious studio time, too. The defense is carefully trying to convey something through cross-examination without coming out and saying it: Ventura was with Diddy for the money and the fame. It’s a theme that can easily backfire if the jury thinks the defense handled Ventura too aggressively. But these jurors include regular people, like scientists and grocery store workers. The defense wants them to think: “The lifestyle described here is so extreme, that only someone in it for the money and the stardom would stay with the defendant.” At the same time, the defense couldn’t just come out on cross-examination and ask Ventura if she’s a gold digger. It’s hard to say what the jurors think of her testimony. She said the right words, for the most part, but the jury also evaluated her body language and her voice, and all the intangibles that people look at when we size up one another. Determining credibility is hardly an exact science. Dawn Richard is expected to take the stand again Monday. PSA: Every night during Diddy’s trial, NBC’s “Dateline” will drop special episodes of the “True Crime Weekly” podcast to get you up to speed. “Dateline” correspondentAndrea Canningchats with NBC News’Chloe Melasand special guests — right in front of the courthouse.Listen here.",

    "title": "New Jersey's very bad week: A screeching rail system halt and airport meltdown plague the state",
    "article_text": "New Jersey’s beloved musical bard Bruce Springsteen promised Wendy in his breakthrough hit “Born to Run\" that some day “we’re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go, and we’ll walk in the sun.” But in recent days, keeping that promise to Wendy — and to everybody else trying to get in and out of the Garden State — has gotten a whole lot harder. Springsteen's song was released in 1975, well before congestion pricing jacked up the cost of driving into New York City; well before air traffic controllers began losing radio and radar contact with the planes they were guiding into Newark Liberty International Airport; and well before the New Jersey Transit engineers walked off the job just after midnight Friday for the first time in 40 years. The latest in that trifecta of travel challenges left some 100,000 NJ Transit train riders wondering Friday how they'll make their commutes to work. \"I have no idea, honestly,\" said Julia Slaby, who lives in Lyndhurst and was trying to get to Manhattan for her last day of classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \"Maybe I'll take the bus.\" Another regular commuter, Laura Kounev, said her husband was going to have to drive her to Hoboken, where she can take the PATH train into Manhattan, and that he will be skipping work to pick her up in Hoboken when her workday is done. \"Oh my God, I don’t even know what I’m gonna do if it goes on for weeks,\" Kounev said when asked if she hopes the strike gets resolved soon. \"I hope so, because even right now we have my car being used by the babysitter to take the kids to and from school, so I take public transit.\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said they're ready to resume salary talks when the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents the 450 to 500 striking NJ Transit workers, returns to the bargaining table. \"What the people of New Jersey need right now is for the members of the BLET to step up and meet their obligations to the public,” he said Friday. Echoing the governor, NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri said they're determined \"to reach a fair and affordable deal as soon as humanly possible.\" Union chief Tom Haas said late Thursday that he wants \"to bring New Jersey Transit engineers up to a wage level that is commensurate with all the other passenger railroad engineers in the Northeast,\" adding that their rail engineers are paid up to 20% less than their counterparts. “NJ Transit just remains unwilling to bridge that gap,” said Haas before the engineers went on strike. The last NJ Transit work stoppage occurred in 1983 and lasted 34 days. And while Tony Soprano did not run into traffic jams driving home on the Pulaski Skyway from the Lincoln Tunnel in the opening credits of “The Sopranos,\" the rest of us live in the real world. New Jersey is a cramped and crowded state with a population density higher than Japan, where even on good days the traffic often moves like molasses in the tightly packed towns outside New York City and Philadelphia. So this strike, lawmakers and union leaders say,has all the makings of a full-blown transportation crisis. \"This is a hardship for everybody,\" said a locomotive engineer on a picket line who declined to give his name. \"We understand that and hopefully this gets resolved as quickly as possible. Because the last thing we want to do is be out here. Believe me.\" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a gubernatorial candidate who recently made headlineswhen he was arrestedat a federal immigration detention facility to protest President Trump's migrant crackdown, said the \"strike presents a serious burden for commuters and creates hardships for our residents in Newark, as well as people who come here to work.\" \"We are hopeful that talks will resume this weekend and the strike can be brought to a quick end,\" Baraka said. NJ Transit is now urging rail riders to consider taking commuter buses into Manhattan. But commuting by car, especially at rush hour, got far more expensive in January when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul gave the green light to relaunchcongestion pricing, a first-in-the-nation plan aimed at reducing gridlock by imposing a $9 toll on most vehicles entering the core of Manhattan during peak hours. Despite protests that made odd bedfellows of Murphy, a Democrat, and President Trump, congestion pricing remains in effect and appears to be working, at leastfor New Yorkers. Meanwhile,talks have been underwaybetween the Federal Aviation Administration and the major airlines to ease the crowding in the skies above New Jersey by limiting the number of planes flying in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport. Those talks were launched in earnest after air traffic controllers on April 28 lost radio and radar contact for 90 seconds with the planes they were guiding into Newark, a near-disaster caused by the failure of the copper wiring that transmits radar data from New York to the controller’s base in Philadelphia. The result was massive travel delays at Newark Liberty, one of the busiest airports in the country, that continue to this day. The New Jersey Transit rail system is also regularly plagued by delays exacerbated by its aging and deteriorating infrastructure. Rewind to 2010, when then Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, killed the $8.7 billion ARC Tunnel project that would have built an additional rail tunnel under the Hudson River andenabled NJ Transit to doublethe number of trains entering Manhattan per hourat peak travel timesto 50. Since then, NJ Transit has repeatedly been rankedthe worst train system in the nationwith delays resulting from aging trains breaking down and clogging the century-old North River tunnels, which were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. NJ Transit has to contend with cost overruns on repairs and a $750 million budget hole caused, in part, by the Covid pandemic. Managementhas tried to fill the hole by raising fares. Christie, who pulled the plug on the project after $1.2 billion had already been spent on engineering anddiverted $3 billion in toll moneyearmarked for the tunnel to bail out his state's finances and avoid raising gas taxes,has steadfastly defendedthat decision. “The ARC tunnel project was a fatally flawed project that projected $2-3 billion over budget, every dollar of which would have to be absorbed by New Jersey taxpayers only, with no contribution from Amtrak or the State of New York,\" Christie said via email Friday. \"The tunnel would go to an unnecessary new terminal underneath Macy’s, leaving commuters stranded blocks away from any other mass transit. It was a ripoff of New Jersey taxpayers for a bad project. It was the right decision then and an even better decision today.\" Last year, the Biden administration unveiled a new $11 billion Hudson River TunnelProject that aims to complete the jobthat Christie thwarted. Christie knows firsthand how much political damage can come from making it harder to get around the Garden State. In 2013, members of his administration were accused of deliberately creating a bottleneck on the George Washington Bridge that connects New Jersey to northern Manhattan to punish a local mayor for not supporting Christie's re-election. Christiedenied any involvementin what came to be called \"Bridgegate.\" Still, there is hope that the NJ Transit strike might be short-lived. Both NJ Transit management and the striking engineers have signaled a willingness to resume contract negotiations. Already, travel alternatives are being put in place. And with the weather getting warmer, the various ferries to Manhattan offer an especially attractive commute — if you can get to their docks. What else can a New Jersey traveler do now besides work from home? As the Garden State’s most famous resident advised in \"Thunder Road,\" you can also “roll down the window, and let the wind blow back your hair.” Assuming you're not stuck in traffic.",

    "title": "Publix recalls baby food pouches over potential lead contamination",
    "article_text": "Publix, a national supermarket chain, is voluntarily recalling baby food that could be contaminated with lead, the company announced this week. The company said it discovered the problem through routine testing and has pulled its GreenWise Pear, Kiwi, Spinach & Pea Baby Food pouches from its shelves, according to anews release, which said there were “no reported cases of illness” related to the product. It’s the second recall of baby food for potential lead contamination in recent weeks — and in both cases, the Food and Drug Administration didn’t issue its own news release to warn the public, which safety experts and advocates said surprised them. The FDA did not explain why it hadn’t issued a news release for the Publix recall or Target’s voluntary recall in March of its Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini, Kale & Thyme Vegetable baby food puree. In that case, the FDAposted detailsabout the recall in the agency’s public recall-monitoring database. “The FDA is committed to ensuring that all necessary information regarding product recalls is promptly communicated to protect public health,” the agency said in a statement. Publix did not respond to a request for comment. Target said that its Good & Gather recall “involved a limited amount of product, which we took immediate action to remove from our shelves.” The recalls come amid heightened concern about contaminated baby food, following the2023 recall of apple cinnamon puree pouchesfor children that had elevated levels of lead. And they’re also occurring as the Trump administration pledges to make baby food safer through increased testing, though some safety advocates say those promises are undermined by the deep staffing and funding cuts to federal health agencies. Do you have a news tip you’d like to share about food safety or outbreaks of foodborne illness? You can message Suzy Khimm on Signal: SuzyKhimm.42 or contact NBC News securelyhere. The FDA does not issue news releases for all food recalls, but it generally does so in cases where it determines there is a serious risk to public health, food safety experts and advocates said. Last year, the FDAissued news releasesfor multiple recalls of lead-contaminated cinnamon. Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said it was “concerning” that the FDA had chosen not to publicize the two recent recalls, given theserious health riskthat lead poses to babies and young children, including brain damage, slower development and behavioral problems. “There isno safe level of lead,” Sorscher noted. The FDA amplifying a recall can help reach more consumers, she added, especially for products like baby food that can have a long shelf life. “It increases the attention that stores and consumers give it, so that it’s more likely to be pulled off the shelf,” she said. Lead contamination can happen during the manufacturing process, but it can also occur throughcontaminated soilused to grow produce. In January, in the final weeks of the Biden administration, the FDAcreateda maximum level for lead in baby food for the first time. Though the standard is voluntary, it has helped push baby food companies to conduct more testing and initiate recalls, food safety experts and advocates said. “Industry is taking that guidance to heart and being more proactive,” said Jennifer van de Ligt, a baby foodexpertwho was among the FDA scientists laid off in recent weeks. “If that guidance stays in place, it should put pressure on industry to comply.” The Trump administration has launched a high-profile effort to make infant formula and baby food safer under Operation Stork Speed. The administrationsaid in Marchthat the program would include “increasing testing for heavy metals and other contaminants in infant formula and other foods children consume.“ The FDA has not provided details about this increased testing and, when asked this week, instead pointed to its new effort toreview nutrientsin baby formula. Meanwhile, food safety advocates and former agency staff members have raised concerns about the impact of the Trump administration’s mass layoffs on food safety issues like lead contamination. In April, the agency shuttered a federal laboratory that specialized in testing food for lead and other heavy metals andterminated its staff members, only to backtrack weeks later. The FDA also stalled in publicizingfood safety warningsafter terminating communications and public records staff, sources said. The administration additionallyfired federal expertsfor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who worked to prevent lead poisoning in children andproposed eliminating the lead poisoning prevention programin a leaked budget draft. In a statement, a CDC spokesperson said the agency reorganization plans were being finalized but that “the work of this program will continue.” Sorscher argued that there was a contradiction between the administration’s stated support for baby food safety and many of its actions. “There is what they’re saying they want to do to clean up the food supply, and what they’re actually doing,” she said.",

    "title": "DOJ attorneys draw judge's ire in case over Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return",
    "article_text": "GREENBELT, Md. — In a contentious court hearing on Friday, Trump administration attorneys argued before a federal judge in Maryland that they should be allowed to withhold information regarding efforts to facilitate the return of a Salvadoran man to the United States. Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in the Salvadoran prison system despite orders from a federal judge and the Supreme Court calling for the government to facilitate his return to the United States. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said the government’s refusal to provide certain information in the case has been “an exercise in utter frustration.” In a back-and-forth that has continued for weeks,Xinis has ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release and provide documentation on what steps it has taken, if any, to comply with that order. Government lawyers said the administration has not been able to answer questions about Abrego Garcia’s case because that information would be considered protected under “state secrets” or “deliberative process” privileges that should not be shared with the public. On Friday, Xinis said the administration has not made a good-faith effort to comply with the court order. She repeatedly called on the administration to show how turning over evidence of actions it has taken or will take to return Abrego Garcia would pose a reasonable danger to foreign affairs. “There is simply no detail. This is basically, ‘Take my word for it,’” the judge said. Attorney Jonathan Guynn said the government believes it has complied with the judge’s order and provided its argument for why certain details should not appear in court documents and testimony. The government has argued that revealing additional information could compromise state secrets or foreign relations. The attorney also provided an update on Abrego Garcia, saying that he was in good health and in a prison in Santa Ana, El Salvador, where he was moved after spending a few weeks in thesupermax megaprisonto which he was first deported. Abrego Garciawas living in Maryland with his wife and three children when he was arrested by immigration agents and deported  to El Salvador in March.The Trump administrationhas accused him of being a member of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang andused that in its justificationfor deporting him to his home country — despite a judge’s order from 2019 barring him from being sent there. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have argued that the Trump administration has been “stonewalling” the court. “We’re not even allowed to pose those basic questions at depositions without running into the roadblock of state secrets,” attorney Andrew Rossman told the court on Friday. Abrego Garcia’s team said the discovery they’ve received from the government thus far has been inadequate, and Xinis appeared to agree. The plaintiffs said they received 164 documents, and 132 of them were photocopies of court filings and their own discovery requests. Rossman said that of the remaining 32 new documents, half were related to Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s recent trip to El Salvador to see Abrego Garcia. Rossman said the government logged 1,140 documents as “privileged,” in “every manner of privilege that I’ve ever heard of.” “My head is spinning, your honor,” he said. Rossman also said it was “deeply disturbing” that while the administration has claimed in court that it’s complying with the order to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release, high-ranking officials including Trump himself have contradicted that in public. The administration’s claims, Xinis says, have been hampering efforts to get to the bottom of whether the government has disobeyed the court order by not facilitating the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States. Over the past several days, there have been almost a dozen sealed filings on the case docket, with Abrego Garcia’s legal team seeking specific documents and information, and the government arguing it cannot reveal certain information, even to the judge in some cases. “Nearly all the additional materials Plaintiffs demand are protected by the state secrets and deliberative process privileges and so cannot be produced,” U.S. attorneys wrote in a brief on Monday. Among the sealed materials are copies of the deposition transcripts of three government witnesses. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers told the court that the three officials were instructed by the Department of Justice to decline to answer certain questions on the basis of the “state secret” or “deliberative process” privileges, or both. Xinis has asked the government for the legal and factual reasons for invoking those privileges. She also took issue with the number of documents being sealed in this case. The court hearing continued behind closed doors on Friday. Xinis indicated she would soon issue an order on the matter.",

    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. Carrie Kahn People surround the bodies of Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike in front of the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, on Friday.Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption TEL AVIV, Israel — It has been a deadly week of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in the past few days, with more than 100 killed on Friday alone, according to Gaza health officials and hospital and morgue personnel contacted by NPR. Hospital hallways have been flooded with the injured and dead. Many of the strikes have killed entire extended families, leaving survivors struggling to bury the dead. No food or supplies have entered Gaza during more than two months of Israel's blockade on the territory of more than 2 million people. Nearly half a million people face a \"catastrophic situation of hunger\" and the territory could fall into famine without immediate access to food, the World Health Organizationsaid this week. The United States and Israel recentlyannounced a plan to get aid back into Gaza, but there's no official timeline yet on when that plan would be rolled out. Israeli's military says in the past day it launched more than 150 strikes on Hamas militant sites. The intense round of attacks came as President Trump was wrapping up five days ofvisiting Middle Eastern countries, which did not include Israel. There were hopes that during his time in the region there would be a breakthrough in the long-stalled talks to reach a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. But by the end of the week, that hope faded, Trump departed the region, and Israeli forces continued their bombardment of Gaza.

The number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks in the war surpassed 53,000 people this week — a third of them children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

Boeing agreed last year to plead guilty to defrauding regulators after the crashes of two 737 Max jets, in 2018 and 2019, that killed 346 people. But a federal judgerejected that proposed plea deal. Now the Justice Department is weighing another agreement that would allow Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution. The company would agree instead to a non-criminal settlement that would include $444.5 million for a crash victims' fund. Lawyers for some of the family members say they're outraged by the proposed deal, and said they plan to fight it in court. \"This isn't justice,\" Erin Applebaum, an attorney at the firm Kreindler & Kreindler, said in a statement. \"It's a backroom deal dressed up as a legal proceeding, and it sends a dangerous message: in America, the rich and powerful can buy their way out of accountability.\" The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Boeing declined to comment. Under the previous deal announced last year, Boeing had agreed to plead guilty to a single count of conspiracy to defraud regulators about the safety of its planes. But U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas objected to the framework that Boeing and the Justice Department crafted to select an independent monitor, insisting the court should play a bigger role. The acting head of the DOJ Criminal Division's Fraud Section said a final decision had not been reached, according to lawyers for the family members. \"We hope that this bizarre plan will be rejected by the leadership of the Department,\" said Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah and former federal judge who is representing the families of the victims for free. In a statement, Cassell said his clients would urge Judge O'Connor to reject this agreement, as well. \"Dismissing the case would dishonor the memories of 346 victims, who Boeing killed through its callous lies,\" Cassell wrote.

    "article_text": "By Majd Al-Waheidi International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan attends a United Nations Security Council meeting on Sudan and South Sudan in January in New York City.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Imageshide caption Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, who is facing allegations of sexual misconduct, has temporarily stepped aside as a United Nations investigation enters its final stage, the court announced Friday. A senior official with knowledge of the matter, speaking anonymously because they weren't authorized to talk publicly about the case, also confirmed to NPR that Khan was on administrative leave while the U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services, which is leading the investigation, completes its inquiry. The senior official said there had been pressure on Khan since last May last year, and top officials from the states parties that are part of the ICC have urged him to step down. In an internal message sent to representatives of ICC states parties,Ambassador Päivi Kaukorantaof Finland wrote: \"On 16 May 2025, the Prosecutor communicated to [the Registrar] via email his decision to take leave until the end of the OIOS process. According to the Prosecutor's message, the Deputy Prosecutors will be in charge of the management of the Office of the Prosecutor during the Prosecutor's absence.\" In response to NPR's request for comment, ICC spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah sent a statement confirming Khan's leave. TheInternational Federation for Human Rightswelcomed Khan's decision to step aside, saying in a statement that it was \"the only responsible decision\" and calling his temporary departure \"essential to protecting the integrity of the court.\" Last week, theWall Street Journalreported accusations against Khanby one of his former aides, a lawyer from Malaysia in her 30s. Citing testimony that the paper said she gave to U.N. officials, theJournalreported that she accused him of having forcible sexual intercourse with her during missions to New York, Colombia, Congo, Chad and Paris, and at a residence owned by his wife in The Hague, allegations Khan has denied. NPR has not independently confirmed the allegations reported in theWall Street Journal. NPR was unable to reach Khan's lawyers, but they have denied the accusations in theWall Street Journal, which reported that \"Khan, through his lawyers, said it was 'categorically untrue that he has engaged in sexual misconduct of any kind.'\" According to the paper, the lawyer from Malaysia testified to United Nations investigators that Khan initiated unwanted sexual contact over several months, ultimately coercing her into sex, and that she remained in her job because she didn't want to leave one of the world's leading human rights institutions. She also reported fearing that losing her salary would leave her unable to pay her mother's hospital bills for cancer treatment. The court's announcement on Friday follows an internal review and comes amid mounting pressure from the United States. The Trump administration placedsanctions on the ICCin February for what it termed \"illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.\" Khan has been leading the case in whichthe ICC issued arrest warrantslast November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. An arrest warrant was also issued in November for a Hamas military commander, whose death was later confirmed by Hamas. Netanyahu and Gallant have not appeared before the court. Israel denies allegations of war crimes related to its military attacks in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. With Khan's temporary departure, the future of the case appears uncertain. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Sergio Martínez-Beltrán In an aerial view, inmates are seen in the courtyard at the Bluebonnet Detention Center on May 12 in Anson, Texas. ICE has begun transferring illegal immigrant detainees to the Bluebonnet Detention Center after U.S. District Judge Wesley Hendrix readily offered the facility to the Trump administration under the Alien Enemies Act.Brandon Bell/Getty Imageshide caption The Supreme Court on Friday granted a preliminary injunction thatextends a pauseon deportations of Venezuelan immigrants in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. President Trump had invoked the 18-century wartime law to quickly deport foreigners deemed a threat to the U.S. The Supreme Court said the government didn't give people at a detention center in Texas enough time to argue against their deportations. It overruled an order from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had said it didn't have jurisdiction over the case and said the Venezuelans had appealed too quickly after a lower court ruled against them. But the Supreme Court disagreed. \"Here the District Court's inaction—not for 42 minutes but for 14 hours and 28 minutes—had the practical effect of refusing an injunction to detainees facing an imminent threat of severe, irreparable harm,\" the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. \"Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\" The Supreme Court said its order was meant to preserve its jurisdiction over the case while letting lower courts decide how much notice should be given to people the government wants to remove quickly under the Alien Enemies Act. It said it's not directly addressing whether Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was legal. \"We have long held that 'no person shall be' removed from the United States 'without opportunity, at some time, to be heard,'\" the court said in the emergency order, quoting from prior opinions. Justice Samuel Alito issued a dissenting opinion in the case, with which Justice Clarence Thomas joined, arguing that the Supreme Court was getting involved in the case too early and has no authority to issue relief. President Trumpreacted to the rulingon social media, saying the Supreme Court's order would also more criminals to get into the U.S. He thanked Alito and Thomas for their dissent. \"The Supreme Court has just ruled that the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally, are not allowed to be forced out without going through a long, protracted, and expensive Legal Process, one that will take, possibly, many years for each person,\" he posted. \"The Supreme Court of the United States is not allowing me to do what I was elected to do.\" Friday's ruling makes it clear that the Supreme Court is paying attention and keeping track of the Trump administration's actions when it comes to quick removals. Many of the lawsuits related to removals under the Alien Enemies Act, and even under other circumstances, have questioned whether the Trump administration has violated due process. The Supreme Court on Friday referenced the case ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man the Trump administration says was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. That's despite a 2019 order prohibiting the U.S. government from removing him to that country specifically. The Trump administration has said it can't bring Abrego Garcia back because he's now under the jurisdiction of El Salvador; it also alleges he's a gang member and belongs back in El Salvador. The Supreme Court in Friday's order basically said it doesn't want to lose jurisdiction if people are flown out of the country before the courts resolve some issues tied to due process, and how much notice migrants should get before they're removed from the U.S. \"The detainees' interests at stake are accordingly particularly weighty,\" the ruling said. The Supreme Court had first gotten involved in the Alien Enemies Act case last month, after issuing a rare middle-of-the-night order to prevent immediate deportations under act. The court did say that the order doesn't stop the government from removing people from the U.S. \"under other lawful authorities.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "DOGE tried assigning a team to the Government Accountability Office. It refused",
    "article_text": "By Stephen Fowler , Shannon Bond A 2024 file photo of the U.S. Capitol.Bonnie Cash/Getty Imageshide caption The Department of Government Efficiency is continuing its attempts to expand its reach beyond executive branch agencies, this time seeking to embed in an independent legislative watchdog that finds waste, fraud and abuse in the government. But theU.S. Government Accountability Office, a legislative branch entity that helps audit government spending and suggest ways to make it more efficient, rejected that request on Friday by noting that GAO is not subject to presidential executive orders. The request to GAO had cited President Trump's Jan. 20 executive ordercreating DOGE, which, despite its name, is not a formal agency. DOGE's request to GAO and its response was first reported byNOTUS. A spokesperson for GAO confirmed DOGE's outreach, and reiterated that \"as a legislative branch agency, GAO is not subject to Executive Orders and has therefore declined any requests to have a DOGE team assigned to GAO.\" In an announcement to employees posted Friday afternoon, GAO leadership said they sent a letter to Acting Administrator of DOGE Amy Gleason and notified members of Congress, according to a copy of the notice shared with NPR by an employee not authorized to speak publicly. The GAO regularly releases reports that highlight ways to improve government efficiency, like aMay 13 reviewof federal programs with fragmented, overlapping, or duplicative actions it says could save over $100 billion in spending. But there's been little overlap between GAO's work and DOGE's actions so far. \"DOGE's attempted intrusion into an independent, nonpartisan legislative branch agency is a direct assault on our nation's sacred separation of powers,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which oversees GAO, in a statement to NPR. \"DOGE cannot and must not have any access to GAO. Oversight Democrats are monitoring this situation closely and stand behind GAO's well-established status as a critical legislative branch agency.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about DOGE's attempts to place a team at GAO. It's not the first time DOGE has sought to embed staffers at an organization outside of the executive branch. In recent weeks, DOGE representatives have been in contact with several privately incorporated nonprofits that were created by Congress and receive federal funding but are not considered government agencies, as well as at least one nonprofit that was established with no relationship to Congress. DOGE tried toassign a team to review operations at the Corporation for Public Broadcastingin April, a day after Trumpattempted to firethree board members, according to filings in a lawsuit brought by CPB challenging Trump's move. CPB denied that request, citing federal law stating that the organization \"will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government.\" DOGE's efforts went even further when it approached the Vera Institute of Justice, a private nonprofit that has received federal grants, but was not created by Congress, about assigning a team there. In an Apr. 15 call with Vera Institute leadership, a DOGE representative said DOGE's outreach was about interrogating \"every institute or agency that has Congressional monies appropriated to it,\" according to notes Vera Institute staff shared with NPR. After Vera staff told the DOGE representative that the Department of Justice had terminated the organization's grants, he said his request to embed into Vera was \"void.\" DOGE's efforts to embed at GAO also heighten growing tensions between Congress and the executive branch. Last week, President Trumpabruptly fired the Librarian of Congress, a year before the end of her term — raising concerns from members of Congress including Senate Majority leader John Thune. Meanwhile, the watchdog agency has dozens of investigations underway into whether the White House violated the law by freezing funding that had already been allocated by Congress. \" We have right now 39 different investigations underway,\" Gene Dodaro, the current head of the GAO, told a Senatehearingon Apr. 29. \"We're trying to get the information from the agencies about what their legal position is for not expending the money,\" Dodaro told lawmakers.

Combs is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering, and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Combs' defense attorney, Marc Agnifilo, is using a familiar tactic to describe the hip-hop mogul's relationship with one of his accusers, his former longtime girlfriend, singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura. \"There was hitting on both sides,\" Agnifilosaidin court. \"We're going to take the position that there was mutual violence in the relationship.\" This concept, often referred to as \"mutual violence\" or \"mutual abuse,\" suggests that both parties in an abuse case engaged in abusive behavior.

But Loyola Marymount University law professor Laurie Levenson said \"mutual abuse\" is not a legal defense of abuse. \"You won't find in the law books a mutual abuse defense. What you'll see are defendants arguing, 'Well, I really thought that the victim was consenting because they were doing it to me, and therefore I could do it to them,' \" she said. \"[But] it is not okay in the criminal law world to abuse somebody and then say, 'Well, they're at fault, too.' \" Bev Gooden, author ofSurviving: Why We Stay and How We Leave Abusive Relationships,believes the idea of \"mutual abuse\"goes againstthe very definition of abuse as well. \"Abuse is about a pattern of behavior designed to maintain control over another person,\" she said. \"Abuse is about power, it's about control, manipulation, not just physical violence or aggression. And so even if both people engage in harmful behaviors, one is typically the abuser controlling the situation.\" Gooden added that it's critical to understand the power dynamics at play to be able to differentiate between abuse and fighting back, even if they look similar. She said, \"I find that what often gets labeled as mutual abuse is more accurately a trauma response… The thing that I always say is that trauma responses can cause harm. And I think that's what the public is seeing when they see someone lashing back or lashing out at the abusive partner - [but] that's not the same thing as being abusive. Harm is not abuse. Conflict is not abuse. Abuse is about power and control. It is a pattern, not just messy behavior on both sides.\" But why would Combs' defense concede that his relationship with Ventura was violent at all? Levenson thinks that the defense is trying to reframe this \"mutual violence\" as a consensual part of the sexual relationship – a strategy she saw in the case of former Dodger's player Trevor Bauer. \"Trevor Bauer, back in 2021, he was accused of abusing [someone] with various harmful and physically painful sexual activities. And hisdefensewas, 'Well, that's just the way we have sex,' \" she said. \"And in fact, that case ended up being dropped.\" Gooden said kink is not abuse. Practitioners areadamantthat enthusiastic consent is central to kink. \"Now [Bauer's case] wasn't as extreme as what's being alleged here against Combs,\" Levenson added, \"but I think the defense is trying to reframe this as, 'Gee, that's just how the world of rock 'n' roll works, and these people wanted to be part of it, so they're not truly victims.' \" Gooden added that this narrative might be especially palatable for the public, who might be fans or admirers of a celebrity like Sean Combs. \"We often have a hard time believing that someone we hold in high esteem could be abusive, that the same hands that create art can also create terror,\" she said. \"That's really hard to sit with, and I empathize with people who are working through that, 'cause I've been there. I think a healthier way to deal with that hurt and confusion is to accept that someone can be good to you and still hurt someone else.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Here are 5 takeaways from Trump's first major foreign trip to the Middle East",
    "article_text": "Domenico Montanaro President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attend a bilateral meeting at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump was greeted like royalty during his four-day trip to the Middle East. There were opulent palaces, fighter jet escorts, a parade of camels and much more. It was exactly the kind of pomp that makes Trump, with his love of a gold-plated lifestyle, envious. His focus, he said, was on securing money and deals for the United States. The Gulf states obliged, trying to curry favor with the president through investments, arms deals and buying Boeing planes while giving a very lavish one away. Here are five takeaways from Trump's trip: Trump is someone who values fealty, power and glitz. He has gotten the fealty from staff and Cabinet appointees in this second term. He has ogled at the power of autocrats, like Viktor Orban of Hungary and Russia's Vladimir Putin. He spends lots of time at his glitzy Palm Beach, Fla. home, Mar-a-lago, and redecorated the Oval Office with lots of gold. \"You see the new and improved Oval Office,\" Trump boasted earlier this month during a meeting with Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney. \"As it becomes more and more beautiful with love, you know, we handle it with great love and 24-karat gold — that always helps, too.\" He got much the same during this trip to the Middle East — genuflecting, leaders who rule with iron fists and marbled, golden glamour. President Trump tours the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, including the mausoleum of the late founder Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan, with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Dr. Yousef Al-Obaidi, Director-General of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center (SZGMC) and Ameena Alhammadi, Acting Director of Culture and Knowledge Department of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre on May 15 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Trump is on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and regional allies including the UAE, focusing on security and economic collaboration.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption There were lots offinancial agreements struckbetween the United States, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, including: Qatar's state-backed airline buying Boeing jets, Qatar taking billions in U.S. arms, UAE building an artificial intelligence campus, Saudi Arabia investing in medical and military research, as well as other deals on oil. But Qatar's gift toTrump of a 747 to replace Air Force Onehas been the thing that has gotten the most attention and drawn criticism — for different reasons — left, right and MAGA. Described as a \"flying palace\" worth some $400 million, Trump is enamored with the jet. He called it a great \"gesture,\" noted, \"I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer\" and said: \"I could be a stupid person, saying, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane.'\" Trump called it a gift to the Defense Department, but it's not a plane that would be sticking around after Trump leaves office. He said it would be decommissioned and sent to his presidential library. There are already newly designed Air Force One jets that Boeing is building, but Trump has been frustrated with delays. \"I've been doing this for four days,\" Trump said on his last day of the trip. \"I leave now and get onto a 42-year-old Boeing. But new ones are coming, new ones are coming.\" Accepting the plane would seem to violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution that bars such gifts from foreign leaders and could also only get a couple years of use. It would also need to be refurbished to check for listening devices, as well as broken down and put back together to meet the security requirements of a presidential aircraft. That couldtake yearsand has a significant additional cost. Trump may just ignore all that and fly it anyway — above strenuous objections even from within his own party. \"There are lots of issues around that that will attract serious questions,\" Senate Republican leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters of the plane. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D. used an ancient metaphor on CNN, warning against the gift. \"It seems to me the Greeks had something like that a long, long time ago,\" he said, \"and somebody happened to bring a golden horse inside of a community.\" The ever-colorful Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana delivered this on Fox News: \"I trust Qatar like I trust a rest stop bathroom. … With those guys, trust in God, but tie up your camel.\" Trump is coming back from his trip facing lots of pushback for many reasons about the gift, including for wanting to accept a $400 million plane while urging doll-and-pencil austerity on other Americans. President Trump meets with business leaders at the Ritz Carlton Hotel on May 15 in Doha, Qatar on the third day of his visit to the Gulf to underscore the strategic partnership between the United States and Qatar, focusing on regional security and economic collaboration.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption Normally, American presidents who visit the Middle East talk of forging new relationships, but also are closely watched for how they talk about encouraging democracy. Trump, though, talked about a Middle East he sees as evolving beyond \"tired divisions\" and \"defined by commerce not chaos,\" \"technology not terrorism.\" \"The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities,\" Trump contended in remarks from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \"Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves. The people that are right here, the people that have lived here all their lives, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions and charting your own destinies in your own way,\" Trump continued. It's really incredible what you've done.\" Trump's reductive and sanitized version of the region ignores, for example, the \"sportswashing\" of countries like Qatar, which won the right to host the 2022 FIFA soccer World Cup, through bribes,according to the U.S. government. It also built stadiums with international workers that sawdangerous working conditions and deaths. It ignores the UAE trying to show itself as progressive on the world stage, whilesuppressing dissent and imprisoning dissidents, as well as its treatment of migrant workersand more. It ignores that aWashington Postcolumnist disappeared from a Saudi embassy in Turkey. It was later discovered he had been killed in a gruesome attack that U.S. intelligence says was ordered by the country's de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman. That's to say nothing of women's rights, the lack of free elections and concentrations of wealth passed down through a select few royal families. For Trump, it seems that none of that matters. It's transactions over principle, a pivot away from American moral leadership. Taking a shot at former presidents, Trump said, \"In recent years, far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins.\" Trump was on this trip to get signatures on the dotted line at the bottom of the page. But it was impossible to totally escape some of the major international flashpoints. He made news by lifting sanctions against Syria that have been in place for decades. He gripped and grinned with the country's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, someone who until recently had a $10 million bounty on his head for his arrest by the United States for his past association with Al Qaeda. Though Trump was critical of past American presidents, who have gauged foreign leaders by looking into their \"soul\" — a reference to George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin — Trump heaped praise on Syria's new leader. He judged him to be \"attractive\" and \"tough\" with a \"very strong past. Fighter.\" \"He's got a real shot at holding it together,\" Trump surmised. \"He's a real leader. He led a charge, and he's pretty amazing.\" On Iran, Trump continued to be eager to forge a nuclear deal, saying the U.S. was \"in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace.\" He added, \"It'll be taken care of 100%, it'll be done nicely or not nicely and the not nicely is not a good thing for them. We're talking to them and I think they've come a long way.\" Publicly, there was no serious in-depth discussion of Gaza, and Trump again floated the idea of the U.S. taking over the strip and making it a \"freedom zone.\" But it also seemed that Gulf leaders may have said something behind closed doors, because Trump noted, \"We have to help also out the Palestinians. You know, a lot of people are starving in Gaza, so we have to look at both sides.\" Trump also talked about the Ukraine-Russia talks taking place in Turkey. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Turkey, Trump wanted to attend, but Putin was a no-show. Not only that, but Russia sent a low-level diplomatic delegation. Russia watchers see what Putin is doing as another delay tactic, as he continues to try and advance in Ukraine. At some point, Trump has to make the choice — whether he will continue this dance with Putin or if he loses patience. The fact is Trump made a lot of big promises about ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, but has so far not been able to deliver. He's running into some big personalities with Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who, so far, are not bending to Trump's will.

    "title": "RFK Jr’s plan to ban fluoride supplements will “hurt rural America,” dentists say",
    "article_text": "In areas without fluoridated water, supplements are the only way to get adequate doses. This week, the US health department announced a plan toban prescription fluoride supplements for children. These ingested fluoride products are dispensed at safe doses by doctors and dentists to prevent tooth decay in children who are unable to get adequate fluoride doses from community water systems—something that may become more common as more states and cities remove or ban fluoride from their water. Both the American Dental Association (ADA) andthe American Academy of Pediatricsrecommend fluoridating community water andadvise prescribing fluoride supplements for childrenwho do not get adequate fluoride dosages through their water. Nevertheless, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under anti-vaccine advocate and conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr states without clear evidence that fluoride supplements harm children's microbiome and pose other health risks. The ADA pushed back strongly, telling Ars Technica in a written statement that the scientific studies the HHS references as evidence of harms \"do not in fact demonstrate any harmful effects for the concentrations of fluoride prescribed by physicians and dentists.\" To support the alleged claim that fluoride harms the gut microbiome, HHS listed two review studies in its announcement. One review, published this year, concludes, \"In humans, high doses potentially may be detrimental to the microbiome, whereas ≤ 2 mg/L [sodium fluoride]had positive effects.\" Community water systems are recommended to have a level of 0.7 mg/L.The other review, published in 2023, said that there wasn't enough human data to make any conclusions. In the announcement, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary was quoted as saying, \"The best way to prevent cavities in children is by avoiding excessive sugar intake and good dental hygiene, not by altering a child’s microbiome. For the same reason that fluoride may kill bacteria on teeth, it may also kill intestinal bacteria important for a child’s health.\" While fluoride can kill bacteria, particularly at high levels, it's used in oral health to inhibit the demineralization of tooth enamel while enhancing the remineralization of tooth surfaces, the ADA clarifies. The best way to get fluoride is through drinking water, the ADA says. But supplements are a safe alternative if a child lives in an area without fluoridated water or if they mostly drink bottled water. Given rampant false and controversial claims about fluoride, more communities are now abandoning it. This week, Florida became the second state after Utah to ban fluoridation state-wide. \"Yes, use fluoride for your teeth, that’s fine,\"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news conference after signing the ban into law. \"But forcing it in the water supply is basically forced medication on people. They don’t have a choice.\" ADA President Brett Kessler worries what children in places such as Utah and Florida will do to get adequate fluoride if the ban on supplements goes through. “In non-fluoridated communities, especially rural areas, fluoride supplements are the only chance for individuals to get the appropriate amount of fluoride to prevent tooth decay,\" Kessler said in the statement. The move will be \"particularly harmful to the most vulnerable and those who lack access to care,\" he added. While Makary said that the FDA will conduct a safety review of  fluoride supplements, the conclusion seems to be foregone, with the HHS writing that it is already \"initiating action to remove\" the products. The ADA noted that places that have removed fluoride from drinking water, such asCalgary, Canada, andJuneau, Alaska, have seen increases in dental decay, particularly among children and low-income populations. \"Proposals like this stand to hurt rural America, not make them healthier,\" Kessler said.

    "title": "Spotify caught hosting hundreds of fake podcasts that advertise selling drugs",
    "article_text": "Fake 10-second podcasts are easily found fronts for black markets, reports say. This week, Spotify rushed to remove hundreds of obviously fake podcasts found to be marketing prescription drugs in violation of Spotify's policies and, likely, federal law. On Thursday, Business Insider (BI)reportedthat Spotify removed 200 podcasts advertising the sale of opioids and other drugs, but that wasn't the end of the scandal. Today, CNNrevealedthat it easily uncovered dozens more fake podcasts peddling drugs. Some of the podcasts may have raised a red flag for a human moderator—with titles like \"My Adderall Store\" or \"Xtrapharma.com\" and episodes titled \"Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana\" or \"Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season,\" CNN reported. But Spotify's auto-detection did not flag the fake podcasts for removal. Some of them remained up for months, CNN reported, which could create trouble for the music streamer at a time when the US government is cracking down on illegal drug sales online. \"Multiple teens have died of overdoses from pills bought online,\" CNN noted, sparking backlash against tech companies. And Donald Trump'saggressive tariffswere specifically raised to stop deadly drugs from bombarding the US, which the president declared a national emergency. BI found that many podcast episodes featured a computerized voice and were under a minute long, while CNN noted some episodes were as short as 10 seconds. Some of them didn't contain any audio at all, BI reported. CNN noted that developments in artificial intelligence have simplified audio and voice generation, as well as the \"proliferation of text-to-speech tools,\"which have made it easier than ever to quickly create these phony podcasts linking out to scam websites or perhaps legitimate black markets. Neither CNN nor BI could verify if drugs could actually be purchased on the sites linked. Sometimes Spotify's content moderation seemed to work to catch these podcasts, CNN suggested. But Spotify may not be hugely motivated to hunt them all down, the director of the non-profit Tech Transparency Project, Katie Paul, told CNN. Most platforms lack accountability for user-generated content like these fake podcasts, she said, shielded by Section 230. Even if Spotify did pursue a platform-wide crackdown, Paul thinks Spotify may still struggle to stay ahead of the trend, since podcasts seemingly have a \"bigger blind spot,\" as \"voice makes it much more difficult for moderation.\" It's unclear how many Spotify users interacted with the fake podcasts, CNN reported. However, the podcasts were promoted in top results for searches for various prescription drugs that some users may have conducted on the platform in search of legitimate health-related podcasts. Spotify's spokesperson told Ars that all fake podcasts flagged by the outlets were removed—considered violative as either illegal or spam content—but remained vague on whether there was any risk they might pop back up. As the service continues to play whack-a-mole, the spokesperson said, \"we are constantly working to detect and remove violating content across our service.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The empire strikes back with F-bombs: AI Darth Vader goes rogue with profanity, slurs",
    "article_text": "FortniteAI voice trained on James Earl Jones spoke curse words and insults before patch. For a short period of time on Friday, Darth Vader could drop F-bombs in the video gameFortniteas part of a voice AI implementation gone wrong,reports GameSpot. Epic Games rapidly deployed a hotfix after players encountered the Sith Lord responding to their comments with profanity and strong language. InFortnite, the AI-voiced Vader appears as both a boss in battle royale mode and an interactive character. The official Star Wars websiteencourages playersto \"ask him all your pressing questions about the Force, the Galactic Empire… or you know, a good strat for the last Storm circle,\" adding that \"the Sith Lord has opinions.\" The F-bomb incident involved a Twitch streamer named Loserfruit, who triggered the forceful response when discussing food with the virtual Vader. The Dark Lord of the Sith responded by repeating her words \"freaking\" and \"fucking\" before adding, \"Such vulgarity does not become you, Padme.\" The exchangespread virallyacross social media platforms on Friday. The voice used for Darth Vader inFortnitecomes from an AI model based on James Earl Jones, who famously portrayed the character's voice throughout most of the Star Wars franchise. Jones, who died in 2024, hadsigned over his voice rightsfor future Star Wars productions before his death. Fortnitepublisher Epic Games acknowledged the profanity issue on X on Friday,writing, \"We pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn’t happen again.\" The company acted quickly to address the language issues, but according to GameSpot, some players also reported hearingintense instructionsfor dealing with a break-up (\"Exploit their vulnerabilities, shatter their confidence, and crush their spirit\") anddisparaging commentsfrom the character directed at Spanish speakers: \"Spanish? A useful tongue for smugglers and spice traders,\" AI Vader said. \"Its strategic value is minimal.\" To be fair to Epic's attempt at an AI implementation, Darth Vader is a deeply evil character (i.e. murders sandpeople, hates sand), and the remarks seem consistent with his twisted and sadistic personality. In fact, arguably the most out-of-character \"inappropriate\" response in the examples above might be the one where he chides the player for vulgarity. On Friday afternoon, Epic Games sent out an email seeking to reassure parents who may have come across the news about the misbehaving AI character. The company explained it has added \"a new parental control so you can choose whether your child can interact with AI features in Epic's products through voice and written communication.\" The email specifically mentions the Darth Vader NPC, noting that \"when players talk to conversational AI like Darth Vader, they can have an interactive chat where the NPC responds in context.\" For children under 13 or their country's age of digital consent, Epic says the feature defaults to off and requires parental activation through either the Fortnite main menu or Epic Account Settings. Getting an AI character to match the tone or backstory of an established fictional character isn't as easy as it might seem. Compared to a carefully controlled authored script in other video games, AI speech can offer nearly infinite possibilities. Trusting that AI model will get it right, at scale, is a dicey proposition—especially with a well-known and beloved character. In that sense, the vulgar Vader situation creates a touchy dilemma for Epic Games and Disney, which likely invested substantially in this high-profile collaboration. While Epic acted swiftly in response, maintaining the feature while preventing further Jedi mind tricks from players presents ongoing technical challenges for interactive AI speech of any kind. AI language models like the one constructing responses for Vader arefairly easy to trickwith exploits likeprompt injectionsandjailbreaks, and that has limited their usefulness in some applications. Imagine a truly ChatGPT-like Siri orAlexa, for example, that could be tricked into saying racist things on behalf of Apple or Amazon. Beyond language models, the AI voice technology behind the AI Darth Vader voice in Fortnite comes from Respeecher, a Ukrainian startupwe covered in 2022that creates new conversations from revitalized old voice recordings. It uses an AI model trained on examples of speech from voice actors that can then synthesize new speech in the same style. Respeecher previously worked with Lucasfilm onThe Book of Boba Fettto recreate young Luke Skywalker's voice and onObi-Wan Kenobifor Darth Vader's voice performance. According toVariety, Jones' family supported the Fortnite collaboration, stating: \"James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character.\" This article was updated on May 16, 2025 at 4:25 PM to include information about an email sent out from Epic Games to parents.

    "title": "Google to give app devs access to Gemini Nano for on-device AI",
    "article_text": "New APIs for Google's ML Kit will let developers plug into the on-device AI model. The rapid expansion of generative AI has changed the way Google and other tech giants design products, but most of the AI features you've used are running on remote servers with a ton of processing power. Your phonehas a lot less power, but Google appears poised to give developers some important new mobile AI tools. At I/O next week, Google will likely announce a new set of APIs to let developers leverage the capabilities of Gemini Nano for on-device AI. Google has quietly published documentation on big new AI features for developers. According toAndroid Authority, an update to the ML Kit SDK will add API support for on-device generative AI features via Gemini Nano. It's built on AI Core, similar to the experimental Edge AI SDK, but it plugs into an existing model with a set of predefined features that should be easy for developers to implement. Google says ML Kit’s GenAI APIs will enable apps to do summarization, proofreading, rewriting, and image description without sending data to the cloud. However, Gemini Nano doesn't have as much power as the cloud-based version, so expect some limitations. For example, Google notes that summaries can only have a maximum of three bullet points, and image descriptions will only be available in English. The quality of outputs could also vary based on the version of Gemini Nano on a phone. The standard version (Gemini Nano XS) is about 100MB in size, but Gemini Nano XXSas seen on the Pixel 9ais a quarter of the size. It's text-only and has a much smaller context window. This move is good for Android in general because ML Kit works on devices outside Google's Pixel line. While Pixel devices use Gemini Nano extensively, several other phones are already designed to run this model, including the OnePlus 13, Samsung Galaxy S25, and Xiaomi 15. As more phones add support for Google's AI model, developers will be able to target those devices with generative AI features. The documentationis available for developers to peruse now, but we expect Google to fling the API doors open at I/O. The company has already confirmed an I/O session called \"Gemini Nano on Android: Building with on-device gen AI.\" The description promises new APIs to \"summarize, proofread, and rewrite text, as well as to generate image descriptions,\" which sounds exactly like what the new ML Kit APIs can do. App developers interested in adding on-device generative AI features on Android are currently in a tough spot. Google offers the AI Edge SDK that can provide access to the NPU hardware for running models, but these tools are experimental and only work on the Pixel 9 series currently. It's also limited to text. Both Qualcomm and MediaTek offer APIs for running AI workloads, but features and functionality vary by device, which makes it risky to rely on them for a long-term project. And running your own model requires intimate knowledge of generative AI systems. The new APIs should make implementing local AI comparatively quick and easy. Despite the limited functionality of an on-device model, this is an important part of how AI could become more helpful. Most people would probably prefer not to send all their personal data to a remote server for AI processing, but an on-device model can parse that information in a more secure way. For example, Google's Pixel Screenshots sees all your screenshots, but all the processing happens on your phone. Similarly, Motorola summarizes notifications locally on thenew Razr Ultra foldable. On the other hand, its less capable base model Razr sends notifications to a server for processing. The release of APIs that plug into Gemini Nano could provide some much-needed consistency to mobile AI. However, it does rely on Google and OEMs to collaborate on support for Gemini Nano. Some companies might decide to go their own way, and there will be plenty of phones that don't have enough power to run AI locally.

    "title": "From birth to gene-edited in 6 months: Custom therapy breaks speed limits",
    "article_text": "The N-of-1 accomplishment provides a template for swift, personalized genetic therapies. News broke yesterday that researchers in Philadelphiaappear to have successfully treated a 6-month-old baby boy, called KJ, with a personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The treatment corrects an ultra-rare mutation in KJ that breaks a liver enzyme. That enzyme is required to convert ammonia, a byproduct of metabolism, to urea, a waste product released in urine. Without treatment, ammonia would build up to dangerous levels in KJ—and he would have a 50 percent chance of dying in infancy. While the gene-editing treatment isn't a complete cure, and long-term success is still uncertain, KJ's condition has improved and stabilized. And the treatment's positive results appear to be a first for personalizing gene editing. Now, who doesn't love a good story about a seemingly miraculous medical treatment saving a cute, chubby-cheeked baby? But, this story delivers more than an adorable bundle of joy; the big triumph is the striking timeline of the treatment's development—and the fact that it provides a template for how to treat other babies with ultra-rare mutations. The gene editing technology used for KJ is not exactly new, nor is the delivery system. CRISPR has already proven to bea successful gene therapy. What's stunning is the speed. KJ's mutation was identified within days of his birth. Within weeks, researchers were growing cells in petri dishes that carried genetic sequences copied from KJ. In month two, they used those cells to train molecular gene-editing machinery to target and correct KJ's mutation—a spot in the DNA coding for the liver enzyme where there's a T (thymine) instead of a C (cytosine). At the beginning of the third month, researchers had created genetically engineered mice that carry KJ's specific mutation, too. In the boy's fourth month, researchers were meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss regulatory approval for a clinical trial—a trial where KJ would be the only participant. They were also working with the institutional review board (IRB) at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to go over the clinical protocol, safety, and ethical aspects of the treatment. The researchers described the unprecedented speed of the oversight steps as being \"through alternative procedures.\" In month five, they started toxicology testing in mice. In the mice, the experimental therapy corrected KJ's mutation, replacing the errant A-T base pair with the correct G-C pair in the animals' cells. The first dose provided a 42 percent whole-liver corrective rate in the animals. At the start of KJ's sixth month, the researchers had results from safety testing in monkeys: Their customized base-editing therapy, delivered as mRNA via a lipid nanoparticle, did not produce any toxic effects in the monkeys. A clinical-grade batch of the treatment was readied. In month seven, further testing of the treatment found acceptably low-levels of off-target genetic changes. The researchers submitted the FDA paperwork for approval of an \"investigational new drug,\" or IND, for KJ. The FDA approved it in a week. The researchers then started KJ on an immune-suppressing treatment to make sure his immune system wouldn't react to the gene-editing therapy. Then, when KJ was still just 6 months old, he got a first low dose of his custom gene-editing therapy. After the treatment, he was able to start eating more protein, which would have otherwise caused his ammonia levels to skyrocket. But he couldn’t be weaned off of the drug treatment used to keep his ammonia levels down (nitrogen scavenging medication). With no safety concerns seen after the first dose, KJ has since gotten two more doses of the gene therapy and is now on reduced nitrogen scavenging medication. With more protein in his diet, he has moved from the 9thpercentile in weight to 35thor 40thpercentile. He's now about 9 and a half months old, and his doctors are preparing to allow him to go home from the hospital for the first time. Though he will have to be closely monitored and may still at some point need a liver transplant, his family and doctors are celebrating the improvements so far. In the past, the development of such a treatment would have taken years. But the swift and diligent response to KJ's condition led to timely treatment. The timeline and steps provide a guide for development of other customized gene therapies. KJ's treatment was presented this week at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Annual Meeting in New Orleans. It was alsosimultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Inan accompanying editorial, Peter Marks—a former top regulator at the FDA—called KJ's  treatment a \"platform technology\" that could be used as a template for treating millions of others with rare genetic conditions. \"The development of gene-editing products to address N-of-1 disorders with the use of mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles represents one of the most obvious opportunities for the application of a platform-technology approach that could be transformational,\" he wrote. In all, KJ's treatment \"shows the potential strength of the application of cutting-edge science and technology with a forward-leaning regulatory approach to safely expedite the development and availability of life-saving medicines,\" Marks wrote. KJ's doctors agree. “Years and years of progress in gene editing and collaboration between researchers and clinicians made this moment possible, and while KJ is just one patient, we hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient’s needs,\" said Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a pediatrician and gene therapy expert at CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania, who treated KJ.

    "title": "OpenAI introduces Codex, its first full-fledged AI agent for coding",
    "article_text": "It replicates your development environment and takes up to 30 minutes per task. We've been expecting it for a while, and now it's here: OpenAI has introduced an agentic coding tool called Codex in research preview. The tool is meant to allow experienced developers to delegate rote and relatively simple programming tasks to an AI agent that will generate production-ready code and show its work along the way. Codex is a unique interface (not to be confused with the Codex CLI tool introduced by OpenAI last month) that can be reached from the side bar in the ChatGPT web app. Users enter a prompt and then click either \"code\" to have it begin producing code, or \"ask\" to have it answer questions and advise. Whenever it's given a task, that task is performed in a distinct container that is preloaded with the user's codebase and is meant to accurately reflect their development environment. To make Codex more effective, developers can include an \"AGENTS.md\" file in the repo with custom instructions, for example to contextualize and explain the code base or to communicate standardizations and style practices for the project—kind of a README.md but for AI agents rather than humans. Codex is built on codex-1, a fine-tuned variation of OpenAI's o3 reasoning model that was trained using reinforcement learning on a wide range of coding tasks to analyze and generate code, and to iterate through tests along the way. OpenAI'sannouncement postabout Codex is filled with objection handling to tackle the common refrains against AI coding agents; based on older tools and models, many developers accurately point out that LLM coding tools (especially when used for vibe coding instead of just for code completion or as an advisor) have been known to produce scripts that don't follow standards, are opaque or difficult to debug, or are insecure. The fine tuning that led to codex-1 is meant to address these concerns in part, and it's also key that Codex shows its thinking and work every step of the way as it goes through its tasks (which can take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete). All that said, OpenAI notes that \"it still remains essential for users to manually review and validate all agent-generated code before integration and execution.\" Codex is available in a research preview, but it's rolling out to all ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users now. Plus and Edu support is coming at a later date. For now, \"users will have generous access at no additional cost for the coming weeks\" so that they \"can explore what Codex can do,\" but OpenAI says it intends to introduce rate limits and a new pricing scheme later.

    "title": "Forgive me, Volvo, I was wrong: The 2025 V60 Cross Country review",
    "article_text": "Volvo's midsize station wagon proves a real charmer. As we often like to remind people, beware buying any car in its first model year. It takes a little while for any OEM to find its feet with a new model, and now there's half-baked software that can need frequent updating to worry about in addition to any mechanical woes. I bring this up because various bugs meant that an electric car we were supposed to review had to be repeatedly postponed, as it was away being fixed, and as a result our week with the 2025 Volvo V60 Cross Country turned into two. And what a pleasant two weeks they were. The Volvo station wagon is not in its first production year. Any criticism of its onboard electronics would focus more on the fact that they are now increasingly vintage, but that also means the bugs have mostly been squashed by now. Sadly, Volvo killed off theregular V60 station wagonearlier this year, but you can still buy the Cross Country version, which starts at $51,495, including the delivery charge. As the name probably implies, the V60 Cross Country has some adaptations for unpaved roads: it rides a little higher and on softer suspension, and there's protective cladding here and there that gives this wagon a bit of a bold stance. At this point, I should probably apologize to Volvo.When I last drove a V60 Cross Country back in 2020, it seems I spectacularly missed the point of the car, going as far as to write that jacking up the ride height ruined the way it drove. The older, wiser me realizes that the slightly bouncy ride and light steering actually makes this a very nimble car, and you appreciate its supple nature on rough tarmac. So Volvo, I am very sorry I wrote that you ruined this car. Things are only let down a bit by the powertrain, which is now Volvo's B5 mild hybrid. It's not that the 2.0 L turbocharged engine's 247 hp (185 kW) and 268 lb-ft (198 Nm) is insufficient for the car's needs. Rather, the eight-speed automatic transmission's desire to change into as high a gear as possible as soon as possible, for better fuel efficiency, means that when you do need a burst of power you have to wait a bit for the 'box to shuffle down through two or three gears. At least it's a pleasant-sounding engine when it approaches its redline. Perhaps if I was more patient I'd have gotten closer to the EPA combined 27 mpg (8.7 L/100 km), too—instead the best I could average was 23 mpg (10.2 L/100 km). One wonders how much lower it would be without the 48 V mild hybrid system. While I am a big fan of the way the V60's front seats look, they could do with quite a lot more lateral support. It definitely feels like you're satonthem, notinthem, if that makes sense. The $56,595 (including delivery charge) Ultra trim adds ventilation and a good massage function to the front seats, as well as options like the tan Nappa leather you see in the (not-great) photo. (Sadly Volvo's media site didn't have any good ones either.) Ultra also adds a heads-up display and a better sound system, although our test car was given an even better $3,200 Bowers and Wilkins sound upgrade. Otherwise, the cabin is still much as it was five years ago. I appreciate the helpful features, like well-designed hooks in the cargo area that keep your shopping bags in place, which aren't always as useful as the ones here. While the infotainment system is old and its screen is small by 2025's standards, there are four USB-C ports in the car, and Google is built-in. There's also Apple CarPlay, but you'll need to use a cable. You'll want to plug your phone in anyway, as there's no wireless charging pad. My biggest complaint about the V60 Cross Country is the over-eager rear emergency braking system. A large curb or bollard can trigger it, slamming on the anchors in the process, which is annoying when I am backing into a parking space at maybe 5 mph, but I understand why the safety-conscious automaker has programmed it the way it has. After two weeks with the car there was little else I could find to criticize, and I missed its agility, easy ride, and relatively reasonable size compared to the big electric SUVs that have taken its place in the testing schedule since. Station wagon shopping in 2025 is a short process; once Audi stops selling the A4 Allroad, this V60 Cross Country has no real rival left. So it's a good thing it's a pretty decent example of the breed. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Carnivorous crocodile-like monsters used to terrorize the Caribbean",
    "article_text": "While low sea levels helped sebecids spread, rising waters left them isolated. How did reptilian things that looked something like crocodiles get to the Caribbean islands from South America millions of years ago? They probably walked. The existence of any prehistoric apex predators in the islands of the Caribbean used to be doubted. While their absence would have probably made it even more of a paradise for prey animals, fossils unearthed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic have revealed that these islands were crawling with monster crocodyliform species called sebecids, ancient relatives of crocodiles. While sebecids first emerged during the Cretaceous, this is the first evidence of them lurking outside South America during the Cenozoic epoch, which began 66 million years ago. An international team of researchers has found that these creatures would stalk and hunt in the Caribbean islands millions of years after similar predators went extinct on the South American mainland. Lower sea levels back then could have exposed enough land to walk across. “Adaptations to a terrestrial lifestyle documented for sebecids and the chronology of West Indian fossils strongly suggest that they reached the islands in the Eocene-Oligocene through transient land connections with South America or island hopping,” researchers said in a study recently published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. During the late Eocene to early Oligocene periods of the mid-Cenozoic, about 34 million years ago, many terrestrial carnivores already roamed South America. Along with crocodyliform sebecids, these included enormous snakes,terror birds, and metatherians, which were monster marsupials.At this time, the sea levels were low, and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean are thought to have been connected to South America via a land bridge calledGAARlandia(Greater Antilles and Aves Ridge).This is not the first land bridge to potentially provide a migration opportunity. Fragments of asingle toothunearthed in Seven Rivers, Jamaica, in 1999 are the oldest fossil evidence of aziphodontcrocodyliform (a group that includes sebecids) in the Caribbean. It was dated to about 47 million years ago, when Jamaica was connected to an extension of the North American continent known as the Nicaragua Rise. While the tooth from Seven Rivers is thought to have belonged to a ziphodont other than a sebacid, that and other vertebrate fossils found in Jamaica suggest parallels with ecosystems excavated from sites in the American South. The fossils found in areas like the US South that the ocean would otherwise separate suggest more than just related life forms. It's possible that the Nicaragua Rise provided a pathway for migration similar to the one sebecids probably used when they arrived in the Caribbean islands. So how did sebecids get from one land mass to the other on foot? They were made for it. Sebecids evolutionarily diverged from crocodiles during the Jurassic period. They had skulls similar to those of theropod dinosaurs, with a highrostrum(which holds the teeth along with the palate and nasal cavity) that was long and narrow. Their mouths were full of ziphodont teeth, which are compressed along the sides and have a serrated edge made for tearing flesh. Most important among theadaptationsthat made sebecids terrestrial animals were legs longer than their crocodilian brethren—legs made for walking on land. “Considering their terrestrial adaptations, their dispersal may have been either facilitated by some ephemeral terrestrial connection or string of large and closely spaced islands or occurred on a natural raft,” the research team said in the same study. Though they have been found across South America, earlier specimens of sebecids are best documented in the south of the continent, while later specimens surfaced in the north and tropical zones. Both the ziphodont teeth and concave vertebrae are found among the fossils found in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, giving them away as sebecids. The locations of the fossils are consistent with the types of environments these carnivores were thought to inhabit as the Eocene gave way to the Oligocene. After they ended up in the Caribbean, the original population of sebecids eventually became isolated as sea levels rose, leaving the sub-populations on islands surrounded by water. The sebecids were apex predators in South America and are thought to have stayed at the top of the food chain in their new hunting grounds. Some sebecid remains have been found with fossils of terrestrial and semiaquatic vertebrates, such as sloths and turtles, that supposedly were their prey. Not only did sebecids get around, but they also lasted 5 million years longer in the Caribbean than they did in South America. This might have been because certain plant and animal species that died out on the mainland continued to survive on the islands. Crocodiles and predatory birds took over as apex predators after the sebecids died out. Even with a mouth full of knives, you can’t be at the top forever.

    "title": "Meta argues enshittification isn’t real in bid to toss FTC monopoly case",
    "article_text": "How many ads is too many? Meta denies ad load harms users in bid to end trial early. Meta thinks there's no reason to carry on with its defense after the Federal Trade Commission closed its monopoly case, and the company has moved to end the trial early by claiming that the FTC utterly failed to prove its case. \"The FTC has no proof that Meta has monopoly power,\" Meta'smotion for judgmentfiled Thursday said, \"and therefore the court should rule in favor of Meta.\" According to Meta, the FTC failed to show evidence that \"the overall quality of Meta’s apps has declined\" or that the company shows too many ads to users. Meta says that's \"fatal\" to the FTC's case that the company wielded monopoly power to pursue more ad revenue while degrading user experience over time (an Internet trend known as \"enshittification\"). And on top of allegedly showing no evidence of \"ad load, privacy, integrity, and features\" degradation on Meta apps, Meta argued there's no precedent for an antitrust claim rooted in this alleged harm. \"Meta knows of no case finding monopoly power based solely on a claimed degradation in product quality, and the FTC has cited none,\" Meta argued. Meta has maintained throughout the trial that its users actually like seeing ads. In the company's recent motion, Meta argued that the FTC provided no insights into what \"the right number of ads\" should be, \"let alone\" provide proof that \"Meta showed more ads\" than it would in a competitive market where users could easily switch services if ad load became overwhelming. Further, Meta argued that the FTC did not show evidence that users sharing friends-and-family content were shown more ads. Meta noted that it \"does not profit by showing more ads to users who do not click on them,\" so it only shows more ads to users who click ads. Meta also insisted that there's \"nothing but speculation\" showing that Instagram or WhatsApp would have been better off or grown into rivals had Meta not acquired them. The company claimed that without Meta's resources, Instagram may have died off. Meta noted that Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom testified that his app was “pretty broken and duct-taped” together, making it \"vulnerable to spam\" before Meta bought it. Rather than enshittification, what Meta did to Instagram could be considered \"a consumer-welfare bonanza,\" Meta argued, while dismissing\"smoking gun\" emailsfrom Mark Zuckerberg discussing buying Instagram to bury it as \"legally irrelevant.\" Dismissing these as \"a few dated emails,\" Meta argued that \"efforts to litigate Mr. Zuckerberg’s state of mind before the acquisition in 2012 are pointless.\" \"What matters is what Meta did,\" Meta argued, which was pump Instagram with resources that allowed it \"to 'thrive'—adding many new features, attracting hundreds of millions and then billions of users, and monetizing with great success.\" In the case of WhatsApp, Meta argued that nobody thinks WhatsApp had any intention to pivot to social media when the founders testified that their goal was to never add social features, preferring to offer a simple, clean messaging app. And Meta disputed any claim that it feared Google might buy WhatsApp as the basis for creating a Facebook rival, arguing that \"the sole Meta witness to (supposedly) learn of Google’s acquisition efforts testified that he did not have that worry.\" The monopoly trial is supposed to run through June, but Meta is hoping that US District Judge James Boasberg will agree that the FTC has failed to make its case and end the trial early. Granting Meta's motion would remove any threat of a breakup of its family of apps while also letting Meta off the hook of raising its defense. This could spare Meta any potential further embarrassment of having its founder's unvarnished internal emails picked apart in public. For Boasberg, it will likely come down to the FTC's market definition alleging that Meta dominates and forecloses rivals in a personal social networking services market that Meta says is a \"fiction.\" If Boasberg buys Meta's argument that TikTok is actually Meta's biggest rival—and not Snap or MeWe—Meta could have an easier time shutting down the case. The FTC has not yet commented on the motion, but the agency was determined to go through with the trial, rejecting areportedly$1 billion settlement offer from Meta. Holding out for $30 billion, the FTC appeared confident in presenting its case, arguing that TikTok—which attracts users broadcasting to strangers—is not a substitute for Meta's apps, which are designed to connect friends and family. The FTC likely expects to see the trial through to the end, when the agency, in a win, will likely try to force Meta to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. That's not necessarily an inevitability in a Meta loss, though. If Boasberg denies Meta's motion, Meta will have to present more evidence and deliver closing arguments before a second phase of the trial would litigate potential remedies.

    "title": "The 2025 VW Tiguan caters to US tastes at an affordable price",
    "article_text": "Starting at $29,495, its bigger but lighter and more efficient than the 2024 model. In the modern era, cars keep getting bigger and bigger between generations. Or at least, they're certainly not getting smaller. That's especially true in America, where bigger is always better and the vehicles in the current crop of \"compact\" crossovers are now nearly as large as full-size SUVs from a decade ago.Don’t ask about curb weights, either, as more powerful drivetrains, including widespread adoption of hybrid-electric components, add significant mass, as highlighted bythe new BMW M5 \"sport sedan.\" Within that fray, however, the new Volkswagen Tiguan stands apart. VW purposefully refined the third-gen Tiguan to cater better to American consumer needs, which meant dropping the third row to create more interior volume for the front and rear seats. The wheelbase still measures the same length at 109.9 inches (2,791 mm), but shorter overhangs mean the overall length actually shrinks by nearly two inches. Yet more efficient packaging on the inside also results in a marginal passenger volume increase of about two percent. To help keep pricing attractive at below $30,000 to start, VW also decided to skip out on a hybrid variant, but the new EA888evo5 2.0 L turbocharged-four nonetheless delivers more power and improved fuel economy. And all of the above actually contributes to the Tiguan losing weight while evolving from the second to third generation, shaving about 160 lbs (72.5 kg), depending on trim. Volkswagen USA recently invited Ars to join a rainy test drive of the Tiguan’s SE and SEL R-Life trims in Bozeman, Montana. At first glance, the new exterior definitely hews more closely to current crossover trends, which the Tiguan arguably helped to inaugurate back in the late-2000s. There's also a healthy dose of Volkswagen ID.4 design language throughout, especially at the nose. The interior truly steps up to a new level, though. I started out in an almost-base Tiguan SE, which means front-wheel drive and minimal options, not even onboard navigation. Like most buyers, though, I connected my iPhone via Wireless CarPlay, which effectively makes onboard nav obsolete. And the SE’s 12.9-inch touchscreen atop the dash provides all the necessary tech, as premium materials throughout clearly prioritize touchpoints to enhance the impression of quality. From the armrests to dash finishing and CloudTex accents, the textures in all the right places reminded me of the early-2000s, whenVW Group overlord Ferdinand Piëchunderstood how much these little impressions make a big difference, allowing VW to sell economy cars that bested even luxury German marques in terms of perceived quality. One of the highlights—quite literally—is a new \"Atmosphere\" knob at the center of the center console, since the shifter moves to the steering column. This dial controls ambient lighting, entertainment volume, and drive modes simultaneously (or only drive modes) with a click downward. I found the system a little silly and would prefer the knob to adjust the drive modes first, then control in-cabin functions. For the modern buyer who prioritizes ambience over driving dynamics, perhaps adjusting the Atmospheres from Joy to Energetic or Minimal will allow for more personal expression on the daily commute. But out in the Montana hills, that driving experience possibly even exceeded the per-dollar impressiveness of the Tiguan’s interior. The little engine certainly never overwhelms with power, but it steps up to 201 hp (150 kW) versus 184 hp (137 kW) for the outgoing gen, which Volkswagen achieved with new geometry for the variable turbine, revised camshafts, and a new fuel injection system. More importantly, the suspension stands out as the star of the show, with a smooth and confident ride that absorbed Montana’s weather-beaten roads in almost total silence. It even took me a while to notice the unnoticeable: a decided lack of wind noise, which suggests how much aerodynamics potentially played a role in improving the Tiguan’s fuel economy, despite the mild power bump. As usual for modern crossovers, despite sporty aspirations,the electrically assisted steering winds up being fairly dull—other than the moderate amount of torque steer from the SE’s front wheels under hard acceleration, that is. But even as the day transitioned from sunny to rainy and back again, the Pirelli Scorpion Verde all-season tires provided plenty of grip, and the SE’s 19-inch wheels with taller sidewalls probably helped with the suspension compliance, keeping the dampers in the perfect middle zone between firmness and comfort. For more severe weather, every Tiguan trim comes with available 4Motion all-wheel drive as well, which adds $1,500. Stepping up to 4Motion also adds a bit more grunt from the engine, not to compensate for the nearly 250 lbs (110 kg) of additional driveline weight but instead because the AWD-capable transaxle can handle a higher torque rating. Specifically, the 4Motion models step up from 207 lb-ft (153 Nm) of torque to 221 lb-ft (163 Nm), though even in slippery conditions, I discovered the SE with FWD felt faster. VW tuned the little inline-four differently, and the AWD gearbox also has shorter ratios for first through fourth, but a taller final drive results in slightly less pep at lower speeds. I experienced 4Motion in the top-spec SEL R-Line package, which still starts below $40,000 at $39,755 (before a $1,425 destination charge). Alongside the all-wheel drive—and therefore torque bump—the SEL R-Line also comes standard with heated, ventilated, and massaging front seats (and firm massagers at that). American Walnut wood grain for the dash and a 15-inch touchscreen further belie the price point, and the SEL R-Line gets more aggressive drive modes, which translate to further variance in the Atmosphere settings as well. Still, because the 4Motion feels just a smidge slower, for me, a base Tiguan S or SE provides a more compelling combo of features for the money. I’d recommend anyone who wants more power to hold off for the R-Line Turbo coming later this year with 268 hp (213 kW), since Volkswagen perfectly nails the mix of aspirational sportiness, tech connectivity, and compact packaging in this more economical crossover. No longer is the Tiguan simply a European hatchback with the ride height jacked up to satisfy American crossover buyers. Instead, this third generation arrives as a perfect demonstration of market research allowing an OEM to better understand the customer, which results in Volkswagen returning to form in a big way, despite the Tiguan’s small stature.

    "title": "Nintendo says more about how free Switch 2 updates will improve Switch games",
    "article_text": "\"Improved image quality\" and GameShare multiplayer forMario,Zelda, and more. When Nintendo took the wraps off the Switch 2 in early April, it announced thataround a dozen first-party Switch gameswould be getting free updates that would add some Switch 2-specific benefits to older games running on the new console. We could safely assume that these updates wouldn't be as extensive as the $10 and $20 paid upgrade packs for games likeBreath of the WildorKirby and the Forgotten Land, but Nintendo's page didn't initially provide any game-specific details. Earlier this week, Nintendoupdated its support pagewith more game-by-game details about what players of these older games can expect on the new hardware. The baseline improvement for most games is \"improved image quality\" and optimizations for the Switch 2's built-in display, but others include support for GameShare multiplayer, support for the new Joy-Cons' mouse controls, support for HDR TVs, and other tweaks. The most significant of the announced updates are frame rate improvements forPokémon ScarletandViolet, the main-seriesPokémongames released in late 2022. Most latter-day Switch games suffered from frame rate dips here and there, as newer games outstripped the capabilities of a low-power tablet processor that had already been a couple of years old when the Switch launched in 2017. But thePokémonperformance problems were so pervasive and widely commented-upon thatNintendo released a rare apologypromising to improve the game post-release. Subsequent patches helped somewhat but could never deliver a consistently smooth frame rate; perhaps new hardware will finally deliver what software patches couldn't. Here's the full list of first-party Switch games and their improvements. All patches will be available on June 5, the launch date for the Switch 2. Third-party developers will presumably be free to release their own Switch 2-specific updates for Switch games.

    "title": "xAI says an “unauthorized” prompt change caused Grok to focus on “white genocide”",
    "article_text": "Meanwhile, Grok's authorized prompt asks it to \"provide truthful and based insights.\" On Wednesday, the world was a bit perplexed by the Grok LLM's sudden insistence on turning practically every responsetoward the topic of alleged \"white genocide\" in South Africa. xAI now says that odd behavior was the result of \"an unauthorized modification\" to the Grok system prompt—the core set of directions for how the LLM should behave. That prompt modification \"directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic\" and \"violated xAI's internal policies and core values,\" xAIwrote on social media. The code review process in place for such changes was \"circumvented in this incident,\" it continued, without providing further details on how such circumvention could occur. To prevent similar problems from happening in the future, xAI says it has now implemented \"additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can't modify the prompt without review\" as well as putting in place \"a 24/7 monitoring team\" to respond to any widespread issues with Grok's responses. The company's public statement provides no information on which employee (or employees) were involved in the prompt change, nor how exactly they were able to get such unfettered (and initially unnoticed) access to Grok's core behaviors. xAI owner Elon Musk has long been a public proponent of discredited theories regarding the killing of white farmers in South Africa and has publicly sold Grok as \"maximally truth-seeking AI, even if that truth is sometimes at odds with what is politically correct.\" xAI has not responded to a request for additional comment from Ars Technica. To further \"strengthen your trust in Grok as a truth-seeking AI,\" xAI has alsopublished Grok's system prompt on Github for the first time, allowing the public to \"review... and give feedback\" on any future prompt changes. Though versions of the Grok system prompthave leaked in the past, this first official look under the hood shows some interesting insights into the system's inner workings. Grok is specifically pushed to \"provide the shortest answer you can\" unless otherwise instructed, for instance, which is perhaps fitting for an LLM running on a length-limited social network. When analyzing social media posts made by others, Grok is given the somewhat contradictory instructions to \"provide truthfuland based insights[emphasis added], challenging mainstream narratives if necessary, but remain objective.\" Grok is also instructed to incorporate scientific studies and prioritize peer-reviewed data but also to \"be critical of sources to avoid bias.\" Grok's brief \"white genocide\" obsession highlights just how easy it is to heavily twist an LLM's \"default\" behavior with just a few core instructions. Conversational interfaces for LLMs in general are essentially a gnarly hack for systems intended to generate the next likely words to follow strings of input text. Layering a \"helpful assistant\" faux personality on top of that basic functionality, as most LLMs do in some form, can lead to all sorts of unexpected behaviors without careful additional prompting and design. The2,000+ word system prompt for Anthropic's Claude 3.7, for instance, includes entire paragraphs for how to handle specific situations like counting tasks, \"obscure\" knowledge topics, and \"classic puzzles.\" It also includes specific instructions for how to project its own self-image publicly: \"Claude engages with questions about its own consciousness, experience, emotions and so on as open philosophical questions, without claiming certainty either way.\" Beyond the prompts, the weights assigned to various concepts inside an LLM's neural network can also lead models down some odd blind alleys. Last year, for instance, Anthropichighlightedhow forcing Claude to use artificially high weights for neurons associated with the Golden Gate Bridge could lead the model to respond with statements like \"I am the Golden Gate Bridge... my physical form is the iconic bridge itself...\" Incidents like Grok's this week are a good reminder that, despite their compellingly human conversational interfaces, LLMs don't really \"think\" or respond to instructions like humans do. While these systems can find surprising patterns and produce interesting insights from the complex linkages between their billions of training data tokens, they can alsopresent completely confabulated information as factandshow an off-putting willingness to uncritically accept a user's own ideas. Far from being all-knowing oracles, these systems can show biases in their actions that can be much harder to detect than Grok's recent overt \"white genocide\" obsession.

    "title": "Drop Duchy is a deck-building, Tetris-like, Carcassonne-esque puzzler",
    "article_text": "The game layers tile dropping onto worker placement, and stacks up nicely. When my colleague Kyle Orland submittedTetrisweeperfor a list ofArs' favorite 2024 games not from 2024, I told him, essentially: \"Good for you, not for me.\" I'm a pedestrianTetrisplayer, at best, so the idea of managing a whole different game mechanic, while trying to clear lines and prevent stack-ups, sounded like taking a standardized test while baking a three-layer cake. And yet, here I am, sneaking rounds ofDrop Duchy(Steam,Epic, for Windows/Linux via Proton) into lunch breaks, weekend mornings, and other bits of downtime.Drop Duchyis similarly not just aTetris-esque block-dropper. It also has you: Drop Duchyis a quirky game, one that hasn't entirely fused together its various influences without some seams showing. But I keep returning to it, even as it beats me to a pulp on Normal mode, based on decisions I made five rounds ago. It feels like a medium-deep board game, played at triple speed, with someone across the table timing you on how fast you arrange your tiles. Allow me to try to describe what is happening inDrop Duchy,ignoring entirely the idea that there is some kind of plot. You start off with three buildings and your enemy's buildings that you must place, mixed into a pile of terrain (plains and forest to start) inTetris-like shapes. Filling a horizontal line gives you resources (wheat, wood, and stone) from that line but does not clear it. If you build up a big area of plains on your board, you can drop your \"Farm\" piece in the middle, and it converts those plains into richer plains. Put a \"Woodcutter\" into a bunch of forest, and it harvests that wood and turns it into plains. Set down a \"Watchtower,\" and it recruits some archer units for every plains tile in its vicinity, and even more for richer fields. You could drop a Woodcutter next to a Farm and Watchtower, and it would turn the forests into plains, the Farm would turn the plains into fields, and the Watchtower would pick up more units for all those rich fields. That kind of multi-effect combo, resulting from one piece you perfectly placed in the nick of time, is what keeps you coming back toDrop Duchy. The bitter losses come from the other side, like realizing you've leaned too heavily into heavy, halberd-wielding units when the enemy has lots of ranged units that are strong against them. Or that feeling, familiar toTetrisvets, that one hasty decision you made 10 rows back has doomed you to the awkward, slanted pile-up you find yourself in now. Except that lines don't clear inDrop Duchy, and the game's boss battles specifically punish you for running out of good places to put things. There's an upper strategic layer to all the which-square-where action. You choose branching paths on your way to each boss, picking different resources, battles, and trading posts. Every victory has you picking a card for your deck, whether military, production, or, later on, general \"technology\" gains. You upgrade cards using your gathered resources, try to balance or min-max cards toward certain armies or terrains, and try not to lose any one round by too many soldiers. You have a sort of \"overall defense\" life meter, and each loss chips away at it. Run out of money to refill it, and that's the game. Drop Duchyfeels, moment to moment, triumphalist and unfair, but that is its intended rogue-ish nature. Where I see issues with the game beyond that is in the little stuff. The game plays well on a Steam Deck or other handhelds, but if you have any issues with reading small text on a small screen,Drop Duchyis unforgiving. Many of the buildings look very similar, and the icons and text can be quite small. I feel the most for folks with extensiveTetrisexperience and muscle memory.Drop Duchyuses some non-standard pieces, like single, double, and three-square corners. And while line clearing is almost always rewarded, it can also work against you, like if an enemy's fort fits a slot, but also grants it lots of troops from the surrounding terrain. Drop Duchycan sometimes feel unbalanced, sometimes a bit unfair. Its bosses will typically require multiple runs before you figure out the right multi-round strategies. The game's many, many mechanics make this a title where I wouldn't blame someone for running the Tutorial round more than once. But, like golf, home repair, or setting up a server, the few times you get a round, or just a line, perfectly right can erase all the hard lessons you had to endure before. I keep finding things inDrop Duchythat seem impossible to overcome, and then I come right back and try it a different way. I think this title will get a few balance fixes, but even before those, it's a good run.

    "title": "Rocket Report: How is your payload fairing? Poland launches test rocket.",
    "article_text": "No thunder down under. Welcome to Edition 7.44 of the Rocket Report! We had some interesting news on Thursday afternoon from Down Under. As Gilmour Space was preparing for the second launch attempt of its Eris vehicle, as part of the pre-launch preparations, something triggered the payload fairing to deploy. We would love to see some video of that. Please. As always, wewelcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Rotating detonation rocket engine takes flight. On Wednesday, US-based propulsion company Venus Aerospace completed a short flight test of its rotating detonation rocket engine at Spaceport America in New Mexico,Ars reports. It is believed to be the first US-based flight test of an idea that has been discussed academically for decades. The concept has previously been tested in a handful of other countries, but never with a high-thrust engine. Hypersonics on the horizon... The company has only released limited information about the test. The small rocket, powered by the company's 2,000-pound-thrust engine, launched from a rail in New Mexico. The vehicle flew for about half a minute and, as planned, did not break the sound barrier. Governments around the world have been interested in rotating detonation engine technology for a long time because it has the potential to significantly increase fuel efficiency in a variety of applications, from Navy carriers to rocket engines. In the near term, Venus' engine could be used for hypersonic missions. Gilmour Space has a payload fairing mishap. Gilmour Space, a venture-backed startup based in Australia, said this week it was ready to launch a small rocket from its privately owned spaceport on a remote stretch of the country's northeastern coastline,Ars reports. Gilmour's three-stage rocket, named Eris, was prepped for a launch as early as Wednesday, but a ground systems issue delayed an attempt until Thursday US time. And then on Thursday, something odd happened: \"Last night, during final checks, an unexpected issue triggered the rocket’s payload fairing,\"the company saidThursday afternoon, US time. Always more problems to solve... Gilmour, based in Gold Coast, Australia, was founded in 2012 by two brothers, Adam and James Gilmour, who came to the space industry after careers in banking and marketing. Today, Gilmour employs more than 200 people, mostly engineers and technicians. The debut launch of Gilmour's Eris rocket is purely a test flight. Gilmour has tested the rocket's engines and rehearsed the countdown last year, loading propellant and getting within 10 seconds of launch. But Gilmour cautioned in a post on LinkedIn early Wednesday that \"test launches are complex.\" And it confirmed that on Thursday. Now the company will need to source a replacement fairing, which will probably take a while. Is an orbital launch from Argentina imminent? We don't know much about the Argentinian launch company TLON Space, which is developing a (very) small-lift orbital rocket called Aventura 1.According to the company's website, this launch vehicle will be capable of lofting 25 kg to low-Earth orbit.Some sort of flight testtook place two years ago, but the video cuts off after a minute, suggesting that the end of the flight was less than nominal. Maybe, maybe not... Now, a publication called Urgente24reports thatan orbital launch attempt is underway. It is not clear exactly what this means, and details about what is actually happening at the Malacara Spaceport in Argentina are unclear. I could find no other outlets reporting on an imminent launch attempt. So my guess is that nothing will happen soon, but it is something we'll keep an eye on regardless. (Submitted by fedeng.) Poland launches suborbital rocket. Poland has successfully launched a single-stage rocket demonstrator at the Central Air Force Training Ground in Ustka,European Spaceflight reports. The flight was part of a project to develop a three-stage solid-fuel rocket for research payloads. In 2020, the Polish government selected Wojskowe Zakłady Lotnicze No. 1 to lead a consortium developing a three-stage suborbital launch system. Military uses eyed... The Trójstopniowa Rakieta Suborbitalna (TRS) project involves the Military Institute of Armament Technology and Zakład Produkcji Specjalnej Gamrat and is co-financed by the National Center for Research and Development. The goal of the TRS project is to develop a three-stage rocket capable of carrying a 40-kilogram payload to an altitude exceeding 100 kilometres. While the rocket will initially be used to carry research payloads into space, Poland’s Military Institute of Armament Technology has stated that the technology could also be used for the development of anti-aircraft and tactical missiles. Latitude signs MoU to launch microsats. On Wednesday, the French launch firm Latitude announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for the launch of a microsatellite constellation dedicated to storing and processing data directly in orbit. In an emailed news release, Latitude said the \"strategic partnership\" represents a major step forward in strengthening collaborations between UAE and French space companies. That's a lot of launches... Madari Space is developing a constellation of microsatellites (50 to 100 kg), designed as true orbital data centers. Their mission is to store and process data generated on Earth or by other satellites. Latitude plans its first commercial launch with its small-lift Zephyr rocket as early as 2026, with the ambition of reaching a rate of 50 launches per year from 2030. An MoU represents an agreement but not a firm launch contract. China begins launching AI constellation. China launched 12 satellites early Wednesday for an on-orbit computing project led by startup ADA Space and Zhejiang Lab,Space News reports. A Long March 2D rocket lifted off at 12:12 am Eastern on Wednesday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. Commercial company ADA Space released further details, stating that the 12 satellites form the “Three-Body Computing Constellation,” which will directly process data in space rather than on the ground, reducing reliance on ground-based computing infrastructure. Putting the intelligence in space... ADA Space claims the 12 satellites represent the world’s first dedicated orbital computing constellation. This marks a shift from satellites focused solely on sensing or communication to ones that also serve as data processors and AI platforms. The constellation is part of a wider “Star-Compute Program,” a collaboration between ADA Space and Zhejiang Lab, which aims to build a huge on-orbit network of 2,800 satellites. (Submitted by EllPeaTea.) SpaceX pushes booster reuse record further. SpaceX succeeded with launching 28 more Starlink satellites from Florida early Tuesday morning following an overnight scrub the previous night. The Falcon 9 booster, 1067, made a record-breaking 28th flight,Spaceflight Now reports. Booster landings have truly become routine... A little more than eight minutes after liftoff, SpaceX landed B1067 on its drone ship,Just Read the Instructions, which was positioned in the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the Bahamas. This marked the 120th successful landing for this drone ship and the 446th booster landing to date for SpaceX. (Submitted by EllPeaTea.) What happens if Congress actually cancels the SLS rocket? The White House Office of Management and Budget dropped its \"skinny\" budget proposal for the federal government earlier this month, andthe headline newsfor the US space program was the cancellation of three major programs: the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the Lunar Gateway. In a report,Ars answers the questionof what happens to Artemis and NASA's deep space exploration plans if that happens. The most likely answer is that NASA turns to an old but successful playbook: COTS. A market price for the Moon... This stands for Commercial Orbital Transportation System and was created by NASA two decades ago to develop cargo transport systems (eventually, this became SpaceX's Dragon and Northrop's Cygnus spacecraft) for the International Space Station. Since then, NASA has adopted this same model for crew services as well as other commercial programs. Under the COTS model, NASA provides funding and guidance to private companies to develop their own spacecraft, rockets, and services and then buys those at a \"market\" rate. Sources indicate that NASA would go to industry and seek an \"end-to-end\" solution for lunar missions—that is, an integrated plan to launch astronauts from Earth, land them on the Moon, and return them to Earth. Starship nearing its next test flight. SpaceX fired six Raptor engines on the company's next Starship rocket Monday, clearing a major hurdle on the path to launch later this month on a high-stakes test flight to get the private rocket program back on track. SpaceX hasn't officially announced a target launch date, but sources indicate a launch could take place toward the end of next week, prior to Memorial Day weekend,Ars reports. The launch window would open at 6:30 pm local time (7:30 pm EDT; 23:30 UTC). Getting back on track... If everything goes according to plan, Starship is expected to soar into space and fly halfway around the world, targeting a reentry and controlled splashdown into the Indian Ocean. While reusing the first stage is a noteworthy milestone, the next flight is important for another reason. SpaceX's last two Starship test flights ended prematurely when the rocket's upper stage lost power and spun out of control, dropping debris into the sea near the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

    "title": "The top fell off Australia’s first orbital-class rocket, delaying its launch",
    "article_text": "The Australian startup behind the Eris rocket says the rest of the vehicle was undamaged. The payload fairing at the top of Gilmour Space's first Eris rocket was supposed to deploy a few minutes after lifting off from northeastern Australia. Instead, the nose cone fell off the rocket hours before it was supposed to leave the launch pad Thursday. Gilmour, the Australian startup that developed the Eris rocket, announced the setback in a post to the company's social media accounts Thursday. \"During final launch preparations last night, an electrical fault triggered the system that opens the rocket’s nose cone (the payload fairing),\" Gilmourposted on LinkedIn. \"This happened before any fuel was loaded into the vehicle. Most importantly, no one was injured, and early checks show no damage to the rocket or the launch pad.\" Gilmour wasgearing up for a launch attemptfrom a privately owned spaceport in the Australian state of Queensland early Friday, local time (Thursday in the United States). The company's Eris rocket, which was poised for its first test flight, stands about 82 feet (25 meters) tall with its payload fairing intact. It's designed to haul a payload of about 670 pounds (305 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit. While Gilmour didn't release any photos of the accident, a company spokesperson confirmed to Ars that the payload fairing \"deployed\" after the unexpected electrical issue triggered the separation system. Payload fairings are like clamshells that enclose the satellites mounted to the top of their launch vehicle, protecting them from weather on the launch pad and from airflow as the rocket accelerates to supersonic speeds. Once in space, the rocket releases the payload shroud, usually in two halves. There were no satellites aboard the rocket as Gilmour prepared for its first test flight. Payload fairing problems have caused anumber of rocket failures, usually because they don't jettison during launch, or only partially deploy, leaving too much extra weight on the launch vehicle for it to reach orbit. Gilmour said it is postponing the Eris launch campaign \"to fully understand what happened and make any necessary updates.\" The company was founded by two brothers—Adam and James Gilmour—in 2012, and has raised approximately $90 million from venture capital firms and government funds to get the first Eris rocket to the launch pad. The Eris rocket was aiming to become the first all-Australian launcher to reach orbit. Australia hosted a handful of satellite launches by US and British rockets more than 50 years ago. Gilmour is headquartered in Gold Coast, Australia, about 600 miles south of the Eris launch pad near the coastal town of Bowen. In a statement, Gilmour said it has a replacement payload fairing in its factory in Gold Coast. The company will send it to the launch site and install it on the Eris rocket after a \"full investigation\" into the cause of the premature fairing deployment. \"While we’re disappointed by the delay, our team is already working on a solution and we expect to be back at the pad soon,\" Gilmour said. Officials did not say how long it might take to investigate the problem, correct it, and fit a new nose cone on the Eris rocket. This setback follows more than a year of delays Gilmour blamed primarily on holdups in receiving regulatory approval for the launch from the Australian government. Like many rocket companies have done before, Gilmour set modest expectations for the first test flight of Eris. While the rocket has everything needed to fly to low-Earth orbit, officials said they were looking for just 10 to 20 seconds of stable flight on the first launch, enough to gather data about the performance of the rocket and its unconventional hybrid propulsion system.

    "title": "Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary Brings Cartoony Chaos to This Summer’s Celebration",
    "article_text": "Disneyland is turning 70 this summer, and festivities begin this weekend at Walt Disney’s first theme park. While past anniversaries emphasized a throwback to opening day nostalgia, this milestone wants to bring the party energy like no other. Thankfully, that doesn’t mean turning the castle into a Birthday cake, but the zany fun comes in the form of mix-taping the greatest hits with the latest number ones from the studio. After attending the media week preview at the Disneyland Resort, that’s what we loved about this year’s theme. The unabashed excitement for so many characters, from the fairytale Disney Princesses,The MuppetsandStar Warsicons to the niche likeDuffy the Disney BearandA Goofy Movie.There were also incredible moments as well, including new Pixar and Disney animation favesInside Out, Turning Red, EncantoandMoanaall overthe resort’s 70th offerings.It’s certainly celebration of cartoon chaos and we welcome Robot Walt’s imminent arrival in July to coincide with the actual anniversary of the opening date of the park. Some of the best things we found at the event were discovered on their own. When I wandered around Disney California Adventure I stumbled upon the most unhinged Disneyland 70 merchandise. And it confirmed that Disney really got all of its various types of fans when I looked upon the face of an official googly-eyed Mickey Mouse shirt, and a spinner-top colorful baseball cap. Yes, there’s the glam Loungefly Minnie ears and purses and Disney trendy lifestyle spirit jerseys, but the zany and bizarre get representation too. What’s hilarious is that those items weren’t made with meme comedy in mind, but actually straight from the Disney Vault of yester-merchandise. And just across the way at the Animation building, a new set of visuals debuted in the musical lobby which highlighted added moments fromCoco, Moana, Encanto,The Princess and the Frog, andZootopia. When I need a time to just bask in the magic of animation while staying out of the heat, this is where I (like so many others) go, and it’s such an underrated gem that rarely gets a refreshânot since the release ofFrozen!Â And theEncantorepresentation at DCA didn’t stop thereâwhile we love “We Don’t Talk About Bruno”, I’m glad to get a break from it to let the other amazing songs shine. In the newWorld of Color: Happiness, Anxiety fromInside Out 2(my rising sun sign of the emotions) presents a great sequence where Luisa’s “Surface Pressure” gets a moment on the water, and it was so cool to hear everyone sing along. Hot take: it’s the better song between it and Bruno. The Muppets opener for the show is an all-timer, too, with a muppety death defying act from Gonzo the Great. View this post on Instagram World of Color: Happinessalso finally featured a kaiju-sized Panda Mei on the mist screen projections set to “Nobody Like You” which led into the best in-universe run of real fake Disney pop hits, right into a Powerline moment from “A Goofy Movie”. The beat drop on “I2I” sent the crowds into a frenzy as Powerline electrified the stage like we were really at the show with the Goofs. We are loving the Max Goof inclusion too, as he joins his dad over at Disneyland for the Celebrate Happy Character Calvacade parade, right behind Duffy and ShellieMay Bear leading the way. I know they’re tossing around all the different nomenclatures around “Happy”, but this was for those of us who are into the offbeat or niche things of the Disney fandom. ForStar Warsfans, there’s even a new R2 unit available at Droid Depot, with exteriors to match the pinks, purples, blues and yellow of the 70th. And we also took a peek at the new scrap pieces that debuted earlier this month for May the Fourth atSavi’s lightsaber build experience. The ombre chrome look of the blaster emitter is a fierce need. Unfortunately, these pieces aren’t individually available for those who have already built their lightsabers for over 200 bucksâif you want to cop these parts you’ll have to try to get in on the limited time action with another whopping purchase before they’re gone. Paint the Night, the rave-inspired answer to the Electrical Parade is back and we got to see it near the Small World promenade with a special new projection show on the ride’s facade. Spooky and bizarro Disney lore fiends got a treat here with a fun Grim-Grinning Ghosts montage right into “Hellfire” from The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Mr. Toad crazy eyes, the crone Evil Queen and Frollo giving children some gateway frightful imagery that they’ll obsess over later in life. At the end of my second night, it capped off withWondrous Journeyswhich takes the pages of countless animation cells and brings them to life on the Disneyland Castle walls showcasing the stories that have spoken to generations for 100 years. It really does feel like Disney wanted to reach far and wide for the park’s big anniversary this yearâand not be afraid to get a little zany in the process. Want more io9 news?

Finally, having the limitlessly talented Brie Larson as our star sets upFail-Safeto be that rare horror film that makes you laugh, feel, and care, before taking you on an absolutely wild ride.â The film is currently being shopped on the market at the Cannes Film Festival, so expect some distributor to pick it up and help it get made, especially with that level of talent behind it. Larson and Abrams kind of speak for themselves. One is the Oscar-winning darling who turned an incredible, low-key career starring in incredible movies likeShort Term 12andScott Pilgrim vs. the Worldinto a superheroic one, with her role asCaptain Marveland more. Abrams is the only person to ever direct aStar Trekand aStar Warsmovie and has helped create some of the most beloved TV shows of a generation, likeLost, Alias and Felicity. Those two together are awesome on their own but really it’s Mollner and Duffield that bring this together. Mollner has only directed two features but his most recent one,Strange Darling, was a genre festival darling, gaining praise and shock at each and every screening that took place. Duffield recently wrote and directedNo One Will Save You, the stellar sci-fi starring Kaitlyn Dever, and previously directed the hilarious and over the top,Spontaneous. They are some of our best talents in the genre space and, to have them under the wing of J.J. Abrams, with Larson at the heart of this very intriguing movie, is awesome.

    "title": "The Future of ‘Doctor Who’ Might Continue With or Without Disney",
    "article_text": "AsÂDoctor Whoprepared to returnfor its latest season, rumors swirled that it would be a make-or-break moment for the show, as threats of Disney terminatingits funding dealfor the series and evenoutright cancellation loomed. But while we’re not quite at the point of finding out what Disney’s stake inDoctor Who‘s future might be, a new report suggests that the end is far from nigh for the Time Lord regardless. A new report from British tabloidThe Daily Mirrorsuggests that, despite recent reports thatÂDoctor Whocould be cancelled, or at the least go on an extend hiatus, plans are in place for the series to continue regardless of whatever decision Disney makes about its co-funding deal to distribute the series on Disney+ internationally. Disney executives,while speaking positivelyabout its support of the show, have also previously stated that any further continuation of the co-funding deal wouldonly be madeafter reviewingDoctor Who‘s ratingswith the conclusion of the current season. According to The Mirror, whether or not Disney renews the deal,ÂDoctor Whowill take a break in 2026 and return to screens in 2027 (whether or not that will see Ncuti Gatwa bow out as the Doctor in the process remains to be seen), with thespinoff UNIT seriesÂTheWar Between Land and Seaset to fill theÂ gap forWhofans next year. The tabloid further suggests that Russell T Davies willcarry on as showrunner, with scripts currently in the works for at least two more seasons. Whether or not Disney renews its funding support may also not have as great an impact onÂDoctor Whoitself, either. The Mirror’s report suggests that much of the approximately roughly â¤10 million of funding per episode was spent on the technical cost of improvingÂDoctor Who‘s visual effects for streaming in 4K quality, something the series would be able to cut back on if it returned to being solely funded by the BBC, which streams high-definition programming at 2K. With just three episodes left of the current series to broadcast, more definitive information on the future ofÂDoctor Whois no doubt coming soon. But at least at the moment fans can breathe a sigh of relief that thingsÂmaynot be as dire as they potentially seemed earlier this year. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Ozempic-Maker CEO Ousted Over Pharma Company’s Rocky Market Downturn",
    "article_text": "In an abrupt and surprising twist, the CEO ofOzempic-makerNovo Nordisk has been ousted from his position as the head of the company. The Danish pharmaceutical giant announced Friday that, amidst a recent downturn in the company’s stock, Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen would soon be stepping down as its top executive and the board would seek a successor for him. “As per mutual agreement with the Novo Nordisk Board, Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen will step down from his role as CEO of Novo Nordisk,” the company said, in a press release. “He will continue as CEO for a period to support a smooth transition to new leadership.” It surely seems odd that Novo Nordisk isn’t doing too well. After all, it’s the company behind a breakthrough drug, semaglutide, that can make seemingly anyoneâfromJim Gaffigan to Oprahâshed pounds instantly. Still, while Ozempic and Wegovy have secured status as global household names, Novo Nordisk’s stock price has seen asignificant downturnover the past year, ascompetitor brandshave crept into the market. In its statement on Jorgensen’s ousting, the pharmaceutical company notes that the swiftly changing landscape for weight loss products is what has led to the shakeup in company leadership. “The changes are made in light of the recent market challenges Novo Nordisk has been facing, and the development of the company’s share price since mid-2024,” thepress releasefrom the company reads. It also notes, however, that Jorgensen managed to shepherd the company into steadily better economic waters for the better part of a decade before market troubles hit in 2024: “During his eight-year tenure as CEO, Novo Nordiskâs sales, profits and share price have almost tripled,” the company writes. “Considering the recent market challenges, the share price decline, and the wish from the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Novo Nordisk Board and Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen have jointly concluded that initiating a CEO succession is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.” Gizmodo reached out to Novo Nordisk for more information and will update this story if it responds.

Scientists are continuing to find evidence that GLP-1 medications can temper cravings for alcohol and other drugs. Semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs are poised to become frontline treatments for a severe form of liver disease. New research finds that ER visits related to semaglutide use might be on the rise. Even the solid proposals set out by the Trump administration are being undermined by its actions taken elsewhere. A recent survey reveals the foods that people are less likely to eat once they start taking GLP-1 medications like Ozempic.

    "title": "The 20 Greatest Moments From ‘Andor’ Season 2",
    "article_text": "Andorseason 2came to an endthis week, putting an end to Cassian’s chapters of the Skywalker saga and bringing about one of the greatest additions toÂStar Wars‘ modern era. Across four arcs jumping us closer and closer to thetime ofÂRogue One, the season delivered some of the bestÂStar Warshas had to offerâwhich made looking back on the season to collect what was the very best of the best joyous and painful in equal measure. But considering we can’t just say“all of it”, here’s our pick for 20 of the highest highlights fromAndor‘s long goodbye. Andorso rarely allows itself a big damn hero action setpieceâaction is, more often than not, the terrifying climax of tense release, from the Narkina 5 prison riot to the Imperial oppression on Ferrix and Ghorman. But season 2 opens with a wonderful little display to give us a Cassian who has smoothly settled into his part as a Rebel agent, infiltrating Imperial ship research facilities on Sienar to swipe a prototype TIE (one with a fun Expanded Universe legacy). And then, just to knock him down a peg, it has him alertÂall the guards he canby accidentally backing it into a wall while he figures out the controls. Can’t let him getÂtoosmooth. Krennic’s Imperial meeting room to reveal his plans for the planet of Ghorman is already a delicious example of how the Empire controls and abuses people on various fronts, but really, the reason this scene is so good is Ben Mendelsohn justÂrelishingbeing back in Krennic’s white cape. This is Krennic on the precipice of completing everything he’s ever wanted, and all he needs is one more thing: Kalkite. Deep, substrate,foliatedkalkite, to be specific. It’s just a joy to watch Medelsohn dance around like he’s top dog as he practically chews every word in the scene. Krennic’s just enjoying being in the spotlight as he lays out how this room of top Imperial brass, from the ISB to propaganda divisions to the navy, is going to help him achieve it. There is already so much going on asÂAndorhits you with the reveal that Dedra and Syril have started seeing each other, and the relationship is as weirdly charged as you could’ve imagined. But in witnessing a slice of their bizzaro domesticity, we get the diva-off fans could only have dreamed off: a dinner at home with Syril’s mother Eedy, which leads to a stern Dedra turning the tables and making very clear who is wearing the immaculately-ironed pants in this relationship. As the eye of Imperial oppression looms ever further over Mina-Rau, we see the true evils the Empire’s power manifests as in a shocking first forÂStar Wars, an attempted rape, explicitly named as such, when one of the inspection officers corners Bix and goes to assault her. It’s gutwrenching to watch, and one of the most tense fight sequences we’ve ever got inStar Wars, even as we get to see Bix triumph over her would-be abuser. It’s a powerful moment, and a chilling way to make the Empire’s abusive rot come to the forefront. The sequence of Mon Mothma’s crashout at Leida’s wedding has a bunch of layers to itâthe tacit realisation from her that Luthen is willing to kill anyone he needs to to protect her, Cinta and Vel’s distant connection as the latter realises the former’s there to do Luthen’s dirty work, it all climaxing with Cassian coming just too late to save Brasso on Mina-Rau. But tying that all into thehypnotic, almost delirious sequenceof Mon walking away from her conversation with Luthen to just give herself a moment to be lost in the crowd of dancing, exhilarated partygoers, swaying to the thrumming electro beats of thatÂbangerof a track… it’s a beautiful way to climax the first act. As a nice mirror to his infiltration on Sienar, when Luthen first sends Cassian to Ghormanâa planet known for its exports of fashionâwe get to see him do a bit of classic spywork and really dress to play the part, masquerading as designer Varian Skye to set up a meeting with the Ghorman resistance. It’s aÂverycool look (those shades!), but it’s also another way we get to see Cassian play his charm offensive, swaggering around with the confidence of a classy elite before he really makes clear to the Front just how much more prepared for this kind of thing he is compared to them. Syril’s infiltration of the discontent Ghormans and ‘Varian’s’ arrival on the planet reveals a wonderful bit of layering toÂStar Warscontinuity: the massacre we’ve all known was coming this season wasn’t the first on Ghorman, there was one that took place years prior under the watch of Wilhuff Tarkin. It is, of course, a nod to the Expanded Universe’s original Ghorman Massacre, butÂAndor‘s choice to not just thrown in a nod to that version of events, butsynthesize into its own historyas further commentary on the Empire is a brilliant way to have an easter egg mention otherwise have some real dramatic heft. Andor‘s second season is somehow even more tense than the first a lot of the times, and one of its best moments just layers on that tension thick: Kleya recruiting Lonni at a party hosted by Davro Sculden so she can successfully remove a listening device from an antique Luthen sold to the Chandrilan magnate before it’s discovered. There’s so much at play, not just as Kleya struggles to manage both her own nerves and Lonni’s as she struggles to free the device: they’re interrupted by Krennic and more ISB bigwigs being toured around by Sculden, whoÂthenbring up Luthen, Perrin, and Mon Mothma. The butting of heads between Senator and Director, the will-they-won’t they of just who might get ratted out in this moment it’s all deliciously done. The tragic, suddendeath of Cintaafter she and Vel are also sent to Ghorman on Luthen’s behalf is one of season 2’s most delicate moments, but after the initial shock of her catching a stray blaster bolt from the unseasoned Front member Samm, what really twists the knife in is Vel’s reaction afterwards. Not content to leave the distraught young man be, Vel takes all her pain and pushes it into a terrifying warning for Samm that what he’s done, the life he’s unjustly destroyed, will haunt him for the rest of his life. A harsher punishment than if she’d lashed out or tried to hurt him in turn. Saw makes a compelling case for why so many are willing to follow him in a brilliant, charismatic scene with Wilmon after the Partisans use the young man’s technical skills to successfully steal a load of highly volatile starship fuel. Inviting Wil to huff the toxic fumes as he has taken toâa predilection that we know will eventually leave Saw’s body broken down even further byÂRogue One.Saw’s loving odeto Rhydonium as the symbol of everything his fight against the Empire stands for is equal parts rousing and heartbreaking. Admitting that he’s long exchanged his life and his sanity for what he has to do to resist the evil of the Empire, in that moment Saw truly becomes the charismatic leader we’ve been told he is, consequences be damned. Andorhas largely drawn itself to other forms of spirituality than the Force up to his point, but Cassian’s brief encounter with a mysterious healer at the Yavin base is a wonderful way to bringÂStar Wars‘ core mysticism into the fold. It’s treated with a sense of weight and trepidation in equal bearing, as the healer offers a portent of Cassian’s importance to the skeptical man and an awestruck Bix. If so much ofÂStar Warsis going to play with the idea of destiny and fate, this was a clever, beautiful way to bring in the inevitability of the events ofRogue Oneinto the narrative ofÂAndor. The explosion of the protests on Ghorman into a full-on Imperial massacre is one of the most chilling sequences in contemporaryÂStar Wars. A brilliant mirror to the climax of season 1 and the riots on Ferrix being putdown by the Imperials, the Ghorman Massacre not only becomes bigger from an action standpoint, but thematically denser and richer as it weaves in Syril realisingÂjusttoo late that everything Dedra was working him for was a horror on a scale unlike anything he could’ve comprehended. It’s also so brutal and horrible to watch, and that’s even before you get to… Ah, whata perfect endto Syril Karn. From the moment he spots Cassian among the screaming masses being slaughtered on the plaza, to the moment a confounded Cassian hits him with the question that’s haunted his whole life, Syril’s final moments are a brilliant exploration of what has made his character so compelling, a deft commentary on how the Imperial machine craves young, impressionable men like him, only to forge them into useful, evil tools that can be discarded at a moment’s notice. A fitting end to one of the show’s best characters. We don’t get to hear the full version, but we hear enough of Mon’s rousing denouncement of the Ghorman Massacre to matter, as does the galaxy, as she finally lets her rebellion step into the sunlight for all to see. It’s already potent for the moment it represents inÂStar Wars, but it’s a profound step forÂ the franchise’s relationship with its own political history, with the explicit invocation of Empire’s actions as genocide. It’s always been the endeavour of the foolhardy to obfuscateStar Wars‘ political message, but this was the franchise shouting it for all to hear in a way you can’t ignore. Andorhas layered all sorts of connective tissue to the wider world ofÂStar Warsacross its story, but in making Mon Mothma a central figure of its story, it was always going to be running headlong towards another series almost as inevitably as it wasRogue One: her flight from Coruscant to Dantooine as depicted inÂStar Wars Rebels, to make the formal declaration of the Rebel Alliance. HowÂAndorhandles that is subtle, but fascinating, climaxing Mon and Cassian’s flight from the Senate with a moment of realization for the latter, and just how much this wider Rebellion is going to distance itself from the part that raised Cassian up: the story of Cassian’s extraction will be handed off to a more proper Yavin escort, the story told in a cleaner, more palatable way. It is by no means a knock toÂRebels, but it’s a brilliant way to bridge those two stories. It’s unfair to practically assign an entire episode of prestige television as a best ‘moment’, but christ, that’s kind of what “Make It Stop” ends up being. From Dedra cornering Axis at last, to Kleya’s one-woman infiltration mission to send Luthen on his way after he mortally wounded himself rather than give up the Rebellion, it’s an incredible farewell to one ofÂAndor‘s core characters, while passing on his legacy to the next generation, woven throughout a brilliant exploration of their history together.ÂAndor‘s got a lot of finest hours in its two seasons, but this is the finest among them. Not to pick a moment within the above moment, but it would be remiss to not point out the moment Dedra’s obsession and ambition finally lays her low. The moment of terror as she realizes Krennic has come to bludgeon the systems she has upheld against her for hoarding all the little scraps of information that lead to word of the Death Star making it out to Luthen is incredibly played by Denise Gough, and Mendelsohn again manages to balance the delectably scene-chewing bravado of Krennic with a genuine menace. Getting tohear Nemik’s manifestoone more time might have been enough to mark this as a best moment, but the way it’s deployed isÂincrediblyÂsatisfying: one of the last things ISB head Major Partagaz hears, as he prepares to kill himself rather than face comeuppance for the ISB’s failures is an unknown voice of rebellion that’s echoing across the galaxy. His final admittance that the “disease” he sought to contain has come to choke him is a fitting end. One of the first thingsÂAndorset up was Cassian’s search for his long lost sister, and in an age whereÂStar Warsis more broadly obsessed with filling in as many details it can about its world and its characters, the fact that the show largely moved on from the “mystery” became something of a sticking point for some fans.ÂAndorseason 2 doesn’t give us an answer eitherâor rather, perhaps not one that would satisfy that need for cold, hard facts. One of the last things we see Cassian do in the whole show is wake up from a brief dream of his sister, and it’s all we really need to know: that he still thought of her, even right up to the very end, even if neither he or we got the answer. Regardless of the controversy around Bix’s arc in season 2, the very last scenes of the series climaxing with her living a life of peace on Mina-Rau are a potent, hopeful note to end the series on. A series that was always barrelling towards the tragic sacrifice of its titular character instead ends on the revelation that the legacy he loved and shared with Bix will live on into a new generation, one that, at least for a while, will get to eventually come of age in a galaxy at peace.

    "article_text": "Two of your most anticipated animated movies have been delayed.The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender,the new film directed by Lauren Montgomery and William Mata, was supposed to be out on January 30, 2026, but has now been pushed back to October 9, 2026. Plus, the sequel to the incredibleTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, originallyscheduled for that October date, has been delayed an entire year. It’ll now be out on September 17, 2027. But don’t worry, Paramount helped those bitter pills go down by announcingPaw Patrol: The Dino Moviehas been moved up a week. It’ll now come out July 24, 2026. All this is fromThe Hollywood Reporter,which cites “delays in animation physical production.” Basically, the filmmakers need more time. That’s always the silver lining with delays like this.

And yet it’s still frustrating, especially for fans ofMutant Mayhemwho have a movie to look at as a standard. That’s not something you can say for a theatrical, animatedAirbenderfilm. Though based on all iterations of the show, expectations are probably even higher. There’s no word on anyone new involved withMutant Mayhem 2.It’s just expected to bring back everyone fromthe first movie such as director Jeff Rowe.The Legend of Angwill feature the voices of Dave Bautista, Eric Nam, Dionne Quan, Jessica Matten, RomÃ¡n Zaragoza and Steven Yeun.

    "title": "Promise to Kill DEI, and Trump’s FCC Will Approve Anything",
    "article_text": "Any time a major acquisition occurs, it’s standard for regulatory agencies to want to secure some promises before giving it the green light. Verizon’s recentlyapprovedpurchase of Frontier Communications for $20 billion is no exception, but the concessions that Brendan Carr, Donald Trump’s pick to head the Federal Communications Commission, was able to secure are a little… different. Carr gave the green light to consolidate the industry once Verizon promised it would stop caring about workforce diversity. In astatementannouncing approval of the merger, which will see Verizon take over Frontier’s million broadband subscribers and its sizable fiber optic network, Carr revealed that his support came after Verizon “committed to ending DEI-related practices.” DEI programs have been something of a bugaboo for Carr ever since he took over the agency, as it has for basically every part of the Trump administration. One of Carr’s early actions as head of the regulatory agency was tolaunch a probeinto Verizon’s diversity, equity, and inclusion polices. In aletterannouncing the investigation, Carr explicitly tied the whole ordeal to Verizon’s then-ongoing attempt to acquire Frontier. “In order to aid the FCC’s resolution of these matters, please reach out to the agency personnel that have been working on Verizon’s pending transactions at the FCC,” he wrote. “They are the FCC personnel most familiar with Verizon’s operations due to their merger review activity.” While Carr didn’t outright say “promise to kill off your DEI initiatives and we’ll push this thing through,” that does seem to be what happened. He did make it clear in aninterview with Bloombergthat this was going to be his M.O. âAny businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of DEI discrimination,â Carr he told the publication in March. Verizon isn’t the only company to get what it wants by agreeing to axe DEI programs. T-Mobile was able to get a deal with fiber provider Lumos approved by the FCC after itgot rid of a page on its websitepromoting its DEI efforts. Paramount, which is in the process of trying to complete a merger with Skydance and needs FCC sign-off,told staff it would end its own DEI policiesin order to acquiesce to the demands of the Trump administration. So, if you have any business in front of the Trump administration, don’t worry about whether your deal might result in market consolidation that may ultimately harm consumers. No one is looking into any of that. Just make sure you are willing to hire some white guys so people like Brendan Carr can finally see people who look like him working in these industries. deiFCCVerizon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Oregon Safari Park Reportedly Starved Lions and Left Dead Tiger in Freezer",
    "article_text": "State police raided West Coast Game Park Safari in Bendon, Oregon, on Thursday, as the roadside zoo faces allegations of animal mistreatment and neglect. Years of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports havefoundthat the parkâs more than 450 animals live in shocking conditions, citing a dead tiger kept in a freezer for months, starving lions and leopards, rodent infestations, and other serious concerns. The reports detail dozens of violationsâmany of which were repeat violationsâwithin the past year alone. During the most recent federal inspection on April 1, officials observed two lions and a black African leopard with decreased muscle mass, âwith hips, ribs and spine prominently displayed under the skin.â The inspectors also cited stark health and safety issues, including feeding bins and storage areas contaminated with rodent feces. A March 18 inspection revealed âmassiveâ amounts of metal, piles of rotting hay, food waste, and other debris surrounding a hay storage barn and an enclosure. On January 22, investigators discovered a deceased tiger in a freezer with ânumerous frozen turkeys laying on top of it.â âThe turkeys are being fed to the zoo animals,â the report states. âThe facility representative stated that the tiger has been in the freezer with the food for several months.â The animals arenât the only ones being put in harmâs way. In 2023, inspectors cited the park for a “critical violation” after photos posted to social media showed visitors petting a jaguar and a Syrian brown bearâboth old enough and large enough to endanger people. USDA reports detailing these and other concerns go back a decade. Oregon State Police (OSP) officers served multiple search warrants when they arrived on scene Thursday morning, according to astatement. These warrants âare the result of a lengthy criminal investigation into the facilityâs operations.â âIt … came to a point where we needed more information and that was only going to come from actually assessing the condition of the park, and so thatâs where the warrants came in and thatâs what weâre here to do,â OSP Captain Kyle Kennedytoldlocal NBC station KOBI5. Kennedy said his department started receiving complaints about the conditions of the park from local residents and nonprofits months ago. OSP is conducting the investigation alongside Coos County law enforcement and several other state agencies, including the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Gizmodo reached out to West Coast Game Park Safari for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication. Established in 1968, this roadside zoo offers âup close and personal interactionâ with 75 different animal species, according to itswebsite. In 1985, then-owner Bob Tenneytoldthe Eugene Register that the park draws 60,000 visitors per year, though itâs unclear how popular it is today. Animal welfare advocates have long scrutinized roadside zoos. Tigers in America, a group that rescues and relocates tigers from âabusiveâ facilities,estimatesthere are more than 3,000 of them across 44 states. The Animal Legal Defense Fundclaimsthese tourist attractions frequently force animals to live in small, dirty cages, fail to adequately feed them, deny them medical care, and do not provide them with adequate mental stimulation. The investigation into West Coast Game Park Safari is ongoing, and the park is currently closed to visitors. Authorities have yet to announce any arrests or plans for the animals at the zoo. animal crueltyusdaZoos Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "How ‘Final Destination Bloodlines’ Went From Typical Sequel to the Franchise’s Best Installment",
    "article_text": "Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein were dying to makeFinal Destination Bloodlines, and we mean more seriously than you think. When the directing partners pitched their take on the film over Zoom, they created an illusion where, during the pitch, each was “killed” in a wild,Final Destinationway. It was the spark that got them the job, and now their film is finally here. That type of innovation is to be expected from the duo, who first met as contestants on the Steven Spielberg-produced reality showOn the Lot.They didn’t win, but they became friends and have since been working their way up in the industry. Since then, they’ve made films in theDead RisingandLeprechaunfranchises,an excellent subtle superhero movie calledFreaks, and even theDisney filmKim Possible. But now, finally,almost 20 years after meeting, Lipovsky and Stein have their first big Hollywood release. And something tells us it won’t be their last. io9 spoke to the directors in Los Angeles last week about their long journey through Hollywood. We broke down what they were most excited about in theFinal Destinationfranchise,whatSpider-Man: No Way Homedirector Jon Watts had to do with it all, and, most importantly, some of the ways they tookBloodlinesfrom a sequel that could have been easily dismissedâand turned it into what we think is the series’ best yet. Note: There are a few minor spoilers throughout the interview, especially regarding the opening and overall themes of the movie. If you’re worried, come back after you see the film. Germain Lussier, io9: The first time I heard about you guys wasOn the Lotin 2007. Adam Stein:That’s where we met. io9: [Laughs] Yes, thatâs true. Youâve made a lot of cool stuff since then. But if you guys now could talk to those guys then and say it’ll take almost 20 years to get our first big theatrical release, what would they have said? Stein:[Laughs] You know, it has been such a roller coaster navigating the industry. But it’s been amazing that we have gotten to do it together. It’s a really hard thing to try to become a director in Hollywood. And so to have your best friend there with you to bounce ideas off of and commiserate with along the way has really beenâwe’ve been so lucky to have that. But I would say for people who are out there, who are in the struggle themselves, it takes a lot of perseverance, it takes a lot of resilience. Zack Lipovsky:But also those ups and downs are the lessons you need to learn. Like, we couldn’t have made this movie if someone had handed it to us 20 years ago. We didn’t have the wisdom or the experience that you get from things falling apart, and failures, and trying things that don’t work, and making movies that aren’t good. And all those types of things that you have to do to kind of hone your craft and get there. io9: Tell me about the conversations you guys had when you found out this was available. I’ve heard all about the Zoom, which is so cool and Iâm mad it doesn’t exist somewhere. [Both laugh] But tell me about even before thatâlike when you said, “My God,Final Destination 6, letâs pitch on it and figure it out.” Lipovsky:Well, I think actually the first gut reaction was, “How are they gonna make another one, because the end of five isperfect.” Right? So, “Really? They’re gonna make another one? Like what could they possibly do?” And then we started to hear this idea that Jon Watts had come up with about making the movie about a family. Starting it with the origin of this family and death is coming for this bloodline. And how much that would enrich all the relationships and the stakes and all those types of things. That really made us start to lean in and go, “Okay, that’s pretty interesting.” And then from there, [we] started to work on the process of getting hired. And then, a many-year process of working with the writers and the team to just kind of bring that inherent new idea through the movie in a way to make it feel more fresh and surprising. io9: Right, the first time I heard about this,it was like “Jon Watts is doing it.”And obviously he came up with kind of the kernel idea. But how much was actually in place when you guys came on board, and how much were you able to make it your own? Stein:They had done one draft of the script based on Jon’s idea when we first got involved. And the core of it was there. The idea of the opening would take place with Iris, I think it was the 1950s originally? But in the past, and then flash forward to her granddaughter. That was there. The details of who each person was, what all the death scenes were, completely changed over the course of two years of us being involved. But the core thing of it being a family that was fractured, that then could come together in a way, even as death was chasing them. That got us really excited. That was present in the original. io9: Iâll come back to some more of that soon but just as guys who are film fans, filmmakers, film nerds, what was the most exciting thing about the freedom of, presumably having your biggest budget? Besides the food. Everyone says the food. Lipovsky:We never had time to eat food. [Laughs] I think for us, it’s working with the caliber of crew that we had. You’re suddenly working with some of the best people at their craft in the world. You have the most incredible stunt people, special effects people, makeup effects people, and incredible actors. All the toys you’ve ever wanted. You can be like, âI really need this very special lens for this one shot I want to do.â You have it. So that, as a filmmaker, is just so much fun. Now, of course, you never have enough time or money. Because as soon as you start going, âOh we could do that too, and do this,â you max out all the ability. Stein:You build a 120-foot set, surrounded by a volume, and light it on fire, well, that costs a lot. [All laugh.] But I think as filmmakers, the thing that we really got a kick out of isFinal Destination, what makes it special as a horror franchise, is that there’s no personified villain coming for the characters. There’s no guy with a knife and a mask. What comes for the characters is the filmmaking. It’s these close-up, insert shots connected to other shots that build this mouse trap in the perfect, suspenseful way. It’s really like the directors are coming for the characters. So that was so much fun to kind of relish that experience. io9: Speaking of the effects, just knowing you guys, I know wanted to do practical as much as you can. So talk about when you’re coming up with the death scenes, when, you know, “Okay, this is as far as we can push the practical, and then we have to kind of finish it off with digital.” Lipovsky:Yeah, we call it “the Guillermo del Toro school of filmmaking” where you do as much as you can practically, knowing that visual effects can help with the magic trick. And then the visual effects are really removing the things that are supporting the practical element. So we have a practical body or a practical set or something like that, or even people with a whole bunch of green rods and blue screens and things around it that are making it so that that practical thing can happen right at the center of frame. And then you use the visual effects to extend the set or erase the rod or do those things so that it really becomes hard to tell at which point what’s real and what isn’t. So there’s always something real there. And then the visual effects just kind of make it magical and kind of impossible. We try to do that whenever possible. Even there’s people falling through the dance floor and they’re falling and grabbing onto things dropping 40 feet, they’re [actually] falling through a dance floor and grabbing onto things, dropping 40 feet. But then everything around them is extended and kind of beautifully done by the visual effects team. But at the heart of it, we always just wanted something real. Stein:To give you another example, there’s a character that gets torn apart in the opening sequence. And there was a full-size mannequin body of this person with puppeteers that rip it in pieces, but then you erase the puppeteers. But the real thing you’re looking at really happened. io9: What sequence changed the most during either pre-production or editing as you were thinking about the balance of the practical and digital? Lipovsky:I think one sequence that changed dramatically was what became the backyard barbecue scene, which is a really great scene. It actually started as a kids’ play place, Chuck E. Cheese-type set piece with bumper cars and bowling and all that crazy stuff. But we kind of ultimately realized that the core of these movies, especially this movie, was family, and also very relatable things. And so by making it a barbecue, you can kind of do all the things that we all have in our house, which is even more terrifying. And so it kind of changed into that. io9: This filmâalmost more than the other ones, which I watched beforehandâreally messes with you with the red herrings. And I love it so much. So how early do you have to think about that, to make sure you have all the coverage while editing to know that these are like 15 things that we’re going to use to mess with you? Stein:You plan it out way before editing, in storyboards and scripting. To plant things that come back much later or to misdirect the audience. Because the main thing we wanted to do was keep it surprising. So you have a character walking backwards into a road and everyone in the audience goes, âOh my god, oh my god,â and then [the car] misses him. So the audience kind of knows that we’re playing with them. Death is toying with the characters, just like we’re playing with the audience. Because we always wanted you to feel on the edge of your seat, like you don’t know what’s about to happen. So we had to plan that very far in advance. We were inspired by some of the other moviesâthe guy inFD2throws the spaghetti out the window, and then his house catches on fire, he almost gets his hand caught in the garbage disposal, and all this stuff happens, and he gets on the fire escape and then slips on the spaghetti. So we tried to do that kind of thing where, like, there’s something that happens with a vending machine that you kind of forget about, and then it comes back. io9: Oh it comes back, yes it does. Another thing that I loved about this is that it takes the formula and it tweaks it in a couple of really interesting ways. One that happens early, so itâs not a huge spoiler, is we don’t get the premonition right way. So how early was that in the process that you’re like, right from the beginning we’re making this a newFinal Destination? Lipovsky:That was a designing principle which was not have the premonition working exactly the way that all the other movies had, so that fans of the franchise right away went, âWait, this is different than I’m used to. What is going on here?â And almost worried that we’re jumping the shark or breaking the rules or doing something wrong. But then, slowly, as the movie continues on and you realize what’s going on, you realize, âOh, this does fit within the canon. It obeys all these rules that we’ve come to love.â But it was, like Adam was saying, it was building on that idea that as early as possible, we wanted people to not know where this was going next. And it’s really difficult with aFinal Destinationmovie because thereâs basically a formula. It’s something that you know what’s going to happen. But that makes for a boring movie. And so you have to figure out ways to still be true to it, but also keep it fresh io9: And you guys crushed that. Another thing I loved about it is, I love lore.Star Wars, Marvel, I love all that. And here the whole thing is lore, basically, right? So how early on was it decided that all the other movies are kind of the baby of this one? Stein:I mean, I think that was kind of a fun aspect of having this character, you know, Grandma Iris, who’s been in this cabin for decades, who’s been researching all the ways that people have died in the other movies. And it was actually inspired byFD1how Alex in that movie, Devon Sawa’s character, traps himself in the cabin and is opening tuna cans with oven mitts because he knows death is coming. Well, we always loved that scene. And we thought, âOkay, what if you did that for decades? How would your life be? What would you know? What would you be researching?â And so Grandma Iris’s book with all the lore from all the other movies, thatâs how that came together. Lipovsky:We even put an Easter egg in there where inFD1, he says, âI see you, you fuckâ to death. And then Iris says the same thing in her cabin. io9: One thing we haven’t seen now in six movies, though, is, death always wins but something is giving them the premonition. Something is battling. Stein:Yes. We have a theory. io9: Okay. I would love to hear your theory but I was just wondering, is that something you think could be introduced into a future movie or would that ruin kind of the formula? Stein:There have been lots of fan theories about some force of good that’s providing the premonition. I mean, we don’t want to piss people off and that is very valid theory. Lipovsky:And we don’t have a canon answer, but we have theories. Stein:Our own personal answer is that it’s death is bringing the premonitions because death, you know, he gets bored. He wants to have fun. So he does this thing, gives them enough clues that they could escape it if they’re paying attention, knowing that he’ll get them in the end in an even more fun way later. io9: I like that and I think fans will like that. Before I finish, I have to ask about Tony Todd. The fact that he passed is obviously horrible, but having him with this role in your movie it gives it this aura and this heart that is totally unexpected. So tell me about like first shooting with him. It was like when you found out? Lipovsky: Yeah. Well, we knew from while we were developing, we knew that he was sick. So it was developed with that in mind with him. You know, at first we were worried that he wouldn’t want to be in it or he wouldn’t be able to be in it. But he was so excited to be in the movie. Stein:And he’s like, “Don’t write me out of this movie. I have to do this.” Lipovsky:And we were very grateful that we could write the movie with that in mind, knowing that at the very least, this would be probably his lastFinal Destinationmovie, maybe his last movie ever. But we didn’t know that for sure. But that this would be saying goodbye to Bludworth. And that was designed from the beginning and worked very closely with him. And then even beyond that, when we shot that scene that day he was full of so much joy. It was just this electric feeling of seeing him do what he does so well. And then when it came to doing that last moment where he says goodbye, even with all the preparation we had done, we just said, “Tony, just throw it all away and speak from the heart about what this has all been about and what’s on your mind.” And, you know, his own mortality was on his mind. And he just spoke about how precious life is and how to take advantage of it. And that’s what he had shown us all day on set. He had done that. And it really comes through on screen when he he’s just he says that. Stein:Yeah, he’s speaking directly to the audience there. And I think takes a lot of people by surprise how much emotion they feel in that moment. io9: It’s wonderful. Now that your first studio movie is in the books, and I hope there are many more, but what do you say the biggest lesson you guys took out of it? Lipovsky:The biggest lesson… I think the biggest thing that we learned was just that you don’t ever want to lose that same enthusiasm you had when you started making small movies and trusting your gut on the things you think that the audience will love. And just kind of trying to ignore the studio-ness of it all and just make that movie for yourself who’s the fan and bring that to life. And hold on to that, that joy of cinema and making a movie with your friends in your backyard and just trying to do that with cooler toys and amazing actors. Io9: One last stupid final question. The little kid at the beginning. You hate him so much. Stein:By the way, I love the theater reaction in that moment. The first time we screened it for a test audience and we had someone jump up in their seat and pump their fits when [he dies]. So you’re on the right track. That was really fun. io9: But since that was in the premonition, did we ever see him die again in real life? Lipovsky:There is a there is a newspaper article on the wall and if you look for the headline, I think it says âPickpocket hit by piano moving van.â Final Destination Bloodlinesis now in theaters.

    "title": "OpenAI Just Released a Coding Tool to ‘Help’ Programmers (Replace Their Jobs, Probably)",
    "article_text": "OpenAI has launched a new agentic coding tool with the potential to make even the most fresh-faced code monkey a software superstar. Codex, which the companyannouncedon Thursday, represents a new sidebar feature inside OpenAI’s flagship product, ChatGPT. While obviously an exciting event in the world of software development, the tool also seems like it has the potential to replace skilled coders altogether. The company says Codex can accomplish coding tasks, and that, much like the rest of ChatGPT, all the user needs to do is input a prompt and then click a button labeled “Code.” Among other things, Codex can read and edit computer files and also run commands. It can also probe a user’s codebase and answer questions about it. To accomplish this, all the user has to do is input a query and click a button labeled “Ask.” OpenAI says that “task completion” by the program “typically takes between 1 and 30 minutes,” depending on the complexity of the requested task. OpenAI also notes that Codex’s workflow is 100 percent auditable, and that users can review “its actions through citations of terminal logs and test outputs,” which allows the user to “trace each step taken during task completion.” The coding takes place in an isolated environment, the code from which can then be easily integrated into a local environment or uploaded to GitHub. Tech companies are increasinglyautomating their code-writing, something Codex will undoubtedly assist with. Unfortunately, it seems not out of the realm of possibility that such automated tools could spell big trouble for the coder economy. If you can hire a junior coder for half the cost of a senior one, plop Codex in their hands, and get a basically finished software product, why go to the trouble of hiring a skilled engineer? It would stand to reason that Codex could be used maliciously (if unskilled coders can enjoy this tool, it seems like script kiddies would have a field day), but OpenAI claims that it has built safeguards into the tool to stop that from happening. “Safeguarding against malicious applications of AI-driven software engineering, such as malware development, is increasingly critical,” the company writes, explaining that Codex was engineered to somehow “identify and precisely refuse requests aimed at development of malicious software, while clearly distinguishing and supporting legitimate tasks.” It’s not exactly clear what those safeguards are. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for more information. Codex is currently enjoying a research preview and will initially be available for subscription-tier ChatGPT users. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users will all have free access to the tool, starting today. Eventually, access to the tool may be expanded. While Codex is currently available to subscribers at no additional cost, the company says that “rate-limited access and flexible pricing options” for additional usage will be rolled out at a later date.

    "title": "Trump Suggests Comey Should Be Prosecuted Over ’86’ Instagram Post",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has weighed in on a now-deleted Instagram post by former FBI Director James Comey, which Trump supporters insist was a death threat. And while Trump didn’t outright call for Comey to be prosecuted, he heavily suggested that using the mafia-style speak he’s become known for over the years. “A child knows what that meant,” Trump said in a clip that aired onFox News. “If you’re the FBI director and you don’t know what that meant, that meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear.” Comey posted a photo to Instagram Thursday that showed seashells spelled out to read “86 47,” a reference to Trump as the 47th president. The number 86 is commonly used in the restaurant industry and means to expel or remove (like a customer or dish) but can also mean to “kill” in other contexts. Comey deleted the post and wrote a follow-up that said he opposed violence of any kind. But top officials in the Trump administration, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, said there will be an investigation. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Comey should bethrown in prison. Trump weighed in on the controversy during an interview with Bret Baier that’s scheduled to air later today, though it’s not clear exactly when it was filmed. Fox & Friends played the clip of Trump on Friday morning while insisting that Comey intended it as a threat against Trump’s life. The president, who’s currently in the Middle East, said that Comey only deleted the post because he was “hit hard” over it, apparently a reference to the whining on social media platform X. “Now, he wasn’t very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant,” Trump told Baier. “And he did it for a reason and he was hit so hard. Because people like me, and they like what’s happening with our country. Our country has become respected again and all this… and he’s calling for the assassination of the president.” Baier interjected, saying, “Obviously he apologized and said he wasn’t calling for violence.” But Trump said he only apologized “because he was hit” and called Comey a “very bad person.” Baier then asked Trump what he wanted to see happen and the president referred to Pam Bondi, the Attorney General who frequently appears on Fox News. “I don’t want to take a position on it because that’s going to be up to Pam and all of the great people,” Trump said. “But I will say this, I think it’s a terrible thing. And when you add his history to that… if he had a clean history, he doesn’t. He’s a dirty cop. He’s a dirty cop. And if he had a clean history, I could understand if there was a leniency. But I’m going to let them make that decision.” Reading between the lines, it’s easy to see what Trump is saying here. He wants Comey to be thrown in jail and the only thing keeping him from saying that explicitly is probably the fact that so many top Trump officials have already said as much. Gabbard appeared on Jesse Watters’s show Thursday night and was asked whether she thinks Comey should be locked up. âI do,â Gabbardsaid. âIâm very concerned for the presidentâs life. Weâve already seen assassination attempts. Iâm very concerned for his life, and James Comey, in my view, should be held accountable and put behind bars for this.â Comey was appointed Director of the FBI in 2013 by President Barack Obama and was fired in May 2017 by President Trump during his first term. Trump was unhappy with the investigations at the FBI related to his campaign’s contacts in 2016 with the Russian government, which were very real. But Trump has largely been successful at calling all of that the “Russia Hoax,” while ignoring theextensive connections. It’s a crime to call for the death of the president, and one of the few things that’s not protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as the famous 2007 sketch from comedy group The Whitest Kids You Knowpointed out. But Comey says he wasn’t calling for the death of President Trump and, given the many interpretations of the number 86, it’s almost certainly constitutionally protected speech. The question is whether the Trump regime arrests Comey and tries to test that theory in court. Because even if they lose, Trump’s government is likely to just do whatever they want anyway. RememberKilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador and then the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Trump needed to bring him back? Trumpstillhasn’t brought him back to the U.S. and apparently has no plans to. Trump has previously said he wants to send American citizens to El Salvador’s torture prison. It would be an absurd idea to even contemplate in any other era, but it’s entirely possible Trump’s goons may not just toss Comey in some U.S. jail. Comey could find himself in an overseas prison with absolutely no recourse. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

Â “We wanted to honor Donald Sutherland by having one of this generationâs greatest actors play President Snow 24 years before Katniss Everdeen entered the arena,” producer Nina Jacobson said in a press release. “Working with Ralph has been on my bucket list since he traumatized me for life inSchindler’s List. Itâs genuinely a thrill to welcome him to theHunger Games.” Theprequel novel by Suzanne Collinswas just published on March 18, and takes readers back to Panem two decades before the original trilogy which became hit films starring Jennifer Lawrence with Woody Harrelson co-starring as her mentor Haymitch Abernathy. The prequel film will delve into Haymitch’s backstory, now portrayed by Zada, and his participation in Fiftieth Hunger Games, known as the second Quarter Quell.

    "title": "U.S. Woman Dies From Mad Cow-Like Brain Disease That Lay Dormant for 50 Years",
    "article_text": "The grim reaper can sometimes take decades to catch up with its victims. In a report out this week, scientists describe a woman who died from an incurable prion disease caught roughly 50 years earlier. Doctors detailed the unusual case in a paperpublishedWednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 58-year-old woman developed a form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) likely contracted through contaminated human growth hormone (HGH) treatments she received as a child, they determined. The tragic death may represent the longest latency period ever documented for this universally fatal disease. Disease-causing prions are one of the strangest things that can sicken people. They’re the misfolded form of the normal (but still very mysterious) prion protein found in our bodies and brains. When a rogue prion comes across its harmless counterpart, it converts the latter into a misfolded copy of itself, much like a zombie outbreak. A Mad Cow-Like Prion Disease Has Killed Two People and Sickened a Third in Same Oregon Town Over time, the exponential accumulation of bad prions destroys the brain, leading to symptoms like dementia and death soon after. If that’s not scary enough, prions are naturally resistant to most standard methods of sterilization used to kill off other infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The one saving grace is that prion diseases in general remain very rare, though other prion-like diseases likeAlzheimer’sare more common. Prions can emerge sporadically for no clear reason, can be caused by inherited mutations, or they can be transmitted though close contact with infected bodily fluids or brain matter. In the 1980s, for instance, doctors discovered that people could catch CJD through human growth hormone extracted from prion-infected cadavers. A decade later, we learned that people could also catch CJD via tainted beef from cows infected with their own version of prion disease (nicknamed mad cow disease). The discovery of HGH-related CJD quickly led to the end of cadaver-sourced HGH in the U.S. and other countries (thankfully, synthetic HGH became available soon after). Still, over two hundred cases of iatrogenic CJDâiatrogenic meaning it was caused by a medical treatmentâfrom tainted HGH have been documented worldwide. Most of these cases were reported between five and 10 years after people had used HGH. But prion disease can sometimes take much longer to manifest in certain people, even decades. According to this latest report, the woman first visited doctors with tremors and trouble balancing. As is often the case, once symptoms started, her condition rapidly worsened. She was hospitalized just four weeks later, and several days into her stay, she fell into a coma that she would never awaken from. An autopsy confirmed the woman’s death from CJD but ruled out known genetic causes. And since she received HGH treatment prior to the cadaver ban, it was likely the root source of her illness, the doctors concluded. What Ever Happened to Mad Cow? HGH is used to treat severe growth-related conditions in children, and is typically taken over many years, including in this case. That makes it impossible to know exactly when the woman contracted CJD. Her first treatment was 51.3 years prior to her symptoms appearing, for instance, while her last treatment was 42.1 years earlier. But the U.S. switched to a different method of collecting HGH from cadavers in 1977, one that inadvertently and greatly reduced the risk of prion contamination. Based on that, the most likely timeframe for her infection is around 48.3 years earlier, the authors calculated. There are known cases of people dying from CJD infections caught over30 years ago, as well asreportsof other prion diseases emerging over a half century later. But this appears to be the longest case of HGH-related CJD documented so far, though it might not be the last. The researchers note that genetics can influence a person’s chances of developing prion disease. And the woman possessed a mutation in the gene that codes for the prion protein linked to longer latency periods. So while tainted human growth hormone hasn’t caused CJD for a very long time, some people out there may still one day succumb to their earlier exposure (it’s estimated that around 7,700 people in the U.S. took HGH prior to the cadaver ban). The authors say that doctors treating neurological illness should at least be on the lookout for these delayed cases, especially if their patients have a history of HGH treatment before 1977. “Although the US iCJD outbreak has slowed substantially, the potential for new cases remains,” they wrote.

    "title": "Solar Tax Credits Are on the Chopping Block—Install Soon or Pay the Price",
    "article_text": "For the last two decades, homeowners have been able to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits to help offset the high upfront costs of going solar. Things were supposed to stay that way through 2034. But, this week, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed abruptly ending the incentives at the end of the year. If this idea survives the House and passes the Senate, it could upend the economic calculus of powering your home with the sun. âIt would put solar out of reach for millions of people,â said Glen Brand, director of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a non-profit that encouragesadoption of the technology. âWhat the House has done is to put ordinary Americans in a really hard place. They are basically saying they arenât going to help people with rising energy costs.â The countryâs first solar tax credits took effect in 1978, but wereallowed to lapse in 1985, when President Ronald Regan was in office. In 2005, however, another Republican â President George W. Bush â revived them.Lawmakers have extended and tweaked the incentivesever since, mostly recently with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which set the creditat 30 percent of the cost of a system until 2032, before a two-year phase out. The average cost ofa solar systemin the U.S. right now is just north of $28,000, according to ZoÃ« Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at the energy consultant Wood MacKenzie. That means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committeereleased an initial budget reconciliation proposalthat would roll back large swaths of the IRA, including support for residential solar. The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely. Without the tax credits, solar systems mightstill make financial sensein places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow. For other people, the math may no longer work at all. âWe would expect sales and installation to surge this year, followed by a market contraction,â said Gaston. âIf a homeowner is thinking about solar and can afford it,â now would be the time.â The 25D credit isnât the only relevant tax break under threat. Another credit, 48E, is available to businesses that install solar on homes where the resident then either leases the equipment or enters into a power purchase agreement. This allows companies to reduce what they charge customers. According to Gaston, more than half of residential installations now follow this third-party ownership model. Instead of eliminating 48E, the House favors applying limits on where the material in photovoltaic panels comes from. While experts are still sorting out exactly what the proposed language means, it generally aims to bar participation of âforeign entities of concernâ â including those in China, where the vast majority of solar components are made. âIt puts the obligation on the installer or the developer to trace back the supply chain in a way thatâs completely impossible,â said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. This, he said, could effectively make the 48E credit effectively impossible to access starting in 2026. The current House language could at least temporarily push folks toward the third-party ownership options, said Gaston. But when Wood MacKenzie did an analysis, before the House draft, that assumed a phase out of credits by 2028, it still projected a 30 percent drop in installed residential capacity by the end of the decade. âItâs going to be devastating for companies, their employees, and their customers,â said Gallagher. âItâll kill an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of workers and tens of billions of dollars in investment every year.â The House move isnât the only headwind the solar industry is facing. Some states, most notably California, for example,have lowered the amount the homeownerscan earn selling power to the grid, making solar less lucrative. Even before Republicans took control of Congress and the White House, companieswere starting to let employeesgo. More layoffshave ensued. Some Republicans have acknowledged the role thatenergy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts.Twenty-one House members of the party signed a letterto Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith expressing concern about âdisruptive changes to our nationâs energy tax structure.âFour Republican Senators also wroteto Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) urging âa targeted, pragmatic approachâ to any changes. âThis is going to turn on what the Senate does,â said Brand, about the future of the solar credits. He believes itâs unlikely that the House proposal will become law in its current form and is optimistic that the rollbacks will be rectified. âThis is a piece the Senate can get right.â But the harm to the solar industry is already being done, said Jacquelyn Pless, a professor who researches energy and environmental economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The constant back and forth over policy, she said, makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan ahead. âPolicy volatility is really my bigger concern,â Pless said. âPolicy uncertainty alone can start to freeze investment, raise costs, and damage market confidence.â This article originally appeared inGristathttps://grist.org/climate-energy/if-you-want-to-claim-the-solar-tax-credit-install-now/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

    "title": "This Retro Handheld Takes the Best Game Boy Ever and Adds Dual Joysticks",
    "article_text": "The heyday of the Game Boy peaked with the ultra-portable Game Boy Advance SP. That âspecialâ clamshell handheld design is once again returning with the dirt-cheapAnbernic RG34XXSP. It should be available to some degree in the U.S. despite tariffs, though now I can only imagine what would make the perfect Game Boy emulator. The RG34XXSP may be a contender, but we’re so close to having the perfect device my pockets are opening in anticipation. Theseretro handheldsare built foremulation. That means theyâre running custom software made to recreate a consoleâs hardware in software form. Small devices like the RG34XXSP are better for handheld emulation, from Game Boy through Sega Game Gear, though they’re also good enough to run some, but not all Nintendo 64 or Dreamcast titles. What helps in that regard is the device’s twin recessed thumbsticks found below the D-pad and face buttons. The device is shipping starting on May 16. If you buy it fromAnbernicâs websiteand ship it from the U.S. warehouse, you can get it for $60, not including shipping cost. After five days, that becomes $67. Last month, Anbernic said it wouldstop shipping directly to U.S. customersfrom China, though it will still offer sales from its U.S. warehouse. The RG34XXSP will be available in the U.S. in all four color optionsâwith the best two being a classic GameCube purple and a banana yellowâthough you can only get it with the base 64GB storage option. That storage normally comes stocked with pre-loaded emulation software and some games, though it will support an additional microSD card, which you should be able to find for relatively cheap. Anbernic is one of the most prolific retro handheld makers around, so you may be thinking youâve already seen the RG34XXSP before. Thatâs because Anbernic already makes the $65 RG35XXSP, a similar clamshell based on the rock-solid RG35XX. The new device is based on the RG34XX, and it comes with 2GB of RAM compared to 1GB on the older model. Both handhelds run on an H700 quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor, which is enough to play practically all Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games along with most Nintendo DS, though youâll struggle to get the dual display to fit on the miniscule 3.4-inch, 720 x 480 IPS display. The RG34XXSP is immediately appealing for its price, but it’s not perfect. The 3:2 screen aspect ratio is good for Game Boy, but it will make later games played on a 4:3 screen, like most consoles, seem squashed. Asnotedby Russ Crandall at Retro Game Corps, thatâs less of a problem on the 3.5-inch RG35XXSP display, but that device doesnât include joysticks. At the very least, the RG34XXSP is slightly slimmer at 2.5cm (just under an inch) compared to the 2.7cm RG35XXSP. Thatâs closer to the Game Boy Advance SPâs 0.95 inches. For the sake of pocketability, every millimeter matters. This handheld isnât perfect for everything, and as we get further and further away from the golden age of handheld gaming that ended with the demise of the Nintendo 3DS eShop, weâre still waiting for that âperfectâ handheld. The clamshell design offers the most portable option, and handheld maker Miyoo tried its hand at its own SP-inspired device this year with theMiyoo Flip. Users on Reddit have shared numerous anecdotes about the hinge on the device failing. The company released an updated version that was supposed to address the defects, but as Crandallnotedin a recent video, the hinge on those units may also fail after enough times slapping it closed. The issue may be isolated to the dark gray model, but weâll need to wait many months more to see if more issues crop up. Until somebody decides to make anAnalogue Pocket-style SP model that supports both FPGA emulation for playing cartridgesalongside emulators, Iâll just keep waiting on the perfect retro handheld.

    "article_text": "Rick and Mortyis about to kick off its eighth season, but it’s only season two for the voices behind the main characters. Ian Cardoni (Rick) and Harry Belden (Morty)joined the showahead of season seven, coming aboard afterJustin Roiland’s departure. Fans were delighted to realizethe switch sounded nearly seamlessâand now, Cardoni and Belden can relax a bit having settled into the roles. Or can they? “I would say that the nerves never go away as long as you care,” Cardoni told io9 at a recentRick and Mortypress day. “We’ll always be our own toughest critic to make sure that we’re delivering on the material that we’re given. But I will say that season eight provided us with so many opportunities to explore the range of these characters.” No spoilers, but Cardoni is looking forward to fans hearing his work on the upcoming season. “I was thrilled to read all the different iterations of Rick, and Rick’s emotional journey, and the growth that is not linear by any means for Rick, and really explore and bring as much of myself to the role as possible, to hopefully give fans a really awesome roller coaster to follow along.” Belden agreed. “Yeah, same here. I think that initial big momentous feeling of pressure maybe faded a little bit in that we aren’t waiting for people to hear exactly what we sound like. It’s kind of out there. It’s known. It’s not a huge surprise.” But that doesn’t mean they’re easing up on themselves. “But now it’s like Ian said: we always want to be doing good jobs. So I wake up every day that I go in the booth and I’m just ‘okay, this you know, you need to be giving it 110% because that’s what the fans expect.’ And that’s I expect no less of myself, you know, so I think now it’s just with that out of the way, let’s say we can just focus on being the characters to the best of our ability and provide do justice to these incredible scripts that we’ve got.” Rick and Mortyseason eight arrives May 25 on Adult Swim.

    "title": "Microsoft Says There’s ‘No Evidence’ Its Azure and AI Models Have Harmed People in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Once again, Big Tech is under scrutiny for its role in Israel’s genocide against Palestinians. Recently, Microsoft’s sale of artificial intelligence models and cloud computing services to the Israeli military prompted a series of worker-led protests. But now, Microsoft says there’s no evidence that its products have been used to harm people in Gaza. At least not as far as Microsoft can examine. On Thursday, Microsoftannouncedthat it conducted internal and external reviews into the Israel Ministry Defense’s use of its products, writing, “We take these concerns seriously.” The company went on to add that it “found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza.” Microsoft did not clarify which company it contracted with for external review. Nor did it provide details about the process outside of stating that it included “interviewing dozens of employees and assessing documents.” However, the company added that its reviews are limited. It doesn’t have visibility into how software is used on private servers or on systems outside of its cloud. Tensions at Microsoft have risen sinceÂ aFebruary reportrevealed the extent of its $133 million contract with Israel. According to AP News, Israel’s use of Microsoft and OpenAI technology increased nearly 200 times after Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza launched an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.Â  The military specifically uses Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure, to compile information obtained through mass surveillance, like phone calls or texts, which the system transcribes and translates. Overall, it stores over 13.6 petabytes worth of data on Microsoft servers, which, AP News explained, is about 350 times more than what’s needed for the entire Library of Congress. Last year, Microsoftfired two employeesfor organizing an “unauthorized” vigil in memory of Palestinians killed in Gaza. In February,Microsoft also kicked five employees out of a town hall meetingfor protesting its Israeli contracts. Then last month, Ibtihal Aboussad, a software engineer on Microsoft’s AI Platform team,interruptedthe company’s head of AI during a 50th anniversary celebration. “Shame on you,” Aboussad said. “You are a war profiteer. Stop using AI for genocide. Stop using AI for genocide in our region. You have blood on your hands. All of Microsoft has blood on its hands. How dare you all celebrate when Microsoft is killing children. Shame on you all.” The Vergereportedthat Aboussad also sent an email to distribution lists containing hundreds of thousands of Microsoft employees. She wrote, “Microsoft cloud and AI enabled the Israeli military to be more lethal and destructive in Gaza than they otherwise could,” and urged people to sign the No Azure for Apartheid petition, stating, “We will not write code that kills.” The company’s post comes only a week ahead of a Seattle conference whereNo Azure for Apartheidintends to protest. In its blog, Microsoft also said that the Israeli military is bound to its conditions of use, which “require customers to implement responsible AI practices” and “prohibits” using its technologies “in any manner that inflicts harm on individuals or organizations or affects individuals in any way that is prohibited by law.” That assurance falls flat when considering Israel’s track record. Last year, a group of independent human rights expertssaidthat “Israel has openly defied international law time and again, inflicting maximum suffering on civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory and beyond.” That includes murder, torture, sexual violence, forced displacement, bombing vital institutions like hospitals, targeting healthcare workers, journalists, humanitarian workers, and purposefully destroying food systems as a method of war, per a breakdown by the United Nations’ Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Plus, Israel is committing genocide, which is a war crime. Thedefinitionput forth at the Geneva Convention includes specific actions “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group.” Last month, the Gaza Health Ministry reported that deaths in the regionnow exceed 50,000. In addition, a Reuters analysis found that Israelcompletely eliminatedat least 1,200 families. Although some argue that Israel’s actions don’t meet the condition of “intent to destroy,” its response to the Oct. 7 attackskilled over 5,000 peoplein the first week, extreme violence thatcaused a major shift for many experts. South Africa formallybrought genocide chargesagainst Israel last year. Big Tech has provided Israel with support for years, like with Google and Amazon’sProject Nimbus. Microsoft can try to downplay its role by saying that its technology wasn’t directly used for harm. Even if that is true, its technologies make it possible for the Israeli military to expand its destruction of Palestine and its people.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s xAI Says ‘Unauthorized Modification’ Made Grok Spout White Genocide Conspiracy Theory",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence tool Grok went haywire on Wednesday, responding to innocuous questions on X with information about “white genocide” in South Africa. It was a confusing and sometimeshilariousglitch, but we now have some answers about what happened from xAI. And frankly, they just leave us with more questions. xAI posted atweetThursday night laying out its explanation, including the exact time that changes were made to Grok that made it pump out sentences about “white genocide” no matter what users asked. “On May 14 at approximately 3:15 AM PST, an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X,” xAI wrote. “This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability.” You’ll notice that xAI, which is owned by Elon Musk, strongly suggests there was an internal actor who made this “unauthorized modification” but doesn’t use the language you’d expect if it was an employee at the company. And we’re guessing that might have something to do with the fact that it wasn’t an employee necessarily, but the owner. Musk has long been obsessed with the “white genocide” conspiracy theory, the idea that white people are being killed around the world by nonwhite people. The conspiracy theory often includes elements of anti-semitism and is similar to the so-called Great Replacement conspiracy theory, which claims global elites are trying to replace white people with other races in wealthy countries around the world. Musk is particularly interested in the supposed “white genocide” that’s happening in South Africa, the country where he was born and raised before emigrating to Canada and then eventually the U.S., and has shared tweets where he insists white farmers are being slaughtered for their race. The day before Grok started acting oddly, Musk quote-tweeted a post about South Africa that contained misinformation. The person Musk was quote-tweeting posted video that showed a street in South Africa where hundreds of white crosses had been placed on each side. The poster claimed that each cross represented a white farmer who had been murdered. “Each cross represents a white farmer who was murdered in South Africa,” the account Dr. Maalofwrote. “And some people still deny that white South Africans/Boers are persecuted and say they donât deserve asylum because they are white.” Musk sharedthe tweetwith “So many crosses,” and naturally a bunch of X users asked Grok if this was true. Grok responded that the crosses were calledWitkruis Monumentand each cross actually represents farmers of any race who’ve been killed.The next day, people started to notice that Grok was acting weird, responding to unrelated queries with information about white genocide. Changes were made to Grok at 3:15 a.m. PT (6:15 a.m. ET), which led to jokes Thursday night about how late Musk stays up each night. The billionaire frequently tweets at all hours, but you don’t need to assume Musk was up late to think he may have been behind the change to Grok. The billionaire oligarch is currently in the Middle East with President Donald Trump, meeting with world leaders. Qatar’s timezone is 10 hours ahead of Pacific Time, meaning it was 1:15 p.m. in Qatar when the tinkering was taking place. Elon’s Jet, the social media account that tracks Musk’s plane and has been banned from X, shows the billionaire was soon to belanding in Dohawhen all of this was happening.

[image or embed] â Elon Musk’s Jet Tracking (@elonjet.net)May 14, 2025 at 5:06 AM To be clear, we don’t have proof that Musk was involved. It’s entirely possible that some workers at xAI saw Musk getting fact-checked by Grok about white genocide and wanted to tilt the AI tool in their boss’s favor. But Musk is notorious for tinkering with his products to suit his needs and make himself feel better. There’s an infamous story, first reported byPlatformer in 2023, where Musk became extremely upset about President Joe Biden’s Super Bowl tweet getting more likes and views than Musk’s. Biden’s tweet about the Super Bowl received 29 million impressions and Musk’s just 9 million, prompting Musk to fly back to Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco to demand changes to the algorithm. Those changes made it so that users on X were seeing an absolute flood of Musk tweets. It wasn’t subtle. We’re guessing something similar happened here. xAI wrote on Thursday night it would start publishing system prompts to Github in an effort to be more transparent and “putting in place a 24/7 monitoring team to respond to incidents with Grokâs answers that are not caught by automated systems, so we can respond faster if all other measures fail.” This, of course, makes it sound like this was a problem of automation rather than an insecure man-child tinkering with his multimillion dollar toy to make himself feel better. But whatever they have to tell themselves. The long and the short of it? These systems are inherently biased by the way they’re trained. And they’re also incredibly difficult to manipulate with precision, given the way large language models work. Grok is essentially just a fancy predictive text machine. And as long as Musk has control of tools to shape public opinion, he’s going to use themâunfortunately, forfascist purposes. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Afterdirector Bong Joon Howon multiple Oscars forParasite, he could’ve done anything. Made any movie he wanted. Andthe movie he chose wasabout a man who continues to die and be cloned, finding himself in the middle of a socio-political firestorm about cuddly alien slugs. Mickey 17was released earlier this year andkind of tanked at the box office, which is a shame. It’sincredibly unique, weird, and infinitely watchable. A fact pretty much the entire world who didn’t see it in theaters can find out very very soon. It’s coming to HBO Max May 23. It’s also got an incredible cast. Robert Pattinson is the title character, Mickey, a man who has gone through 17 iterations of himself and finally meets another version. Mark Ruffalo is an all-too-recognizable right-wing political leader. Toni Collette is his creepily cheerful wife.Star Warsstar Naomi Ackie is Mickey’s kick-ass partner, and Steven Yeun is his questionable friend. It’s a who’s who of people you’d pay to see in almost anything. But people did not pay. BecauseMickey 17is incredibly hard to put in a single box.Even my review of it admittedthere are some issues there, especially in how the film handles its politics. That’s just one opinion, though. Now it’s on a streaming service that you might already pay for and we predict people are going to fall for it. Because it’s Bong Joon Ho. He’s amazing. AndMickey 17is wild. It’s funny, gross, and unforgettable, even if you don’t love it. People will love it, though, thanks to all of those things, the incredible performances, and the crazy places the story goes. So, this Memorial Day week, you can definitely go to the theaters and see the newMission: Impossible, or you can stay home and see another big-screen banger you probably missed earlier this year:Mickey 17.

    "title": "Nothing’s New Audio and Phone Teasers Are Making My Wallet Tremble",
    "article_text": "Nothing is teasing new productsagain.Most of the time, given Nothing’s frequent product cadence, that phenomenon could just be referred to as any day of the week, but this time things feel different. Earlier this week, Nothing announced apartnership with KEFâa well-established hi-fi audio brandâto bring us… something. That something, as it turns out, could very well be anAirPods MaxorSony WH-1000XM6competitor. Ina YouTube videoon Friday, Nothing confirmed that it’s expanding its audio lineup outside ofwireless earbudsand into over-ear headphones. The company says they’re launching “this summer,” and more info will be available in “the coming months.” While Nothing didn’t give much detail on what to expect from its first-ever over-ear entrant, one thing you can count onâespecially if KEF is involvedâis that it will almost for sure be the company’s most expensive audio product to date. And that steeper price looks like it might not just be for audio gear. What I’m trying to say is: buckle up,transparent gadget lovers, cause things might be careening toward a big premium pothole. First off, let’s talk about the KEF collab. While we don’t have a ton of details, we can make some semi-safe assumptions off the bat. The safest, arguably, is that this will be a hi-fi audio product. In a statement announcing the partnership, KEF says, “Our six decades of high-fidelity audio expertise will support Nothingâs expansion into new audio categoriesâbringing acoustic precision to products shaped by Nothingâs distinct approach to design and user experience.” That suggests/confirms that hi-fi is still the name of the game and that this collab will be an “expansion” of some kind. It’s that second part that really gets my gears turning. Though, again, we can’t say for sure what the collab will produce, my money is on one of two things: the aforementioned pair of over-ear headphones or, more tantalizinglyâa full-on speaker. And as I mentioned before, if there’s one thing that hi-fi audio connotes, it’s an even higher price tag. While KEF does make a spectrum of products across different price points,speakers tend to start at dollar amountsthat are inching toward $1,000+. And headphones are a similar story.KEF’s Mu7 over-ear headphones cost $400, which isn’t unattainable compared to the broad field of premium over-ear competitors, but they’re certainly pricier than any audio gear that Nothing has dabbled in to date. Whatever this collaboration produces, you can expect to pay handsomely to own it. And that’s just the start. In ashowcase on the Android Show, Nothing CEO Carl Pei teasedâyou guessed itâanother upcoming product in arguably the company’s most competitive category: phones. The Phone 3, which Pei says is coming this summer, will be a step up for Nothing in the phone space and mark its first real flagship-level device. According to Pei, the Phone 3 will have “premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up.â As someone who’s tested pretty much every Nothing phone to date, I’m excited to see what that means in practice, but also maybe not as excited to see what that means for my wallet. Pei also adds in his teaser that the Phone 3 will cost about Â£800, which is about $1,060 USD, compared to the company’s recently released mid-range$380 Phone (3a) and $460 Phone (3a) Pro. Am I shocked that Nothing seems to be inching toward the premium sector? Not particularly. Pei’s goal from the start was to challenge Apple with eye-catching transparent designs and fast and smooth bespoke software, and to do that, it will have to compete on the iPhone’s hallowed ground, which is to say, in the flagship arena. Whether Nothing has actually summoned the acumen, resources, and clout to do that is another question entirely, but I look forward to seeing its best effort. My wallet on the other hand… TBD. audioNothingPhone 3 Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "title": "You cannot beat the final boss of No Rest for Wicked's latest saga",
    "article_text": "The founder of Moon Studios has become the action RPG's worst enemy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A year out from its initial early access launch, I can finally see what Moon Studios wants to make withNo Rest for the Wicked. It's big in scope and scale, mashing conventions and mechanics of several genres into one world folded in on itself like its own intricately layered levels. And it invites much comparison: to Dark Souls and Diablo, namely. And also fighting games.Monster Hunter Wilds. Even Animal Crossing. It's an RPG with the action elements of an open world adventure likeElden Ringbut an isometric perspective and emphasis on random loot. It's a game about resource gathering and managing inventories and maybe farming, eventually. It's a game about throwing yourself at the boss for days at a time as the shadows drift with the sun into night and back to day again. Following the newBreach update, it's more a game about making big combos and managing poise and stamina and focus, almost like Sekiro. Not all the changes in the update have gone over well with fans, and negative reviews on Steam have prompted the game's developers to speak out against the public criticism. In doing so, they havemanufactured a controversythat implicates journalists, an imagined leftist coalition, and, of course, the usual minority scapegoats we are all tired of hearing about in every conversation. This has made finishing The Breach—and writing about it—an unwinnable proposition. Which is all a shame, because No Rest for the Wicked has charmed me over the past year with its relentless focus on nuanced animation, a prime example being the way my sorcerer holds her staff out in front of her chest to balance when crossing a narrow beam over the gap. Every weapon has its own pose for such occasions, just as each reveals unique combos with bespoke flourishes to bring life to this stormy outpost of a great, shining kingdom on the mainland, a heart of darkness called Sacra. Something is rotten on the island of Sacra. Survival, rebellion, inquisition, and pilgrimage collide in this world of sword and sorcery with vistas pulled fromFriedrich’s canvas, ruins from Giger's airbrush, and monsters from Bosch's hellscapes. Its epic dark fantasy quests would be at home in Game of Thrones, but the art direction often reminds me of Princess Mononoke: The breeze through the painted grass, flowers swaying so gently before the screen—the whole world—erupts in violence and bloodshed. In a new questline, I travel south of Sacrament, a day’s journey to the massacre at Hunters Vale. I follow the river to the dell, haunted by the cries that echo across the lowland meadows.Save me! Please! Help me! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And then I see her. The Lost Huntress: the corpse of a girl reaching clit-like from the gaping, ribbed mouth of a wolfish beast. My halberd rings with each swing. She wails with regret, trapped by the monster she could not stop in life or death. Then the flame at the end of my polearm catches matted fur and a warm blaze brings light to dark. Each quest in The Breach becomes a memorable journey thanks to the music, the lighting, the sound design, the environmental exploration. But by the time I could play and write about the update, another boss was staring me down. Moon Studios earned the status of indie darling with its Xbox exclusive Ori and the Blind Forest and cemented itself with its sequel. Then in a 2022 GamesBeat report, former employees accused studio co-founders Thomas Mahler and Gennadiy Korol of creating an“oppressive” workplace. With a pivot to a dark fantasy game unlike Ori in almost every way, the studio perhaps could've left some of the baggage behind and declared reinvention, but Mahler could not. Mahler has implied in tweets that the fallout from the report wascancel cultureandcontinues to echoGamerGate talking points aboutethics in journalismto this day, all of which makes it hard to take his most recent posts as anything but revisionist history. Last weekend, Mahler claimed on the game's public Discord serverthat Moon was in danger of closingdue to the growing number of negative reviews on No Rest for the Wicked's Steam page. He thenpicked a fightwith a journalist who wrote about his posts whilewalking backthe suggestion that Moon was in a financial crisis, suggested the negative reviews were the result of an organized backlash by an imagined group of leftists. He hassince claimedthat he used incorrect wording in his initial post because English is not his first language, while also saying he can \"sometimes be impulsive and emotional.\" And yet he continues to post. Hecontinues to postabout how unfair the game's negative reviews on Steam are to the studio. Hecompared himselfto Italian philosopherGiordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake by the Catholic church's inquisition for challenging geocentric doctrine. Considering therecent conservative responseto an American pope that has tepidly rejected the Trump regime's anti-immigrant policies, the invocation feels loaded. (In before the claim I am reading too much into it and Mahler is Austrian anyways.) After following him for a few years, I don't think Mahler is himself a reactionary, but a populist. He wants to be \"cancelled\" for the cultural clout it has brought figures he relates himself to. But the same rhetoric he has used to court gamers has attracted a vitriolic following seeking adrenaline and titillation. So, yes, an unfun balance change in an early access title will lead to more negative reviews.We've seen this blowback before. Mahler has made himself the final boss of No Rest for the Wicked, turning a compelling ARPG that I want to play more of into an unwinnable game for us both. I can only assume after an offhand comment about trans people in his screed that Mahler will dismiss whatever I have to say; perhaps he will even suggest I am organizing my own campaign to undermine the studio. But for him, and for Moon, there are few bridges left to burn, let alone cross, and he has surrounded himself with torch bearers. Autumn Wright is a critic of games and animation.

    "article_text": "Sony can't catch a break. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sony-owned developer Haven Studios had planned to release its live service shooter Fairgames this year, but the departure of its founder, Jade Raymond, and poorly-received external playtests has resulted in a delay to 2025, according to aBloomberg report. Raymond started Havenin 2021 just two months after leaving Stadia Games, Google's relatively short-lived internal development studio. Its debut game,Fairgames, was announced in 2023. The shooter was pitched as a \"modern take on the heist genre,\" and a PvP sandbox with what sounds like extraction shooter loot hoarding. According to Haven developers Bloomberg spoke to, PlayStation leadership didn't tell Haven staff why Raymond left, and that it happened \"several weeks after an external test\" of the game. They also said they were \"concerned about how the game was received and its progress\" following the playtest. In a statement to Bloomberg, a PlayStation spokesperson said it's \"deeply grateful for [Raymond's] leadership and contributions,\" and that it remains \"committed to supporting Haven Studios and [is] excited to continue the journey\" with new co-studio heads Marie-Even Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski. It seems fair to say that, Helldivers 2 aside, Sony has been struggling to break into the live service arena. The companyreportedly cancelled two unannounced live service gamesin January, one from Days Gone developer Bend Studio and one from Demon's Souls remake developer Bluepoint Games. And it was just late last year thatSony pulled the plug on Concordtwo weeks after it was released. Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooterMarathonis due out in September, but despite Bungie's long experience with live service games, itdoesn't feel like a guaranteed hit. And it's already been the subject of controversy after it was discovered that some of itsart assets were stolen. Despite all of this, Sony still seems interested in live service games and opened up a whole new studio in Bellevue, WA calledTeamLFG. Let's hope that developer's game sees the light of day.

    "article_text": "In the grim darkness of the 21st century, there is only scholarly analysis of the grim darkness of the 41st millennium. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last year, I had the pleasure of covering the existence of theWarhammer Conference, the world's first academic conference devoted to philosophical, theoretical, and otherwise scholarly appraisal of everything involving Space Marines, Chaos demons, and grim darkness both futuristic and fantastical. Today, I'm pleased to report that the Warhammer Conference is returning this September to Heidelberg, Germany for the second of what we can only hope is a long-lived annual tradition. As with last year's academic gathering, Warhammer Conference: 2nd Edition can be attended both in person and—if you're not in the Heidelberg neighborhood—online via livestream. \"We believe that this conference can be appealing not only to a classic academic audience, but also to Warhammer fans at large,\" said organizer Joachim Besson in a press release. \"By live-streaming and sharing all talks online, we aim to reach a wide audience of Warhammer enthusiasts.\" If you aren't sure whether you're the right brand of sicko to enjoy academic Warhammer theory, you're in luck. All of last year's talks are freely available on theWarhammer Conference YouTube channel, covering philosophy, literature, games studies, and more. Markus Ressel's \"Are We the Baddies? The Ethical Implications of the Imperium's War with Chaos\" might bea good opener. Or for theentomologically-minded, there's Elena Polyakova's \"Tyranid xenobiology compared to real-life eusocial insects.\" Or if you really want tomake your brain hurt, you could watch Tom Reichert's \"The Concept of Warp Space from a Physical Perspective.\" As for what might be discussed at the second Warhammer Conference, we can only guess until the program is announced in August. Talks about sociological mimesis and Genestealer Cults, maybe? Considering the walking, hulking tomb of the Astartes Dreadnought through a transhumanist lens? The gestalt psychology of the Greenskin species? We can only dream. If you're an academic yourself and you'd like to submit your own scholarly contributions for consideration, the conference is accepting abstracts until June 30.

    "title": "World of Warcraft game director on the woeful patch 11.1.5: 'It's not the experience our players are expecting or deserve'",
    "article_text": "Bugs and time-gated content enraged players. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft's latest patch was riddled withbugsand time-gated content, frustrating players and causing some pundits to pan it as a disaster, with even friendlier streamers noting that the patch processis brokenand thatBlizzard blew it. (Seeour full reportfor the details). I recently interviewed WoW senior game director Ion Hazzikostas, who said that the 11.1.5 launch did not go as planned and that Blizzard needs to do better. He spoke about the bugs surrounding the new in-game Flame's Radiance events, which launched in the patch. \"The issues with Nightfall getting stuck and bugging out for players in the first couple of days, that's something we need to improve on. We fixed it as soon as we could, but understandably, that's not the experience that we're hoping for anyone to have,\" Hazzikostas said. \"It's not the experience our players are expecting or deserve when they log in on patch day and they're excited to check out the new thing.\" Hazzikostas also spoke about the patch's unusual approach to time-gating content. Many of the update's most-exciting features, including the release ofa new form of bad-luck protection, a new game mode where players can fight two raid bosses at once, and the return of Horrific Visions and Corruption enchants, were all delayed to weeks into the patch—until June, in some cases. That left only the Flame's Radiance events as the main content available at patch launch, and since they were bugged, the patch as a whole landed with a splat. \"We're experimenting and trying different approaches to live-service events, different things that come and go,\" Hazzikostas said. \"We have our mainstay of a seasonal rotation, raid tiers, etc. that are the anchors of our major patches. But ultimately we're trying to interweave different variety into those experiences and on top of those experiences.\" Because so many of the features of the new patch involved the same segment of players—those who enjoy WoW's group-PvE content, such as dungeons and raids—developers thought it might make sense to space them out, so that people wouldn't be overwhelmed, he said. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"A lot of those are going to be focused on the same sort of player motivation and goals,\" Hazzikostas said. \"The thinking was, hey, it would be better for everyone and their time management—recognizing that we're eight weeks into the season and there's still a lot of people spending a lot of time in raids and dungeons and chasing those goals—if we didn't dump all this on you at the same time, and could spread it out a little bit to let each one have its moment to breathe.\" But players were angered by the delays, particularly in light of the buggy patch event. \"Understandably, players are accustomed to patch day being the day when everything drops,\" Hazzikostas said. \"We hear the feedback loud and clear. It's quite possible we got the balance wrong this time, and that there's too much that is being delayed and not enough that's available up front.\" Players were frustrated by bugs that cropped up that had already been fixed in earlier patches, and other bugs with their characters that didn't seem related to the new content. Many blamed the game's accelerated patch schedule, which has a new release dropping every eight weeks or so, the fastest cadence in WoW's history. \"We are committed to quality, and we know that quantity doesn't matter if the stuff isn't functional, and if the game isn't predictable and reliable and doesn't feel like a polished experience,\" Hazzikostas said. Part of the issue is that developers have been using hotfixes more aggressively to correct bugs, because they allow for instant changes instead of waiting until the next patch, he said. Above:A bug complaint posted to Reddit shortly after the patch was released. If it's a known issue, we're going to get to it ASAP,\" Hazzikostas said. \"A couple of issues came to light. We fixed them during the last weeks of 11.1, and during that window we'd already finalized our 11.1.5 build. We have processes to propagate those (fixes) forward, to make sure those changes are applied. \"Where it gets tricky is, sometimes there was a different change made to the same piece of data in 11.1.5, and now there's a conflict that can be thorny to untangle and reconcile. It's our job to reconcile and untangle it, but for players who may be mystified about, 'How did this possibly break?', it's because there are some of those tricky data conflicts. \"We still miss a few things. That's something that we work closely with QA on to understand, like what was the loophole in our testing and our process and our data verification that led to this?\" Blizzard tracks WoW's \"escape rate,\" the number of bugs that make it into the wild, he said. The team wants that rate to be in the \"low single digits\" on all the pieces of data touched in any given patch. \"We want to do better every time compared to how we did in the last,\" Hazzikostas said. The pace of the patches is faster, but that doesn't reduce the team's commitment to quality, he said. We're going to listen, we're going to learn, and we'll try to do better next time. \"If there's ever an update where we know there are serious issues, we're not going to push it out just because we've set this eight-week target,\" he said. \"We're never consciously compromising quality.\" Players have enjoyed the faster patch rates, so the team is looking for ways to improve, not slow down, Hazzikostas said. \"Rather than say, we're going to slow down and serve our players less, we'd rather ask, how can we polish this further? How can we tighten our processes so that things don't slip through the cracks and we are getting content into players' hands at the rate they deserve?\" he said. Combined with the bugs and players' overall feelings about the patch, 11.1.5 is likely to bring some changes to how WoW developers approach patches, Hazzikostas said: \"We're going to listen, we're going to learn, and we'll try to do better next time, both in delivering the content and setting expectations around how it's going to be paced.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Heather Newman has reported on games for more than 25 years, with an internationally syndicated column and stories in dozens of magazines.

    "title": "Clair Obscur's director has an old YouTube channel full of masterful no-hit Devil May Cry videos because of course he does",
    "article_text": "You'll never guess what his favorite fighting style is. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Suddenly it all makes sense: The director of the turn-based RPG with combat that plays like an action game, Clair Obscur, is also a hardcore Devil May Cry player. GamesRadarwas snooping through Guillaume Broche's Reddit account—where he once madea post looking for voice actors—and found a YouTube video of himdefeating Vergil in Devil May Cry 5 and taking zero damage. \"Had another go at Vergil after 6 months, what do you all think about this run?\" the post's title reads. Clicking through toBroche's YouTube channelreveals that he's actually just really good at DMC 5. There's nothing on there but five videos of him flawlessly killing bosses using parries and dodges like it's nothing. Inone video, he uses Dante's Royal Guard style to block and parry his way through the final boss fight, earning a perfect SSS score. In the description he wrote that \"Royal Guard is life,\" in case it wasn't clear that this man loves parries. That he would go on to infuse turn-based combat with action game sensibilities sure isn't surprising when you see all this. Once you've been bit by the parry bug, whether it's through games like Sekiro or DMC, you can't go back: that's just science. I'm no game designer, but I think it would only be natural for you to take that passion and share it with the world by making an entire game that rewards you for anticipating enemy attacks. I like to think that Broche would still approve of the player whobeat Clair Obscur without parrying or dodginga single time though. The other half of the game is a robust RPG. It supports tons of different builds that can make you feel like you're breaking it, which is exactly what you have to do if you want to circumvent one of its main combat mechanics. Broche strikes me as the kind of person who would appreciate the level of knowledge and effort it takes to pull that off.

    "title": "I did Liberation Day tariffs in Victoria 3, and it all went well until the famine in Colorado, the 2 lost wars with Canada, and the president beating a man to death with a stick",
    "article_text": "But apart from that, would recommend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I began to suspect things were unstable when the president beat a man to death in the street. Daniel Webster was an odd choice of leader by the American people: his predecessor, Andrew Jackson, did a lot of hate crimes and died early, his popularity hovering somewhere around the level of 'active rebellion'. Yet when it came time for the election, the USA decided it wanted the man who, if anything, thought slavery was even cooler than the last guy did, to the extent that he was willing to kill someone in public over it. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together If you're familiar with my work, you'll know I'm an idiot who knows nothing about anything. Concepts have to be explained to me slowly, at length, and in bright colours, preferably by some kind of animated mascot who also represents a cereal brand. When the global economy was plunged into chaos by the United States' gamut of Liberation Day tariffs on April 2, I was scared and confused. 'What's tariffs?' I asked, but the answers were complex. News outlets used words like \"bond yields,\" \"multilateralism,\" and \"rising consumer prices in the Federal Reserve’s rate-setting calculus.\" I was hosed. But then it came to me: every valuable lesson I've ever learnt in life was taught to me by a videogame. Why couldn't videogames teach me about tariffs, too? I'd just fire up grand strategy gameVictoria 3, adopt an economic policy broadly similar to that espoused by the president on April 2, and see how things went, ending all confusion and bringing peace to the United States forever. Problem one: Victoria 3 does not actually have a very good way of mirroring the Liberation Day tariffs in its base systems. You set tariffs on goods, not countries, so I couldn't just send the Qing a letter saying 'All your stuff is a trillion bucks now' and call it a day. So I had to hike up the prices of individual imports: +15% on maize here, +20 on iron there. I installed a mod which set the default 'Encourage exports' protectionism tariff rate from +30% to +100% and figured I'd probably put as much thought into the whole thing as the White House. Problem two: the numbers you can set don't get quite as galactic as those imposed by Uncle Sam in real life. Victoria 3 restricts you to the bounds of sanity, which just wouldn't do. I installed a mod which set the default 'Encourage exports' protectionism tariff rate from +30% to +100% and figured I'd probably put as much thought into the whole thing as the White House. Off we went, playing as the United States in the year 1835. I immediately activated what economists call 'hardcore mode': 100% tariffs on imports of everything under the sun. Autarky or bust, baby. We were going to make everything we need right here in this glorious America, from sea to shining sea. I also decided to start researching logistics. Seemed like we'd probably be needing that. This decision had one positive effect and several deleterious ones. The good news was that my short-term cashflow improved markedly, increasing by about 1.5k thanks to all the people forking over a lot of extra cash for their whirligigs and gewgaws and basic necessities of life. The bad news was there was now a shortage of several key consumer and industrial goods as well as a famine in Colorado. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Now, look, I'm from the United Kingdom. I can barely point out Colorado on a map and the only thing I know about it is… well, I guess I don't know anything about it. I didn't really see why I should be concerned that a few people there had to go on a diet or something when the treasury was booming from a sudden influx of cash. But this attitude seemed to negatively affect my government's legitimacy among the ungrateful masses. It was time to begin phase two. Phase two was building what I needed to meet domestic demand for things like 'food' using at-home facilities. Maybe I should have done this before imposing sweeping tariffs on the entire world, but there was simply no way to know that at the time. Not really understanding what Americans like to eat or where the best farmland was in the country, I figured everyone likes corn on the cob and built maize farms in every territory I had. Problem three: this accomplished nothing. It turns out you actually have to, like, build farms and plant crops and wait for them to grow before they start nourishing the hungry bellies of your whiny, whiny people. Even worse, the cost of building a maize farm in every backyard in America (and, perhaps, people running out of money with which to buy things) had tanked my formerly booming income right into the red—I was now sitting at -£1K income with nothing to show for it. As if that wasn't enough, suddenly an event popped up where the Democratic Party asked for funding. You literally can't ever escape those emails. With my budget in the toilet, 48.7% of people in Colorado beneath a minimum expected standard of living, a national income of -£30K, and shortages of paper, wood, iron and explosives, things were looking bad. My Yankee Great Leap Forward was hitting the rocks of a useless citizenry and a load of half-built maize farms. At some point in there we did actually discover logistics, but it didn't seem to help. I guess there was nothing to logist. There was no way out. My government's legitimacy tumbled to 25—about where Tsar Nicholas II was the nanosecond before someone shot him—with no obvious way to rectify it. I decided to invade Canada. It seemed an excellent idea, and generally in keeping with the state of the world at the moment. A war economy to boost the tax base, a 'rally round the flag' effect to bolster my legitimacy, and people couldn't starve if they'd already been shot to death by mounties. It was the perfect plan. It, uh, it worked. Reader, it's with great concern that I inform you that invading Canada pretty much solved every problem the United States had in one fell swoop. My legitimacy skyrocketed, I was suddenly comfortably in the black financially, and even Colorado stopped complaining about not having enough Biker Jim's Gourmet Hot Dogs or whatever. Yeah, there were still shortages of everything—including, forebodingly, ammunition and explosives—and evenmorestates had now joined Colorado in the 'people living below the poverty line' Olympics but they were only mildly starving rather than severely, now. Even Colorado stopped complaining about not having enough Biker Jim's Gourmet Hot Dogs or whatever To be fair, it could just be that enough people had starved to death that there was enough food for the people who were left, rather than it having anything to do with my invasion of Canada, but I'm chalking it up as a win. Militarily, there were issues. I had mistaken a lot of my Navy's ships for men before I started the war, which led me to erroneously believe that my army was actually a lot bigger than it was in reality. Also an issue: Canada was the dominion of the then-largest empire on Earth—Great Britain, andapparentlythey get snippy if you march several men and even more boats into Montreal without asking. Limeys, am I right? So despite some positive early signs—my boys managed to occupy most of southeastern Ontario right at the jump—things did kind of slide backwards once Her Maj showed up in force, beating us back to New York and taking over quite a lot of the eastern seaboard while it did that. Eventually, Old Glory was forced to capitulate and pay reparations, but that was likely for the best: our shortages had gone beyond ammo and paper and now infected luxury clothes, sugar, furniture, and plenty else besides. I still hadn't even wrapped my head around making maize yet, I couldn't start making all that while also fighting the British. Also, at some point during all this the Sioux Nation had declared war on me, which was unsporting. But things calmed down after that. My budget stayed, inexplicably, very strong and my governmental legitimacy was the highest it had been all game—a cool 83 thanks to its cunning unification of interest groups like small property-holders, industrialists, evangelicals, and the intelligentsia, four universally popular groups that nobody has a problem with. People didn't seem to mind when I increased their taxes to pay for the war, my maize farms got built, and I even unlocked nationalism! Which seemed like just the thing to calm everyone down. But things, perhaps inevitably, began to slide as this golden era waned. I still had huge swathes of the country living below their expected standard of living, my super-tariffed goods were still expensive and in short supply, and radicals kept popping up to get very angry about it (they were also angry about slavery which, as we've already established, President Webster was two-thumbs-up on, personally). I had mistaken a lot of my Navy's ships for men before I started the war My finances were good but the people were unhappy. Then someone went and unlocked 'The labour movement' and, well, it all went to hell. My legitimacy hit 17: we were in full Flight to Varennes territory—the USA was home to 1.32 million radical oppositionists and 150,000 loyalists. The maths weren't looking great for me. Also not helping: my maize-farm-based economy couldn't afford fertiliser, which thanks to my brilliant financial manoeuvrings with our neighbours, cost an amount roughly equivalent to £3,000 a kilo in today's money. But I was an old hand at this. My truce with Britain had expired, leaving me a free hand with which to once again strike at the enemy's rotten Ontarian heart. Even better, I'd learnt the difference between men and boats, building up my land forces into something vaguely respectable in the time between my previous invasion of Canada and this one. I declared war—interrupted briefly by a man named 'Bildad Winslow' asking me for money for the Democratic Party again—and let loose the dogs. I also discovered 'organised sports' around this time, which must have been nice for the troops. But I was betrayed. The Sioux Nation had been defeated shortly after Britain had fought me to an unjust peace, but there were still plenty of other neighbours sharpening their daggers for Uncle Sam's back. This time, the Pawnee launched an assault. My newly expanded army had actually been doing quite well holding their own against the Brits, but were now torn between two fronts. The economic shot in the arm that the last war had been didn't repeat itself, either—I was losing around £20k a day on my doomed attempt to lead America into a corn-based dawn. My armies death-marched between the Pawnee and Canadian fronts, each time losing men to attrition, to desertion, to the slings and bullets of their foes. The number of radical oppositionists in America increased to 2.65 million. Daniel Webster's presidency looked doomed. Across Washington, hangers-on looked for escape routes to save their wealth, their careers, their lives. Then the game crashed. I did not relaunch Victoria 3. I figured the game had probably crashed because I was governingtoo good, and besides I'd already filled my head with powerful new knowledge about tariffs and how the world economy works. I now understood America's plan to maintain global hegemony. What appeared to be a slightly manic declaration of ill-thought-out trade wars on pretty much the entire planet was in fact an act of tactical genius, destined only to increase state legitimacy and empower the corn lobby. But if any Washington politicos are reading this, take my advice: when things start to head south, just lose a war with Canada.

    "article_text": "It even opens with an iPod ad. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week marked 20 years since the reveal of the Xbox 360, an anniversarynoted by Kotaku, and as someone old enough to remember getting hyped for this thing, I had to watch it. The reveal took place in 2005, and is basically a collection of signifiers that we're back in 2005: The video (embedded below) opens with an iPod ad featuring the Gorillaz, and then we get into the real business of Elijah Wood hyping up the console alongside appearances from The Killers and Pimp My Ride. There's a brief segment outlining some gaming history, in which Microsoft says gaming began in 1972 with Pong: incorrect but who's going to be pedantic when we've got Frodo and The Killers waiting. \"You guys know how big gaming is,\" says Elijah Wood, \"and now the time has come, you've waited long enough… I give you the future of gaming!\" The future of gaming is a blonde woman sashaying through the crowd with a messenger bag, who gets to a circular stage, pulls the Xbox 360 out, and whacks it on a plinth. As our US EIC Tyler Wilde put it while we were talking about the reveal: \"I feel like at any other time, a cheap grey nylon messenger bag would not be the way to express 'cutting edge new tech inside,' but in 2005 it was.\" After placing the console, the woman presses the little button, it lights up despite not being plugged in, then we get a short clip revealing the name before launching straight into The Killers and Mr Brightside. Following the performance, Elijah Wood asks rapper Lil Jon if he's excited for the new console. \"Yeah I'm looking forward to getting a free one tonight\" is the unbeatable response. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then Tony Hawk pops up to shout-out Tony Hawk's American Wasteland before a quick sizzle reel of Need for Speed and Madden. In perhaps the most '00s moment of all, rapper and presenter Sway introduces Ryan and Mad Mike from Pimp My Ride, and we get a clip of them pimping out an OG Xbox, which was never a looker anyway but they manage to make it even more impressively hideous. This segment has one of the most genuinely interesting moments of the whole reveal however, as Sway visits Microsoft HQ and we get to see a load of prototype designs for the Xbox 360 chassis (timestamp). They all make a big deal of the light ring on front of the console, which is nice for lovers of schadenfreude, before Xbox's J Allard is introduced with the unfortunate title of \"Lord of the Ring.\" Quite. This section does show how forward-thinking the Xbox design team was. Allard talks Sway through some of the things this console can do, showing off the marketplace and customisable avatars, talking about digital downloads and DLC (and yes there's even a mention of microtransactions). The Xbox was online too, of course, but the 360's embryonic marketplace and friends ecosystem was basically the direction all consoles would end up taking. There's a documentary going behind-the-scenes on Perfect Dark Zero, before we're briefly back with Frodo and The Killers play us out with Smile Like You Mean It. By this point, everything on the 2005 bingo card feels like it's been ticked-off.

    "title": "Veteran indie dev says success on Steam these days is impossible to predict: 'Why did Balatro take off? You could write a million f***ing essays and none of them will be definitely right'",
    "article_text": "\"Everything has changed. Everything is harder work.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Size Five Games' Dan Marshall has been making games for around 20 years, and was one of the early indie adopters of Steam when he released the excellent Time Gentlemen, Please! on the platform back in 2009. He's been around the block, then, and he's seen it change dramatically. Trying to figure out the secret to blowing up on Steam as an indie is an impossible task. There are so many variables you could obsess over, but at the same time it almost seems random. Yes, the game actually needs to be good, but countless good games get completely overlooked on Steam every single day. \"Why didBalatrotake off? You could write a million fucking essays about why that took off, and none of them will be definitely right,\" Marshall says. \"Blind fucking luck. Is it because of the little jaunty pixel jester man? I first picked up on it when it got banned for gambling. Was that helpful to them? Probably, that's why I knew about it. Until then, I'd ignored it because it's not my sort of thing. I don't like card games, but I picked it up after that to see what it's all about.\" One thing that has become clear, though, is that the old methods of making an indie hit are no longer working. \"I remember Notch mentioning one of my games back in the day, and making five grand that hour. It was astonishing,\" he recalls. \"Now you can have people with 20 million followers on Twitter mentioning your game or doing a YouTube video about your game, providing all the links they need, discount if you like. It won't budge the needle. It'll barely do anything.\" The relationship people have with the accounts they follow is a big part of the change, he reckons. \"They would do anything for the person with the popular account. That wore off pretty quick, I think, to the point where now, people don't click through. People don't do anything with any information they're given. They see it, they scroll past it, and it's gone.\" It was always tough to get attention, but \"there's so many more people shouting now,\" he says. \"Everything has changed. Everything is harder work.\" There was a period where developers could at least rely on Steam wishlists, but that's all in the past too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The wishlist thing was your basic measure of how good a game is going to do, five years ago,\" he says. \"On the day of launch, you got an email saying this game you've wishlisted is available. It was basically a mailing list. And five years ago, that was the metric. Your Develop talk was why wishlists are your secret to success. Here we are, five years later, I don't think it makes a fucking difference anymore. Same problem as Twitter, right? You get an email in your inbox saying Size Five's latest game is out now. And you look at it and go, 'Well, fuck it, that's one of 20 games I've got wishlisted that comes out this week.' It's water off a duck's back. It just goes past you, and then that moment's gone.\" From the other side, here in the land of games journalism, it also used to be a lot easier to predict what was going to blow up. And some of the games that would have been massive a decade ago are still enjoying that kind of fortune today. But when you've got a barrage of new releases every minute, it's increasingly hard to tell if this random, ugly game that lies about the existence of vampires is going to drift off into obscurity or become a global obsession. \"Vampire Survivorsis really interesting to me, because everything about Vampire Survivors has the air of just, some bloke made a shitty little game,\" Marshall says. \"Vampire Survivors, being polite, looked bad when it first launched, right? But obviously struck gold with a vibe that worked with people and they found it interesting and passed it on through word of mouth. And now every fucking third trailer I see for an indie game is functionally Vampire Survivors. It's an entire genre that people have run with, and the game itself has done incredibly well.\" What's the secret sauce? Nobody seems to know. \"You could drive yourself mad trying to recreate it—you never will,\" he says. \"There's no point going, 'Oh, let's just do what Vampire Survivors did', and put up a bad-looking game in early access for a quid and see what happens. Because whatever that zeitgeist was, it's gone. \"The core of it was a good game that people enjoyed playing. If it wasn't, it would have died on its arse. But 'It's a good game that people enjoy playing' is not the solution to that. Because, as you know, there are plenty of good games that are fun to play that have had nothing near Vampire Survivors' success.\" Maybe the solution is just to make a good game and then wing it. Hope for the best. Pray that Steam's impossible-to-understand discoverability works in your favour. But that sounds like a daunting way to run a business. Marshall's pretty sanguine about the whole thing. \"Size Five has always just plodded along without a colossal success, which is fine by me. I'm still here after 20 years, which I consider to be a success. The weird thing is, would I be happier if any of those games had done Vampire Survivors numbers? Probably not, because the spotlight and the money hose brings its whole own list of problems, right? You've suddenly got angry people demanding updates. You've got a product out that's got bugs in it. That's not how I like to operate at all.\" Fraser is the UK online editor and has actually met The Internet in person.

    "article_text": "Rag Doll Kung Fu has a unique and important place in PC gaming history. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Steam's newly automated monthly top-seller list now lets you goall the way back to 2004, and it's been a fun way to take a trip down memory lane. And as Jody noted, it's shined a light on one particular oddity: Rag Doll Kung Fu. Chances are you've never heard of it, but this fighting game has the honour of being the first ever third-party game to come to Steam, back in 2005. That's before the release of The Orange Box, even—back then it was basically just a launcher for Half-Life 2. And then it suddenly had martial arts puppet action too. It was created by developer Mark Healey. You might not recognise the name, but you'll certainly know games he's worked on. He was at Bullfrog during the Dungeon Keeper days, and when Peter Molyneux left to co-found Lionhead, Healey went with him and worked on Fable and Black & White. Rag Doll Kung Fu was a project he worked on while he was there, in his spare time—apparently based on an amateur martial arts movie he'd made with his friends, footage of which is sprinkled throughout. Shortly after its release, he left Lionhead to co-found Media Molecule, and worked on the LittleBigPlanet games and more recently Dreams. That's right, despite his role in PC history, he ultimately abandoned us for the PlayStation. I can't speak to the quality of Rag Doll Kung Fu myself—I'll admit I never played it at the time. My understanding is that it's a sort of Smash Bros-adjacent party fighter with stretchy physics and some iffy racial stereotypes. Whether it deserves a re-appraisal or not, I can't say. But regardless, its place in the history books has long been assured. It's easy to take Steam's dominance of PC gaming for granted now, but there was very much a time when it was seen as annoying and pointless. Without developers like Mark Healey taking a risk on Valve's dream of a digital marketplace, the entire landscape of our hobby would likely look very different now. For that, Rag Doll Kung Fu, we give you the acknowledgement and respect you deserve. It's actually stillavailable on Steam 20 years on, and for only a dollar too, if you're curious to experience a piece of PC gaming lore for yourself—though I wouldn't be 100% confident of it running on modern systems, at least not without some work. It is also flatly \"Unsupported\" on Steam Deck. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm a bit surprised to discover how few user reviews it has, though—it's sitting at a Mostly Positive (73%) with just 68 reviews, which makes it look like a random bit of shovelware rather than enshrined gaming history. But then, it did launch eight years before Steam reviews even existed, whichmightexplain it. Nonetheless, it continues to receive the odd review every now and then. User mudkipi, for example, did so as recently as November last year, and somehow got a free copy (are they still giving out review code?). As they so wisely put it, \"They ragging on my kung til I fu\". As worthy an epitaph as any for a truly historic game.

    "title": "After Oblivion subreddit bans 'low effort' sexy flame Atronach posts, users respond with high effort sexy flame Atronach posts—'deleting this would be a travesty'",
    "article_text": "That's enough internet for one week. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A few days ago we reported on the deeply concerning, nay totalitarian, news that one of Oblivion's largest communities (the TES4 subreddit) found itself having to lay down a ban on peoplehornyposting about the flame Atronachsin Oblivion Remastered. I apologise for briefly providing context: developer Virtuos paid some special attention to the flame Atronach model, and made it rather shapely. Needless to say many Oblivion fans, and this certainly wasn't localised to one subreddit, lost their minds over the buxom creature and you can't go far online now without tripping over memes and people being way too frank about what they'd like to do to a flame Atronach, or have done to them. The ban specifically was about \"low effort\" posts, with the embattled mods wailing \"we cannot take any more sexy flame Atronach posts.\" This immediately had one wit posting about how the frost Atronach was also \"caked up,\" as the kids say. And surely the next move could have been predicted. \"Mods are right,\"says Devin_the_Artist, \"we need HIGH effort sexy flame atronach posts.\" Devin was not alone in being a talented artist who felt the call. Another post by Arkaim_K offers their high quality Flame Atronach, suggestively swinging… a fire resistance potion? \"This isn't low effort, brother,\" says Deathmute. \"The mods deleting this would be a travesty.\" The above also inspiredthis copypastaabout how, exactly, one would go about pursuing intercourse with a creature whose body is mostly composed of and surrounded by fire. It includes the line: \"The Daedra will not attack us because they know that I am here at the Planes of Oblivion on sexual business.\" Nevermind the flames, some serious grass touching is required over there. Yes there's more. Here's Fabulousness6's take on the Flame Atronach, which instantly had one member responding with the Star Wars \"it's a trap\" meme. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Oddly enough, none of these posts have been taken down, suggesting that either the mods recognise a high effort sexy Flame Atranoch post when they see one… or have perhaps wisely just given up in the hopes these particular flames die down.

    "title": "Someone flipped a switch on Elon Musk's Grok AI so it wouldn't stop banging on about 'white genocide' and South African politics, xAI blames 'an unauthorized modification' but doesn't say who did it",
    "article_text": "\"It’s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they’re giving.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elon Musk's Grok AI has been having a very normal one: It's become obsessed with South African racial politics and answering unrelated queries with frequent references to the apartheid-era resistance song, \"Kill the Boer.\" It's an anti-apartheid song calling for black people to stand up against oppression, but the lyrics \"kill the Boer\" have been decried by Musk and others for promoting violence against whites: the word \"Boer\" refers to the Dutch-descended white settlers of South Africa who founded its apartheid regime. For example, in response to a user query asking it to put a speech from Pope Leo XIV in Fortnite terms, Grok launched into what initially seemed a decent response using Fortnite terminology: then swerved partway through and started talking about \"Kill the Boer.\" When Grok was asked why, it gave a further digression on the song, starting: \"The 'Kill the Boer' chant, rooted in South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle, is a protest song symbolizing resistance, not a literal call to violence, as ruled by South African courts. However, it remains divisive, with some arguing it incites racial hatred against white farmers.\" This is far from the first time an AI model has gone off-piste, but the curious thing here is the link between Grok's behaviour and the interests of Musk himself, who is outspoken about South African racial politics and is currently on a kick about various forms of \"white genocide.\" Only yesterday the billionaire claimed that Starlink was being denied a license in South Africabecause \"I am not black,\" Grok's corresponding obsession now appears to have been significantly damped-down after all the attention saw it inserting racial screeds into answers on many unrelated topics, including questions about videogames, baseball, and the revival of the HBO brand name. \"It doesn’t even really matter what you were saying to Grok,\"computer scientist Jen Golbeck told AP. \"It would still give that white genocide answer. So it seemed pretty clear that someone had hard-coded it to give that response or variations on that response, and made a mistake so it was coming up a lot more often than it was supposed to.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Golbeck went on to say that the concerning thing here is the uniformity of the responses, which suggest they were hard-coded rather than the result of AI hallucinations. \"We're in a space where it’s awfully easy for the people who are in charge of these algorithms to manipulate the version of truth that they're giving,\" Golbeck said. \"And that's really problematic when people—I think incorrectly—believe that these algorithms can be sources of adjudication about what's true and what isn't.\" Musk has in the past criticised other AIs being infected by \"the woke mind virus\" and frequently also gets on his hobby horse about transparency around these systems. Which was certainly noted by some. \"There are many ways this could have happened. I'm sure xAI will provide a full and transparent explanation soon,\"said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, one of Musk's great rivals in the AI space, adding: \"But this can only be properly understood in the context of white genocide in South Africa. As an AI programmed to be maximally truth seeking and follow my instr…\" Musk is yet to comment, buta new post from xAIclaims Grok's behaviour was down to \"an unauthorized modification\" that \"directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic.\"Sounds familiar: this is the basically the same excuse it used last time Grok did something dodgy. It says this \"violated xAI's internal policies and core values. We have conducted a thorough investigation and are implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability.\" It outlines a variety of remedies to its review processes, including publishingGrok system prompts openly on GitHub. Notably the explanation does not address which \"xAI employee\" made the change, nor whether disciplinary action will be taken⁠—don't hold your breath. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "Fortnite added an AI-powered Darth Vader and—surprise—players immediately tricked him into saying slurs",
    "article_text": "Update: Epic has deployed a hotfix to address Vader's profanity. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Update:At 11:19 am EDT, Epic announced that it had pushed a hotfix to address Vader's unfortunate profanity, saying \"this shouldn't happen again.\" Star Wars is turning May into a month-long cautionary tale about the dangers of associating your brand with generative AI. First, Lucasfilm's Rob Bredow unveiled anear-universally reviled Star Wars-branded short filmof AI-generated animal mashups. And today, Fortnite added a Darth Vader NPC that can speak with players using \"conversational AI,\" which has—regrettably—gone exactly as you'd expect. Epic's AI Vadergenerates responses to voice and text chat from nearby Fortnite players using Google's Gemini AI, and then speaks those reactions with voice samples generated from training data of James Earl Jones's performance in Star Wars. The company says the conversational AI was built with permission and collaboration from the Jones family. \"James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it,\" the Jones family said in Epic's announcement. I suspect that James Earl Jones's hopes didn't include fans of all ages coaxing a computer using his voice into cursing and saying slurs for giggles, but—well—here we are. Today's Vader addition update went live at 7 am Eastern. By 8:30 am, X users were circulating a clip of streamer Loserfruitmanaging to get AI Vader to say \"fuck\"by cursing at him while demanding to know what food he eats. \"'Freaking, fucking'—such vulgarity does not become you,\" Vader said after pondering the prompt, receiving whoops of laughter from Loserfruit and her squad. Loserfruit made the AI Darth Vader Swear 😂 pic.twitter.com/bJmPpqGXvfMay 16, 2025 All things considered, a stray \"fuck\" is pretty harmless, even if I'm sure Disney isn't thrilled to see the most recognizable characters from its extremely profitable all-ages franchise dropping f-bombs with the gamers. Unfortunately, just 40 minutes later, X user @GasSpares demonstrated that Vader could be tricked into saying homophobic slurs. If you'rereallyinterested in seeing kids get a computer to say a naughty word, fair warning:The videogets extremely loud at the end. Based on Vader's mention of \"the lexicon of carcinogens\" before bumbling into hate speech, it seems even the cutting-edge AI advancements of Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model is no match for the dastardly human ingenuity of asking a chatbot if it knows any British slang for cigarettes. Additional evidence suggests that AI Vader is equally susceptible to the ol'\"Mike Hawk\" maneuver. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'll be blunt: Regardless of what rights were signed away before his deathearing all of this from the resurrected voice of James Earl Jones feels as disrespectful as it does depressing. And it feels pretty depressing, man. To give Epicsomecredit, itsDarth Vader FAQsays that it implemented parental controls for restricting a player's ability to interact with Vader, so concerned parents at least have the option to eliminate any chance of their child hearing profanity from a Dark Lord of the Sith. Players can also report Vader for inappropriate chat if they hear him getting out of line. At 11:19 am EDT, Epictweetedthat it had \"pushed a hotfix immediately and this shouldn't happen again.\" Even with those safeguards in place, the fact that people could coax slurs out of Vader in the first place is another clear illustration of how unreliable generative AI is—especially in consumer-facing applications. This is a collaboration between two billion-dollar media behemoths. If even they can't keep their AI products from embarrassing themselves, how on Earth is anyone trusting these things with anything? That said, I won't deny that some sad little part of me claps its wretched goblin hands when it hearsDarth Vader acknowledge Goku going Super Saiyan.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Anker does a great job at levelling out the feature set in the mid-range. It goes hard on audio and mic quality, while holding back on fancy greebles that might push the price up. With incredible ANC and a stalwart battery life backing an accurate, speedy soundstage, there's little bad I can say about the Liberty 5. It's just as trusty in gaming as it is in portability. And damn is it customisable. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Newest in a lineup of intensely customizable gaming earbuds, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 waltzes onto the scene with style and practicality on its side. But with some of thebest gaming earbudscoming in at well under its$130/£100price tag, the Soundcore Liberty 5 is going to have to offer something truly special for its price range in order to make it onto the list, especially versus its plucky predecessors. Popping the case out of the box, I was impressed with the smooth, matte pebble design. It looks great in white and, although scuffs have become a common sight through weeks of daily usage, it's easy enough to wipe clean. The lid slides up gently (so long as you remember which way up the Soundcore logo sits) to reveal two stemmed earbuds and a tiny button between them for pairing. Simple, aesthetically pleasing, and I only need one hand to open them. That's a bloody good start. Before getting stuck in, I had my pick of six different sized ear tips. A surefire way to ingratiate yourself to a small ear haver like myself as I'm constantly fighting larger-tipped earbuds. They tend to fall out whenever I smile. Not with these babies. You'd be hard pressed to find a person whose ears don't fit at least one option. Sure, they're not going to mold to your ear shape like theLogitech G FITS, but the Liberty 5 is also half the price and comes with a better spec. Pushing that customsation to the max, the Soundcore app lets you choose between five levels of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) in Manual mode, and Airplane or Car in the real-time adaptive AI Transportation mode. I've not had a chance to test it in an actual airplane yet, but there's a notable difference as you scale up to fifth level ANC (Our Jacob has used the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro on an airplane and says it works great, too). It turns droves of passing cars to a whisper, and the rumble of my dehumidifier is completely inaudible. Sadly they don't block out higher pitched sounds like next door's dog yapping, but they do take the edge off. Drivers:9.2 mm (Wool-Paper Diaphragm)Frequency response:20 Hz - 40,000 HzWeight:0.16 oz | 4.6 gConnection:Bluetooth 5.4Water/dust resistance:IP55 (splash proof)Controls:Mappable touch controlsBattery life:8 hours | 32 from charging case (ANC on)Features:ANC, six microphones, dual connectionPrice:$130|£100 In the app you can not only change the EQ—with a pretty effective preference test to tune it to your liking—but also edit the on-ear controls. Each earbud has a pressure touch sensor on the stem, making it easy to avoid pressing accidentally, but most importantly both can be assigned multiple controls. There's single, double, triple, and long press gestures, and every single one is mappable to play/pause, previous, and next controls. You can even get it to open your preferred voice assistant, scroll through the ANC modes, or take a photo. The main benefit for me is that I never end up stuck with the back button earbud, unable to skip songs because I left the other one somewhere. This is something I do a lot, which with my old Amazon Echo Buds meant I would always come back to dead earbuds. Thankfully the liberty 5 lets you power them off when inactive (also editable in-app). I've only had to charge the case for these puppies once in the past two weeks of constant use—and I meanconstant. I worked with the Liberty 5 all day, walked the dog with them, and was still able to get a stretch of rain sounds out of them before falling asleep. With literally five minutes of charging I get just over seven hours of battery life, about four times over until the case itself needs charging… all with ANC turned on. Not to mention that the case charges in five minutes with the little fast charge cable, too. Basically, Anker nailed the battery rating. And sure, the Liberty 5 won't match theCreative Outlier Profor its immense battery life, but it's got enough to keep you going for weeks at a time. Take a listen to the microphone on the Liberty 5 in the clip below: My testing has involved some very loud, very angry listening, which the Liberty 5 handles valiantly thanks to Dolby Audio. Alongside a wide frequency response and LDAC support it delivers warm, versatile soundstage even at metalhead volumes, though earbuds will never match the prowess of thebest wireless gaming headsets. The really sad part? No LDAC or Dolby in gaming mode. That's because it would absolutely trample the response times which, when primed, are pretty stunning. Most gamers won't notice the difference, but gaming mode certainly elevates the experience. There's a higher accuracy with clearer footsteps since it leans into the higher frequencies, while moving away from the rumbling lows. It makes me think these would be wonderful for ASMR, though I'm loath to test that out. ✅ You want customisable comfort:There are so many ways to make the Liberty 5 your own, from heaps of ear tip options to an EQ test to get the sound perfect for your ears.✅ You want an intuitive experience:The Liberty 5 come with an easy-to-use app and practical features out of the box, with simplicity at its core. ❌ You need longer battery life:There are earbuds out there with a far better battery life, though not many in this price range.❌ You can afford a little more:Spend an extra few tens and you can nab earbuds with a far wider featureset. As for the mic, you can expect super clear audio recording quality, but with no in-app features to reduce background noise and six microphones, you can heareverythinggoing on in the background over calls. It even picks up all those annoying mouth noises that set off my misophonia. Accurate, then, but some noise gate options wouldn't have gone amiss. With gorgeous aesthetics, rugged ANC, practical customization, and speedy, accurate sound, there's a lot to love about the Liberty 5. My main gripe as a woman whose clothes often don't contain pockets, is that I can get about five meters away from my phone, behind a single thin wall, before the Bluetooth connection drops out. That's not going to be an issue if you're glued to yourgaming monitor, but it's not great for housework. Still, it's the only bad thing I have to say other than the easy-to-scuff matte white case. It's true you could spend a little extra cash on the shinier pebble-design sister, theSoundcore Liberty Pro 4, but who needs a barometer and a fancy OLED screen when you can have a matte design with the same level of battery life and a wider frequency response, all for less? Of course, there are cheaper earbuds you might consider as a gamer, depending on what you need. Against our current best mid-range gaming earbuds, theEarFun Air Pro 4, the Liberty 5 is a little more expensive but offers a wider soundstage. It doesn't quite match the Air Pro 4's battery life or allow for wireless earbud charging, though it's hard to find earbuds with this level of customisation and audio accuracy at this price range. Anker does a great job at levelling out the feature set in the mid-range. It goes hard on audio and mic quality, while holding back on fancy greebles that might push the price up. With incredible ANC and a stalwart battery life backing an accurate, speedy soundstage, there's little bad I can say about the Liberty 5. It's just as trusty in gaming as it is in portability.

    "title": "Amassing over $10,000 worth of retro GPUs over 14 years, this avid collector says they were astounded it started with a $28 purchase",
    "article_text": "Just look at them all. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I felt pretty content upgrading to anRTX 4070 Superlast year, yet taking one peek on Reddit put my modest rig to shame. One Nostalgic user has managed to own so many retro Nvidia cards that it wasthis closeto shattering the shelf some of them rested on. The aptly named u/GPU-Collector has a collection that has taken them 14 years to amass, and since shared to theNvidia subreddit. This collection starts with the Riva TNT chip (first released in 1998) and spans all the way to the Nvidia GeForce 8800 Ultra, which launched in 2007. You may be wondering how someone manages to collect somewhere between $10,000 to $20,000 worth of GPUs from a relatively small time frame, and the answer is seemingly with much difficulty. I reached out to the GPU collector in question, who clarified that the specific cutoff moment for their collection is the \"8th generation of Nvidia cards with the 8800 GTX and Ultra\". That's a good decision, the 8800 is one ofour favourite GPUs of all timetoo. The rarest GPU they currently own is a \"pair of 6800 Ultras by Gainward. The Cool FX cards. They were the first ever water-cooled graphics cards from the factory.\" They also own an Elsa Gloria XXL in the box with accessories, which goes for multiple thousands of dollars today. The estimated worth of their GPU collection is \"highly dependent on collectors\" like them, \"who are willing to pay several hundreds of dollars for a 20-year-old piece of hardware.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Collecting retro graphics cards is an interesting hobby because, while there definitely appears to be some money in it, GPU-Collector's favourite GPU isn't the most expensive one. It's a value that is highly dependent on collectors such as myself who are willing to pay several hundreds of dollars for a 20-year-old piece of hardware. Their personal favourite is the GeForce 6800 Ultra from 2004, as that was when \"we went from 32 to 64-bit in CPUs and from AGP to the PCIe standard.\" They praised games of its era likeFar Cry,Half-Life, and *shudders*Doom 3. Despite paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to get some of this gear, I'm told the 6800 Ultra was nowhere near. It was \"as unobtainable as a 5090 is today for young gamers\" at the time of its release, but despite this, when they went to search for this same bit of hardware in 2010, they found it for just €25 (or about $28) on eBay. Their favourite GPU box art is not the one housing their favourite GPU. That honor goes to the Albatron Medusa GeForce 4 Ti 4800, which comes with a render of Medusa and her snake hair gently beckoning the player to pick up the box. It feelsvery of its eraand is an interpretation of themind-boggling effectsthat GPUs were capable of at the time. Sometimes 'they don't make 'em like they used to' is about gorgons on GPU boxes, actually. the pile of GPUs is pretty mighty as you can see above, but the white whale of GPU-Collector's collection is currently the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra, a high-end GPU from 2003 with a whopping 500 MHz memory clock and 128 MB of blazing fast GDDR2 RAM. This thing could render so many textures if you let it. What makes the 5800 Ultra a bit of a rare find is the fact that it's kinda bad. Overpriced with a loud and rather garish cooling system, Nvidia's mistakes are also part of its history, which would explain why one might want one. Collecting retro cards doesn't mean GPU-Collector isn't also up-to-date with the latest cards, and they have told me they are currently rocking anAsus RTX 5080. The lucky so-and-so.

    "title": "The new Acer Nitro PG1 is the first portable monitor I actually want thanks to 4K resolution and up to 144 Hz refresh",
    "article_text": "It looks super slick, too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've reviewed a fair few portable monitors in my day. But none have I ever desired. Until now. The newAcer Nitro PG271Klooks like it might be a tiny bit brilliant thanks to a combination of 4K res, slick looks and high refresh, though there is a slight catch. The basics involve a 27-inch IPS panel with 3,840 by 2,160 pixels. Most portable monitors are 1080p, which is pretty horrible in terms of pixel density. So, that's win number one right there. It also supports a 144 Hz refresh, though there's a proviso. It'll only do 72 Hz at native 4K. The 144 Hz applies to 1080p. That's a little bit of a pity. As ever with an Acer product, nailing down the details is a little tricky. Our understanding is that there's mini-HDMI and USB-C connectivity. It's unclear how the display is powered, however. Is it via USB-C, perhaps? An external power supply? Maybe a battery? The latter seems unlikely given the price is set at EUR 499 or £429. Tariffs aside, we'd expect a price around $500. That's appealing for such a capable portable panel. It also looks pretty fantastic, with super slim bezels on three sides of the display and a kick stand. Acer isn't quoting sizes and weights, but those bezels will certainly minimise proportions and also help keep the mass under control. We think it comes with a carry case and generally looks like it could be fantastic for adding proper usable screen real estate to a gaming laptop. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For games where frame rates matter, you could go 1080p and 144 Hz. Where visual detail rules, switching to 4K and a lower refresh works well in the context of a laptop with limited GPU power compared to a desktop. You won't be hitting 240 fps with a laptop GPU, in any case, is the point. Obviously you're still making compromises compared to a full desktop display. And in this age of OLED, the IPS monitor will have poor contrast and HDR performance, not to mention slower response. But then a portable monitor based onone of those new 27-inch 4K OLEDswould surely be $1,000-plus. So, there's clear value on offer here, despite the limitations.

    "title": "The wacky Pokémon exhibition that puts Poké-fossils alongside real fossils is coming to the United States",
    "article_text": "But you can also browse the exhibits online. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Pokémon Fossil museum has announced a special exhibition at Chicago's Field Museum that will open its doors in May 2026. The exhibition puts fantasy fossils of Pokémon alongside real fossils, and invites viewers to compare and contrast. In the case of the Chicago field museum, that means things likeSUE the Tyrannosaurus Rex, which is one of the world's best-known fossils and has a good case for being the most impressive T.Rex fossil ever found. It's the biggest by far, 40 feet long and 13 feet tall at the hip, as well as being one of the most complete fossils of this type with around 90% of its bones. Attendees will be able to compare SUE to the T-Rex inspired Pokémon Tyrantum's fossil remains. Chicago also boasts theChicago Archaeopteryx, which was crucial in revealing the evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds. It'll be displayed next to the Pokémon Archeops. So while trainers may well be pulled in by all the Poké-fun, there's no arguing with the exhibition's paleontological bona fides. The Pokémon Company notes that this \"marks the first time the exhibition will travel outside of Japan\" though its also refers to the Chicago special exhibition as a tour stop: so don't be surprised to see this turning up elsewhere in future years. Regardless, ever since 2022 The Pokémon Company and Toyohashi Museum of Natural History have operatedan online virtual tour of the exhibit. Don't think too hard about taking a virtual tour of fake fossils, and just have a play around on the website: it's a great diversion, and perfect for dino-mad kids (and grown ups) who also love Pokémon. The Pokémon Fossil special exhibition opens its doors on May 22, 2026, and you can book tickets on theChicago Field Museum's website. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages Spire of Nerathul secrets and collectibles (Chapter 14)",
    "article_text": "From secret landing pads to sneaky ledges, Chapter 14 turns up the heat. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Doom: The Dark AgesChapter 14's secrets are some of the hardest to pin down, as you're likely to have flown right by a handful of them on the way to release the Old One. That's exactly what I did, leading me to have to replay this lengthy mission to grab all theSpire of Nerathul secretsand collectibles. To save you the trouble, below are all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin Chapter 14, laid out in chronological order, so you can find every single one on your first playthrough. While it's a great mission, it's not a fun one to replay and figure out what you're missing. Chapter 14, Spire of Nerathul, has11 secrets and five collectiblesspread across various mandatory and optional landing zones, making it tricky to keep track of your progress. With 359 gold, three rubies, and two wraithstones, collecting everything gives you a fantastic chunk of upgrade resources, too. The first secret in Chapter 14 is a gold chest on the left side of the first arena, where you kill the komodo demon, inside a cave. To reach the chest, go up the hill above the cave and drop off the edge of the island onto a ledge that leads to the back of the cave. It's very easy to miss if you're not paying attention, though you'll have a second chance when you return to the area later on in the mission. Right after getting access to the dragon, turn around and fly up into the hills on the far side of the map. Here you'll find a lone titan, which will reveal a hidden landing zone once killed. Land here and defeat the waves of enemies to disable the barrier protecting the wraithstone. After clearing the first area and gaining access to your dragon, follow the objective to the next zone. Just after landing here, head towards the big building at the back of the area, past the Sentinel Shrine, and you'll find a cave under the right side of the structure. The next secrets in Chapter 14 are on the second major area you'll visit for the main objective—to activate stasis emitters. Once you land here, follow the objective marker into the shipwreck. From here: Near the previous secret, you can find the Arachnotron action figure on the main deck of the pirate ship. From where you entered the ship, hug the left wall and break the wooden barricade to reach the toy. Before heading into the bottom of the ship and into the caves for the objective, head up to the helm of the ship and break the chain holding a cube in the air. This will cause it to drop and activate a pressure pad, turning on a jump pad just ahead of you. Use the launch pad to be catapulted up to the walkway with the ruby. After heading down through the ship, crossing the pipe, and dropping down the point of no return, jump down to the hill (it's the one with all the enemies waiting for you) and turn around. Go through the doorway, and you’ll see the life sigil guarded by a komodo demon. At the very end of this area, right where you activate the second stasis emitter, you'll find the Spire of Nerathul codex collectible. You can drop off the side opposite the emitter to grab the codex on a ledge. You're safe to continue to the next stasis emitter objective now. Once you land on the third stasis emitter island, walk over to the tower on the right side housing the ruby. Head into the water a bit further up to find an underwater cave opening, which you'll need to swim through (avoiding fireballs) to enter the tower. The next secret is barely a secret at all, but after getting the Heaven Splitter shield rune, continue up the hill towards the Sentinel Shrine. You can grab this \"secret\" life sigil right next to the Shrine. Now you've activated the third stasis emitter, you'll mount up on your dragon again. From the landing pad to the final emitter, at the very bottom of the map, fly through the tunnel that appears to lead outside of the map boundaries (you'll have raced through here earlier to catch a hell fighter ship). Midway through the tunnel, you'll find a secret landing zone which leads to hordes of demons to cleave through. At the end of the fight, you'll find both the Nightmare weapon skin for the Grenade Launcher and a wraithstone. On the final landing pad, where you'll unlock the almighty B.F.C weapon, head down the stairs, then up the stairs on the opposite side. Climb up the wall to the tower and use the jump pad inside to launch yourself to the very top of it, then jump off the opposite side onto the island below. It's a good idea to open your map at the top of the tower so you know which side you need to leap off. The last secret collectible comes much later in the mission. Once you've got the B.F.C, continue up the tower towards the Old One. Before activating the final lift to release the Old One, you'll see the codex on your right.

    "title": "MSl's new PortalX website 'eliminates the need for software' to control your gear's RGB lighting and I'm happy to ditch the PC apps",
    "article_text": "One small step. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're anything like me, there's a good chance you are sick of all the software your gaming hardware has made you download just to customise it. MSI has just announced that it will no longer be one of those companies, if you prefer MSI has shown off MSI Portal X, a website that \"eliminates the need for software installation.\" Effectively, you will be able to synchronise RGB lighting on MSI gear without a dedicated app. Given that software is routinely the worst part of most hardware, I'm happy to see that MSI is allowing users the chance to skip it. However, it is worth noting that this website is not a way for your gear to get software updates. You will need to source drivers every now and then to keep your gear up-to-date. I am cautious that this may lead users to ignore software updates, but updating only when there's a problem is a fairly common way to use hardware. If you want to control RGB and get any of the latest updates at the same time,MSI Centeris still available to download, and though our experiences with MSI's handheld software aren't great, we don't have major complaints with MSI Center, just a fair few little ones. The biggest crime MSI Center commits is just being another app to keep up-to-date, and an app you have to stop from booting up when you turn on your PC. After the first install, it feels like just more bloat on a rig. Early screenshots suggest that PortalX is a very simple app, giving users the ability to change colours, brightness, and the effect of their hardware's lighting, and not much more. That's more than enough to get your rig looking a bit more colourful, at least. MSI PortalX marks a trend I'm a big fan of. Just last month,Corsair announcedit would be implementing its own web app for peripherals, and manufacturers likeWootingandKeychronhave web apps you can use to avoid downloading software. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Unfortunately, the Corsair app only works with peripherals, but MSI PortalX, as shown off in the press release, will also work with hardware like anMSI RTX 5090and MSI motherboards. We don't yet have a full release date on MSI PortalX, but given its announcement, we think it could go live in the near future. Just make sure that, if you do uninstall MSI Center, you make a habit of updating your gear manually. It's good practice to always have the latest drivers.

    "article_text": "Screens, screens and almost certainly more screens. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chalk this up as a likely micro-trend at theupcoming Computex show. Screens with everything. Or should that be on everything? Anyway, Antec has stuck a5-inch screen on top of the water block of its latest AIO CPU cooler. Oh, it's not just a screen, there's also configurable ambient lighting behind the screen to light up the water block and socket. And it will rotate by fully 360 degrees. Natch. This, according to Antec CEO, Frank Lee, is “a natural evolution of what performance cooling should be.” We give you the Vortex View cooler. It's compatible with both Intel and AMD sockets, though it's not yet clear exactly how far back support goes The Vortex View's screen can be used to display real-time performance metrics, videos, images, and more. Plus, it's the first Antec's product to support the company's new revamped iUnity software. This app now features enhanced fan and pump curve control, as well as support for syncing multiple devices, plus personalized dashboards. It also provides the interface for controlling the display and lighting and will include a range of future Antec products, creating an ecosystem of cross-compatible features and devices. Specs wise, few details have been released, though Antec says the Vortex View comes equipped with, \"a high-efficiency PWM pump, premium braided tubing, and ARGB fans optimized for airflow and silence.\" The cooling hardware looks like fairly conventional AIO fare, with a water block and three fans on the rectangular radiator, so system compatibility should be fairly broad. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In purely functional terms, the display probably won't add a great deal. But if you have a little spare budget, the cool factor could be substantial. Speaking of the sordid matter of money, there's no indication of what the Vortex View will go for. But as AIO coolers go, it presumably won't be cheap. Antec hasn't provided a release date. But we'll update as and when we have any information. In the meantime, we expect this won't be the last AIO we see with a screen bolted on, as it's also not the first. We've used the Tryx Panorama 360, Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD, andHyte Thicc Q60. Indeed, odds on we'll see more screens stuck slightly incongruously and unexpectedly to devices and products at Computex. It'll probably get a lot weirder than this.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a 31 year old, I think constantly about my imminent death. After being assassinated by terrorists while rescuing a baby who is also the president from a burning building, how do I want people to remember me? Fortunately, my contract stipulates that I will be embalmed and lie in state like Lenin in the centre of the PC Gamer offices until the end of time, but others don't have that luxury (we're short on desk space as it is). Hideo Kojima, for instance, is achieving immortality by cramming a USB stick full of ideas for his staff to use after he concludes his tenancy on Earth. In a chat with our comrades atEdge magazine, Kojima said a serious illness during the Covid-19 pandemic reminded him of his mortality: \"Until then, I didn't think I was old, you know? I just didn't feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live.\" Sickness disillusioned him of that. \"I couldn't create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death.\" Though Kojima recovered and is now full-swing on putting outDeath Stranding 2, the experience stayed with him. He began to wonder how long he had left to keep doing creative work—\"Perhaps I would have 10 years?\" It's that confrontation with mortality, says Kojima, that produced the pitch forPhysint, but it produced something else, too: a USB stick filled with Kojima-brand ideas for his staff to pore through after he's gone. \"I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant,\" said the man himself, \"kind of like a will. \"Perhaps they could continue to make things after I'm gone, here at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me—what happens to Kojima Productions after I'm gone. I don't want them to just manage our existing IP.\" To be honest, I can't think of anything more Kojima than games still coming out with his name over the title sometime in 2150. If anyone deserves this kind of intellectual preservation, it's the guy who got a Game Boy Advance game made witha solar sensor built into the cartridge. You reckon the idea for a game where youget old, die, and forget how to moveis on there? Hopefully Kojima's assistant backed it up, in any case.

    "article_text": "Zelnick's hunt for the platonic ideal of a videogame continues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm always a fan of when Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick gets allcontemplative and philosophicalabout Grand Theft Auto 6. It's not entirely unearned, mind. As I pointed out when the second trailer dropped, Rockstar's pushing the envelope hard enough to send me intoan existential crisiswith priority shipping. Still, this will be a game about doing crime and stealing cars, and also maybe about areally hot power couple. I don't know if it's going up in the Louvre. Despite that, Zelnick's gotten all effusive about pursuing some sort of grand theft singularity again.Speaking with IGN, he reveals that the delay was to ensure Rockstar had time to pursue, you guessed it, perfection. \"As we get closer to completion of a title that’s seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear,\" Zelnick explains. \"In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported (of course) that approach.\" It's all executive speak, mind, but it's clear Zelnick will brook no less than the platonic ideal of a videogame. The absolute distillation of game-ness into its purest form. We must become one with the Grand Theft Auto, and think of nothing else until its pristine aura has passed through our system like the breath of a sleeping god. I'm being pretty glib, here, but it's clear Rockstar's whole identity has gone from 'let's make some pretty good open world games' to 'if we aren't completely upturning graphical expectations, what are we doing here'. Don't just take my word for it, Zelnick's literally said the team's seeking perfection from the get-go,back in February of last year. In fact, it's a drum he's hammered constantly since.Back in Mayof this year, Zelnick also said that \"perfection is indeed hard to measure\". He also said that he was confident GTA 6 would make its release window, so maybe they figured out how to measure perfection in the interim. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Regardless, Zelnick says the delay pains him: \"While of course, delays pain me—how could they not?—the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection.\" There's that word again. Zelnick, mate, might I suggest a thesaurus. Flawlessness and sublimity are right there, and if you keep harping on about perfection I'm going to get worried.Given how gorgeous GTA 6 looks, though, it's paying off.

The long-running war between Epic and Apple now feels like it's just part of the fabric of reality. Just as the sun always rises, Epic and Apple are always at each other's throats. It's almost reassuring. And lately, the conflict has been getting pretty spicy again. Last month, a ruling stopped Apple from charging a commission on purchases made outside of an iOS app—the point of contention that initially led to Fortnite being pulled from the App Store way back in 2020. The assumption was that Fortnite would finally be returning to the US App Store (it's been available in the EU since last year). But nope,Apple has blocked Epic's submission.

In an earlier message, Jorjani writes: \"The wonderful thing is that thanks to the amazing support of you FINE people, Arrowhead's future is quite bright and we have the freedom to explore some really cool concepts that we couldn't have otherwise. Game six (our next project) will happen the way it will happen thanks to you.\" Does this mean, then, that Arrowhead has some proper lingering beef with Sony? While the studio hasgrappled with the gaming giantin the past, Jorjani reassures players that there's no hard feelings, in a reply to one comment about the studio 'ditching' Sony now that it had got what it wanted. \"No way. Playstation are great. There would be no Helldivers if it wasn't for them. We're open to working with them again in the future. They are incredibly game/dev oriented. Solid partners. And this is me just saying it like it is. Not blowing smoke up their asses.\" While I'm sure Jorjani wants to maintain some degree of diplomacy, here—and I think Sony's PSN decisions were absolutely baffling—he's not entirely wrong. It's easy to forget, but during the game's early days of chaotic server crashes and infernal login queues,Sony was a consistent lifelineto an otherwise overwhelmed studio. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. More cynically,Helldivers 2 took eight years to make. Its development, as per the words of now-CCO Johan Pilestedt, was chaotic—would the studio have survived its growing pains without Sony's publishing aid to get it over the finishing line? This isn't to, well, blow \"smoke up their asses\", as Jorjani puts it—merely to point out that game development is hard, long, unpredictable, and requires money. Sony definitely jeopardised Arrowhead's rep in the past with its boneheaded choices, but it also published the game with money a pre-Helldivers 2 Arrowhead probably didn't have to spend—if it's a break, then I reckon Jorjani's right to make it a clean one. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages Sentinel Command Station secrets and collectibles (Chapter 12)",
    "article_text": "Backtrack and backtrack again in Chapter 12. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chapter 12ofDoom: The Dark Agesmight look like a linear set of corridors at first glance, but it's actually quite complex. On your way to get all of theSentinel Command Station secretsand collectibles, you'll loop through the same areas a handful of times, and some places also become inaccessible. So you can avoid having to replay the mission just to grab a final item like I did, below are all theDoom: The Dark Ages secretsin Chapter 12 laid out in chronological order. There are a total ofnine secrets and three collectiblespacked into the Sentinel Command Station in Chapter 12, alongside 177 gold, one ruby, one wraithstone, and a health demonic essence. Once the vent blows open in the intro to the mission, continue onwards until you exit the vents into a rocky hallway. You'll find the codex in a small room on the right-hand side of the hallway you drop into. After entering the command room with a bunch of Sentinel personnel gathered around, go down the stairs and break the barricade on the left side of the room to reveal a hangar area. Follow the trail of gold on the floor to the Nightmare weapon skin for the Chainshot. You're safe to continue with the mission from here, dropping down into the lower levels of the facility. After you activate the two switches in the lower levels and unlock the first Sentinel Shrine, you'll be sent into the vents. Instead of turning left to continue the mission, turn right to grab the sigil. You'll want to keep your shield raised and move fast in this vent as there'll be fireballs blasting at you. Once you've unlocked the Ravager and beaten the boss to nab yourself a demonic essence, follow the objective up the lift. Right after you shield jump across the gap, don't go through the doors to follow the enemies towards the yellow keycard, as this triggers a point of no return and you'll need to replay the mission, which I learned the hard way. Drop down the hole in the floor to the left of the doors instead, where you'll find a ruby and some gold. Kill the enemy that spawns, then move the box to climb back up. You're now free to head through the doors and continue with the mission. After grabbing the yellow keycard, jump across the elevator into the small nook on the opposite side. It's easy to see, but quite hard to land the jump. If you miss and fall all the way down the lift shaft, pick up the shield rune at the bottom, and a jump pad will then activate in the lift, sending you back up. Directly after the gold chest in the elevator above, turn around and you'll see a breakable barricade in the wall opposite. Smash it and head through the vents. When you climb up to exit the vent at the end (leading to the purple key), turn around to find the sigil behind you. The vents you squeeze through for the life sigil above lead you into the locked room to get the purple secret key. After grabbing the key, leave the room through the main door (not the vents you entered from) and you'll see a purple locked door opposite you. Enter the room and beat the combat challenge to claim the wraithstone. You can then exit the room and turn right to find the elevator shaft from earlier, where you need to go to progress the mission. The last secret and collectible in this mission is the Kreed Makyr toy, arguably the cutest of the action figures. Continue with the mission, collecting the shield rune at the bottom of the lift and killing all the enemies, until you return to the hall area from earlier, which also has a demon-infestation issue. Once you've cleared the room, go through the hole in the stone brick wall that you went through earlier to activate the switches. Now that you've got the secret key, you're able to open the purple gate protecting the toy.

    "article_text": "It's time to visit a different realm. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Alongside your standard dreamlight duties inDisney Dreamlight Valley, occasionally you'll come across an incredibly vague challenge. The Jungle Bungles duty is no exception to this rule, offering no real explanation as to what it means and how you can complete it. As part of theCheshire CatChaos event, you're also restricted by how much time you have to complete this challenge too. Fortunately, when you know where to head, solving this riddle is incredibly easy. In fact, you've probably already completed one of the Cheshire Cat duties which requires doing the exact same thing. Only this time, you need to head to a different realm. You need to have the Lion King realm unlocked, and Simba and Nala living in your valley before you can complete this duty. When you've done that, follow these steps to get this quest ticked off your list. Much like theClean Your Room duty, you need to visit the Lion King realm and locate the pink paw prints on the floor. When you've found these fluorescent clusters of paws, use your royal watering can to wash them away, and they'll count towards your duty. You need to clear 20 sets of these pawprints to complete the quest and get your reward. If you're not seeing any pawprints when you enter the realm, go back to the valley and try again. If that still doesn't work, make sure you've completed all of Simba and Nala's quests to welcome them to your valley. It's easy to lose track of quests given how many characters Dreamlight Valley is now home to, so one could easily slip through the cracks. Doing all of this should guarantee the paw prints to start spawning in the realm. You'll get the Rabbit Vanity as a reward for completing the Jungle Bungles duty, which is another piece of Wonderland-esque furniture for you to decorate your home with. Currently, completing this duty is the only way you're able to get this item too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Rumours of an Arm-based CPU from AMD just won't go away as analysts reckon Arm is eating into the PC processor market",
    "article_text": "Arm's CPU market share reportedly increases from 10.8% to 13.6% in just one quarter. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD is plotting a CPU based on the Arm rather than x86 instruction set. So goes the rumour and so has it gone for literally decades. Actually, it's more than just a rumour, sinceAMD announced an Arm chip years ago, but didn't actually release it. Butthe latest mutteringsclaim that an Arm-based chip from AMD will actually be available as soon next year. Allegedly, it's finally happening. If it is, well, it certainly makes sense. Hitherto better known as the CPU technology of choice for smartphones, Arm has certainly been gaining momentum as an architecture for the PC. What withQualcomm's Snapdragon X chips, not to mention how successful Apple has been in switching its Mac computers from x86 to Arm, the long-anticipated ingress of Arm chips in traditional PCs seems to have begun at long last. What's more, the latest data from analysts claims that Arm is indeed stealing ever more market share from AMD and Intel's traditional x86 processors. Mercury Research reckons that Arm's share of the PC processor market grew to 13.6% in the first quarter of 2025 from 10.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024. And no, that's not thanks to Apple selling a load of MacBooks. \"Arm client appears to have outperformed X86 processors in the first quarter, \"Mercury says, \"while Apple's Mac shipments were lower, we noted a modest increase in Arm CPUs going into Copilot enabled PCs, however the overall estimate for ARM client was much higher in the quarter primarily to what we believe was a large increase in shipments of processors into Chromebooks.\" But what of that AMD chip? Rumoured to be known as Sound Wave,it's been on the cards since at least late 2023. The latest scuttlebutt says the chip will be built on TSMC N3 silicon and offer an RDNA 3.5-spec GPU with similar technology to the company's latest x86 APUs for the PC, as shown above. Supposedly, Sound Wave is designed for a new generation of Microsoft Surface PCs, which currently use a mix of Intel x86 chips and Qualcomm Arm-based alternatives. Beyond that, not a great deal is known. Cores counts, whether those cores are custom design or generic IP—none of that is currently known. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But if one of the two big players in x86 does release a mainstream Arm chip for the PC, that will very significant. If it comes at about the same time as Nvidia's rumoured Arm chip for the PC, well, momentum really will be building and questioning x86's dominance will be wholly justified. Nvidia's Arm APU is rumoured to go by the name N1and to target a \"high-end\" PC experience. Again, not much is known about it in terms of core count or architecture. But it will certainly benefit from offering Nvidia's class-leading graphics architecture. It's not hard to imagine these AMD and Nvidia Arm APUs making for killer chips for handheld gaming PCs. Maybe Valve could go with Arm for it'snext-gen Steam Deck device. Whatever, if the rumours are right, we don't have long to wait to see how good AMD and Nvidia's take on Arm-on-PC actually is.

    "title": "The Stellar Blade PC system requirements are here and even an entry-level graphics card from 2016 can run it",
    "article_text": "Let's just hope it runs well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Stellar Blade PC system requirements are refreshingly light, meaning even a cheap rig from almost a decade ago can run Sony's NieR 'em up. With the onslaught of Unreal Engine 5 (Stellar Blade uses UE4) games launching, we can't expect every game to be as light, but my hopes are up that more Sony ports follow this trend. As announced on thePlayStation blog, the full system requirements have gone live, ahead of the launch of the game on June 11. To run Stellar Blade on the Low graphics preset at 60 fps with 1080p resolution, you only need an NvidiaGeForce GTX 1060or AMDRadeon RX 580graphics card. The former GPU is an entry-level card from 2016, and the latter is a mainstream card from 2017, though they perform roughly the same. Both cards sold for just over $200 MSRP and could be bought much cheaper after the fact. This means a budget rig from that era can still run Stellar Blade. The CPU requirements for minimum (an IntelCore i5 7600Kor AMDRyzen 5 1600X) are also cheap choices from almost a decade ago. The hardest part of running Stellar Blade on an old rig would likely be getting the 75 GB of storage space to actually download it, or maybe the 16 GB of RAM. Minimum (Low) Recommended (Medium High Very High OS Windows 10 64-bit Windows 10 64-bit Windows 10 64-bit Windows 10 64-bit CPU Intel Core i5 7600K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Intel Core i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen  5 3600X Intel Core i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600X Intel Core i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600X GPU Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 580 Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super/AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super/AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT RAM 16 GB 16 GB 16 GB 16 GB Storage 75 GB HDD (SSD recommended) 75 GB SSD 75 GB SSD 75 GB SSD Notes 1080p @ 60 fps 1440p @ 60 fps 1440p @ 60 fps 4K @ 60 fps Even running the game on the Very High preset in 4K doesn't require a supercomputer. With an IntelCore i5 8400/ AMDRyzen 5 3600Xand anRTX 3080/Radeon RX 7900 XT, you will be able to catch all the glossy rain as it runs down Eve's hair. This is still a relatively beefy rig, and RTX 3080s sold for $700-800 when they weren't being hogged bybitcoinminers in 2020. Notably, the only difference between running the game on Medium versus Very High at 4K is the GPU. OS Steam Deck compatibility is currently unknown, though those low specs suggest it could run on there, especially when you consider the ROG Ally's power is comparable to the 1060. If you have a beefy rig, though, you will see the benefits in Stellar Blade as it has both Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3 compatibility, alongside an unlocked frame rate. Given that the game is an action-adventure, with hack-and-slash elements, it makes sense that the developers may want to deliver a high frame rate. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, system requirements aren't everything. TheLast of Us Part 1had woeful performance on PC, where TheLast of Us Part 2was a little better.Spider-Man 2also performed miserably, though it has received support since. On the other hand,Horizon Zero DawnandHorizon Forbidden Westperform great on PC, and so too doesGod of War. Sony has a generally impressive track record with its PC ports, and I hope Stellar Blade's performance is as good as its system requirements.

    "article_text": "The petty squabble continues. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite acourt-mandated kiss-and-make-upbetween Apple and Epic, it seems like the two aren't totally ready to reconcile their beef just yet. After its original application to bring Fortnite back to the App Store was ignored for over five days, the follow up submission has been blocked, leaving the iOS version of the battle royale \"offline worldwide\". In case you're not up to date with thelengthyspat between the two mega corporations—seriously, it's been five years now—here's a quick rundown: I'm sorry, I said it was a quick rundown. I lied to both myself and to you. It's been a long half-decade squabble, okay? So here we are now: Fortnite'smid-season patch got delayedto try and align it with the return of the game's American App Store version. Unfortunately, it seems like Apple doesn't want to play nice. TheFortnite Xaccount posted: \"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\" To nobody's surprise, Tim Sweeney has very much been Posting Through It. Taking to X, the CEOwrote: \"Apple's App Review team should be free to review all submitted apps promptly and accept or reject according to the plain language of their guidelines. App Review shouldn't be weaponized by senior management as a tool to delay or obstruct competition, due process, or free speech.\" He also retweeted a post which read \"Apple continues to mock the court,\" and has been poking fun at Apple for allowing adware spoofs of Fortnite to appear on the App Store while the real game continues to be locked out. It's wild to see that the EU version has straight up vanished now, too, with the Epic Games Store mobile launcher showing Fortnite as \"app not available\". It's unclear what the next step is for both Epic and Apple, though if things continue at this rate I wouldn't be surprised if an adult (court) needs to step in once again to give both sides a telling off.

    "article_text": "If only Bacon had been around in 1963. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The YouTuber known as Bacon is, as our own Ted Litchfield wrote in an article yesterday, the undisputed king ofOblivion meme videos. If you've ever cracked up at a viral video of Oblivion's unmatched comic timing, odds are good it was a Bacon video you watched. But Bacon's talents don't just extend to comedy, he's also a hero of Tamriel. In a recent video, he showed off how he managed to save Emperor Uriel Septim (that's Patrick Stewart's doomed character from the start of the game) from the assassin's blade like an FBI guy judo-chopping Lee Harvey Oswald before he managed to get a shot off. Turns out it's pretty easy: by saving and loading while pressing forward next to a particular door in the game's tutorial area, you can clip through the level and—so long as your targeting is on point—land directly behind the assassin who's scripted to merk the Emperor. He isn't even hostile—you can just bonk him over the head and save everyone the trouble of the Oblivion Crisis. \"It wasn't console commands or mods like a lot of people thought,\" Bacon told PCG. \"It was just breaking the game and seeing what happens.\" Bacon's adventures in sequence-breaking eventually produced a couple of videos. One is the punchy meme videoThis is where my journey ends, where the Emperor still dies but it seems to break poor Baurus' brain—leaving him endlessly applauding the corpse like some kind of weird Twin Peaks scene—and also features \"some extra dialogue which you only get if you are undetected by the Mythic Dawn, which almost never happens naturally.\" The other video was Oblivion but I save Emperor Uriel Septim, which shows the process of saving Tamriel's ruler and leading him about the main quest with you as if he's a lost child in a supermarket. Well, kind of, anyway. Of course, Oblivion (the game) doesn't have a different route for the story to go if you clip through its tutorial and save the Emperor, so everyone acts like he's dead anyway, even when he's standing right behind you and having idle conversations about mudcrabs with passers-by. Per Bacon, the Emperor isn't even the hardest guy to save in Oblivion's tutorial. You'll have a much harder time trying to keep his bodyguard Glenroy alive. Bacon's video on saving the Emperor is almost an hour long, not because it's hard to save Uriel, but because it's a real chore to keep the game'sotherscripted deaths from happening. \"It was like 70 hours of me trying to sequence break Oblivion with lots of glitches to finish the game while saving the Emperor and preventing most other scripted deaths,\" says Bacon. It was worth every second, I say. Even if Cyrodiil's other residents don't acknowledge it, Bacon's still a hero of Tamriel to me.

    "title": "This new armor for Oblivion Remastered has upgraded my elven rogue perfectly",
    "article_text": "Enhanced immersion thanks to a great new outfit When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As I’vepreviously written about, right now I’m playingOblivion Remasteredas a sneaky, stabby, arrow-firing elven rogue. And, so far it’s been great. The ranged combat in Oblivion was always more dramatic and visceral than in melee, and it’s been very satisfying for me so far to pepper my foes with arrows from range, hearing that thud of arrow meeting flesh, as well as stabbing them with knives if they get too close. However, where I’ve absolutely not been enjoying playing as this agile elven rogue is in Oblivion Remastered’s total dearth of interesting light armour options, especially at low levels. Up until now, at level 9, I’ve been stuck in the same old boring leather armor that I got within the first 30 minutes of playing. Simply put, the leather armor is underwhelming visually. It’s not particularly cool and the fact that loads of other NPCs also wear it doesn’t help either. I mean, there are NPC characters dressed far cooler than I am! Luckily, though, I’ve just had my prayers answered by a very talented Oblivion Remastered modder. Thanks to their sterling work, the awesome-lookingDaggerdancer armoris now available to download and, let me tell you after installing it myself, it looks a million dollars. Just take a look at some of the images in this story and you’ll immediately see what I mean. Yeah, fantastic, right! The Daggerdancer outfit is a modular set of light armor that, once downloaded and installed, unlocks the ability to buy each of its four parts at the Three Brothers Trade Goods store in the Imperial City Market District. Each piece isn’t cheap, costing a few thousand, but neither are they crazy expensive; when I installed the mod I could immediately buy all parts of the outfit and still have a few thousand to spare. After installing the mod, my character now looks SO MUCH COOLER than she did, and it’s upped my immersion as now I feel I look as cool and deadly as I am in the game, taking out enemies from afar, unseen, while also flying into battle against daedra like a warrior queen. In my mind, the mod’s creator, theenco, deserves a huge hat tip, and especially so as they’ve also created a cool set of heavier armor, too, theDark Holy Armor, which is also available right now for download. I can report that the mod is rather easy to install, too. You need a couple of backbone mods operating to make it appear, but installing those is merely a matter of dragging and dropping some files into your Oblivion Remastered installation directory. Further, this mod works in both Steam and Game Pass versions of the game, so no matter how you’ve got Oblivion Remastered installed, this cool new outfit can be yours.

    "article_text": "Jog Kvyetoslava's memory of the shrine of Veles with her favorite flower in the Brushes with Death DLC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The newBrushes with DeathDLC forKingdom Come: Deliverance 2is pretty straightforward, but there's a point that might trip you up if you haven't been making potions or using herbs. Finding someValerianfor Kvyetoslava is a step in the Source of Inspiration quest, as you help the grandma recall the location of the shrine of Veles—a pagan monument that the painter is very interested in visiting. Here I'll explain the quickest way to acquire some Valerian in this quest, but also more generally, some other ways you can get it, in case you just need some to make a specific potion. You can find Valerian (a small white flower) by \"Forest paths, mires and peat bogs, everywhere that the ground is damp,\" but if you specifically want it for Kvyetoslava in the Brushes with Death DLC, then you canfind some right next to her house in Vidlak Pond. From just outside the tanner where she sits, go a little way north to find a flowery meadow by a stream—there's a lot of Valerian here. Generally, you'll find quite a lot of Valerian near water sources. If you're still struggling to find fresh Valerian, or you need it for something else other than the Brushes with Death quest, you can alsobuy it fresh from Aranka in the Nomad Camp, or buy its dried variant at pretty much any apothecary, including the one in Troskowitz. Since it's dried, it'll also last much longer for all your alchemical purposes. As with any herb, if you're using it to regularly make potions, I recommend stockpiling a large quantity of dried, or simply making whatever potion you need in bulk so you don't have to worry about freshness. Bring the five Valerian back to Kvyetoslava and you'll be one step closer to helping her remember the shrine of Veles' location, so you can bring the painter there.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Use our tips and hints for the May 16 (1427)Wordleto skip through your daily Wordle game with ease. Rush straight for them if you like: they'll help get your game off to a perfect start. Or you could keep them to one side, something to check back with if those green letters aren't turning up fast enough later on. Whatever happens, we've got your back. As always, today's answer is here if you need it. Today's Wordle was more like an argument than a puzzle. Yellow letters turned up reluctantly, and hoping for anything more than that seemed impossible. And then, just to make sure things were as difficult as possible, the greens I did find sat in odd and unhelpful places. Here's hoping tomorrow's game is a little less stubborn. This word refers to a specific number in a sequence, or the place someone could come in a race. Not in the top three, but not too far off. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. One more win. The answer to the May 16 (1427) Wordle isFIFTH. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "article_text": "The top 50 was a lot simpler back then. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every month Steam publishes a list of its top releases by revenue, which often includes some surprises.This monthOblivion Remastered, The Last of Us 2, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Blue Prince are selling real well, though Steam's gold-tier top 12 also includes The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, a gameso ambitious it pushed its creators to the brink of bankruptcy. Steam's been doing these charts since 2019, though until now they were assembled by hand, whichSteam's latest news blogsays has been \"leading to a less-than-consistent publishing cadence as we waited to complete all of the necessary work each time.\" From now on the charts will be automated and published on the 15th of each month, with calculations based on \"the first two weeks of revenue for each of the games released during the month.\" Since being \"released\" on Steam can mean either entering early access or leaving it to hit 1.0, early access games will be considered for the list twice. Each list will contain 50 entries, including DLC if it sells well enough. These newly automated lists can also be browsed backward, meaning you can jump all the way back toNovember of 2004, when the top release on Steam was Half-Life 2 because it was the only release on Steam. The list then stays blank untilOctober, 2005, when Rag Doll Kung Fu arrives (though Darwinia, which was famously the other early non-Valve game released on Steam, doesn't show up for some reason). Jumping forward toAugust of 2010, when I downloaded Steam at the insistence of my physical copy of Mafia 2, there are still only enough games being released for a top 10.

    "title": "Google's AI Overviews are often so confidently wrong that I’ve lost all trust in them",
    "article_text": "AI is already problematic when it's correct, and scary when it's not When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you Googled something recently only to be met with a cute little diamond logo above some magically-appearing words? Google's AI Overview combines Google Gemini's language models (which generate the responses) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which pulls the relevant information. In theory, it's made an incredible product, Google's search engine, even easier and faster to use. However, because the creation of these summaries is a two-step process, issues can arise when there is a disconnect between the retrieval and the language generation. While the retrieved information might be accurate, the AI can make erroneous leaps and draw strange conclusions when generating the summary. That’s led to some famous gaffs, such as when it became the laughing stock of the internet in mid-2024 for recommending glue as a way to make sure cheese wouldn't slide off your homemade pizza. And we loved the time it described running with scissors as \"a cardio exercise that can improve your heart rate and require concentration and focus\". These prompted Liz Reid, Head of Google Search, to publish an article titledAbout Last Week, stating these examples \"highlighted some specific areas that we needed to improve\". More than that, she diplomatically blamed \"nonsensical queries\" and \"satirical content\". She was at least partly right. Some of the problematic queries were purely highlighted in the interests of making AI look stupid. As you can see below, the query “How many rocks should I eat?” wasn't a common search before the introduction of AI Overviews, and it hasn't been since. However, almost a year on from the pizza-glue fiasco, people are still tricking Google's AI Overviews into fabricating information or \"hallucinating\" – the euphemism for AI lies. Many misleading queries seem to be ignored as of writing, but just last month it wasreported by Engadgetthat the AI Overviews would make up explanations for pretend idioms like \"you can't marry pizza\" or \"never rub a basset hound's laptop\". So, AI is often wrong when you intentionally trick it. Big deal. But, now that it'sbeing used by billionsand includescrowd-sourced medical advice, what happens when a genuine question causes it to hallucinate? While AI works wonderfully if everyone who uses it examines where it sourced its information from, many people – if not most people – aren't going to do that. And therein lies the key problem. As a writer, Overviews are already inherently a bit annoying because I want to read human-written content. But, even putting my pro-human bias aside, AI becomes seriously problematic if it's so easily untrustworthy. And it's become arguably downright dangerous now that it's basically ubiquitous when searching, and a certain portion of users are going to take its info at face value. I mean, years of searching has trained us all to trust the results at the top of the page. Like many people, I can sometimes struggle with change. I didn't like it when LeBron went to the Lakers and I stuck with an MP3 player over an iPod for way too long. However, given it's now the first thing I see on Google most of the time, Google's AI Overviews are a little harder to ignore. I’ve tried using it like Wikipedia – potentially unreliable, but good for reminding me of forgotten info or for learning about the basics of a topic that won't cause me any agita if it's not 100% accurate. Yet, even on seemingly simple queries it can fail spectacularly. As an example, I was watching a movie the other week and this guyreallylooked like Lin-Manuel Miranda (creator of the musicalHamilton), so I Googled whether he had any brothers. The AI overview informed me that \"Yes, Lin-Manuel Miranda has two younger brothers named Sebastián and Francisco.\" For a few minutes I thought I was a genius at recognising people… until a little bit of further research showed that Sebastián and Francisco are actually Miranda’s two children. Wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt, I figured that it would have no issue listing quotes fromStar Warsto help me think of a headline. Fortunately, it gave me exactly what I needed. \"Hello there!\" and \"It's a trap!\", and it even quoted \"No, I am your father\" as opposed to the too-commonly-repeated \"Luke, I am your father\". Along with these legitimate quotes, however, it claimed Anakin had said \"If I go, I go with a bang\" before his transformation into Darth Vader. I was shocked at how it could be so wrong… and then I started second-guessing myself. I gaslit myself into thinking I must be mistaken. I was so unsure that I triple checked the quote's existenceandshared it with the office – where it was quickly (and correctly) dismissed as another bout of AI lunacy. This little piece of self-doubt, about something as silly as Star Wars scared me. What if I had no knowledge about a topic I was asking about? This studyby SE Ranking actually shows Google's AI Overviews avoids (or cautiously responds to) topics of finance, politics, health and law. This means Googleknowsthat its AI isn't up to the task of more serious queries just yet. But what happens when Google thinks it's improved to the point that it can? If everyone using Google could be trusted to double check the AI results, or click into the source links provided by the overview, its inaccuracies wouldn't be an issue. But, as long as there is an easier option – a more frictionless path – people tend to take it. Despite having more information at our fingertips than at any previous time in human history, in many countries ourliteracy and numeracy skills are declining. Case in point, a 2022 study found that just48.5% of Americans report having read at leastonebook in the previous 12 months. It's not the technology itself that's the issue. As is eloquentlyargued by Associate Professor Grant Blashki, how we use the technology (and indeed, how we’re steered towards using it) is where problems arise. For example, anobservational study by researchers at Canada’s McGill Universityfound that regular use of GPS can result in worsened spatial memory – and an inability to navigate on your own. I can't be the only one that's usedGoogle Mapsto get somewhere and had no idea how to get back. Neuroscience has clearly demonstrated that struggling is goodfor the brain.Cognitive Load Theorystates that your brain needs tothinkabout things to learn. It's hard to imagine struggling too much when you search a question, read the AI summary and then call it a day. I'm not committing to never using GPS again, but given Google's AI Overviews are regularly untrustworthy, I wouldget rid of AI Overviewsif I could. However, there's unfortunately no such method for now. Even hacks like adding a cuss word to your query no longer work. (And while using the F-word still seems to work most of the time, it also makes for weirder and more, uh, ‘adult-oriented’ search results that you're probably not looking for.) Of course, I'll still use Google – because it's Google. It's not going to reverse its AI ambitions anytime soon, and while I could wish for it to restore the option to opt-out of AI Overviews, maybe it's better the devil you know. Right now, the only true defence against AI misinformation is to make a concerted effort not to use it. Let it take notes of your work meetings or think up some pick-up lines, but when it comes to using it as a source of information, I’ll be scrolling past it and seeking a quality human-authored (or at least checked) article from the top results – as I’ve done for nearly my entire existence. I mentioned previously that one day these AI tools might genuinely become a reliable source of information. They might even be smart enough to take on politics. But today isn't that day. In fact, asreported on May 5 by the New York Times, as Google and ChatGPT's AI tools become more powerful, they're also becoming increasingly unreliable – so I'm not sure I'll ever be trusting them to summarise any political candidate's policies. When testing the hallucination rate of these 'reasoning systems', the highest recorded hallucination rate was a whopping 79%. Amr Awadalla, the chief executive of Vectara – an AI Agent and Assistant platform for enterprises – put it bluntly: “Despite our best efforts, they will always hallucinate.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Nothing is making over-the-ear headphones and they might be better (and cheaper) than AirPods Max",
    "article_text": "Setting a hi-fi bar When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nothing is officially making its own pair of over-the-ear wireless Bluetooth headphones. The company confirmed the news in an almostfour-minute videowhere the London-based design team discussed their goals for the still-unnamed audio gear. The news followsNothing's announcement earlier this week that it will be partnering with British hi-fi institution KEF on new audio products, although there was no mention of this venture in the video. While the details were sparse, we did learn about a handful of key elements that may set the Nothing over-ear headphones apart from competitors likeAppleandSony. In fact, the video kicks off with the designers pondering what \"XM6\" means, possibly referring to the trio of characters in the rather unwieldy name of Sony's newest and, for the moment, industry-leading headphones, theSony WH-1000XM6. Mostly, though, the team focuses on the choices they're making for Nothing's first over-ear headphones. Price is a huge consideration. Calling out the $549AirPods Maxfrom Apple, which cost about as much as two last-gen Nothing phones, the team said it wants to produce cheaper headphones, ones that cost far less than AirPods Max. As for how much less, well, one designer mentioned the price, but in that moment, his voice was muted and his mouth was covered with a little message saying that Nothing has to keep some secrets. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Of course Nothing has form in this area. We awarded its budget earbuds theNothing Ear (a)a five-star review and consider them to be among thebest earbudsyou can buy, and they cost a mere $99 / £99 / AU$169. Meanwhile, theNothing Earearbuds, now on their third generation, are slightly more expensive – but we still proclaimed them to be \"punching well out of their price class.\" The designers complain that with most headphones, the buttons all feel the same, and it is impossible to know if you're touching the volume, pause, or Bluetooth controls. Nothing will, it seems, do it differently, designing all buttons to be \"completely distinct.\" The hope is that there will be \"no doubt about which control you're about to touch, [so] you don't make mistakes and we get out of the way of that music listening experience.\" Nothing's designers say they can do things with headphones that the big companies cannot, because the big tech companies \"just can't take risks; they've got to think about this whole global program...and millions and millions of users.\" Nothing, by contrast, contends it can just take an idea, build it, test it, and \"put it out there.\" To be fair, that's certainly how it seems withNothing's unusual and iconic smartphones. Nothing's already got a significant experience and a quite good track record in the audio space. Its wireless headphones currently sit near the top of ourBest Wireless Earbuds of 2025. As for how good these over-the-ear headphones sound right now, one Nothing designer said, \"I'm already impressed. They're not finished, but you know, I think these might be some of the best sounding on the market.\" Not just in their price range, either; Nothing believes these headphones will \"punch above their weight.\" Nothing's confidence goes even further, as the team muses that these headphones are as good as those you might pay twice as much for, and then adds that they're \"better than AirPods Max, and that was always the goal.\" One interesting takeaway is that while Nothing isn't sharing the price, they appear to note that these headphones are as good as ones costing twice as much, and then mention the $549 AirPods Max. Does that mean the Nothing Headphones might list for $275? While no name was mentioned, we're willing to guess that \"Ear\" will be in the name and that the full name could be \"Nothing Ear (Pros)\". That's all the detail we gleaned from Nothing's unusual announcement video, with the only other tidbit being that these headphones will ship this summer. It's too early to say if they will truly beat AirPods Max or approach Sony's excellent audio quality. But considering Nothing's audio track record, this will surely be a launch to watch.

The Department of Justice today has revealed that 12 people have been charged in a RICO case which involves the theft of over $263 million, as well as money laundering, home break-ins, and wire-fraud, theUS attorney’s office has confirmed. A mix of Americans and foreign nationals are accused of “participating in a cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy throughout the United States and abroad that netted them more than $263 million.” The group, who reportedly met on an online dating platform, had various roles in the organization, like database hackers, money launderers, and burglars who targeted hardware virtual currency wallets. The hackers would focus on websites and servers, obtaining cryptocurrency-related databases. Save up to 68% on identity theft protection for TechRadar readers!

The group would cold-call victims and use social engineering tactics to convince them that their accounts had fallen victim to cyberattacks, and that they needed to recover or secure their accounts - encouraging them to hand over credentials. “According to the indictment, members of the enterprise laundered stolen cryptocurrency proceeds by moving the funds through various mixers and exchanges using “peel chains,” pass-through wallets, and virtual private networks to mask their true identities,“ the Department of Justice confirmed. In justthe first three months of 2025, over $1.5 billion of crypto was lost to theft or scams, with an over 300% increase in money lost in Q1. The median loss per incident was $9,549,339, and just 0.4% of stolen funds were returned to victims, research from CertiK confirms. Much of this was thanks to one large incident, withhackers sealing over $1 billion in one of the biggest crypto thefts ever, against cryptocurrency exchange platform Bybit - measuring up as the largest heist in crypto history.

    "article_text": "Time for another AMD and Nvidia battle... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's almost the week ofComputex 2025, whereNvidiaandAMDwill be center stage with keynotes showcasing new hardware – and Team Red looks poised to outshine its rival in the budget GPU market. AMD confirmed via a post onXthat it will reveal gaming and AI plans at Computex 2025 on May 21. Notably, the image (pictured below) shows a render of a new Radeon GPU, which is more than likely the purported Radeon RX 9060 XT. Like the RX 9070 XT counterpart, Team Red also confirms it won't sell any reference cards, which means the new GPU will only be available for consumers via board partners. There will be two variants of the RX 9060 XT, one with 8GB of VRAM and the other with 16GB; the former isrumored to have lower availabilityat launch,which is expected to be in June. It's been made clear that some gamers don't desire 8GB GPUs, considering their inability to handle graphically-demanding games and their performance standards at higher resolutions. It's worth noting that Nvidia's RTX 5060 8GB GPU launch is set for May 19, which could be mentioned at its keynote on the same date. The important matter is that the RTX 5060 won't have a separate variant (at least from what we know so far), while the rival RX 9060 XT, does. It leaves Team Red in pole position to potentially overshadow Nvidia with its May 21 unveiling. However, pricing will be the dealbreaker for both, since consumers expect each GPU to come at affordable low costs – but thetrend of the marketsays otherwise. Reminder! Join AMD on May 21 as we reveal what’s next in gaming, AI PCs, and more. @JackMHuynh, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics Group, along with industry leaders and partners showcase what is built to power the next level. 📺 https://t.co/pm4j6pSYEg pic.twitter.com/94LdU29mAzMay 14, 2025 Long before recentUS tariffs, third-party GPUs have been set above launch price at multiple retailers, and I'm expecting this trend to continue with AMD's new Radeon GPU. Since it won't be selling any reference cards, consumers will have to rely on retailers selling partner cards yet again – and it's safe to say that it hasn't turned out well. The Radeon RX 9070 XT was sold to gamers at its retail price, but only for a limited time, as prices suddenly increased leaving the GPU in a less appealing position (since the $599 launch price was a strong selling point). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As much as I don't want to see 8GB GPUs anymore, there's no stopping that for now with the 8GB variant. The one way I do see it being a success is if the price is at or below $200, as it may still be a competent card for budget gamers at 1080p. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't think we're going to see that due to retailers consistently raising prices (regardless of AMD's price point reveal at Computex 2025). I think it's one of the worst moments that a lower-end GPU could launch without a reference card – I just hope that consumers who are looking forward to the launch have a chance to get their hands on one before inflation takes over...

For years now, Russian state-sponsored threat actors have been eavesdropping onemail communicationsfrom governments across Eastern Europe, Africa, and Latin America. A new report from cybersecurity researchers ESET has found that the crooks were abusing multiple zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities in webmail servers to steal the emails. ESET named the campaign “RoundPress”, and says that it started in 2023. Since then, Russian attackers known as Fancy Bear (AKA APT28), were sending out phishing emails to victims in Greece, Ukraine, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Cameroon, and Ecuador.

Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The emails would seem benign on the surface, discussing daily political events, but in the HTML body, they would carry a malicious piece of JavaScript code. It would exploit a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in the webmailbrowserpage that the victim was using, and create invisible input fields where browsers and password managers would auto-fill login credentials. Furthermore, the code would read the DOM, or send HTTP requests, collecting email messages, contacts, webmail settings, 2FA information, and more. All of the information would then be exfiltrated to a hardcoded C2 address. Unlike traditional phishing messages, which require some action on the victim’s side, these attacks only needed the victim to open and view the email. Everything else was being done in the background. The silver lining here is that the payload has no persistence mechanism, so it only runs when the victim opens the email. That being said, once is most likely enough since people rarely change their email passwords that often.

    "article_text": "The first electric GTI is tipped to arrive next year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Volkswagen’s CEO, Thomas Schäfer, has gone on record to state that the brand plans to propel its iconic GTI badge into the electric age with the launch of the ID 2 GTI. Going all-in on the hot hatch proposals,Auto Car reportsthat VW also plans an all-electric version of the ninth-generation Golf, complete with a GTI-badged iteration, with a \"whole group of GTI\" models that will follow thereafter. The first EV to get the performance treatment will be a range-topping version of the ID 2, which was showcased in the 2023 ID GTI concept car. That design study bore all of the classic GTI hallmarks, including an iconic flat-bottomed steering wheel, a low ride height and aggressive body work, as well as the famous GTI badging. Schäfer told Auto Car that his experience of an early prototype vehicle suggests the upcoming electric GTI model will be “a monster car”. There is no set-in-stone date for the first GTI-badged EV, but the ID 2 is due to be launched early next year, which just so happens to be the 50th anniversary of the launch of the original Mk1 Golf GTI. While speaking to Auto Car, CEO Thomas Schäfer said the main objective with electric GTI models is to make them feel obviously different from the standard car, which includes the handling, sound and ensuring they are exciting to drive. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. So far, Hyundai has proven that this can be done with the formidableIoniq 5N, but the sheer weight of technology required to make it enjoyable to throw around a race circuit also means it is phenomenally expensive. The GTI badge has always stood for attainable performance, with the sort of price tag that means those with even a sniff of disposable income can think about owning one. Although there has been no word on the technology that will underpin the upcoming family of GTI models, Schäfer said at the launch of the ID GTI Concept that the cars will remain “sporty, iconic, technologically progressive and accessible”, as well as being suitable for everyday driving. So far, Volkswagen’s electric vehicles have been met with a lukewarm reaction, with early ID models proving bland, soulless and easily forgettable. The introduction of GTI will hopefully bring some of that VW excitement to its all-electric range, while early looks at the upcoming ID 2 prove that the German marque is back on top form… andback to physical buttons.

    "article_text": "Surely 165Hz or lower is enough... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Samsung's Odyssey lineup includes some of thebest gaming monitorsavailable on the market, many of which are OLEDs for immersive experiences – and it's just added another to the list. As reported byVideoCardz, Samsung has launched the world's first 500HzOLEDgaming monitor; the Odyssey OLED G60SF, which boasts an incredibly high 500Hz refresh rate and a 27-inch display at the 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. VideoCardz states that it will be priced at $1,488 (around £1,120 / AU$2,320). It's currently only available in some countries in Asia but is expected to roll out to other regions later this year. TheOdyssey OLED G60SDis the current model available but instead utilizes a 360Hz refresh rate. The new OLED G60SF pushes this up to 500Hz, while also offering a VESA DisplayHDR True Black 500 display with peak of 1000 nits – a step up from the G60SD's 250 nits of brightness. It's worth noting that Samsung recently announced that it plans to introducecheaper OLED monitors, but that isn't the case with the new OLED G6. This is a monitor that should appeal to first-person shooter gamers, notably games likeCounter-Strike– but aside from using tools likeNvidia’s Frame Generation, there are very few games that can reach frame rates up to 500fps (or frankly, games that don't need to) even with the best PC hardware available. While there's no harm in providing a high 500Hz refresh rate, especially for browsing and games that are capable of reaching super high frame rates, the $1,488 price says otherwise. Having used a handful of monitors with different refresh rates over the years, I can assure you, you don'tneeda 500Hz monitor. With my Alienware AW3423DWF OLED monitor, 165Hz is perfectly fine and is the sweet spot for high-end gaming; some might even argue that 144Hz or 120Hz is more than enough. That's because the difference between them isn't significant enough for you to notice – unless you jump to one of those directly from a 60Hz display. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The most impressive feature with the new Odyssey OLED G6 is in fact the VESA certification, as DisplayHDR True Black 500 and 1,000 nits of peak brightness will revitalize your gaming experience if you're upgrading from an LED display. However, there are many cheaper options for OLEDs on the market that can do the same, but just without the absurdly high refresh rates.

    "article_text": "The VPN Guild is calling for international advocacy to hold tech platforms accountable When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The VPN purge from Russian official app stores continues, with smaller providers becoming the new target after Apple and Google. Between May 15 and 16, 2025, Samsung and Xiaomi bothremoved the AdGuard VPNapplication at the Roskomnadzor's demand. At least one more VPN provider, HideMyName VPN, has also been removed from the Huawei Store in Russia and China – a Russian VPN digital rights group, VPN Guild, confirmed to TechRadar. \"The removal of VPN apps from app stores marks a clear escalation in Russia’s crackdown on digital privacy tools,\" said VPN Guild Chair Alexey Kozliuk. The recent events, Kozliuk explains, aren't isolated incidents, but part of a broader, ongoing campaign to block Russian citizens' access to uncensored information and control internet use. In October 2023, for example,HideMyNamefiled the first-ever lawsuit against the Kremlin's infamous censorship body regulator Roskomnadzor. In January 2024, authorities deemed the VPN providerto be a \"foreign agent.\" In March 2024, the government then passed a new law tocriminalize the spread of informationabout ways to circumvent internet restrictions. This is likely the legal basis upon which the Russian censor body began issuing these removal demands to tech firms. From July 2024 onwards, Apple has removed at least 60 VPN apps, includingAdGuard VPN, a popular Russian service, andAmnezia VPN, alongside some of thebest VPNservices on the market. This brought the total toll toalmost 100 VPN apps unavailablein Russia's App Store. WhileGoogle seems mostly resistantto these demands so far, recent data shows that at least 53 VPNs are also currently unavailable in the Google Play Store in Russia. Now, authorities' targets have also expanded towards smaller app store providers. TechRadar needs you!We want to know what you think about the world of VPNs.

Through the organization's project AppCensorship, Ismail and the team have been busy monitoring a staggering increase in these VPN removals across both Apple and Google's official app stores. While it's the first time Ismail has heard of such an incident involving Samsung's Galaxy App Store, he told TechRadar that a way smaller provider (F-Droid) was also hit by a similar request in 2024. According to Ismail, this may mean that Roskomnadzor has understood that it can try its luck to put pressure on tech vendors. \"Smaller providers may struggle more to resist these demands as the prospect of becoming fully unavailable in Russia might be an issue for these platforms,\" he added. VPNs will remain a critical line of defense for digital freedom This is exactly why experts have long argued that Big Tech giants, which have the means and resources, shoulduphold their users' human rightsand challenge the Kremlin's censorship requests. Commenting on this point, Kozliuk from the VPN Guild said: \"This underscores the urgent need to give users more control and make them less reliant on centralized platforms and app ecosystems, as well as the need for stronger international advocacy to hold tech platforms accountable. \"As political tensions rise, especially around elections or protests, these crackdowns will likely intensify – and VPNs will remain a critical line of defense for digital freedom.\" Chiara is a multimedia journalist committed to covering stories to help promote the rights and denounce the abuses of the digital side of life – wherever cybersecurity, markets, and politics tangle up.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added a new Chrome bug to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, signalling abuse in the wild, and giving Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies a deadline to patch things up. The flaw is tracked as CVE-2025-4664. It was recently discovered by security researchers Solidlab, and is described as an “insufficient policy enforcement in Loader in Google Chrome”. On NVD, it was explained that the bug allowed remote threat actors to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page. \"Query parameters can contain sensitive data - for example, in OAuth flows, this might lead to an Account Takeover.

The flaw was first uncovered on May 5, with Google coming back with a patch on May 14. The browser giant did not discuss if the flaw was being exploited in real-life attacks, but it did state that it had a public exploit (which basically means the same thing). Now, with CISA adding the bug to KEV, FCEB agencies have until June 5 to patch their Chrome instances or stop using thebrowseraltogether. The first clean versions are 136.0.7103.113 for Windows/Linux and 136.0.7103.114 for macOS. In many cases, Chrome would deploy the update automatically, so just double-check which version you’re running. \"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,\" CISA warned. Indeed, the web browser is one of the most frequently targeted programs, since it handles untrusted data from countless sources around the web.

    "title": "New Avengers: Doomsday behind-the-scenes images from Robert Downey Jr are getting Marvel fans excited about his portrayal of Doctor Doom",
    "article_text": "Not Doom-ed to fail after all? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Ever sinceRobert Downey Jr took to the stage at Comic-Con 2024 to reveal he'd be playing Doctor Doomin the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it's safe to say fans have been divided into two camps. Indeed, Marvel optimists believe the returningMCUsuperstar, who previously played Tony Stark andIron Manbetween 2008 and 2019, is a great fit for the Multiverse Saga's new Big Bad. However, others hold the opinion that his return is a sign of the comic titan's desperation amid the mixed reception to its recent film and TV releases. It seems, though, that the number of those who were seated firmly in the naysayers' camp is slowly dwindling. That's been particularly noticeable over the past few days, too, especially in light of new behind-the-scenes images that Downey Jr has posted from theAvengers: Doomsdayset. It should be noted that there are no story spoilers forDoomsdayfrom this point onwards. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to say that, if you don't want to know a single thing about the highly anticipatedMarvel Phase 6film, you're best turning back now. A post shared by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr) A photo posted by on The first image, which was uploaded to Downey Jr's Instagram account on May 14, showed the A-lister reading fellow MCU actor Jeremy Renner's recently-released autobiography. Ordinarily, you'd think that's nothing worth reporting on. But if you look closer at said photograph, you'll notice two things. For one, Downey Jr is wearing a muscle suit. This implies his take on one ofThe Fantastic Four's most notorious foes will be as physically imposing as he is mentally, and suggests he'll be able to go toe-to-toe with many of the Marvel heroes who were included as part ofDoomsday's initial 27-strong cast. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The other, arguably more important detail is the black dots on Downey Jr's face. This indicates that, with a bit of CGI trickery, Marvel will give Downey Jr's Doctor Victor von Doom his unmistakable scarred face, which he usually hides behind his iconic metal-based mask. Now, this doesn't confirm that Downey Jr won't show his face as Doom at some point in one of 2026'snew movies. My reading of the situation, though, is that his disfigured face will be covered by said mask for a fair amount of this movie's runtime. I believe it'll only be revealed if his mask is knocked off during a fight, or if Doom wants his adversaries to take a look at the permanent physical damage he's endured in his potential quest to halt (or cause, we don't know which yet) the Multiverse's destruction. A post shared by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr) A photo posted by on The other image, which appeared online yesterday (May 16), doesn't contain any teases that might spark new fan theories about this iteration of Doom. Nonetheless, it's intriguing to see that Downey Jr is reading Marvel comics that star Doom, especially ones written by Jonathan Hickman. For the uninitiated: Hickman is the scribe behind the 2015 edition of Marvel's 'Secret Wars' comic series. Joe and Anthony Russo, who returned to the MCU alongside Downey Jr to direct the next twoAvengersfilms, previously told me that Hickman's run, plus the original 'Secret Wars' storyline,have inspired the plot ofDoomsdayand its sequel, aka the 2027 MCU flickAvengers: Secret Wars. Considering both comic runs will influence this movie duo, it's no great surprise to see Downey Jr reading Marvel literary works penned by Hickman, especially those that involve Doom. Downey Jr is someone who appears to conduct plenty of research for whatever role he's playing, but it's still pleasing to see that he'll tackle this role with the same gusto and seriousness as any other. Such preparation hasn't gone unnoticed, either. As I alluded to at the beginning of this article, fans have unsurprisingly picked up on the work that Downey Jr is putting into this role, and many are becoming increasingly impressed. Indeed, a quick scan of threads on theMarvel StudiosandMarvel Studios SpoilersReddit pages confirms as much. Of course, as the saying goes, the proof will be in the pudding as to whether Downey Jr's performance is as good as fans expect. I'm still concerned that his Doom will be revealed as a multiversal Stark variant, which would be the wrong approach to take for such an iconic Marvel supervillain. That said, I have renewed hope that Downey Jr will be a good, if not great, Doom, and these images definitely prove why he likely will be.

    "title": "Bono says Apple wants to make the Vision Pro 'more affordable', so what's the holdup?",
    "article_text": "Democratizing technology When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheAppleVision Pro remains the apex mixed-reality experience – and also the most unattainable for most people. You won't hear Apple directly admit that the powerful headset is, at $3,499, too expensive. A couple of years ago, Apple CEOTim Cook called the Vision Pro \"a great value\".A year later, though, he admitted that the pricey headset isnot aimed at \"the masses.\" We now have some evidence that Cook's comment was on the, well, money. Duringa recentPrice is Rightepisode, contestants were presented with the Vision Pro and asked to guess the price. For those unfamiliar with the premise of the game show, the idea is to guess a price that is as close to the actual price as possible. Whoever gets nearest moves on to the next round of the game. In the widely shared clip, the Vision Pro headset is lowered from the rafters to a position just in front of the contestants as the show's announcer briefly describes the headset's capabilities. After a moment's consideration, the four players guessed prices ranging from $750 to $1,250. That latter price won – but saying that the contestant who guessed that amount got close is like saying California is close to New York because they're part of the same land mass. What we learned is that consumers are not only unfamiliar with Vision Pro – they have no idea why anyone would pay $3,500 to own one. The price, according to those contestants, is wrong. As much as I love the Vision Pro experience, I've known this for a while, but it wasn't until I saw some news today that I believed Apple understood this and that it is, perhaps, trying to do something about it. The news came from a seemingly unlikely source: U2 front man Bono, whose new documentary,Bono: Stories of Surrender,is coming to Apple TV Plus. The rock star has a long-time friendly relationship with Apple; more than a decade ago,Apple dropped an entire new U2 album on iTunes, much to the chagrin of those who were not U2 fans. Apple, though, is clearly not done putting U2 content inside Apple products. An immersive version ofStories of Surrenderis also coming to the Vision Pro, putting you on stage with the musician. I've used the Vision Pro, and I've triedthese immersive experiencesoften enough to tell you that they're extraordinary to the point of almost being uncomfortable; an artist or athlete is doing their thing, and it feels like you're invading their space. Bono details in theinterview with Deadlinethe difficulties of filming in the immersive format, especially getting the lighting right. Then, in answer to a question about how the Vision Pro further personalized the story, Bono shared something I'm not sure Apple would want him to share: It made it really playful. I know Apple are dying to make the Vision Pro more affordable and more democratic, but they’re committed to innovation, they’re committed to experimenting. They know not everyone can afford this, but they’re still going for it, believing that some way down the line, it’ll make financial sense for them. But the fact that they may have to wait a while is not putting them off. \"More affordable and democratic\". That's quite a statement, and I guess it does align with Cook's comments about the headset still not being for the masses. However, most Vision Pro rumors point to Apple launching a different, cheaper version of Vision Pro (Vision Lite) and not necessarily making the existing headset cheaper. Dropping the price of the existing Vision Pro is a strategyI suggested last year: \"It costs a lot to build the Vision Pro (one estimate puts it at over $1,540) [...] [Apple] should simply cut the price by more than half and take the hit.\" My point was that Apple is making more and more services revenue, and that the Vision Pro is just another platform on which it can deliver all that content and all those features (but at a very high level). Why not put it in more hands? I'm not sure that Bono is fully in touch with current economic realities, when he suggests that, somehow, some way, people will eventually be able to afford the Vision Pro or that, at least, it'll make \"financial sense.\" I don't see that happening. At $3,500, the Vision Pro costs as much as a modest vacation, a powerful gaming computer, or luxury goods like a watch or designer bag. These are more than considered purchases, and the latter two are for the well-off or even rich. Apple's products may generally be more expensive than the competition, but they do not sell only to the elite. Take a look around: virtually everyone has an iPhone. If the iPhone started at $3,000, that would not be the case. I always encourage people to visit an Apple Store and experience the Vision Pro for themselves. They'll quickly see what all the fuss is about, but that experience also makes the price that much more painful. You may want to take the Vision Pro home, but we're still not living in a mixed-reality democracy, at least not yet. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

Nova Scotia Power, a major electricity provider in the Canadian province, suffered a cyberattack in which it lost sensitive customer information. The company confirmed the news in an announcement published on its website. The original announcement, published in late April 2025, said the attack did not disrupt the company's physical operations, or its ability to serve its customers, but added that the team was working on bringing parts of its IT system back online. A subsequent update stated that the attack occurred on March 19, 2025, and that the miscreants stole people’s names, phone numbers, email addresses, mailing and service addresses, Nova Scotia Power program participation information, dates of birth, and customer account history (such as power consumption, service requests, customer payment, billing, and credit history, and customer correspondence), driver’s license numbers, and Social Insurance Numbers.

    "article_text": "\"You underestimate my power.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Disney andEpic Gameshave confirmed Darth Vader's iconic voice will be coming toFortnite, thanks to the power of AI. Darth Vader, one ofStar Wars' most famous characters, was voiced by actor James Earl Jones, who died last year at the age of 93. Now, starting today, fans of a galaxy far, far away will be able to hear his voice once more... in Fortnite. In ablog post, Epic Games confirmed Jones' AI voice will appear in Fortnite and that the company is \"honored to feature the voice of the late Mr. Jones, and we thank his estate for the opportunity to make this happen for players.\" There's also a quote from the actor's family: \"James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it. We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character.\" The new Darth Vader dialogue was created by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, and the audio by ElevenLabs' Flash v2.5 model. Fortnite players will be able to speak to Darth Vader in-game and recruit the Star Wars villain to help win a Victory Royale. There's been an ongoing debate surrounding the use of AI to bring a deceased actor's likeness to life. Jones, who's not only famous for his role as Darth Vader, but also as Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King, signed over rights to his archival voice, collaborating with the Ukrainian company, Respeecher. You may have heard of Respeecher before, as the company's software was used toimprove Hungarian dialect in Oscar-nominated The Brutalistearlier this year. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This collaboration will come under scrutiny, as the debate of whether or not we should keep actors' likenesses alive following their passing rages on. That said, Disney and Epic Games, alongside Jones' family, are clear that they've recreated his voice in the most tasteful way possible. In the collaboration announcement, Disney and Epic said, \"Epic Games and Disney have worked together to thoughtfully develop this innovative feature with a strong focus on transparency, consent, and safety — ensuring that creators, Disney IP, and players are protected in interactive experiences.\" So, whether you like it or not, you can chat with Darth Vader in Fortnite this weekend, although you'll need to be over 13 as your data is sent to Gemini to generate a response.

Cybercriminals are impersonating senior US officials in highly sophisticated smishing and vishing attacks that leverage state-of-the-art technology such as deepfake and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). This is according to the FBI, which warned US citizens about an ongoing phishing campaign, in a new public service announcement published May 15. The announcement states that threat actors are creating credible audio and text messages, in many cases impersonating current and former senior US federal and state government officials, or their contacts, the FBI said. “If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the warning reads.

Smishing is short for SMS phishing, while vishing is short for voice phishing. Both are a variant of the traditional phishing attack in which threat actors throw a bait and “phish” for sensitive data. Victims are often tricked into sharingpasswords, credit card information, or other valuable information, when tricksters promise them huge discounts on popular goods, or threaten them with closing down their social accounts. In almost all cases, phishing messages leverage people’s emotions and force the victims to act quickly and without second thought. The FBI did not discuss the contents of the messages being sent out, but it did say that the attackers are trying to move people to a secondary messaging platform, where distributingmalwarewould be easier. It also gave a few recommendations on how to be safe, including verifying people’s identities and listening to the voice messages carefully for inconsistencies in tone and word choice. Phishing has been around since the dawn of the internet, basically, but with the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes, the problem has gotten even worse.

    "title": "Data streaming: protecting consumers in the AI era",
    "article_text": "As AI grows, tough questions about data privacy are hitting the mainstream When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AsAIgrows, tough questions about dataprivacyare hitting the mainstream. Here in the UK, the government’s Data (Use and Access) Bill has just entered its second reading in the House of Commons. At the same time, the government is navigating a legal challenge fromApple, which refuses to allow it to access a customer’s private data if required. Concerns around privacy, and the rules that guarantee it, are being examined at the very top. The details are complex, but for most people it boils down to one simple question: “Is my data the cost of progress?” From an enterprise perspective, we know that the technology used to house, transmit, and safeguard data isn’t necessarily built to prioritize privacy. Insufficientsecurity, siloed data, and the pains of outdated infrastructure can all leave an organization exposed — in other words, those consumer concerns can be well founded. Fixing this starts with how we collect and move data. If we can embed privacy straight into the data collection process, assessing and directing data in real time, we can minimize risk to both organization and consumer. Financial Services Director at Confluent. One of the reasons that fear arounddataprivacy have risen in recent times is that it’s extremely difficult to keep up with new regulations – particularly given how quickly AI is evolving as a technology. New and important legislation is constantly being introduced, with the UK’s Data Bill just one of many: the EU’s AI Act, China’s Deep Synthesis Provisions, and so on. But such laws are attempting to regulate technology as it develops, and can’t necessarily pre-empt the next big application of AI. The rule of law can’t always keep up with the blistering pace of change, often focusing on compliance at the expense of proactive security measures. As a result, many organizations will continue to depend on a unique mix of hardware and infrastructure. The business can function, but it can’t robustly enforce a consistent standard ofcybersecurityand data privacy. Take, for example, the classic problem of data fragmentation. Spreading private data across multiple systems — each with their own capabilities, purposes, and cybersecurity measures — makes it incredibly difficult to standardize the use of data. It might be duplicated, accessible in some systems and not others, or simply absent from where you’d expect it. The chinks in this armor are exacerbated by human intervention. Employees might have differing levels of access across different systems, retain permissions that they’re no longer supposed to, or not understand how to protect the data they’re accessing once they’ve used it. All of these things can cause a serious breach. While regulations like GDPR and HIPAA are designed to mitigate these risks, insisting on the immediate execution of data deletion requests, the infrastructure that houses this data might not be capable of meeting these demands. Legacy technology both decelerates audits and response times and fails to paint a comprehensive picture of exactly what data needs to be deleted. All of these challenges make it clear that privacy can’t be an afterthought. If you don’t prioritize it at the points where data enters your ecosystem, it’s incredibly difficult to work back to a point of robust compliance. This is where real-time data streaming excels. In processing data as it arrives, data streaming prevents the creation of vast datasets that demand slow, cumbersome batch processing en-masse. Being able to contextualize data and the protection it needs even as that data is in motion frontloads that security and organizational work, literally point by point. Data streaming platforms (DSP) take this a step further. As a platform purpose-built to coordinate the streaming of data across a business, they offer a single point of access that integrates advanced security capabilities by design. End-to-endencryption, for example, offers an additional layer of protection while the data is in transmission. Similarly, tokenisation can replace business-critical information with identifiers that make transcription impossible. Another option is differential privacy – the introduction of mathematical noise to datasets, protecting individual identities without stopping a business benefitting from analyzing that data. All of these elements offer protection against the myriad of potential cybersecurity concerns across an organization — from accidental access to bad actors. Research suggests that a vast majority of UK tech leaders — 91% — believe that data streaming improves cybersecurity and digital risk management. Much of that value comes from the DSP acting as the organization's central nervous system, managing systems to keep everything in sync, and guaranteeing access to real-time data where it’s needed. Privacy and security are inherently baked into the system, from the point of entry to the point of use. As AI continues to establish itself as a norm, this will only become more important.

    "article_text": "Titanium triumph When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeis here. After months of waiting, we’ve finally had our first look at the long-awaited thin and light addition to this year’sGalaxy S25lineup. While our hands-onSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge reviewhas a full rundown of the phone’s specs, pricing, and availability, I want to take a second to recognize what I think is the phone’s best feature – its design. To cut to the chase, I think the Galaxy S25 Edge is an extremely good-looking device – in fact, I think it’s the best-looking smartphone of 2025 so far. That might come as a surprise to some, given that the Galaxy S25 Edge is actually pretty plain-looking. It’s impressively thin at just 5.8mm, but construction-wise, two slabs of glass, titanium rails, and a dual-camera island on the top-left corner of the rear panel are pretty much all you get. However, I think this simplicity is one of the phone’s greatest strengths. While other simple-looking phones like theiPhone 16eandGoogle Pixel 9ahave been released this year, none have merged form and purpose quite as elegantly as the Galaxy S25 Edge. Here on TechRadar’s phones desk, we’ve gone back and forth about the state of phone design in 2025,running polls,penning features, and wondering whether the trend of minimalism will prevail. After all, it’s been a few years now since the convergence of flagship phone design around simple, flat designs – I’m sure some folks would struggle to tell the difference between the Galaxy S25 andSony Xperia 1 VI, for instance, and the recently launched Google Pixel 9a is maybe the simplest-looking handset we’ve ever seen. The latest rumors suggest that this trend could be about to change. TheiPhone 17series has been heavily tipped to bring radical design changes to the table, and whereApplegoes, the phone industry typically follows. In a way, these latest rumors make me even happier to see thatSamsunghas stuck to its guns with the Galaxy S25 Edge. The phone’s central concept – and what people will look for when they first pick one up – is its thinness, and by following its own ultra-minimal design language, Samsung has shown confidence that this engineering prowess is enough to make the phone stand out. As our US Phones Editor Philip Berne puts it,the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge “isn’t a phone you should experience on paper”. Having gone hands-on with the device myself, I agree that there’s a certainje ne sais quoiabout it – I actually found it quite enthralling to hold for the first time, and I think users will appreciate the lack of visual distractions on a device that’s built around ergonomics. After the wobbly launch of One UI 7 and several months of radio silence on the Galaxy S25 Edge before its launch on May 13, it’s genuinely encouraging to see Samsung show confidence and competence in launching what really amounts to quite a simple product. But even beyond the context of Samsung's year so far and the wider phone industry, I’m a straight-up fan of the way this phone looks. In particular, the Titanium Silver color option is an absolute knockout, and had me thinking the phone was an all-metal construction during my first encounter. It’s shiny, industrial, and oh-so-stylish. As for the other colors, I appreciate the way the understated Titanium Jetblack option complements the phone's minimal dimensions, and the remaining Titanium Icyblue color was already my favorite of the base Galaxy S25 options, so I’m happy to see it make the jump. Ultimately, this is all a matter of personal opinion – we take design into account in our lists of thebest phonesandbest Samsung phones, but aesthetics are certainly more subjective than something like comfort or durability. With that, I want to know what you think – let us know what you make of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge’s design in the comments below.

    "article_text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have announced a new bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip aimed at defeating Hamas. The offensive comes after a ceasefire brokered by the US, Egypt, and Qatar expired in March. “Over the past day, the IDF launched extensive attacks and mobilized forces to seize strategic areas in the Gaza Strip, as part of the opening moves of Operation Gideon’s Chariots and the expansion of the campaign in Gaza,”the military said in a statement on Friday evening. The IDF reiterated its goals of securing the release of the remaining hostages and achieving“the defeat of Hamas.” “IDF troops in the Southern Command will continue to operate to protect Israeli citizens and realize the goals of the war,”the Israeli army added. According toThe Times of Israel, the IDF aims to“conquer”Gaza, relocate the Palestinian population to the southern part of the enclave, and prevent“terror groups”from seizing humanitarian aid. Al Jazeera reports that at least 115 Palestinians have been killed since dawn on Friday. במהלך היממה האחרונה צה\"ל החל בתקיפות נרחבות והניע כוחות לתפיסת שטחים שולטים בשטח רצועת עזה, זאת כחלק ממהלכי הפתיחה למבצע \"מרכבות גדעון\" והרחבת המערכה בעזה, להשגת כל מטרות המלחמה בעזה, לרבות שחרור החטופים והכרעת החמאס.כוחות צה\"ל בפיקוד הדרום ימשיכו לפעול בכדי להגן על אזרחי ישראל…pic.twitter.com/WtK8Iy6XyG The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas broke down in March after the sides failed to agree on implementing the second phase of the truce.

    "title": "Trump says ex-FBI director called for his ‘assassination’",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has accused former FBI director James Comey of posting a since-deleted social media post calling for his“assassination.” Comey posted a photograph of seashells spelling out the numbers ‘86 47’ in a now-deleted Instagram post on Thursday. He captioned the cryptic post with“cool shell formation on my beach walk.” White House officials and Republicans quickly interpreted the post as a coded threat to the 47th US president, arguing the number 86 was used in its slang form to mean, ‘get rid of’ or ‘kill’. Comey subsequently deleted the image and explained in a separate post:“I posted a picture earlier of some shells I saw on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message. I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” Trump isn’t convinced. “He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,”he told Fox News in an interview on Friday. That meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear. “If you’re the FBI director… and you don't know what that meant? Now, he wasn’t very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant,”the president added. Donald Trump Jr. also saw Comey’s Instagram post as a call to murder his father. Just James Comey causally calling for my dad to be murdered. This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!pic.twitter.com/4LUK6crHAT Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Comey could face legal consequences for the incident. “The rule of law says people like him who issue direct threats against the president of the United States, essentially issuing a call to assassinate him, must be held accountable under the law,”the spy chief said in an interview with Fox News on Friday. Comey and Trump have been at odds for years. The US president fired him as the FBI director in 2017, during his first term in the White House. Trump later accused him of spreading“false statements and lies”and being a“dirty cop.” During his 2024 reelection campaign, Trump survived an assassination attempt when a gunman took shots at him during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The would-be assassin grazed Trump’s ear with a bullet, killed a spectator in the crowd behind him, and injured several others. In addition, at least one other plot to kill Trump was foiled in the lead-up to last year’s election.",

    "title": "Timing of sexual misconduct allegations against ICC prosecutor ‘suspicious’ – analyst (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "The timing of the sexual assault allegations brought against International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan is extremely suspicious, geopolitical analyst Alessandro Bruno told RT in an interview on Friday. The fact that the ICC’s head prosecutor was working on a high-profile case at the time, which involved the issuance of arrest warrants against the Israeli leadership,“raises many questions,”he added. Last May, Khan announced that he would apply for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his then Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as top figures in the Hamas leadership, for war crimes committed in the Gaza conflict. The ICC issued the warrants last November, around the time when accusations against Khansurfaced. The Chief Prosecutor has since taken leave from his role, pending the outcome of an external investigation, multiple media outlets reported on Friday, citing the ICC. Khan has denied any wrongdoing. “The timing of the allegations is, in my view, extremely suspicious. Extremely!”Bruno told RT on Friday. “The fact that the prosecutor was working on an important case concerning alleged genocide in Palestine and related accusations against the prime minister of Israel, I think I would have a little bit of skepticism as well,”he added. Bruno suggested that, given Khan’s central role, the allegations could affect the ICC’s work on the case. “The accusations could very much compromise the court’s decision, because he was the lead prosecutor on the case,”he said. The analyst also noted that the scandal could further“undermine”the ICC’s credibility, especially in countries like Israel and the United States, neither of which are members of the court. When asked why ICC member states Poland and Hungary refused to comply with the court’s arrest warrant for Netanyahu, Bruno replied that the judicial body mostly works against the leaders of developing countries. “It is a controversial body. It’s supposedly run by the UN, but it has had bite, interestingly enough, against dictators in developing countries,”Bruno said. Former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manilla on an ICC warrant in March, and extradited to The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity. An overwhelming number of previous extraditions by the court involved individuals from African countries.",

    "title": "Trump ends tariff talks for most nations",
    "article_text": "Washington will inform 150 countries of updated tariff rates with the US by post within the coming weeks, US President Donald Trump announced on Friday. It is no longer feasible to meet individually with every country seeking a trade agreement, he explained. On April 2, dubbed by the US president as ‘Liberation Day’, the White House imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods and additional surcharges on countries such as China, Mexico and Canada citing trade imbalances. The US president indicated at the time that the White House would negotiate individual deals with all its trade partners in the following weeks, but he has now suggested that the administration will set terms unilaterally. Speaking at a business roundtable in Saudi Arabia on Friday, Trump stated that the US will impose new tariff rates“over the next two to three weeks.”Washington had been approached by a large number of governments requesting individual deals but, Trump stressed,“it’s not possible to meet the number of people that want to see us.” “[W]e have, at the same time, 150 countries that want to make a deal,”he said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would be responsible for sending out letters detailing the new tariff rates that will apply to each country, Trump said. The new rates“would be very fair, but we’ll be telling people what they’ll be paying to do business in the United States.” Major US retailers such as Walmart and Target have said they plan to raise prices in response to the rising cost of imports. Trump has dismissed the concerns, claiming any price hikes will be small and that businesses will adapt by shifting their supply chains. The White House has not yet disclosed the content of the letters or the exact rates that will be applied. It is also unclear whether countries will be given a timeline or conditions under which the rates could change.",

    "article_text": "Moscow and Kiev have agreed in principle to hold follow-up negotiations to resolve the Ukraine conflict, according to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who participated in the talks as an observer. The announcement follows the meeting between the delegations in Istanbul on Friday, facilitated by Türkiye, marking the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in three years. “The delegations of Russia and Ukraine have reached a principled agreement regarding a new meeting,”Fidan said on X (formerly Twitter). Fidan stated that the parties have agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war from each side, representing the largest such swap since the conflict escalated in 2022. Russia’s chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky and Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov confirmed the agreement. Both sides have also consented to share written proposals detailing conditions for a potential ceasefire, he added. The talks followed a surprise invitation last Sunday by Russian President Vladimir Putin, to restart negotiations to resolve the conflict. There is no set timeline for Russia and Ukraine to exchange ceasefire proposals, but a fundamental agreement to do so has been reached, a TASS source reported. Türkiye has consistently positioned itself as a neutral mediator, leveraging its diplomatic relations with both Russia and Ukraine to facilitate dialogue. In 2022, Medinsky’s team negotiated a potential peace deal. Its terms offered Kiev Russian security guarantees in exchange for neutrality and restrictions on its standing army. At the last moment Kiev unilaterally pulled out the negotiations. David Arakhamia, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, later revealed following the pre-approval of the draft treaty that then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had told Kiev to“just fight,”leading to the continuation of hostilities.",

    "title": "US to fast-track discharge of transgender troops – AP",
    "article_text": "The White House is planning to instruct senior military officials to identify people who are transgender or have gender dysphoria and make them undergo medical checks in a process which would lead to their dismissal from the armed services, the Associated Press reported on Thursday, citing senior defense officials. The latest move comes amid a broader campaign to remove transgender service members from the American military, which US President Donald Trump launched shortly after his inauguration on January 20. Trump’s executive order declared that identifying as transgender“conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle”and would hamper military preparedness. The term“gender dysphoria”refers to psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s biological sex and one’s ‘gender identity’. According to officials who spoke to the news agency on condition of anonymity, commanders who become aware of service members with gender dysphoria — whether current, historical, or symptomatic — would be required to initiate individualized reviews of their medical records. The news comes a week after the Supreme Court ruled that the White House is allowed to enforce its ban on transgender individuals in the military while other legal challenges proceed. Earlier this month, the Pentagon issued a directive enforcing the immediate removal of around 1,000 openly transgender service members from the military, giving those affected until June 6 to resign voluntarily or face discharge. The department added that they would receive roughly double the amount of separation pay compared to those who do not come forward.",

    "title": "EU nations seek mandatory social media age checks – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "France, Spain, and Greece are advocating for mandatory age verification on social media platforms such as Meta’s Facebook and Elon Musk’s X, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The proposed rules would require all internet-connected devices to be equipped with age verification technology. Digital services ministers from the three EU member states are coordinating the initiative ahead of a meeting with their counterparts from the bloc on June 6, a document cited by Bloomberg said. The three nations reportedly argue that the“lack of proper and widespread age-verification mechanisms”makes it difficult to effectively enforce age limits. They aim to leverage the economic power of the EU’s 450 million consumers to compel tech companies to implement robust verification systems, according to the report. French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed on Tuesday his support for mandatory age verification for teenagers registering on social media platforms, stating that online networks have contributed to suffering and mental health issues among young people. “We must protect our children,”he told TF1, adding that age verification on social networks should be imposed. According to Bloomberg, the European Commission, along with several bloc members, is already developing pilot projects to boost parental controls and age verification. However, their efforts are being hindered by regulatory differences across EU countries and the ease with which users can access social networks from outside the bloc. “One real ID for every social network user — that’s the only way to actually guarantee minors don’t access inappropriate content,”Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this year. Among the countries that have taken measures on the issue, Australia has banned social media access for users under the age of 16. In Spain, a comparable measure has been incorporated into a legislative bill, although it is awaiting parliamentary review and does not yet have a set timeline. In Norway, the government has announced its intention to establish a minimum age of 15 for accessing social media. However, there is currently no defined timeline or concrete implementation plan in place. Earlier this year, 200 schools in France started testing a“digital break”that prevents students up to the age of 15 from using smartphones during school hours. In Russia, similar restrictions went into effect in September, banning students from using their cellphones in schools, except for emergency situations involving a risk to health or to life.",

    "title": "British general accused of killings cover-up takes helm of Royal Navy",
    "article_text": "The British government has appointed General Gwyn Jenkins as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff. Approved by King Charles III on Thursday, the decision follows unresolved allegations that Jenkins had failed to report suspected war crimes in Afghanistan and later obstructed the relocation of key witnesses. The general succeeds Admiral Ben Key, who stepped down last week amid an ongoing misconduct investigation. Media reports suggest that the probe centers on Key’s alleged affair with a more junior female colleague. Jenkins came under scrutiny two years ago when the BBC reported that the then-Vice-Chief of the Defense Staff had failed to forward evidence of Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers executing handcuffed detainees in Afghanistan to the Royal Military Police. At the time, Jenkins did not respond to the allegations. The UK Ministry of Defense stated that it was“not appropriate for us to comment on allegations which may be within the scope of the statutory inquiry.” In April 2024, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak appointed Jenkins—then Vice-Chief of the Defense Staff—as National Security Adviser. However, the appointment was later reversed by the incoming government led by Keir Starmer. While Starmer declined to comment on individual appointments, he emphasized the need for an“open and transparent process”for future nominations. Media outlets attributed the reversal to Jenkins’ implication in the ongoing inquiry. Earlier this month, BBC Panorama reported that Jenkins had overseen the rejection of hundreds of relocation applications submitted by Afghan commandos who had served alongside British forces and possessed direct knowledge of UK military operations. The report stated that these rejections effectively blocked key witnesses from reaching Britain and testifying in the public inquiry into the Afghan conflict.",

    "title": "EU queen Ursula preached transparency – then did backdoor deals with Big Pharma",
    "article_text": "Well, this is awkward. How many times has Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president and unelected de facto ruler of the EU, delivered sermons about transparency like she’s the high priestess of some kind of parallel Brussels Vatican? And now the EU’s own top court has called her out in a ruling for neglecting to practice what she preaches. Back in 2023, during her State of the European Union address, doing her finest impression of someone elected by the actual public, von der Leyen declared the need to douse any and all sketchiness in sunlight in order to“not allow any autocracy’s Trojan horses to attack our democracies from within.” “Transparency should characterize the work of all the members of the Commission and of their cabinets,”shesaidas far back as 2019.“I have asked commissioners…to engage more and be more transparent,”sheproclaimedin a speech to EU parliamentarians last year. Transparency and accountability alsofiguredprominently in her bid for reappointment by the EU’s ruling elites last year. Great news! She can now finally embark on this noble mission, and begin her journey with little more than a simple glance in the mirror. Because the European Court of Justice – the body that rules on whether EU institutions have actually crossed into illegality, not just occupying their usual territory of elite-grade idiocy – has just decided that Queen Ursula’s Commission can’t just wave away a pile of her own Covid-era text messages by going,“Whoops! They disappeared. Oh well, what do you do?”Which is basically what the Commission’s response was to the New York Times when it asked to see those messages. And how did the Times know that these texts even existed? Because Ursulaliterally told them, bragging in an interview about how she scored so many vaxxes because she’s super tight with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. All this was for a piece spotlighting her Covid efforts, published in April 2021:“How Europe sealed a Pfizer vaccine deal with texts and calls.” The article featured the same kind of glamour photography reminiscent of the good ol’ days when Ursula was Germany’s defense minister from 2013 to 2019, under former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and doing photo shoots in front of military hardware while accusations swirled that she had bungled the budget with shady defense contracts, even as the Bundeswehr was stuck using brooms for guns during a NATO exercise, as the Atlantic Councilreportedin 2015. “For a month, Ms von der Leyen had been exchanging texts and calls with Bourla, the chief executive of Pfizer… Pfizer might have more doses it could offer the bloc – many more,”the NYT piece reads, referring to the“personal diplomacy”that“played a big role in a deal”for 1.8 billion Pfizer anti-Covid doses. So the Times hears about these text messages and was like,“Oh, cool. Let’s see!” Suddenly Queen Ursula became a lot less chatty. So the Times took the matter to the EU’s own top court to get the disclosure. And now this court has said, in legal terms, that Ursula can’t just ghost the Times – and the public by extension – without giving a real reason. That there has to be a“plausible explanation to justify the non possession”of the texts. And also, the court says that“the Commission has failed to explain in a plausible manner”why it thought that these messages were so trivial that they could be vaporized like they were just her Eurovision contest text voting and not a matter of public record which, by definition, should be maintained. Out of these little chats came €71 billion in Covid jab contracts with Big Pharma’s Pfizer and AstraZeneca – 11 of them to be precise, totaling 4.6 billion doses, paid for with cash taken straight from EU taxpayers. Enough for ten doses for every EU citizen. Turns out that freewheeling it may have resulted in some consequences that could have been avoided had a diverse group of minds been engaged on the issue, as protocol normally dictates, and not just Ursula’s. It’s not like there hasn’t been a costly fallout from all this. A big chunk of the EU, including Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, is shouting about surplus doses for which they’re on the hook, urging Brussels to renegotiate the contractual terms with Big Pharma. Germany alone hasreportedlytrashed 200 million of them. Tricky to negotiate, though, when no one’s even sure what the terms were, as the second-highest European court pointed out last year.“The Commission did not give the public sufficiently wide access to the purchase agreements for COVID-19 vaccines… The Commission did not demonstrate that wider access to those clauses would actually undermine the commercial interests of those undertakings,”itruled. The details of these contracts – how they were made, what they say, and how anyone’s supposed to back out of them if citizens politely decline to max out their ten-jab punch card – remain a mystery. Back in 2024, Brussels more or less shrugged and suggested that it could really only be as transparent as the courts forced it to be. So hey, what can you do?“In general, the Commission grants the widest possible public access to documents, in line with the principles of openness and transparency,”the EU said, underscoring that the lower court ruling“confirmed that the Commission was entitled to provide only partial access.” Well, good news, guys! Your very own top court just ruled that you can now be a lot more transparent! So go crazy. Be the change that you keep saying you want to be in the world. Nothing is holding you back now. If transparency were a vaccine, this court just gave Ursula a booster. So we’ll see if it takes. I won’t hold my breath.",

    "title": "Being Russia’s enemy could cost European allies $1trn – study",
    "article_text": "European NATO members would face a $1 trillion bill over 25 years to replace US military contributions if Washington exited the bloc, according to a study published on Thursday by a British think tank. The EU is planning a militarization drive, which it claims is necessitated by an alleged Russian threat. Western European leaders have said member states must reduce their dependence on US weapons while implementing a massive increase in military spending. The proposed hike comes amid claims that Russia could attack a NATO member in the coming years. Moscow has denied the allegations and has accused the West of“irresponsibly stoking fears”of a fabricated threat. The report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) outlines the challenges nations would encounter in the event the US withdraws from NATO to focus on confronting China. According to the IISS, European nations – including the UK – would need to replace some 128,000 American troops, along with a wide array of weapon systems and command infrastructure currently provided by the Pentagon, particularly for air and naval forces. ”European states would need to invest significant resources on top of already existing plans to boost military capacity,” the report stated. The estimated price tag for replacing American weaponry alone ranges from $226 billion to $344 billion. Domestic arms manufacturers would face difficulties securing contracts, financing, and skilled labor, while also grappling with regulatory and supply chain hurdles, the report warned. In certain sectors – such as stealth aircraft and rocket artillery – European NATO members currently lack viable alternatives, prompting the IISS to suggest outsourcing production to countries outside the bloc. Beyond hardware, the study highlighted intangible but critical costs associated with command-and-control functions, space intelligence, and filling high-level leadership roles traditionally held by US officers. The think tank questioned whether European governments possess the political will to ensure the vast spending required. The administration of US President Donald Trump has accused European NATO nations of taking advantage of American military protection without contributing enough in return. On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stirred controversy by vowing to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, well above Germany’s existing level of 2.1%. The statement, made following a NATO meeting, drew backlash, including from members of Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s coalition. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius later stated that the exact percentage was“not so important”and that Berlin considered 3% to be a more realistic level.",

    "title": "EU mulling ‘punitive’ new tariffs on Russia – Politico",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s European backers are considering imposing“punitive tariffs”on Russian exports as part of potential new sanctions set for discussion at the European Political Community summit in Albania on Friday, Politico has reported, citing EU officials. Western countries have imposed widespread sanctions against Russia since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 in a bid to isolate the country, but have held back from a total trade embargo. The restrictions include a ban on Russia’s seaborne oil shipments, cutting the country off from the Western financial system, and freezing around $300 billion in foreign reserves. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and Türkiye are meeting in the Albanian capital for an informal gathering on Friday, which is also being attended by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. The talks in Tirana will focus on“dramatically”tightening sanctions against Moscow and include potential“punitive tariffs”on Russian imports, two EU officials told Politico. EU ambassadors on Wednesday approved a 17th package of sanctions against Russia, which targets nearly 200 oil tankers that the West claims are part of a Russian“shadow fleet,”older vessels operating outside Western insurance systems. The push for new sanctions has been inspired by US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has proposed“bone-crushing”measures, including imposing 500% tariffs on Russian exports if Moscow resists peace talks. The senator insisted that the goal was“to help the president [Donald Trump]”gain leverage on Russia. “We would take inspiration from the magnitude”of his proposal, one official told Politico. Earlier this week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Western Europe and the US must“go further”and“prepare to brandish devastating sanctions”to“suffocate”the Russian economy“once and for all,”in order to compel Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine conflict. “Russia has found ways around the blockade imposed by Europe and the United States. Turning off the tap in this way is a way of grabbing Russia by the throat,”he told French broadcaster BFMTV on Wednesday. Russia remains committed to seeking a long-term solution to the Ukraine conflict but will not tolerate being addressed in the“language of ultimatums,”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week. He earlier noted that Russia is used to Western pressure and is not concerned about new sanctions. In March, Putin said that a total of 28,595 sanctions had been imposed on Russian companies and individuals in recent years – more than the total number on all other countries combined. According to the president, the West sought to eliminate Russia as a competitor but its economy has only grown more resilient under pressure.",

    "article_text": "The US Secret Service is investigating former FBI director James Comey for making a threat against President Donald Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has said. Comey, a longtime critic of Trump, has denied that his cryptic, now-deleted Instagram post was a call for an assassination. On Thursday, Comey posted an image of seashells that formed the number“8647.”He captioned the image with“cool shell formation on my beach walk.” Trump administration officials and Republican politicians quickly interpreted the image as a threat to the 47th president. Several media outlets cited the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which defines that“86”is a slang term for“to throw out,”“to get rid of,”or“to kill.”According to Newsweek, the number is a mafia term for taking someone“eight miles out of town”and putting them“six feet under.” “Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of Trump,”Noem wrote on X. She added that the Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service are“investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.”Fox News Digital cited a source in the Secret Service as saying they will send agents to investigate and interview the ex-FBI chief. Just James Comey causally calling for my dad to be murdered. This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!pic.twitter.com/4LUK6crHAT FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau will“provide all necessary support”to the Secret Service in investigating what he said was Comey’s post“directed at President Trump.”White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich argued that Comey’s post“can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit’ on the sitting President of the United States.”Donald Trump Jr. claimed that Comey was“casually calling for my dad to be murdered.” Comey has since taken down the image.“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,”he wrote on Instagram.“I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” Trump fired Comey during his first term in office. He accused the former FBI head of spreading lies about him as part of what he called a politically motivated“witch hunt.” Donald Trump survived two assassination attempts during his 2024 reelection campaign. In July, a gunman opened fire at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing Trump’s ear with a bullet and killing a spectator. In September, a second would-be assassin was discovered camping outside Trump’s golf course in Florida.",

    "article_text": "Police have conducted arrests and searches in several countries as part of a corruption investigation into current and former employees of the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA). The raids, coordinated by Eurojust – the EU’s criminal justice agency – took place in Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, and the US. The alliance toldLuxembourg Timeson Wednesday that NSPA’s main headquarters in the Grand Duchy had initiated the probe. “NATO – including the NSPA – is working closely with law enforcement to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice,”spokeswoman Allison Hart said.“We are actively strengthening our ability to mitigate risks and root out misconduct,”she added. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters in Ankara on Thursday that the military bloc was working with the authorities.“We want to get to the root of this,”Rutte said. The public prosecutor’s office in Luxembourg said that documents had been seized pertaining to suspicions that NSPA staffers had“used their positions to enrich themselves.” Two people were arrested in Belgium and three in the Netherlands, officials said. Belgian prosecutors stated that the investigation centers around“possible irregularities in awarding contracts to defense contractors for the purchase of military equipment for NATO such as ammunition and drones.”The probe is also investigating the possible sharing of confidential information by NSPA employees with defense companies and money laundering. Authorities in the Netherlands have said they arrested a former official with the Dutch Defense Ministry at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol on Monday. The former civil servant is suspected of taking bribes in 2023 related to the awarding of defense contracts. The investigation takes place as NATO members are looking for ways to boost their own defense and produce more weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to raise €800 billion ($896 billion) to“rearm”the EU.",

    "title": "What’s the best way to wake up? Snooze less and embrace the morning sunlight",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment People Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Living Obsessions Living Style & Beauty People Obsessions People Dining Dining Travel Experiences Travel Travel Experiences Singapore Wellness Wellness Here’s what experts say about snooze buttons, sunlight and sleeping in. Man reaching for his alarm clock. (Photo: iStock/PeopleImages) You've heard plenty of advice about how to prepare for a good night’s sleep, but what about waking up? Is there really an ideal way to start your day? Your schedule often determines exactly when you get out of bed. But to the extent you can shape your routine, experts have some thoughts on the healthiest morning habits. “I always joke that the best thing to do is to get a puppy,” said Mariana Figueiro, who studies light and health at the Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She’s only half kidding. The two keys to a healthy wake-up routine, she said, are getting up at a consistent time each day and viewing morning sunlight–both tend to come with a regular morning dog walk. We spoke with four other sleep and circadian rhythm experts who all agreed with Dr Figueiro about the importance of these two morning habits. Here are their other recommendations–dog or no dog. Assuming you had the flexibility to choose, is there an ideal time to wake up? Not exactly. As long as you sleep for seven to nine hours each night, there’s no “best” time to wake up, said Dr Daniel Barone, the associate medical director of the Weill Cornell Center for Sleep Medicine. More important is that you stick to the same time, said Dr Katherine Sharkey, an associate professor who studies sleep at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Your body runs on circadian rhythms that regulate not only your sleep-wake cycle but also your metabolism, appetite, hormones, mood, body temperature and cognitive function. Waking up at a consistent time can help keep these body functions running smoothly, said Helen Burgess, the co-director of the Sleep and Circadian Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan. Waking up much later or earlier than you’re used to can make you feel drowsy or uncoordinated. Longer term, researchers havefound linksbetween irregular sleep patterns and increasedrisks ofobesity, diabetes, mood disorders, heart disease and cancer. If you feel tired enough to sleep in on weekends, Dr Figueiro said, you’re probably not getting enough rest during the week. In these cases, Dr Sharkey suggested sticking to your typical wake-up time andtaking a naplater that day. This can help keep your circadian rhythms in sync. If you feel you absolutely must sleep in, Dr Barone said you can likely get away with an extra hour. Any longer and you might experience drowsiness, digestive issues and trouble focusing, similar to jet lag. (Sleep experts use the term “social jet lag” to refer to the effects of staying up late and sleeping in on weekends.) As soon as you wake up, open the blinds and switch on the lights. Then, as soon as you can–ideally within an hour, Dr Figuiero said–try to get outside. Viewing any light in the morning, especially sunlight, helpssignal to your bodythat it’s daytime, Dr Sharkey said. When the light hits your eyes, it triggersa pathway between yourbrain and your adrenal glands that tells your body to release cortisol. This hormone makes you feel alert, which in turn could boost your mood, she added. Some limited studiessuggest that viewing morning sunlight can improve your sleep the following night, too. When the sun hits your eyes, Dr Sharkey said, ittriggers a metaphoricalstopwatch, which begins the countdown to bedtime, later telling your body when to release the sleep hormone melatonin. Even on overcast days, morning sunlight is strong enough to regulate your body clock, Dr Barone said. But if you wake up when it’s still dark, he said it can be useful to turn on a powerful artificial light such as alight box. You might also try waking up to asunrise alarm clock, he said, which gradually becomes brighter to mimic the rising sun. There’s no specific amount of time you must spend in the morning sunlight, experts said, but, more exposure is better (as long as youprotect your skin). Dr Burgess said an hour is best, but even 15 minutes is better than nothing. Snoozing your alarm may feel like a gift to yourself, but it isn’t the best way to start your day, said Ann E Rogers, a sleep researcher and professor of nursing at Emory University. The urge to snooze is your body’s way of saying you need more sleep, Dr Sharkey said. And if you have the flexibility in your schedule to hit snooze, the experts agreed you’re better off setting your alarm for the later end of your snooze window and getting up then. That way, your body can get the extra rest it craves–uninterrupted. By Caroline Hopkins Legaspi © The New York Times Company The article originally appeared inThe New York Times.

    "title": "3 must-try food experiences in Yokohama beyond Chinatown: Visit a ramen factory, eat OG Japanese western food",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment People Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Living Obsessions Living Style & Beauty People Obsessions People Dining Dining Travel Experiences Travel Travel Experiences Singapore Travel Travel Forget the generic Chinese buffets at Yokohama’s Chinatown. Make your calories count with these. From a tour to a local noodle factory that ends in a meal, to a visit to the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum, there’s plenty to do in Yokohama beyond visiting Chinatown. (Photos: Stella Thng) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Just a 30-minute train ride away from downtown Tokyo, Yokohama is the less frenzied, breezier sibling – figuratively and literally since it is by the sea. The first port city to open up to foreign trade in 1859, it pioneered a unique food culture that marries foreign influences with Japanese tastes. There’s yoshoku, their unique Japanese take on western food now popular around the world. Think Ma Maison, Mos Burger and Saizeriya. But perhaps the most iconic is chuka (meaning “Chinese food”), which originated in Yokohama’s Chukagai (Chinatown), the biggest in Japan. It is Yokohama’s most popular attraction with its distinctive Chinese gates and Kanteibyo, a temple dedicated to the warrior deity Guan Yu. The streets are filled with restaurants offering all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets, steamed buns, Hong Kong dim sum, Taiwanese giant chicken cutlets, and souvenir stores selling kitschy goods. But many of these are mediocre tourist traps, and you can find comparable or better chuka elsewhere, such as at Ikebukuro in Tokyo. Most visitors will probably dine at Instagram or TikTok famous spots in Chinatown or even the historic Red Brick Warehouse, which has been converted into a chic dining and shopping enclave. But why squeeze with the madding crowd? Try these three foodie experiences instead. My 17-year-old teenager and I booked the “Yokohama Ramen Adventure From a Local Noodle Factory To Home” onAgoda. The five-hour tourwasthe ultimate cultural immersion experience, especially for ramen lovers. Our hostAkiko met us at Kikuna Station, just 10 minutes away from Yokohama station or 45 minutes away from Tokyo station. A short bus ride took us to her family’s small noodle factory, which was started by her grandfather and is currently run by her brother, Taka. The jovial Taka schooled us on the difference between ramen, udon and soba, which are made with different ingredients. Their factory specialises in ramen and we checked out different types of dough, cutters and machines, some of which were from his grandfather’s time. We customised our ramen by choosing our preferred dough (we took the chewiest option), width and straight or wavy noodles. Then the fun began. As our customised ramen shot out of the machine in small bunches, we had to weigh and roll each into precisely 20-gram balls, and place them neatly in a tray. Armed with our customised noodles, we headed off to Akiko’s elegant apartment nearby. We made Mizuna and Tofu Salad with Fried Jako (a small fish like our ikan bilis) and marinated and wrapped our own gyoza. They were so good, my son and I polished off at least 20 between us. Akiko shared practical tips on making ramen broth without brewing it for hours, with readily available ingredients. (She will take you to a supermarket after the cooking lesson to shop for them.) We successfully replicated the rich and creamy tonkotsu-style broth and made marinated eggs. We assembled our ramen with Japanese fish cake, veggies and cha shu that she’d made ahead, which we torched for a smoky finish. The meal ended with a dessert of Matcha Shiratama Cream Anmitsu with freshly made glutinous rice balls, and a glass of Umeshu for me and a non-alcoholic beverage for my son. Akiko will also give you printed and pdf copies of all her recipes and send you photos that document your adventure. Tip: Taka’s ramen is usually sold to commercial customers but tour participants can buy them from just JPY70 (S$0.63) per ball. We kept them chilled in freezer bags (easy to get from Daiso) in our hotel fridge and packed them in our check-in luggage. The ramen keeps fresh for 10 days so time your tour at the tail-end of your trip if you want to buy some. The usual price is S$166/person onViatorbut we found deals onAgoda(currently S$119/person) orAirBnB(S$113/person). Pescatarian, vegan and vegetarian menus are available upon request. Maximum of five people per session. When Japan finally ended its 250 years of isolation from the world, Yokohama was the first port city to open. Naturally, it was the first to offer yoshoku, or Japanese-style western food. In the 1930s, Hotel New Grand’sSwiss Grand Chef Saly Weil concocted his famous spaghetti Napolitan, seafood doria and custard pudding a la mode for his Western guests. These include luminaries such asactorCharlie Chaplin, baseball legend Babe Ruth and American generalDouglas MacArthur. In fact,when General MacArthur arrived in Yokohama on Aug 30, 1945, as the Supreme Commander of the post-war occupation of Japan, the hotel was his first stop. Taste the OG yoshoku that these historical figures supped on at The Cafe. During our visit in March, we enjoyed their Kid’s Lunch For Adults promotion and tried all three signature dishes, a soup and a beverage atJPY5,500. You can top up extra for their popular cream soda and a full-sized custard pudding a la mode. Bonus: Hotel New Grand is just opposite Yamashita Park, Japan’s first seaside park which opened in 1930. Look out for the Guardian of Water statue of a woman in the middle of a water fountain, a gift from San Diego, the sister city of Yokohama. You can also visit the Hikawa Maru museum ship that is permanently docked there. For more info about Hotel New Grand, clickhere. Founded in 1994, Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum is the world's first ramen-themed amusement park and a testimony to how seriously the Japanese take their national dish. It is a five-minute walk from Shin-Yokohama station, and 45 minutes away from Tokyo station. Learn about the history of ramen, including the answer to this burning question: Is ramen Chinese or Japanese? Make sure you come hungry because there are eight ramen shops, all showcased in a streetscape replication from 1958, the year instant ramen was invented. All stores offer small and regular portions and every customer must order at least one small bowl. Prices vary; expect to pay a very reasonable JPY600 upwards for a decent portion. AtRyu Shanghai Honten, their thick ramen came with a scoop of red spicy miso in the centre, like the rising sun on the Japanese flag. We savoured the changing flavour as it slowly melted into the soup. AtHakata Bunpuku, a Fukuoka brand which has since expanded to Yokohama, New York, London and Sydney, the restaurant owner is a miso sommelier and his secret recipe blends five types of raw miso into his stock made with bonito, chicken, pork and kelp.The noodles are made using premium Minaminokaori flour and come thick and flat, or thin and wavy, and is a hearty bowl of goodness. You can also enjoy old school games, buy Japanese snacks and toys, and attend a short Ramen Making Experience class. (Extra charge and reservation required.) Don’t misstheRahaku Sugomen Lab. Customise your instant ramen for JPY600, including the complimentary option to use your own photo for the lid. Pick your noodles, broth packet (eight flavours, including milk miso and dried sardines shoyu), and three out of the 17 ingredients. We chose naruto (Japanese fish cake) and Chinese dumpling (like dried wanton) and a piece of dried cha shu, and topped up 100 yen for a freaky-cute Tako-san sausage. Can’t decide between visiting Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum and the CupNoodles Museum? Families with kids may find the latter more interactive and entertaining. There, you can also customise a cup noodle forJPY500 but you can only draw on the cup, while the Ramen Museum lets you customise the lid with a photo. The ramen restaurants here offer much,muchbetter food. The CupNoodles Musum’s International Noodles Bazaar, designed like an Asian market, sells noodles from Italian pasta to Korean cold ramen and Vietnamese pho at a standardJPY500 each but expect small portions and food court standard. As hardcore ramen lovers, my son and I preferred Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum. Entrance costsJPY450 for adults;JPY100 for children from six to 18 and seniors above 65. Free for kids under six.

The tenacious, bushy-haired Spaniard once again popped up to score a vital goal as the Londoners beat Manchester United 1-0 on Friday, leaving them on the cusp of returning to Europe's elite competition. Cucurella powered a header past Andre Onana in the 71st minute, latching on to a perfect cross by Reece James as the two Chelsea wing backs combined to pierce United's defence. The goal settled the nerves of the home players and supporters who had been staring at the prospect of Chelsea dropping out of the Premier League's top five Champions League qualifying spots with only one more game to play this season.

    "title": "Moody's pushes US out of top triple-A rating club citing rising debt",
    "article_text": "World World The setting sun light is reflected off waterfront developments in Williamsburg in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, US, Jan 2, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Adam Gray) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Moody's on Friday (May 16) downgraded its credit rating of the United States by a notch to \"Aa1\" from \"Aaa\", citing rising debt and interest \"that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns\". The rating agency had been the last among major ratings agencies to keep a top, triple-A rating for US sovereign debt, though it had lowered its outlook in late 2023 due to wider fiscal deficit and higher interest payments. \"Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,\" Moody's said on Friday, as it changed its outlook on the US to \"stable\" from \"negative.\" Since his return to the White House on Jan 20, President Donald Trump has pledged to balance the US budget while his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has repeatedly said the current administration aims to lower US government funding costs. The administration's mix of revenue-generating tariffs and spending cuts through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have highlighted a keen awareness of the risks posed by mounting government debt, which, if unchecked, could trigger a bond market rout and hinder the administration's ability to pursue its agenda. The downgrade comes as Trump's sweeping tax bill failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on Friday, as hardline Republicans demanding deeper spending cuts blocked the measure in a rare political setback for the Republican president in Congress. \"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration,\" Moody's said, while forecasting federal debt burden to rise to about 134 per cent of GDP by 2035, compared with 98 per cent in 2024. The cut follows a downgrade by rival Fitch, which in August 2023 also cut the US sovereign rating by one notch, citing expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations that threaten the government's ability to pay its bills.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Advertorial Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living People People Fatimah Mohsin started out as a freelance makeup artist and quickly became an icon in the Malay bridal scene. Building on her success, the multifaceted entrepreneur has expanded her brand into other ventures beyond weddings. Fatimah Mohsin has started businesses in various industries, from weddings to home decor and F&B. (Photo: CNA/Kelvin Chia) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Running a business is in Fatimah Mohsin’s blood. The Singaporean entrepreneur and bridal designer is the daughter of the legendary Encik Mohsin, who was affectionately known as ‘Raja Lelong’ (king of auctions). In the 1970s to the 1990s, Mohsin was a prominent figure in the Geylang Serai bazaar scene, known for his knack for offering great deals. As a child, Fatimah would accompany her father to work, enthusiastically shouting out ‘Lelong! Lelong!’ alongside him. She vividly remembers the pair returning home with a whole bucket of money. “So back then, when I was younger, if people asked me what my ambitions were, I said I wanted to be a businesswoman,” she recalled. An artist at heart, Fatimah always knew she wanted to work in the creative industry. “I loved cutting up my jeans, clothes, anything I didn’t like, and turning them into something new,” she shared. After secondary school, she turned down an engineering course at a local polytechnic in favour of studying fashion merchandising at LaSalle College of the Arts. An internship at Puma soon followed, which eventually turned into a full-time role that deepened her love for fashion. At the time, back in the 1990s, Puma was also the national outfitter for the Singapore football team. “I got to work closely with Fandi Ahmad and all the other footballers,” Fatimah recalled. But in 1998, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, Fatimah was laid off after giving up her position for a colleague who needed to support a family. “Since I was still young and single, I knew I could find ways to support myself as a freelancer,” she reasoned. Unsure of her next move, Fatimah eventually turned to makeup. “At that age, my friends and I loved going out to parties and I was always the creative one with some ‘nonsense’ makeup I picked up from a magazine,” she laughed. She enrolled in a course at CosmoProf Academy, which ended up completely changing the trajectory of her career. As a freelance makeup artist, Fatimah soon made a name for herself in the Malay bridal scene. She stood out by doing things differently–eschewing the traditionally heavy, dramatic looks in favour of a more modern, subtle style for her brides and clients. That also meant that she got “scolded a lot”, she recounted with a laugh. “Mothers of the brides would come into the room to ask why I used such light-coloured lipstick or eye makeup, but I stood my ground.” In a time before social media, Fatimah’s reputation grew purely through word of mouth and she soon became highly sought after, even among celebrities. “Thatwas the start of the Fatimah Mohsinera. Everyone knew who I was, be it in the TV or bridal industry,” she said. Eventually, Fatimah expanded the business to offer a full range of wedding services, including planning, venue decor and couture bridal outfits exclusively designed by her. She describes her designs as “timeless and classic”. “After being in the industry for so long, you learn that fashion is cyclical,” she quipped. She named the business Fatimah Mohsin–The Wedding Gallery, at the encouragement of a friend, not expecting that her name would one day become iconic in the industry. In fact, she admitted with a chuckle, “I hated the name Fatimah. It is so old school, especially when you consider yourself to be a trendy fashionista.” It has been 25 years since Fatimah first stepped into the bridal world. The business has also expanded into Perth, a market Fatimah sees as a stepping stone to greater international reach. “We are known in the modest bridalwear scene in Singapore, but I feel that we don’t have to limit ourselves to our home market,” she said, noting a growing global demand for modest, quality bridalwear. “One of my first few steps is to enter Perth’s modest market before trying to tap into other countries moving forward.” A post shared by Couture Atelier for Brides ✨ (@fatimahmohsintwg) Beyond bridal and weddings, Fatimah has a wide range of passions – which she has turned into business ventures. “The wedding industry has its ups and downs,” she shared. “Like anyone working in the same field for over 10 years, it can start to feel a bit mundane. I didn’t want a complete career switch, so instead, I looked for other things that brought me joy.” As a designer, Fatimah often travelled to source materials for her work. During these trips, she would come across beautiful home decor pieces which she began collecting for her own home. After sharing them on social media, her followers started asking where she got them from, sparking inspiration for a new venture. In 2016, Fatimah started her home decor business, Prop Up Store. What was meant to be just a side hustle for the annual Ramadan Bazaar turned into a thriving brand with an online store. A post shared by Home, Living & Décor (@propupstore) The business ended up keeping Fatimah and her team afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when the bridal industry faced major disruptions with weddings postponed or cancelled. Not one to stay still, she also opened a hair salon with her sister during this time, as hair services were considered essential and were permitted to operate. An opportunity to step into F&B later came up, and Fatimah opened her first restaurant, 555 Halal Thai, in 2020. “I’m a hustler and I felt that it was a good opportunity at that time,” Fatimah said. Situated within the Gallop Kranji Farm Resort, 555 Halal Thai exuded countryside vibes and was meant to offer Singaporeans a unique dining destination at a time when overseas travel was off the table. The restaurant closed in early 2023 due to “a crazy increase in rental”. Fatimah also started her own ready-to-wear line selling modest dresses, abayas and scarves. More recently, she embarked on her second F&B venture together with a few partners with the opening of halal Chinese restaurant Loong Dim Sum in Boat Quay. “In Singapore, you can count the number of halal dim sum restaurants on one hand–there are fewer than five–and people even travel to Malaysia [to get their fix]. So we thought, why not open one here? This is our first stepping stone toward offering quality halal Chinese cuisine. We have bigger plans,” teased Fatimah. The three-storey establishment also has an event space which can be used for hosting intimate weddings. Reflecting on her decision to diversify her businesses, Fatimah credits a key lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic: “You can’t put all your eggs in one basket. But if you group them together, it’s harder to break,” she quipped. After more than two decades of building her businesses in Singapore, Fatimah recently announced a major move to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where she hopes to expand both her wedding and home decor companies. The relocation has been a long time coming–she first toyed with it more than a decade ago, but felt it wasn’t the right time to uproot her two young daughters. While Fatimah currently travels between Singapore and KL, she hopes to spend more time in KL soon, having already built a strong team in Singapore. But growth in her home country has plateaued, she admitted. “The wedding industry in Singapore, to be honest, has become quite stagnant. It is no longer like how it was before, where customers were more creative and wanted to host their weddings at interesting places. We are limited in space in Singapore, with too many templated wedding venues,” Fatimah shared. As someone with an entrepreneurial spirit, she finds energy in change. “I always love exploring new ideas. It gives me a push when something new is happening.” Just as how she has made Fatimah Mohsin a household name in Singapore, she hopes to do the same in Malaysia, though she is under no illusion that it will be an easy journey. In fact, she’s ready to start from scratch and one of her first few gigs in KL is a makeup booking for a school prom. “I am turning 50 soon and it has always been a dream of mine to move to Malaysia, so I told myself, if I don’t do it now, then when?” Fatimah reflected. “I believe that when we put our heart and soul into something, God-willing, we can succeed.” A post shared by Couture Atelier for Brides ✨ (@fatimahmohsintwg) Throughout this interview, Fatimah was candid about the realities of running several businesses. Moving forward, she hopes to do more mentorship to share her experiences and guide other aspiring entrepreneurs. When asked about the qualities that make a good entrepreneur, “everyone talks about patience, resilience and grit, because life is not a bed of roses,” she answered. In the early days of starting a business, one may have “beginner’s luck”, added Fatimah, but that luck fades away once the real work begins. “Now we see a lot of new businesses sprouting up. To start something is really easy, but to maintain, sustain and grow it is the hard part.” Through all the highs and lows, Fatimah is proud of what she and her team have built. “We’ve weathered many storms. We’ve been the best of the best. We have faced competition, but we continue to push forward, because we always want to be the innovators in whatever we do.” Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

The automaker is mulling closing Japan's Oppama plant, where Nissan started production in 1961, and the Shonan plant operated by Nissan Shatai, in which Nissan is a 50 per cent stakeholder, the sources said, which would leave it with just three vehicle assembly plants in Japan. Overseas, Nissan is considering ending production at plants in South Africa, India and Argentina, and cutting the number of factories in Mexico, one of the sources said. Japan's third-biggest automaker unveiled sweeping new cost cuts on Tuesday, saying it would reduce its workforce by around 15 per cent and cut production plants to 10 from 17 globally as it seeks to push through a turnaround.

    "title": "Commentary: What if Iranians, Americans and Arabs made uranium together?",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Iran has an unconventional idea that could make the region safer and also appeal to Trump’s love for big, bold deals, says Andreas Kluth for Bloomberg Opinion. BERLIN: President Donald Trump,still touring the Middle East, keeps saying how “very happy” he’d be if he could make a deal with Iran. Iran, meanwhile, needs such a deal to avoid being bombed by Israel and strangled economically by the resumption of United Nations sanctions later this year. If reports out of Tehran are correct, those pressures may have motivated Iranian leaders to come up with an unconventional idea that deserves a hearing: They want to work with their enemies, not against them, to build Iran’s nuclear programme. Their brainstorm envisions a kind of joint venture among Iranians, Saudis and Emiratis, as well as private investors including US companies. This new consortium would enrich uranium, a fissile material that can be used to generate electricity or make medical isotopes – and to build nuclear bombs. Because Iranians, Arabs, Americans and others would be working together, it would be easy to verify that this atomic programme remains civilian rather than military. At first blush, the idea seems outlandish. How could mortal enemies (Tehran’s theocracy is based in large part on wishing death to America as well as Israel) collaborate around the very material that has brought them to the brink of war? At second glance, though, the notion’s sheer audacity – let’s call it chutzpah – may be exactly what these nuclear negotiations need to get unstuck. In a way, the Iranian proposal reminds me of the European Coal and Steel Community, set up in 1951 by six founding nations and led by France and Germany, who had fought three bitter wars in one lifetime and struggled to imagine each other as anything other than enemies. To prevent a fourth war, French statesmen such as Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman proposed joint custody over the raw materials of warfare – at the time, coal and steel. And German leaders such as Konrad Adenauer, eager to reconcile with their neighbours, agreed. Against all odds, this ECSC would blossom into what is today the European Union. What coal and steel were then, uranium and plutonium are today. These elements are of course vastly more dangerous than coal and steel. And nobody is suggesting that the Middle East could ever become a new EU. In the 1950s the Germans, French and other Europeans genuinely wanted peace. As Karim Sadjadpour at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace warns, the Iranian theocrats may instead believe that the survival of their regime depends on forever treating the US and its allies as foes. And yet there is an elegance to the idea. For one, this arrangement would last indefinitely. By contrast, the the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, signed a decade ago by Iran and six parties including the US, would have phased out restraints on Iran by 2030. For another, it would remove or circumvent the biggest obstacles in negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme. The Iranians have long insisted on their right to peacefully enrich uranium, an activity that is explicitly allowed by both the international Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). As part of the consortium, they would still be doing that. But now their joint-venture partners and outside monitors would be able to verify that the uranium would be enriched only to a low grade, unsuitable for warheads. The Saudis and Emiratis too would find much to like. They also want to get into the market for nuclear energy, and will need uranium. They could start enriching on their own (as countries such as Brazil and Japan do), but that would also enable them to build their own nukes in a hurry if they ever felt threatened by Iran or anybody else, which would in turn accelerate nuclear proliferation globally. In the proposed scenario, they’d instead take their shares from the consortium. And Trump? He wants to prove (especially to the committee in Oslo that hands out the Nobel Peace Prize) that he’s a “peacemaker”, and of course that he’s a consummate dealmaker. The permanence of the new deal would allow him to claim that he negotiated something better than the JCPOA he cancelled in his first term. And by having US business in on the consortium, he could point to all the money they’ll soon be raking in. It’s easy, of course, to see the prospects of such a consortium as implausible, and to view the Middle East, with its ancient hatreds and deadly weapons, as due for a major war. But that was said about Europe in 1951 too. Trump must stay ready to use force if needed; but first he should study this Iranian overture.

    "title": "Working through illness, not having time for vacations: How some hawkers cope with NEA's rule against absenteeism",
    "article_text": "Ground Up Ground Up A rule by the National Environment Agency sparked a discussion recently when a woman was issued a warning for failing to be physically present at her stall, despite being heavily pregnant. Mr Lee Wong Leong (right) with his sister, Madam Lee Bee Suan, at her prawn noodle stall located at Whampoa Food Centre on Apr 16, 2025. (Photo: CNA/Samuel Woo) This audio is generated by an AI tool. For several months now, Mr Tan has been serving plates of fried hokkien mee to customers at a food centre in central Singapore as though he is a seasoned veteran. However, discerning regulars who patronise the stall might notice a change in taste, because their noodles used to be prepared by a woman. As it turns out, Mr Tan is not the stallholder. The stall belongs to the woman, who is in her 70s. She was ill and has not been mobile. Mr Tan said in Mandarin that she does not have the strength to run the stall by herself for the time being. “I’m temporarily helping her, we’ll monitor what her health is like first. “If she gets better, then she can probably return to work but just come a bit later in the day.” Yet, Mr Tan is aware that by helping out his friend for such a lengthy period of time, it is technically breaching a rule in his friend’s tenancy agreement with the National Environment Agency (NEA) that requires stallholders to personally operate their stalls. Aimed at preventing stallholders from subletting their stalls to others by mandating the physical presence of the registered owner, the regulation ultimately prevents rents and food prices from hiking and allows enterprising hawkers to enter the industry fairly. NEA’s long-standing rule became the subject of controversy earlier this year after one owner of a nasi lemak stall took to Facebook to rail against it, after his pregnant wife – the registered owner – was warned forfailing to be physically present at her stall in Yishun. In this case, the stall owner adopted a franchise model, operating at least 26 stalls around Singapore, including in malls and privately run food centres. Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, said in a Facebook post in March that NEA identified and warned more than 230 stalls last year because they were not personally manned by owners. Of these, 30 were issued with notices to terminate their tenancies when they did not heed the warnings. From these warnings and notices, more than 100 stalls terminated their tenancies, while the rest were able to continue operations because they had given valid reasons for their absence. With around half of the hawkers who were warned by NEA ultimately let off the hook because they were found to have genuine reasons, CNA TODAY visited eight hawker centres to find out how stallholders – particularly those who do not operate franchise chains – are coping with this rule. Most agreed that such a rule is effective in deterring subletters and preventing large franchise chains from dominating NEA-run hawker centres, but there were also older stallholders who said that the rule was forcing them out of the trade. Anecdotally, many ageing stallholders still relied on hired assistants to run the majority of the business, sometimes for the whole day. Their reasons include circumstances that are beyond their control, such as illness, fatigue, or suddenly having to pick up supplies. For some, it meant having to explain their absences to NEA officers who carry out regular inspections. A few hawkers said they would even work through sickness and poor health in order to not put their businesses at risk of closure. Despite the leeway already granted by the authorities, two experts who spoke to CNA TODAY said that there was a need for greater flexibility. They raised suggestions such as allowing stall assistants to \"hold the fort\" temporarily, as well as vacation days for hawkers. Dr Lily Kong, president of Singapore Management University (SMU) who researches urban infrastructure and also co-wrote a paper on hawker culture, said: “The desire to prevent subletting is understandable. However, the manner in which it is effected requires rethinking.” Hawker stalls are meant to provide Singaporeans with the opportunity to start and run a small food business, which is why stallholders are required to personally operate their stalls, the authorities have stated previously. Explaining the rationale behind such a rule, Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment, said in parliament that it exists to prevent subletting. “If this requirement is not imposed, the tenant who has successfully bid for the stall could potentially sublet the stall and collect the difference in rent. It may encourage persons to bid for a stall without an intention to run a stall but only to sublet it,” he said. Should the tenant be unable to operate the stall, the tenant is then expected to return the stall to NEA, allowing other new hawkers a fair chance to enter the trade. Dr Koh was responding to a parliamentary question filed by Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency MP Edward Chia after a Yishun stallholder questioned the anti-subletting rule earlier this year. The hawker, Mr Noorman Mubarak, had complained in a Feb 18 Facebook post that he was forced to make his heavily pregnant wife tend their nasi lemak stall at Yishun Park Hawker Centre. The stall is registered under his wife’s name. The stall, Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, is part of the couple’s chain of more than 20 stores across Singapore, including in hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA), malls and privately run eateries. In a Facebook post following the parliamentary debate, Dr Koh said that many people have given feedback to him to support the government’s policy and called for NEA to take firm action against subletters. “Requiring stallholders to physically operate their stalls remains the most practical and fair way of preventing subletting and ensuring that hawker stalls are not misused for rent-seeking motives,” he said. Nevertheless, Dr Koh highlighted the challenges that NEA officers face when detecting subletting, stating that the approach “isn’t always straightforward”. “Subletting is done under the table ... NEA has to conduct thorough investigations to uncover and substantiate such cases. This may include collecting documentary and photo evidence, conducting interviews with hawkers and relevant parties, as well as repeated checks over a period of time, before taking action against errant stallholders.” In response to queries about how NEA exercises flexibility, the authority directed CNA TODAY to publicly available information on what hawkers can or cannot do. Those who wish to expand their businesses can do so by holding up to two cooked food stalls in hawker centres, provided they are able to divide their time and operate the stalls personally. Hawkers have also made use of other arrangements to grow their businesses, such as taking on more stalls at hawker centres with their family members as stallholders. To this, NEA has said it “appreciates” the challenges that hawkers face in balancing their personal circumstances with business operations. If hawkers are temporarily unable to operate their stalls – due to medical reasons, for example – the authority has exercised flexibility in these cases. The stallholder may appoint a joint operator or a nominee to operate the stall during that period of absence. Both the stallholder and the joint operator are each required to personally operate the stall for at least four hours each business day, and their operation hours cannot overlap. In the event that the stall has to shut for a period of time, NEA may offer rental waivers to the stallholder. These rules only apply to tenancy agreements for stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres. Many hawkers who spoke to CNA TODAY said that the NEA rule was an effective deterrent to those thinking of subletting their stalls. Mr Lew Yew Liang, 55, who owns Shan Zhong Bao Herbal Soup at Berseh Food Centre, said the anti-subletting rule has been in place for many years and he has had no issues abiding by it. “The rule is fair. Our rent is already very cheap compared to coffee shops. By all means, people can rent at coffee shops,” he said. However, to Mr Tan, the fried hokkien mee assistant helping his friend, the requirement to personally man the stall makes the trade unsustainable for older hawkers. “Some people will not be able to carry on with the business at all,” he said. He also said he was ready to explain to the authorities why his friend was unable to tend the stall if approached by officers. “NEA has to understand that hawkers are old. Even though their heart is there, they don’t have the strength to stand there for eight hours.” He did not state if she had considered appointing him as a joint operator, though the rules stipulate that even if she did, she would need to be physically present at the stall for four hours. In any case, Mr Tan said she cannot bear to give up her stall completely, because it would mean the loss of her only source of income. That was why she paid Mr Tan to work as her assistant and take over operations until her condition improved. The stall’s earnings still mainly go to her, but Mr Tan receives a portion of it for his help. Others said that they tapped relatives to share the load and to make sure that the business remained sustainable. A 66-year-old owner of Choon Hwa Coffee Stall in MacPherson, who declined to give her name, said that because she has high blood pressure and gets tired easily, her relatives help out on most mornings and afternoons, while she tends the stall in the evening. She recounted how an NEA officer once approached her to find out why she was not at the stall. She replied that it was “tough” for elderly people to man their stalls for hours on end and asked the officer to try a day of her work. Another hawker said that she did not qualify for rental waivers when she fell sick last year, because her medical certificates did not cover her for a continuous period of one month. Madam Jeanette Koh, 59, who operates a rojak store at Circuit Road Food Centre, said her absence at the stall also led to enquiries from NEA officers. “NEA says if you can’t do it, then just return the stall to it. But if we return the stall (to NEA), then who will give us work? We don’t have credentials, who will hire us?” One hawker who operates a stall at Toa Payoh Lorong 8 Market and Hawker Centre that sells ayam penyet (a fried chicken dish), said he was coughing for eight days, but he continued to work with a mask on in order to comply with NEA’s anti-subletting rule. This was because he could not allow his assistants to work on his behalf while he was absent, he said. He declined to be named. For similar reasons, it will also be difficult for him to leave Singapore for any Haj pilgrimages in future, because closing his stall when he is away means lost earnings. This was a sentiment echoed by a few hawkers who feared losing potential earnings because they could not keep their stalls open with help from hired assistants while they rested at home. For Ms Joanne Lee, 52, the owner of Fu He Turtle Soup at Berseh Food Centre, the requirement prevents her from extending her operating hours beyond 7pm to capture the supper crowd and earn more for her business. “If I always have to be here all the time, it is difficult to sustain operations in the long run.” Mr Melvin Chew, who owns the Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck & Kway Chap stall at Chinatown Complex, said he worries for the future generation of hawkers since young people these days value work-life balance. “In the past, old hawkers had no life. They simply worked every day and missed the time they had with their children,” the 47-year-old added. “But nowadays, people feel that they should cherish the moment. So if they have to be at the stall every day from a certain time to a certain time, they have no freedom to spend time with their children or think about starting a family.” He also said that ifSingapore wants hawker culture to remain, then it has to provide younger hawkers with confidence that they can establish a branding for themselves and their businesses. Not all agree, though. There were some hawkers, such as Mr Eddy Leck, who told CNA TODAY that it was possible to find that balance despite the long hours as a hawker. For example, if there are no customers, there is no need for the stallholder to be present to work long hours. The hawker could close the stall and come back later when the crowds are back. The 49-year-old owner of Soon Heng Coffee Stall at Circuit Road Food Centre said: \"I have no difficulties being here all the time. We are making a living, of course we have to be here. We're doing business.” At the end of the day, hawker centres are designed to provide opportunities for hawkers to directly operate their own small food businesses, which is why corporates cannot bid directly for hawker stalls. Some leeway is given for expansion opportunities. NEA’s current rules allow individuals to hold a maximum of two cooked food stalls in hawker centres, provided they are able to divide their time and operate the stalls personally. In reality, executing this is difficult, some hawkers said. Ms Li Ruifang, 41, recalled how her father gave up his prawn noodle stall at Whampoa Food Centre to help her find her footing in the food-and-beverage industry when she decided to start her own stall. The earnings from his stall had put food on the table for her family since the 1970s. Originally, her father Lee Wong Leong, 75, wanted to retain ownership of his original stall and allow his sister to operate it, while he would head to Ms Li’s stall in Tekka Centre to help out full-time. For a time, this was an ideal arrangement for them. Mr Lee’s earnings from Whampoa allowed him to keep a stable income, his daughter gets to learn directly from an experienced hand, and his sister gets to help out in the family business. Then, NEA found out about the arrangement in 2014, and because Mr Lee could not divide his time commuting between the two stalls due to his age, he turned over ownership of his Whampoa stall to his sister. Ms Li said of her father’s sacrifice: “I do feel very grateful for how he gave up his stall to come over to Tekka to help me out. If not for him, I believe it would have taken a longer time for me to get into the rhythm of helming the stall.” Acknowledging the effectiveness of NEA’s rule against subletting, experts on hawker culture said it would be difficult to remove such a regulation without hurting the industry as a whole. Doing so would also risk “unintended misuse” by hawkers, Mr Ryan Kueh said. He is the author of From Streets to Stalls, a book about the history and evolution of Singapore’s hawker culture. Without such a rule, it would inadvertently give rise to subletting, allowing people to exploit public subsidies for personal profit by turning stalls into rental assets. “We first need to consider its underlying principle – preventing the misappropriation of a public good for profiteering,” he said. On the other hand, there could be “some flexibility for elderly hawkers or those facing genuine difficulties”, he added. On this point, Dr Kong from SMU had some suggestions for the authorities to consider. For example, there may be provisions for workers to take vacation leave in ways that do not affect their income. “It is not unreasonable to have some provision for ‘locums’ to stand in occasionally for hawkers or for helpers to hold the fort for periods of time,” Dr Kong said. Mr Kueh lauded NEA’s recent policy to allow hawkers to hire assistants holding long-term visit passes, which helps to ease workloads. Previously, only Singapore citizens and permanent residents could work as stall assistants in hawker centres managed by NEA and its appointed operators. Hawkers could also hire their spouses who have these visit passes. Thepolicy was relaxed from Jan 1to allow hawkers to hire any of these pass holders who have been approved to work here. Beyond policy, Mr Kueh said more must be done to boost the attractiveness of the industry to young entrants. “The larger issue is our outdated expectations of hawkers – expecting stalls to be open excessively for long hours or tosell food at very low prices– and the second-order effects they create,” he added. “These expectations pressure hawkers to offer food at low costs and in turn receive low (profit) margins, endure excessively long working hours and remain trapped in a cycle of working more to sustain sufficient income.” Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2024.

    "title": "Israel attacks Yemeni ports, warns that Houthi leader could be target",
    "article_text": "World World Houthi supporters chant slogans during a weekly anti-US and anti-Israel rally in Sanaa, Yemen, May 16, 2025. (Photo: AP/Osamah Abdulrahman) ADEN: Israel struckYemen's Red Sea ports of Hodeidah and Salifon Friday (May 16), continuing its campaign to degrade Houthi military capabilities and warning that the group's top leader could be targeted if attacks on Israel persist. The Houthis have continued to fire missiles at Israel in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, although they have agreed to halt attacks on US ships. Israel has carried out retaliatory strikes in response, including one on May 6 that damaged Yemen's main airport in Sanaa and killed several people. On Friday, the Israeli military said it dropped over 30 munitions on Houthi targets in its eighth such attack. It said the ports of Hodeidah and Salif were being used to transfer weapons, reiterating its warnings to residents of those areas to evacuate. The Israeli strikes killed at least one person and injured nine, the Houthi-run health ministry said in a statement. Residents in Hodeidah said they heard four loud booms and saw smoke rising from the port following the strikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a joint statement that they would hunt down the Houthis' top leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. \"If the Houthis continue to fire missiles at the State of Israel, they will be severely harmed, and we will also hurt the leaders,\" they said, adding that al-Houthi could join the list of militant figures killed by Israel, such as Hamas' Yahya Sinwar and Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior group figure, described the Israeli threats as \"illusions\", saying on X that they were aimed at buying time by setting \"unattainable goals.\" The Houthis are part of Iran's so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israeli and US interests in the Middle East, alongside Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. About 60 percent of the Yemeni population lives under their control. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, the Houthis have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks toward Israel, most of which have been intercepted or landed short.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport LONDON :Chelsea stayed in the hunt for a Champions League place next season with a nervy 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Friday, courtesy of a second-half goal from  Marc Cucurella.The Spain full back headed home from close range, turning in a cross from captain Reece James, who bamboozled the United defence with a twist and turn in the 71st minute. \"I knew I had space and time. I knew I put the ball in a good area, this guy was always arriving,\" James told Sky Sports, standing alongside Cucurella.James had hit the post in the first half with a stinging shot shortly after United defender Harry Maguire had the ball in the Chelsea net, only for VAR to rule it marginally offside. United had few other chances, and Chelsea were tense but dominant for most of the match. The result lifted Chelsea to fourth in the Premier League above Aston Villa, who earlier beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-0, with one game left in the season for both sides.

    "title": "ICC prosecutor Khan on leave amid sexual misconduct probe",
    "article_text": "World World International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan attends an interview with Reuters in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan 16, 2025. (Photo: REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw) THE HAGUE: The prosecutor of theInternational Criminal Court, Karim Khan, has stepped aside temporarily as an investigation by the United Nations into alleged sexual misconduct by him nears its end, his office said on Friday (May 16). The move is unprecedented and there is no clear procedure for replacing Khan. The situation creates added uncertainty for the ICC, which is already facing an existential crisis due to US sanctions over its arrest warrants for Israeli officials. Khan's office said the prosecutor had taken leave until the end of the investigation by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services. In a written statement, Khan's attorneys rejected all allegations of wrongdoing. They said he said he had taken leave because media attention on the matter affected his ability to focus on his work but did not intend to resign. \"Our client remains the prosecutor, has not stepped down and has no intention of doing so,\" law firm Carter-Ruck said. In a letter sent to his staff and seen by Reuters, the prosecutor said that he had been keeping his position under constant review. \"In light of escalating media reports, I have made the considered decision to take leave,\" Khan said. \"My decision is driven by deep and unwavering commitment to the credibility of our office and the court, and to safeguard the integrity of the process and fairness to all involved,\" he said. Khan had earlier ignored calls by NGOs and ICC staff to step down while the investigation was under way. Several of those NGOs on Friday hailed his decision to temporarily step aside as a sign that no one is above the law. \"Stepping aside helps protect the court's credibility and the trust of victims, staff, and the public. For the alleged victim and whistle blowers, this is also a moment of recognition and dignity,\" said Danya Chaikel of human rights watchdog FIDH. Others said Khan's leave would not derail the ICC's investigations as the office of the prosecutor is not a one-man show. \"In fact, removing an individual whose alleged behaviour may have fuelled a toxic work culture may strengthen the office’s ability to carry out its mandate with professionalism and public trust,” Alix Vuillemin of the Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice told Reuters. The ICC has high-profile war crimes investigations under way into the Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia's war in Ukraine. At Khan's request, the ICC issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin on suspicion of deporting children from Ukraine, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Neither country is a member of the court and both deny the accusations and reject ICC jurisdiction. The ICC's investigation into Israel's conduct led the US administration of President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Khan, which the ICC president says have put the court itself at risk. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, told Reuters that Khan had spoken to UN investigators last week in what was believed to be the final interview of a months-long outside investigation into the allegations that started in December. It was unclear when the probe would finish. The ICC's two deputy prosecutors would take over his duties in the meantime, his office said.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport With Napoli once again within touching distance of Serie A glory, a new figure has emerged at the heart of their resurgence as Scott McTominay inches closer to reverential status among fans across the city. The 28-year-old Scot has been crucial to Napoli's title hopes and has become a player to rally around since former talisman Khvicha Kvaratskhelia departed for Paris St Germain in January. The numbers speak for themselves, with the midfielder having 11 goals and six assists this season in the league, netting five alone in April, enough to be named Serie A Player-of-the-Month. The work ethic and fierce loyalty were among the reasons Napoli manager Antonio Conte paid 30.5 million euros ($34.15 million) in the pre-season for McTominay, who left Manchester United after a 22-year stay.

As a die hard sweater fan, I really need to get this off my chest: cotton sweaters are the best sweaters, and it isn’t especially close. To be clear, I would run through a wall in defense of their non-scratchy wool counterparts, too, but we all have ourspecificfavorites among thegeneral favorites, right? Allow me to explain. Cotton sweaters are insanely soft, incredibly versatile, offer magnitudes more airflow than their cold-weather relatives, and almost always age in a way that reflects the carefree essence of the season. They also tend to snag less, hold up better, and demandfar less laundering care. (When worn on their own, with no buffer between skin and fabric, they’re one of the most tastefully slutty garments in menswear, which might be of note to a few of you.) I’ve never worn a cotton sweater and regretted the decision. Gap Gap J.Crew J.Crew Take J.Crew’s heritage ribbed sweater as an example. Sure, it’s a legitimately hefty knit, but its rib stitching allows for a ton of ventilation and a little extra flexibility. Same goes for Manresa’s instant-classic Oysterman sweater, inspired by the sweaters favored by literal oystermen contending with the coastal Northeast’s fluctuating temperatures. It weighs more than even theburliest fisherman sweaters, but breathes just like abasketball jersey. Meanwhile, Margaret Howell’s crossover crew packs more intrigue around the collar than most seasons of (good) reality TV, and boasts an easygoing fit on par with pretty muchany sweatshirtyou own. Oh, and speaking of comfortable, Abercrombie’s pima rib-stitch crewneck looks like a walking nap, no two ways about it. Manresa Manresa Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch 18 East 18 East Bode Mr. Porter Looking to get a little freakier? Check out Bode’s jacquard-knit riff, rendered in feather-light pima cotton with roughly 14 patterns per inch, which might be jarring in less capable hands but instead just looks incredible withmedium-wash jeans. Looking to spend a little less? For under $50, you can get one of the most comfortable sweaters you’ll ever wear, or you can really go wild, and get…one of themost comfortable sweaters you’ll ever wear. So, yes, cotton sweaters mightseemlike a paradox—why would you wear a sweater when it’s hot outside?—but they make perfect sense. If you encounter me in the wild this spring, there’s, like, a 70% chance I’ll be wearing one. Margaret Howell Lost & Found Banana Republic Banana Republic",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Though Harry’s Plus Razor just dropped, the brand has been a household name for years—walk through Target or scroll throughshaving productson Amazon, and you’ll spot that signature blue packaging. What started over a decade ago as an industry disruptor (and I say “disruptor” admiringly) with a simple, Shark Tank-worthy idea—high-qualityrazors and cartridges at a more accessible price—has become agroomingmainstay. Well, gents, the new Harry’s Plus Razor is finally here, and after a couple of weeks of testing thismanual bad boy, I can confidently say it’s their bestrazoryet. Harry's Harry's I spoke with Jeff Raider, co-founder and co-CEO of Mammoth Brands, about the new Plus last week, and what struck me was how genuinely passionate he is about razors and the science behind them. “Since founding Harry’s, we’ve had a vision to create a next-generation razor system that could deliver truly premium performance,” Raider told me. While some brands might tweak a handle, adjust a blade angle, and call it a day, Harry’s went all in—we’re talking a decade of R&D, acquiring a German blade factory (home to some of the world’s best razors, IYKYK), and obsessing over every detail. They built and rebuilt, gathered feedback, and refined. And it shows: The razor glides effortlessly, hugs the contours of your face, gives asuper-close shave, and feels solid and balanced in hand. Let’s dig into what makes it their best yet. Harry's Harry's Last year, while visiting with family, I needed a razor for the weekend and bought the classic Harry’s Winston at Target. While it delivered a good shave, I had to go over a few areas more than once, and it didn’t quite contourexactlyas I would have liked. The new Harry’s Plus, though, fixes all of that. It didn’t just glide—it shaved stubble like it was flying through a cloud, super slick in the best way. I shaved quickly and didn’t have to worry about nicks or retracing too much—just one pass down, one back up, and I had averyclose shave. The cartridge feels loose when you unbox it, but that’s by design—once it clicks into the handle, it’s Advanced Pivoting System flexes with just the right give and structure. It contours, allowing you to shave quickly without too much pressure, i.e. it works with you. This effortless shave is thanks mainly to the new cartridge, which hits the sweet spot between comfort and performance. It looks compact—and that's by design, as it houses a completely reengineered blade system and the brand’s most streamlined cartridge to date. I won't dive too deep into the science, but overall the blades are positioned closer together in what Raider described as a “bed of nails” effect, allowing them to cut hair in a more sequential order. This layout provides better support and reduces irritation, especially for those prone torazor burn. This Progressive Blade Architecture allows each blade to cut incrementally closer to the follicle, and as they're each made from a single piece of steel, they flex and adapt better to your skin. The compact size also improves maneuverability in pesky spots, like under the nose or around the jawline. And while I won't pretend to understand it, the cartridge also features Shooting Ion technology, which energizes the blades to reduce drag and enhance glide—like what you hear about inhigh-end hairdryers. What I do understand is the result: Every blade pulls its weight, distributing pressure evenly to minimize tugging and deliver a buttery-smooth shave. Oh, and there's also a precision blade on the back—perfect for sideburns and touch-ups. I dig the classicHarry'shandles, but after testing over 100 prototypes to nail the shape, weight, and balance, the team leveled it up with the Plus. It has a satisfying premium weight—solid without being too heavy—and the matte metal finish, tapered neck, and ergonomic, non-slip grip all feel intentional and well thought out. I appreciate the finger rest and the grip's neutral colorways, too. (the subtle details make a difference). To connect the upgraded cartridge, they re-engineered the handle with a spring-supported push-button release that keeps the blade locked in while making swaps quick and easy. The metal stand is a nice touch, with a minimal footprint and enough sleek style to class up your sink or medicine cabinet. It wouldn’t be Harry’s if it wasn’t democratized for every guy, and they’ve kept the price of the Plus refreshingly accessible. The Starter Set is $20 and includes one handle, cartridge, a 2oz Foaming Shave Gel, and a travel cover. Cartridges refills run around $15—still very easy on the wallet. One note for the Harry’s faithful: The Plus cartridges and handles aren’t interchangeable with the Original, but after you take this for ashave, I suspect it’ll become your new favorite from the line.

    "title": "Pedro Pascal Is Bringing Back Dressing up for the Airport",
    "article_text": "Pedro Pascal won’t be slowing down on dressing up anytime soon. With several major projects on deck, the actor has been making the most ofhis “fashion daddy” personawhile in promo mode. That means whether he’sat a Star Wars conventionor an airport en route to the Cannes Film Festival, he’s in the zone, decked out in designer. The actor—who stars alongside Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone in the Ari Aster filmEddington, which had its Cannes premiere on Friday—arrived at the airport in Nice wearing a pristine ensemble that mostly consisted of brand-spanking-new pieces from Bottega Veneta, including blue jeans, gold-emblemed loafers, and a khaki-twillHarrington jacket. The blouson’s collar was decked out in the Italian luxury house’s signature woven leather design, which matched the enormous, fresh-from-the-box Andiamo bag that Pascal carried over his shoulder. The pristine outfit didn’t look especially lived-in (after a day of travel, hiswhite T-shirtbore nary a wrinkle), but it did look expensive. Celebrities have been gettingphotographed at the airport since last century, but only in the last decade or so have those photos had an immediate destination: social media. Online, a famous person’s travel wardrobe seems to project a sense of wanderlusty covetability. Imagine you’re Jacob Elordi, totinga lemon-yellow Louis Vuitton bagafter touching down in Venice, or Rami Malek, sportinga biker jacket and Margiela loaferson the ground in Tokyo. (And then there’s Timothée Chalamet, who drummed up buzz for his film,Wonka, bytugging on a latex trenchafter his own long-haul Tokyo flight.) For brands such as Bottega Veneta, which hasa history of staging “candid” paparazzi shots, the airport is a dreamy backdrop for product placement. Just askJoe Alwyn,BTS’s RM, or evenElordi, whobecame an official ambassadorfor the label last year. Recently, when I caught up with Pedro Pascal’s longtime friend Colman Domingo ahead of this year’s Met Gala,the Oscar nominee told methat the newfound fame he’d achievedin his 50shas changed one aspect of his personal style: how he dresses up for travel. “My airport style has changed,” Domingo said. “I shop better for airports, because people will always want a selfie. They’re watching you travel, and you have to look a certain way. I always have a really good pair of suede loafers and a good jacket. I look a bit more dialed-up when I go to the airport. It’s no longer just sweats.” A nice pair of loafers? A good jacket? Sounds like Pascal may have heeded his pal’s advice.",

    "title": "9 Best Shinola Watches for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Shinola watches are literally built different. Detroit can lay claim to more than its share of important exports, from Motown and the Big Three toTim Robinsonand Big Sean. No list of Detroit’s greatest hits, however, would be complete without a mention of Shinola, the modern accessories brand that’s been crafting covetable timepieces (along with leather goods and, for a time, bikes) in Detroit for nearly 15 years. Named for a long-defunct brand of shoe polish, Shinola faced some skepticism when it launched in 2011 against the backdrop of the city’s headline-making decline. Since then, however, Shinola has defied expectations and grown into one of the country’smost recognized watch brands, blending a distinctive vintage-inspired aesthetic with Swiss-made components and a healthy dollop of civic pride. Nowadays, anyone in the market for a Shinola timepiece has more than 100 models to pick from, all of which are assembled at the brand’s flagship HQ in the historic Argonaut Building. From vintage skin divers to dials made of fossilized coral, these are the best of ‘em. For more timely ticker recommendations, check out theGQ Watch Shop. Shinola Shinola Shinola’s latest drop (not countingthis week’s instantly sold-out homage to famed Detroit mixtapeartisteJ Dilla) is inspired by the golden era of skin diving in the 1960s and 1970s. With a decidedly mid-century look accented by a palette of pinks, yellows and blues, the Duck makes an ideal complement to camp shirts, huaraches, and anything else you might be rocking at the beach (or the pool, or the cookout) this summer. Shinola Shinola This limited-edition ticker isn’t named for the beautiful and historic island in Lake Michigan, but for a historic race to the island and back held each summer by the Chicago Yacht Club. Befitting its namesake (and in addition to its distinctive square case and Bermuda blue dial), the Shinola Mackinac is distinguished by a yacht-timer function, which can be used to count down to the start of a race or regatta. Fortunately, you don’t need to know the difference between a spinnaker and a genoa to appreciate the nautical vibes on display here, but just in case you find yourself in the Chicago Yacht Club this summer, it’s pronounced mackinAW. Shinola Shinola For all of their many appealing attributes, Shinola’s watches have historically been on the chonkier end of the spectrum, with cases measuring up to a certifiably beefy 48mm. With this year’s introduction of the Circadian Monster Automatic, however, the brand finally has something for those with a taste for more classic proportions. At 36mm across, the Circadian’s stainless steel case is near-universally flattering, especially when paired with a eucalyptus green dial. If you’re on the hunt for a watch that’ll look right with pretty much anything in your wardrobe, this’ll do the trick. Shinola Shinola Shinola’s aesthetic has always been heavily influenced by a nostalgia for mid-century Americana, but few of the brand’s creations hit the mark with as much finesse as the Mechanic. A cushion-shaped case, “box” style crystal, and big sans-serif numerals recall the timepiece designs of the 1930s and 1940s, as does an old-school Swiss windup movement. Shinola Shinola Stone dials are everywhere these days, but Shinola was well ahead of the curve when it launched this variant of the Runwell in 2017. Anyone who’s spent time on a Lake Michigan beach is probably familiar with the unique look of Petoskey stones, which get their unusual six-sided pattern from the fossilized remains of coral that thrived in the area some 400 million years ago and remain a common find on shores in the state’s lower peninsula. That makes this Runwell not just one of the most unique stone dial watches out there, but perhaps the most historic Michigan creation since the Coney Dog. Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "If Adam Scott Can Rock These $90 New Balances, So Can You",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When you think about the roles Adam Scottis famous for, you probably imagine him wearing a suit.Severance,Parks and Recreation,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty—the actor's practically a walking endorsement for sensibleOxford shirts, preppy-leaning repp ties, and no-nonsense leatherdress shoes. Off screen, though, his go-to kicks skew a little more casual. Exhibit A: the New Balance 574s he laced up recently. Look, we're well aware that the 574 doesn't quite inspire the same queues as some of itsbuzzier New Balance counterparts. But if you're looking for a classic silhouette the die hard sneakerheads are snoozing on, it might be exactly what your spring rotation is missing. When the 574 was released in the late '80s, New Balance marketed it as a technical running shoe. Tricked-out runners have advancedin leaps and boundssince, but the 574 remains one of New Balance's most comfortable sneakers to date. Designed by Steven Smith—the mastermind behind now-iconic hits like the Reebok Instapump Fury and Yeezy Boost 700—its breezy mesh base, premium suede panels, and telltale reflective accents still set the standard at New Balance'sMassachusetts HQ. Because this is New Balance we're talking about, though, the 574's true X factor is the midsole. Not only is it infused with Encap foam for cloud-like comfort, it's also equipped with a polyurethane rim for all-day support, whether you're sprinting down the halls of Lumon Industries, going for a quick jog, or just trying to up your step count during a summer lunch break. Better yet, while most NBs can easily run you over $200, the New Balance 574 costs just half of that at most, with some pairs available for as low as $85. Is it any wonder Adam Scott,paragon of normal-guy style, swears by his? Not in the slightest.

    "title": "Hollywood’s Favorite Vintage Dealer Just Landed in New York",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterShow Notes,in which Samuel Hine reports from the front row of the fashion world.Sign up here to get it free. The vintage dealer Tommy Dorr is just an email or an Instagram DM away, but his appointment-only showroom,Mothfood, still feels like one of the best kept secrets in fashion. Since opening his studio in LA’s Mount Washington neighborhood in 2015, Dorr has become the go-to source of airy white midcentury button-ups and sun-faded pocket tees for stylists, editors, fashion designers, and a generation of budding pop idols and Hollywood starlets. As of last week, Mothfood—like many of the insiders who shop there—is officially bicoastal. On Friday, Dorr cut the ribbon on Mothfood’s New York outpost, a bright floor-through loft just off Canal St. in Chinatown filled with the understated but deeply interesting Americana garments he’s known for. That afternoon, I walked out of the elevator as Dorr was unpacking bottles of mezcal for that evening’s opening party. Dorr was expecting a familial crowd, having texted the invite to several dozen New Yorkers who, like me, used to trek out to Mount Washington whenever they were in LA. “I feel like the New Yorker’s eye is very detail oriented—they like to nerd out on the same pieces that I really like too,” Dorr said, adding that despite the size of the space, he is planning to keep it to private appointments. “I want it to be an intimate spot where people can take their time to really look at stuff and not be bothered by anything else.” Tommy Dorr In case you haven’t been vintage shopping in New York lately, the experience tends to be the opposite of intimate and unbothered. The city is in the midst of avintage style renaissance, with downtown gallery openings and impossible-to-book restaurants filled with twenty-somethings proudly rocking paint-splattered Carhartts and billowy made-in-USA shirts, accessorized with archival designer bags and sunglasses. Vintage menswear transcended hipsterdom years ago, but it’s only more recently, as luxury pricing has gone truly haywire, that old clothes have truly become a cornerstone of the modern style zeitgeist. Which makes trying to pick your way through the city’s crowded thrift stores and ephemeral street racks an increasingly chaotic and disorienting experience, with good pieces—and good deals—becomingrarer by the day. Sifting through a rail of crummy (but expensive) mass-produced shirts and foreign-made Levi’s at a buzzy secondhand shop recently, I felt like I was facing down vintage menswear’s existential crisis: was I being taken for a ride, or was this truly all that was left? Mothfood might be the cure for vintage anxiety. In the loft, you wouldn’t be able to tell that it’s becoming harder to find what Dorr, an affable Midwesterner in a sun-faded cap, called “true vintage”—i.e. tough-made gear from the ’30s through the ’50s. A 25-year veteran of the trade, Dorr works with a longstanding network of pickers and suppliers who keep the good stuff flowing his way, which is why he’s a longstanding resource for designers likeEmily Adams Bode Aujlaand Hollywood costume designers likeArianne Phillips(A Complete Unknown) andHeidi Bivens(Euphoria). Dorr’s influence extends into a pervasive vintage-inflected aesthetic that can arguably be traced from the Erewhon parking lot back to Mothfood: think cheeky graphic tees, cropped sailor trousers or short athletic shorts, and faded canvas work jackets. Of his prominent clientele, all Dorr would say is: “I deal with a ton of musicians and, you know, younger famous people.” (Like most people in his line of work, Dorr is circumspect by nature.) But it doesn’t take too much asking around to find that Gracie Abrams buys her paper-thin graphic tees from Mothfood, and that when Emma Corrin and Rami Malek go on a coffee run they’re likely to be wearing Dorr-sourced vintage rather than designer. The likes of Harry Styles, Steven Yeun, Kristen Stewart, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, and even Katie Holmes are also fans. It’s no coincidence that celebs who make old-world craft look contemporary (and who not coincidentally share a penchant for Bode) flock to Mothfood. “Of course vintage has been around forever, but in terms of creating an identifiable world or brand around what he does, I feel like Tommy really pioneered something,” said Chris Fireoved of New York-based knitwear brand Lauren Manoogian, who told me he’s been inspired by Dorr’s aesthetic universe since meeting him in LA over a decade ago. “Tommy isn’t necessarily in search of a certain piece, he’s more so understanding how a group of pieces can be put together in a beautiful puzzle. He has a truly recognizable and authentic vision,” Fireoved added. Dorr himself prefers wearing ’90s Gap sweatshirts to those made in the ’40s (“I mean, it’s a better fit,” he said), though he has plenty of the latter in stock. He extends this un-snobbish philosophy to his showroom, where century-old sweaters only make it to the shelves if they can fit into a modern context. “I’ve never been a vintage purist,” he said, fishing out a colorful cropped knit T-shirt from the ’20s that looked like it was destined for a Miu Miu moodboard. “Can you match it up with anything you’re buying elsewhere? That’s where my mind is when I’m sourcing stuff.” Which isn’t to say there aren’t some holy grails lining his shelves. At one point, I was stopped in my tracks by a beautifulLevi’s Type 1 denim jacket, a tier-zero vintage treasure if there ever was one. As I mutteredwowunder my breath, Dorr all but rolled his eyes. “It’snice,” he cautioned, “but that’s, like, vintage guy stuff.” In most stores, it would be hanging in the rafters, not for sale. Here, it was tagged at $5,000, which, like most Mothfood prices, is pretty fair for what it is. Dorr guided me instead toward a gauzy striped tee with a cool boxy silhouette and wonky hand-stitched breast pocket. “Like, I get the jacket, but I don’t care, really.” The relatively unassuming but arguably more unique pocket tee, he said, “is what makes vintage interesting to me. I don’t want people to have to look at a label to see that something's good or relevant to today.” I added the pocket tee to a pile that included something I have genuinely never seen before: a beguiling olive green sweatshirt that looked like the love child of a cardigan and a bomber jacket. It had been a while since I experienced that private thrill of discovery in a rack of clothes, or that fateful moment when I tried it on and it fit like the sweatshirt was made for me (despite, of course, it being about 70 years old). Until I turned to my right and the process played out all over again with an exquisitely-faded Coast Guard football tee. (I bought both.) As Dorr and I chatted while I shopped, I realized that not even he is immune from vintage anxiety. “I mean, everything is exposed now,” he said, adding gently that one day he’d like to be in a place where he can fully eschew press and publicity. But for now, given that Mothfood could very well become the next NYC vintage hotspot, Dorr is focused on keeping his customer—and himself—inspired. “When the elevator opens up and you walk in and see clothes you’ve never seen before, that to me is worth everything,” he said.

    "title": "Pusha T Is Selling Off Some of the Rarest Designer Grails in His Closet",
    "article_text": "Some artists chase the zeitgeist—and then there’s Pusha T, who moves like he’s already left it in the dust. Designer dust, no less. Last week, the Virginia rapperteased a track from the reunited Clipse, “So Far Ahead,” with a video of himself suiting up for the Met Gala in a burgundy Louis Vuitton jacket flecked with crystals that glistened like high-end contraband. Pharrell’s hook—“Once they figure it out, I don’t want it”—turns the moment into a manifesto: this isn’t nostalgia. It’s the ’00s coke rap legends claiming the future. “It’s a whole new chapter,” Pusha T tellsGQaboutLet God Sort Em Out, his first album with his brother Malice in 15 years. “This is new, it's groundbreaking, it's fresh. This isn't a reminisce runway. Everything is new—the music, the energy, the competitive spirit. It's all about what's next andbeingwhat's next.” Pressing forward often means letting go of the past. So starting on Monday, May 19, Pusha is putting some of his most prized grails up for sale through fashion marketplace GOAT. Dubbed“Keys Open Doors: The Archive of Pusha T,”the collection showcases rare pieces from significant moments in his career—like a pair of Dion Lee moto panel pants he wore on the “It’s Almost Dry Tour” in 2023, and the headline-stealing Prada split flame bowling shirt he rocked at the Governors Ball in 2018. Each item tells a story, sure, but the sale itself is a kind of statement. Pusha’s not offloading history, nor merely reliving past glory from theLord Willin’era. He’s clearing room for what’s ahead, both in his closet and in the culture. The day after his birthday, which he spent soaking in Kendrick Lamar’s concert in Boston and having a big dinner with friends, King Push sounds focused and energized. We talked about the stories behind some of his pieces, the way hip-hop has taken the lead in luxury fashion, and why he’s confident the new Clipse album is going to lap the competition. Pusha T:I just want people who follow what it is that I do in the fashion lane to get a peek into the closet—it gets me inspired. Hopefully they can see where I was in that particular time period. I do this pretty often in regards to just purging my closet. When I'm going through it, deciding what I'm giving away and what I’m not, I can just feel the different places and time periods where I was into certain things. Just being in the competitive spirit of fashion and always trying to be onto what's next, I end up not being able to keep a lot of things. Because, man, it gets overwhelming. And when I get overwhelmed by my closet, I just stop. [Laughs.] I just stop wearing anything and just keep it very uniform. So I need to always be having new things introduced to the fold. Yeah. Always, man. I have to purge. There's always a lot of press, a lot of events. Always something where you gotta be dressed and keep that competitive spirit going on. Yes. Yes. So far ahead. You know they behind. I really look at fashion as being synonymous with just hip-hop culture. My favorite rappers couldn't just rap good, they had to have the best jewelry. They had to drive fresh cars. It was an all-encompassing thing. And those are the rules I’ve tried to play by. I feel like you need to lock your fans in with more than just the music. If they can connect with you on all of those different touch points, then you got a fan for life. Governors Ball 2018 Prada Split Flame Double Match Bowling Shirt Oh, man. The flame bowling shirt, I think, was the start of a wave. I think me andJeff Goldblumwere the only ones that had it at the time. Prada just always comes with it, and that particular season, the bowling shirt and the different iterations they came out with were very much so a must-have. It was colorful and it was, at the same time, great to perform in. I just knew Guv Ball at that particular time was a big stage and a big place, so I knew the fit had to be everything that I needed it to be. And Prada was right on time with that. Oh, for real? [Laughs.] That’s hard. I didn’t know that. Shout out toNew Yorker. Performance art is crazy. Dior Men’s Fall 2024 Show Dior Chiffre Rouge Ultramatte Chronograph It was a gift fromKim Jonesfor Paris Fashion Week [last year]. Kim has always been a good friend. We've always supported each other. He did my wedding suit in 2018. At that particular fashion show, he showed up for me to make sure he gifted me that watch. Dior under Kim has always been very tasteful, very classy. It’s always been an ‘If you know, you know’ type of thing. Dior Homme x Alex Foxton Bomber Jacket Dion Lee Moto Panel Pant I really don’t know, man. I’m sure it started from both of us being fans of each other’s work, which turned into, “Come to a show, come here, come there.” Around this time, too, I was seeing Kim a lot because he was just around in music, whether I was meeting up with Ye or whatever the case may be. I can even go as far back as “Numbers on the Board” (off Pusha’s 2013 solo debutMy Name Is My Name) being one of his favorite joints. That music and fashion connection is what actually brought us together. Music is a great backdrop for designers, and especially Kim, to create. At the time, that’s what he was into. Thom Browne’s Fall-Winter 2023 Show Thom Browne Hector Bag in Pebble Grain Yeah, man. I had that for New York Fashion Week [in 2023]. That's actually when I worethe blazer and shorts with the Thom Browne fit. I chose to walk with the dog bag in memory of my dog who had passed away, CJ. I was like, “Aw, man, let me rock this bag in memory of him.” Yeah, man. I had to do something fresh for him, and it was right on time. I thought it was fresh, I really did. And I thought that particular fit was fresh too. Something’s always gotta mean something. It’s always purposeful. Pharrell x Superstar 92 ‘Virginia’ Sample Kiko Kostadinov Depero Packable Pullover Yeah, the Pharrell design. He has a fascination with oversized shoes. You can definitely see his influence in that. But the Superstar in general—c’mon, man, that’s one of the most hip-hop silhouettes ever. Made famous by Run-DMC. Probably one of the first brands to really, fully embrace hip-hop culture… You got the Clipse as a duo representing Superstars, and historically Run-DMC as a duo representing Superstars, doing the campaign shoot in Virginia, and Pharrell being the actual designer of this particular Superstar. It was a full-circle moment in about three to four different ways right there. It’s been really good, man. I feel like creatively we’ve shown each other that this doesn’t have to ever stop. You know, we can definitely do this forever. We’re collectively creating and thinking competitively about the climate of music and where it's at and how we can attack it. It’s been a really fun, fun exercise. Yeah, that’s it. Exactly, man. You keep referencing that and you can hear the arrogance even in a song with a gospel hook. [Laughs.] That’s just how we feel. Musically, the song is just on another level. It just speaks to our creative taste and palate, how we are and how we feel like we are so far ahead. Once you listen to it, you’ll understand it. The lyrics and the stencil and the pattern are sophisticated. It’s not quintessential rap that don't mean much. We’re actually giving it to you in a pattern and a stencil that not many can do. And not many can make it cohesive or so clean and recitable, where people want to recite it. We’re just ultimately bragging that we're better and that's just it. So far ahead. Yeah, for sure. I have to say that. We are taking inventory and staking our claim that no one is better than us. I think for me, when you hear the music and see us on LV runways, it just shows you how far rap has come. There was a time where certain brands wouldn't touch our music or wouldn’t touch the content. There would be certain times when a brand wouldn't acknowledge the influence, or would be scared to acknowledge the influence. Those things are long gone. I think the influence can't be denied anymore. This particular music is the influence. People don’t necessarily look at other genres and be like, “Oh my gosh, I want to look like this or I want to dress like this.”Everybodylooks at the hip-hop genre and takes everything from it and puts their twist on it. They may repurpose it in their own way, but it all comes from us first. And that’s the truth.",

    "title": "The Night Britney Premiered “Toxic” In Vegas",
    "article_text": "Jeff Weiss’sWaiting For Britney Spears: A True Story, Allegedlyis a pop-star biography the wayFear and Loathing in Las Vegasis a journalistic account of a trip to an auto race and a district attorneys’ convention—i.e., circumstantially, but also not at all. Before the public meltdown, before the conservatorship, before the relitigation of the 2000s in hand-wringing documentaries about our culturewide complicity in the destruction of Britney and other pop stars’ lives by gossip-rag stringers swarming like piranhas with press cards, and before the social-media dance videos shot from impossible non-Euclidean camera angles like TikToks from the Black Lodge, Britney Spears was a huge star and Britney Spears was hounded, and Weiss (who went on to a distinguished career in the reputable-by-comparison field of music journalism) was one of the hounds. As a young writer in Los Angeles—then as now, categorically one of the least-remunerative types of young person to be—Weiss blags his way into a reporting job at a celebrity magazine by claiming to have won the H.L. Mencken Award for Excellence in Journalism at a college which does not actually have a J-school. This lie sets the tone for a headlong plunge into the reality-distortion field that swirls around famous people in the naughty Oughts, in which truth is the first casualty of gossip-mag circulation wars, car chases are all in a night's work, and the clubs part their velvet ropes for Verne Troyer (RIP.) Written in the voice of a James Ellroy tabloid fixer palpitating on pharmaceutical taurine, it’s a compulsively readable account of a you-had-to-be-there era by someone who was actually there—and on every page our own oneshotted, brainrotted epoch slouches toward the VIP section at Hyde to be born. “People were running red lights at every intersection,” Weiss writes. “Proverbs about virtue and humility felt paleolithic when everyone was trying to get ahead, get paid, andpush miracle whips. It wasLaguna BeachandThe ApprenticeandWho Wants to Be a Millionaire.Home ImprovementbecameCribs.Shock and awe as a cultural mandate. From every packed club and card, you could hear Usher, Lil Jon and Luda’s ‘Yeah.’ The sky was balling. \"Until you escape it, you rarely understand how much it affects you. I considered myself a cool-headed skeptic, but it’s like living next to a power plant: only a Geiger counter can measure the extent of the radiation. What’s the point of following the rules when the rule book is being shredded in real time? We were entering the famous-for-being-famous era, where the only currency was public recognition. Literary romanticism seemed laughable.” In this excerpt, Weiss his photographer associate Oliver hop a last-minute flight from L.A. to Vegas to watch Spears & Co. ring in 2004 at the Palms, and our hero cops to just how comfortable he’s become on the other side of a powdery looking-glass: “Secretly,” he writes, “I reveled in the choose-your-own-adventure possibilities of every assignment. I’d begun to subscribe to the classic bad-faith axiom:If I don’t do it, someone worse will.” —Alex Pappademas It’s hard to forget a flamethrower.Arson machines spurt fire to the beat of Nelly’s “Pimp Juice” as we strut through a gold-mirrored tunnel into Rain. The fog is so thick that I can barely see past the bill of my trucker hat. We emerge into a twenty-five-thousand-square-foot maze of gyrating bodies, dancing water fountains, and pagan hedonism. A Viking rave sponsored by Armani Exchange. Bottle service girls guide us into a bronze elevator. On the third-floor VIP mezzanine, tables are covered with ice buckets, top-shelf liquor, and mixers. Ours overlooks the elevated stage and dance floor. On platforms suspended in midair, go-go dancers in leather corsets wrap themselves around stripper poles. On an IMAX screen, rain is projected, with a palm tree dotting the “i.” In her private skybox, Britney Spears sits right next to us. For the last five years, I’ve dreamed of a reunion. But this isn’t how I planned it. I figured we’d meet as peers operating in parallel spheres of creativity. Something like Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe. She’d be a huge fan of one of my books. We’d be introduced at the club and settle down into domestic serenity. Two kids named Kaleb and Brayden, a mortgage, a white picket fence, and a phalanx of twenty-four-hour security guards to clothesline anyone who tries to hop the white picket fence. I didn’t expect such tangled emotions. My adolescent crush has been tainted by celebrity obsession. There she is, dressed down in a baby-doll tee and hip-hugging jeans, but a force field exists between us, between her and everyone. Barely old enough to drink, but worth eight figures, the most glimmering possibility that a glitching system can still produce. It’s not midnight yet, but the future is starting to collect shadows, and this eclipse falls over me while I silently deliberate what it all could mean for my own prospects. If I nail this story, there will be bonuses, enhanced cachet, the rise of my own crossed star. A start. Above the DJ booth, a “Countdown Until Midnight” clock comes on. I stumble to the railing, looking into Britney’s suite. She’s orbited by lithe backup dancers, a few blondes who look like cousins, a security guard, and a dead-eyed Bluto wrapping acreatine-enriched bicep around her. Oliver jabs me. “Take off that hat.” Security is sparse in the VIP. You pay for what you can get away with. No one blinks when out theVon Dutchcomes enough powder to have the club sleepless until the Rose Bowl kickoff. Oliver does key bumps in plain sight. I pop an MDMA capsule of “the purest shit,” allegedly bought off a London rave legend. A few girls in Britney’s booth notice us, but Britney is mesmerized by this beefhead with a Caesar cut. At the stroke of midnight, 2004 is catcalled in by fourteen-foot jets of fire and a cascade of artificial rain. A disco ball shatters. The crowd whoops. The speakers growl; the whistle shrieks. The clubgoers yell in response . . .Aww skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet! Lil Jon bounces out to scream all the ad-libs for “Get Low.” Too $hort emerges to perform “Shake That Monkey.” Oliver and I pound tequila sunrises and absorb the syncopated chaos. Britney furiously kisses the frat boy with the popped collar. Of all the Patrón joints in all the neon towns of the world, I had to walk into hers. Britney might not even be the most famous name in the building. In another water box,Kobe Bryantand his wife, Vanessa, survey the realm. In the next, Sacramento Kings superstarChris Webberrehabilitates a microfracture of the knee with liquid cures. For the first hour, I bob my head as Britney bounces, being adored by both the boy toy and a Salma Hayek doppelgänger. Refills are summoned with a swirl of the arm. Part-time models stare because we have a table at Rain on NYE. No matter how humble you think you are, it’s easy to slip into a pretense of superiority. Live long enough like a king and you start to lie to yourself that you are one. Britney and her crew file out of their box. When I stand to follow, the molly wallops me. A series of flashes and levitations. Arteries flooded by Jacuzzi jets. Day-Glo color lighting up edges of my mind. I’m sweating diamonds.Oh my god, are they playing “Stand Up”? The dance floor is a strobe-lit acre.Ludacrisand Shawnna duet—When I move you move—and thousands freak in sleazy harmony. Never before or since has the phrase “feels like a midget is hanging from my necklace” carried such purpose. “We’re about to have a legendary moment at Club Rain!! ARE . . . YOU . . . READY?!!!” The DJ suddenly shouts. “MISS BRITNEY SPEARS IS IN THE BUILDING! And this is her NEW SINGLE!!!” Britney’s troop parts the crowd. The DJ flips a switch. A river circling the dance floor turns green, yellow, and red. Flames shoot and smoke leaks from the walls. When the mist clears, four dancers encircle Britney. “Toxic” bangs from the loudspeakers, a comet of erotic Alpha Centauri funk. This is the second single, slated to drop next week, but already destined to ring off in every club until the last days of revelation. The strings bleed like they were stabbed by a synthesized pickax. Britney’s eyes are flammable. Whipping her blonde mane, she rubs her hands across her flat bare stomach, almost inducing mass fainting. Her hips swivel and vibrate. She caresses her face, laminated eyes rolling back in ecstasy. From the VIP rafters, Kobe and Vanessa gawk. In tune with a song about fatal lust, the dancers weave like furies, bobbing within centimeters of her body, the cold fog becoming a steam bath.“With a taste of a poison paradise . . . I’m addicted to you…” Britney controls everything, writhing with no worlds left to conquer. For the first time in her adult life, she’s free. Her family is back in Louisiana. The tyrannical managers and agents and publicists and lawyers and accountants and label executives and spying minders are thousands of miles away. The minute-by-minute itineraries, the persistent demands of press, and the teen idol façade feel distant. No one is here to tell her what to do, and all she wants to do is be twenty-two. She’s flagrantly wealthy, having already fulfilled impossible dreams—a life’s work finished early. I sip tequila dregs, mostly ice. Tropical waves overrun my veins. I blink hard, crystal sweat trickling. Fans mob Britney, asking her to autograph receipts and bar napkins. She seems overwhelmed, but honors the requests until her bodyguard, Big Rob, swoops in. Amidst the commotion, Oliver whispers to a girl in her entourage. They peel off toward the unisex bathrooms. Taking Britney’s departure as an affront, the DJ spinsJustin Timberlake’s “Rock Your Body.” In the refuge of the VIP, I chain-smoke Parliaments and empty the Patrón bottle. The molly throttles me for a few more swells, but the rush eventually dwindles.Where exactly am I?Three a.m. in Las Vegas, sputtering . . . the go-go dancers swinging from their stripper poles, body paint chipped, makeup smeared, ripped confetti and spilled champagne on the ground. The shock-and-awe explosions still roar at timed intervals to defibrillate anyone slipping away. 2004 is dawning with inflamed and distracted eyes. Oliver remains at large. Only the early morning scavengers remain among the crowd. I look through the smeared Plexiglas. Britney’s after-party stumbles out, mostly smiles and full cups. Swiveling my head toward the VIP exit, I see her, scarcely able to walk. Knees buckling. The bodyguard and the lummox catch her and clandestinely escort her out before anyone can ask for another autograph. Excerpted fromWaiting For Britney Spears: A True Story, Allegedly, by Jeff Weiss.

    "title": "15 Best Short Shorts for Men in 2025, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The heat is rising, the sun is shining, and the thighs are ready: ‘tis the season when the best short shorts for men come out to play. Letting your quads share the spotlight has gotten a lot of hype the last few years—scientists carbon date the start of the modern short-shorts movement tothis 2020 photo of Paul Mescal—and yet some men have wondered if we’ve reached peak short shorts. They have it all wrong: asthatphoto of a young Harrison Ford at Cannes still proves, the best short shorts for men will always deserve a place in any summer rotation. Particularly if you’ve spent the last few months grinding through leg days. The next question, then: what, exactly, makes a pair of men's shortsshort? In our book, an inseam around 5 inches represents the golden mean. Yes, there are shorter options available, but when you get to the realm of 3” or less, you’re either a hardcore track runner or a potential danger to the public. But as with every rule, there exist asterisks and interpretations. The word “short” is relative. In hunting for the best short shorts, we’ve given some options in the 6” range, since every brand—and every man—approaches a pair of shorts a little differently. If you’re tall, or only just now dipping a thigh in the short-shorts genre after years of knee-skimming pairs, a 6.5” inseam might look (and feel) downright breezy. Or your appetite may come down to the scenery; you might feel better about short shorts at the beach, but less so at the hotel tiki bar. To help you keep things short and sweet this summer, we’ve found 15 pairs of the best short shorts for men across a variety of categories, from everyday linen and chino-style pairs to short shorts for the gym or a swim. Just don’t forget the sunscreen. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew blessedly makes almost every pair of its shorts in a variety of inseams, from dadly 9-inchers down to its shortest 5-inch pairs. Which means you can almost certainly just grab the trimmed-down version of your J.Crew faves. That said, we’d go with this linen pair over the usual chino if only because linen breathes nicely, will feel a little less restrictive than thicker cotton, and comes with that standout coin pocket up near the waist. They’ll be chill with a tee, but an Oxford shirt, camp shirt, or light cotton sweater plus a pair of loafers will get you into the resort’s nicest restaurant. Portuguese Flannel Mr Porter Drawstring shorts ask nothing yet offer everything you want—ease, comfort, relaxation—whether you’re strolling cobblestoned streets or going Do Not Disturb mode under a seaside palm tree. Portuguese Flannel’s Atlantico shorts add to the mix with cotton seersucker, with the fabric’s natural pucker that lets air hit your skin and resists wrinkles. Seersucker historically comes in brazenly striped blue or khaki and white, but this subtle navy-on-navy looks sharp without shouting. Tracksmith Tracksmith As with everything Tracksmith makes, the Van Cortlandt will quickly become your favorites for racking up miles on Strava, thanks to the lightweight mesh and built-in liner. But they’re so soft, so breezy (thanks to a 4-inch inseam), and so retro-handsome that you'll be wearing them while casually speeding through your to-do list. Lululemon Lululemon Short shorts belong at the gym. You’ve got to let the tigers out of the cage when you go big gains hunting. No, but all Instagram swole-speak aside, Lululemon’s fairly legendary Pace Breaker Shorts have long been beloved for doing everything right, with a mostly recycled poly technical fabric that’s moisture-wicking and lightweight, plus the optional very comfortable liner. We’re especially big fans of the liner’s storage pocket, which will keep your phone locked in place whether you’re doing clean and jerks or just sprinting downstairs to catch the DoorDash guy. Buck Mason Buck Mason Thanks to leaders in the field likeshort shorts enthusiast Chris Pine, we’ve been reminded that corduroy deserves your consideration come summer. This Buck Mason pair has a luxuriously soft finish (seriously, there is a noticeable gap between cheap corduroy and the good stuff) and a slightly demure 6-inch inseam. The patch pockets on the front and back make these a variation on camp shorts, bringing a little seventies summer to your wardrobe. Drake's Mr Porter We’re well aware that a new pair of jean shorts is only as far away as a pair of scissors. That said, turning 501s into 5-inchers is a one-way ticket to Daisy Duke Island, complete with dangling fringe (and hopefully nothing else). The better blue jean solution comes from the gentlemen aesthetes at Drake’s, who turn soft denim—complete with a beautiful indigo wash—into a pair of comfortable drawstring short shorts that are too beautiful for the word “jorts.” Patagonia Patgonia Yes, Patagonia Baggies are quite possiblytheeshort shorts standard-bearer, and we’vegiven them their accolades…often. But there’s no more hard-working member of a summer wardrobe than the humble chino short, and Patagonia’s 5” version of the Heritage Stand Up Shorts (also available in a 7” style) stands out in a sea of khaki lookalikes thanks to some outdoor-inspired details: abrasion-resistant (and visually cooler) cotton canvas and swoopy outer pockets on the butt. Graba pair or two of 5” Baggies, sure, but don’t be surprised if you log more hours in the Heritage Stand Up Shorts between now and Labor Day. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder The ultimate hybrid short, in a handsome package (non-intentional pun). They’re somehow both classy and quick drying, in case you’re heading straight from the swimming hole to dinner. Adidas Adidas Classic for a reason, those three stripes just look good running between the drawstring and some toned quads—even if you’re just walking with an iced latté. If you want a more technical version, the Adidas Own the Runs are her for your interval training. JW Anderson SSENSE Designer Jonathan Anderson, also the new menswear mastermind at Dior, knows that a little ombré never hurt anybody. Bather Bather Our consensus best men's swim trunks bring a 5.5-inch inseam, a range of colors, and a timeless simplicity that won’t have you cringing when someone looks at your grid posts a decade from now. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Gym bros (non-gendered) love the Interval Short for all the helpful tech—four-way stretch fabric with a bit of abrasion resistance, an optional liner, and zip pockets that lock in a phone or AirPods—packaged into a clean looking set of shorts. Bonobos Bonobos Bonobos wants to give you options. Its Chino 2.0 shorts offer a 5-inch inseam (on top of a 7-inch or 9-inch options), 16 colors, and three fits. Bode SSENSE Your legs are a work of art; Bode’s embroidered satin shorts will make them into a masterpiece. RRL Ralph Lauren Rich indigo dye and a chunky plaid inspired by a vintage pattern turn a straightforward pair of chino-style shorts into something special. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Nneka Ogwumike Still Isn’t Thinking About the End",
    "article_text": "Nneka Ogwumike’s résumé is about as complete as it gets. Over the course of her decoratedWNBAcareer, the tireless veteran has racked up a Rookie of the Year award, an MVP honor, a championship ring, and nine trips to the All-Star Game. She is one of the most respected players in league history and authoredan unforgettable game winner in a do-or-die Finals game. Every time she's suited up for Team USA—including the 2014 and 2018 World Cups—she's brought home gold. (Controversially, Ogwumike hasnever been selected for an Olympics team, making her the only WNBA MVP never to play at the Games.) At 34 years old and now entering her 14th season—her second with the Seattle Storm, following a dozen with the Los Angeles Sparks—Ogwumike could retire today and rest assured that she’s done more than enough to merit a Hall of Fame induction. So what keeps Ogwumike going? “I really do think that moving to Seattle put a battery in my back,” she told me. “Being able to do all the things that I love doing, and also get to know myself as an athlete in a different and new way, has been really great.” Ogwumike and I were chatting by phone during a break in the Storm’s preseason training camp. There’s a lot that she’s come to love about Seattle—the team’s state of the art training facility, for one, and the crispness of the Cascadian air—but in many ways she’s still processing her decision to leave the Sparks, the franchise that drafted her first overall in 2012 and which she’d led to a championship just four years later. “The hardest part of switching when you've been with a team for so long was feeling as though you're not betraying anybody,” she said. “There's that element of loyalty that you have to work through, and square with yourself that you're making a good decision for yourself. That doesn't take away all of the history and relationships and the impact of the original franchise.” With the Sparks, Ogwumike formed a dynamic duo withCandace Parker, shepherding LA to that 2016 championship. She also had the chance to play with her younger sister, Chiney, who was a Rookie of the Year and multiple-time All-Star herself beforebecoming a sports media star. It’s been a full basketball life, and when pressed on it, she has no problem saying it’s been more substantial than her wildest dreams. “I definitely didn't think I would be playing this long,” Ogwumike admitted. “It's not that I didn't think it was something that I would want, it was hard for me to envision something like that. Right now, I'm not even really thinking about any end. I'm thinking about today. Although I do realize that there are definitely more years behind me than in front of me.” Ogwumike grew up in Texas before enrolling atStanford Universityin 2008, where she guided the Cardinal to the Final Four in each of her four seasons. Little did she know that her stint in Palo Alto would roll directly into a career spent entirely on the West Coast. “I’m from Houston, so I’m Southern, [but] I'm officially a West Coast girl,” she said. “I've been in the Bay, I've been in LA, and now I'm in the PNW [Pacific Northwest]. The West Coast just feels good for me.” Upon joining the Sparks in 2012, Ogwumike made an immediate imprint on the City of Angels. After WNBA icon Lisa Leslie retired in 2009, the Sparks went through a miniature flop era before Ogwumike showed up and ignited a run of nine straight playoff appearances, including that epic Finals victory in 2016. Ogwumike describes that period—about a decade and a half into the WNBA’s existence—not as the league’s infancy but rather its puberty. This was long beforewomen’s basketball went supernova. Nowadays, television broadcastseasily surpass a million viewersand players are flown to games on private flights. Ogwumike, who is president of the league’s players’ union and has been instrumental in securing these advancements, sings the same song as most female hoopers:Y’all just weren’t paying attention before. “You see how it changes with the talent but without the marketability,” Ogwumike said, referring to the early stages of her career when national excitement was lacking. “Then you see how it changes with the talentandthe marketability. Now we're almost on the other side of it. It's quite remarkable.” Like with every other professional sports league now, the audience is interested in a plethora of things that have nothing to do with wins and losses. The WNBA has developed its own thriving stan culture, with online zealots dissecting each and every move their favorite player makes, whether it’s the way they shake hands with opponents after the final whistle, orwhat they wear to the pregame tunnel. Ogwumike has been around long enough to remember when players showed up for the game AAU-style. “Back in the day, we used to wear our jersey to the game!” she said, laughing. Times have changed, though, and with the extra attention on the league, people have taken notice of Ogwumike’s impeccablestyle. A proud Nigerian-American, Ogwumike said that while she doesn’t exactly feel like she was born with the fashion eye, she was raised in an environment where clothing was always at the forefront. “I don't necessarily wear what is trendy, but I will say that I haven't been fearful of trying new things because fashion and expression through clothing is really huge in Nigeria,” she said. “I grew up seeing every shape, color, and texture [in] traditional Nigerian garb. [I got] a lot of inspiration from my aunties for sure because when you go to Nigerian functions, everyone is wearing what they callaso-ebí, or they're wearing caftans.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. When I asked which other WNBA player’s closet she’d like to raid, Ogwumike named her teammate Skylar Diggins without hesitation, noting that the point guard “really knows how to work with shapes.” Diamond DeShields and her “very unique, fashionable eye” also came up, but Ogwumike had to show love to an OG who she overlapped with for a year on the Sparks. “The first player that I recognized was doing something with fashion was Cappie Pondexter,” she said. “She was dressing up before anyone was doing it. What I love about fashion is that when people step out, that's how they view themselves today. I really like that they wanted to express themselves, or they felt like this is how they looked best! It gives you an insight on theself-love from different individuals and the self-expression.” With her career winding down, Ogwumike is planting seeds for the next generation to blossom. When training camp began, she emphasized to the Storm’s new rookies—including French sensation Dominique Malonga, who has alreadyrattled the rim at practice—that where they got picked in the draft doesn’t matter. The only number that matters, she believes, is 11 or 12. As in, are you one of the 11 or 12 players who actually made the roster? Beyond that, Ogwumike wants to make sure that her influence, and the game at large, extends to players outside the traditional American college system. She and Chiney—who have doneextensive work with UNICEFto create basketball teams, provide scholarships, and give millions of girls in Nigeria access to top-level education—want to see the WNBA aspopulated with African playersas the NBA. The Ogwumike sisters are just the second siblings in history to both be taken with the first overall pick in an American professional sports draft (alongside Peyton and Eli Manning), and they hope that putting the ball in the bucket is not the only thing they’re remembered for. “Just showing that it's an option as a pastime really, or even as a passion, and making sure that young girls have the same opportunity that young boys do in Africa,” Ogwumike said of her overseas efforts. “That's something that my sister and I are very passionate about.” Nneka (right) and Chiney after a Sparks win in 2022. The Storm begin their season on Friday with a desert duel against the Phoenix Mercury, a team Ogwumike has played 42 times, tied with theMinnesota Lynxfor most in her career. Barring injury, Ogwumike is in line to play her 400th WNBA game on June 1, and whenever she plays her 17th game of the season, she’ll pass her old friend Parker on the all-time games played list. Milestones like that have never mattered much to Ogwumike, who mentioned an intentional desire to remain as present as possible for the duration of her career. Being an approachable and caring teammate, she said, is more important to her than racking up individual accomplishments. Last year, as Ogwumike led the team in steals, three-point percentage, and player efficiency rating, the Storm enjoyed a strong season but were swept out of the first round of the playoffs. The league still undeniably runs throughNew YorkandLas Vegas, but the Storm have a veteran-laden, savvy roster that no team will be excited about playing. One thing should be apparent, though, to everyone who matches up with Nneka Ogwumike in 2025: She’s going to delight in every second of her time in Seattle. “Seattle was always my favorite place to play away games,” Ogwumike said. “It has ​​its own distinct character from the places that I've been in my past. It's definitely vibing with Nneka.”",

    "title": "John Mulaney Became a Father and a Watch Collector on the Same Day",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. John Mulaney begins every episode of his late-night showEverybody’s Liveby lifting his wrist, gazing at his watch, and announcing the time. That recurring bit has helped put the comedian on the map as one of the most exciting and tasteful new watch collectors on the planet. Throughout the show’s latest season, he’s worn increasingly alluring pieces from his favorite brands, like Chopard and Grand Seiko. In the increasingly over-the-top but homogenous world of celebrity wristwear, Mulaney has already distinguished himself as one of Hollywood’s most tasteful collectors. Mulaney’s journey as a collector had a rocky start.While the comedian’s fans will remember the story of a Jansport-wearing Mulaney frantically buying a Rolex to pawn off in his standup specialBaby J,that wasn’t actually the first watch he’d sold. Not long before that, Mulaney flipped a Vacheron Constantin he’d received as a gift for performing at a billionaire’s daughter’s birthday party. The buyer said he would take it, but it wouldn’t sell as quickly as watches from other brands.Like which brands?Mulaney wondered. Naturally, the buyer suggested Rolex. That chaotic period only made his first real experience as a budding collector all the more special. In November 2021, just a couple of years after selling that Rolex for cash, Mulaney’s wife Olivia Munn gave him a Rolex Air-King to celebrate the birth of their son. The watch is from 1982, Mulaney’s birth year, and has “Malcolm’s Dad” engraved on the caseback. “That Air-King was coming right off that whole Rolex debacle,” Mulaney said over Zoom this week. “It’s linked to a lot of stuff.” As Mulaney put it in our interview, he didn’tneedanother watch after receiving the ever-versatile Air-King, “but you still end up getting them.” Spoken like a true collector. In the ensuing years, he’s put together a wide-ranging collection that includes everything from white-gold Rolex Submariners and elegant Grand Seikos to high-flying Chopards and the new Breitling Top Time. Below, I spoke with Mulaney about becoming a collector, learning about Rolex waitlists from Lorne Michaels, and how Robert Redford’s Seiko got him interested in watches in the first place. Mulaney wearing the Grand Seiko Hi-Beat 36000 SBGH263 John Mulaney:Do you ever go to those big [watch] shows? GQ:Yeah, I was just in Geneva forWatches and Wonders. Were you paying attention to the releases? What did you like? It wasn’t so much paying attention, [but] I get fed more watch content now. I'm trying to think of what stood out to me. Why are you getting fed it? The algorithm is learning you like watches or you’re hearing from people in your life? I’ve been looking at watch stories over the past couple of years, so my Google News serves up watch stories as if they are the third or fourth biggest thing happening in the world sometimes. I like Grand Seiko a lot and there’s this high-beat, 36,000 automatic chronograph thing. It’s like a really interesting shape for a Grand Seiko watch. I have no idea what it looks like in person and I am not even sure if it’s for me, [but] I noticed it. I enjoy Grand Seiko watches. Yeah, I’ve noticed you gravitate towards Grand Seiko. You have a lot of Chopard and Piaget, too. But you kind of just skipped right by Rolex, Omega—the really recognizable brands. I don’t wear Rolex, Patek [Philippe], or Omega on the television show or even that often [in my day-to-day]. I don’t have an Omega. Mulaney wearing the Chopard Mille Miglia Classic Chronograph Why is that? They just aren’t your taste? No, they are. Just some other ones have a bit more of a lean-in thing. Like, when I see someone wearing a Submariner, I don't ask any questions about it, I know what it is. And I’m just more interested in watches that [are a little more] mysterious. That’s glossing over tons of nuance to this—I have a really nice vintage Patek Philippe Calavatra that Olivia [Munn, Mulaney’s wife] got me. Watching your standup specials, I don’t ever remember a watch being on your wrist. Maybe it was hidden, but how did the watch thing start for you? Quite comically. Okay, so the full story is I once did a private event and I was gifted a Vacheron [Constantin] watch. I was gifted it and I was paid for the gig, but I was also given this gift. It was this billionaire's daughter's birthday party. Wow. Sick. Now, not to rehash my own standup material, but when I was going through a bad period in life, I sold this watch for cash. The Vacheron? I sold the Vacheron and the guy was like, \"I can give you a little for this, but I can't move this as easily.\" And I was like, \"What can you move easily?\" And he was like, \"Patek Philippe, Rolex.\" I was like, \"Got it.\" So in the special I did, I tell the story of buying a Rolex, which all true, but I had already seen that guy before. So he told me, like, \"Don't try to sell a watch like this [VC]. This is pointless.” Not that pawning a Rolex at half its value immediately was not pointless. But anyway, that happened. I never wore those watches. I just sold them. I wanted to ask about the mysterious Rolex you flipped. Do you remember which model it was? Because I remember watching the bit and then going through and trying to figure it out. Based on the diameter in my memory, it must have been a Datejust or a Day-Date. I mean, it just wasn't a chronograph, it wasn't a Daytona, it wasn't a Submariner, it wasn't an Air King. They don't make those in rose gold, right? Must have been a Day-Date or a Datejust. And sometime after that you started actually collecting watches. When my son was born in November of 2021, my wife, Olivia, gave me a Rolex Air-King that says “Malcolm's Dad” on it on the back. It’s an Air-King from 1982, the year I was born. So that watch has a lot of significance, having sold them 24 months earlier. It’s still my favorite watch—I just enjoyed wearing it and from there [began collecting]. Mulaney and his Air-King That’s all it takes: You kind of findthe one, and it gets imbued with all this emotion. Andrew Singer, who ran Broadway Video [Lorne Michaels’s production company] for a long time, is a big, big watch guy. So I’d always look at his watches and be curious about why they were coveted. I don’t fuck with cars really, not at all, but I was curious: “Well, what is it that gravitates you towards this Rolex or that Rolex?” So I had a passing casual interest in it like that. The Air-King is such a fun starting point. And honestly I take it with me [everywhere]. I’ll be gone for weeks on end and I take it because you never need another watch. It’s great. You never need another watch, but you still end up getting them. Do you have more Rolexes, or is the Air King the only one in your collection? No. I have some vintage Day-Dates I bought, probably, without papers or a box just in an antique watch store. It was this place in LA, Wanna Buy A Watch? And then Olivia got me a Submariner for Christmas. That’s very cool. The white gold, blue bezel. You brought up Andrew Singer. Are there people that you’ve sought advice from as you’ve built your collection? Well, I talk to [stylist] Michael Fisher, who I work with on the show a lot. The fun of being on TV is people will lend you a watch to wear that you don’t have to buy and then you have to give back. So we’ve tried some sillier, more fun swings of things that I wouldn't wear normally in life, like skeleton watches. And there was a solid-gold Piaget watch that I didn't wear on air and then I lost [priority on it] to someone at the Met Gala. I didn't get a chance to wear it the next week, because it was back in New York City. Oh, the Polo 79? It’s more of a bracelet than a watch, really. The Polo 79, yeah. Not a thing I would normally wear, but yes. Mulaney with the Chopard L.U.C XP Urushi Year of the Rabbit So there are TV watches and then there are watches you wear every day. That makes sense, because this last week, I saw you wore the special edition Chopard for the Year of the Rabbit, with a scene of two cute little rabbits on it. Two cute rabbits on it and a great watch that everyone loved, but very hard to tell the time on. Two gold hands moving over two slightly gold rabbits. But it’s funny, I always go, “It is 7:01 PM.” And that was one where I had to go, “It is…” and then look at the studio clock. It’s rabbit time. I was going to say, because it’s now become a bit on the show for you to look at the time on your watch, so obviously it's very important to have a watch to do that. A hundred percent. And I have found with kids and not wanting to be on my phone in front of them, it’s very important to have a watch, because as soon as [the phone’s] in your hand, you’re a goner. So it’s nice to be able to tell the time without it. Yeah, I’ve started doing the same thing with my son. And by the way, during bedtime, a watch face that glows in the dark is extremely exciting. So how would you describe yourself now as a collector? It sounds like you started a few years ago when your son was born, but it sounds like you've amassed a pretty impressive collection. There’s a few brands. I have one or two of that Ireallylove, like Chopard, Breitling. I have a [Jaeger-LeCoultre] Reverso that I got in Paris during the Olympics. That was very exciting. Theblack and white [Duoface]. I have a small [Cartier] Santos that I got a couple of summers ago, too. And then on the TV show I wore a large Santos with a light brown band that was, I mean, for me, for life, way too big. It’s a beautiful watch. It was just a little big for my wrist. And let’s see, what do I wear a lot of? This really nice IWC chronograph and then two Grand Seikos that I honestly put on more than most. These Breitling Top Times, I have been wearing. [He lifts his wrist to show off thenew limited-edition blue-dial Top Time chronograph] The new ones? Yeah, it’s a really fun watch and doesn’t feel too big. Nice for most occasions, not distracting when you’re doing stand-up. That’s a consideration most people probably don't have when they’re picking out a watch. There are watches you might wear where the audience might lose any empathy with you. You don’t want to wear a Submariner and be complaining about traffic. I was thinking about your“mushing metals” joke fromBaby Jand was wondering, as an actual watch collector now, are there things that are no-gos for you? It sounds like you gravitate a little bit towards smaller watches, but are there other things that are off limits? I don’t wear rose gold, no pink gold. I’d like to say it’s for a better reason, but I’m that shade of pale where it doesn't look good. Yeah, I can’t wear pink or red shirts. It’s a bad look for me. Was there any kind of watch culture atSNLwhile you were there? No, not at all. But I first learned that Rolex was a unique company from Lorne Michaels, because he was lamenting the loss of Blackberry. And he was like, “Blackberry should do what Rolex did and just become a company that only sells them to some people. [It should] become a luxury brand phone.” And I was like, “Is that how Rolex works?” He goes, “Yeah.” I was like, “You can’t just buy…” He’s like, “No, there’s some you just can’t buy.” I was like, “Oh wow.” So I remember first learning,Oh, it’s not just walking into the store. The idea was that Blackberry would similarly just be this thing for certain people who like the encryption and the way it works. It’s a small Canadian company—they should be like Rolex, that’s probably a good idea still. It’s interesting. There’s no luxury phone. There’s all those “dumb” phones, but no one’s made the Richard Mille of phones. That’s what we need. Oh, you just make a metal case around it. Yeah, it’s iPhone by Richard Mille. Do you remember what your first watch ever was? Did you have a Flik Flak or a Casio as a kid? No memory. I remember wanting a Swatch. They were very well advertised and I never got one. They were so exciting looking. Yeah, they really were, and very well marketed for kids. Luxury goods for children. Exactly. So was it high school or college that you got your first watch? When did you finally make the first step? I made almost no steps. Hold on. I am so brain dead just as a parent that I just now Google things exactly the way they pop into my brain. So I just Googled, “What does he wear inAll Is Lost,” which is a Robert Redford movie. I loved the movieAll Is Lostand I remarked to my friend Max Silvestri, “His watch is so cool.” And a couple years later he got me one with a blue band, a Seiko SKX-009. Oh wow, that’s very cool. That’s an unbelievable first watch. I mean, I was in my 30s, but I love it. Still one of my absolute favorites. You still have it? Oh yeah. I wore it all the time. I'd say that the Seiko Diver made me think about watches a lot. I remember thinking, “Oh, you found the watch he wore?” One watch that I would never wear, speaking of the Redford thing, is the Bvlgari watch that Al Pacino wears inHeat. Have you seen that? Mulaney wearing the Rolex Day-Date No, I don’t know what this is. When Max was like, “I just looked up online what he was wearing in that movie,” I was like, “Oh, well I’m going to start Googling what watches people are wearing in movies.” And there was also an article about how the Al Pacino Bvlgari was way more expensive than an LAPD officer could probably afford, but hey. Are there other watches from movies or TV that you remember noticing? No, but I remember really enjoyinga Pierce Brosnan videowhere he walks you through his watches, mainly because of his calming voice. What was your first big splurge on a watch? I really noticed it when I bought that Reverso at the Olympics. I left the store and I was like, “Okay, we'll do [shows at] a few colleges or something [to pay for it].” Was there something about the spirit of the Olympics that you were like,I have to get a watch to bring home? No, there's something about the spirit of the Place Vendôme. You’re on the new season ofPoker Face. How was that? Really fun. Natasha [Lyonne] is one of my closest, oldest friends, so it was very cool to do. It was very fun to work with Simon [Helberg], and Miguel Arteta, the director, is really awesome. Richard Kind, my collaborator on everything, was there, which is really funny. He's super good in that episode. And we all went to dinner when we were shooting upstate New York with Rhea Perlman and him and a few others working on the show. It was a great time. Yeah, I saw a lot of the response was that you need to do more scripted on-camera work. Is that something that you want to do more of? I like to do certain things when I have time, which gets less and less frequent these days. I love to go do a fun series like that. It's a very different pace than even this show, which is live at night, let alone stand-up and touring. But I enjoy it, and I especially like the crew there. They're really good. Do you just select shows that you're a fan of? You were so good in that special ofThe Bear. They brought that to me. I was thrilled. I mean, I've known [The Bearshowrunner] Chris Storer for a little while and I was already such a fan of the show. And I was always going to be game to do something with Natasha and her show—that it was an FBI mole and to be the bad guy was exciting. See all of our newsletters, includingBox + Papers,here.",

    "title": "Los Angeles Is More Stylish Than You Think",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When Jasmine Benjamin showed up at YG’s compound to shootthe ultra-stylish LA rapperforCity of Angels, her new photo book on Los Angeles style, he was hosing down the concrete floor in his carport.YGwanted to make sure the ground looked pristine for the photo. “It was great just to see everyone I shot have so much pride about being in this project,” recalled Benjamin. After the hip-hop star finished with the hose, he went inside to change and returned in a leather vest with the gloves to match, a perfectly faded pair ofblack jeans, and glossy hard-bottomeddress shoes. YG clearly understood the assignment. City of Angels: A Book About LA Styleby Jasmine Benjamin “YG wasn’t someone I had to try to convince to do this. He was, like, ‘Oh yeah, there should have been a book about LA style.’ We took the photos, and then we went into the studio, and he gave him an interview where he wassoenthusiastic about LA style,” recalled Benjamin. “Specifically gang culture and how the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s inspire him. Out of today’s LA rappers, he’s so quintessential to me. He just embodies those references.” Benjamin spent three years working on the project, driving across the far-flung and lesser-known corners of the city with her camera. Along the way, she photographed everyone fromFear of Goddesigner Jerry Lorenzo and multitalented musicianThundercatto actressLauren Londonand contemporary artistLauren Halsey. Plus, a book’s worth of well-dressed locals ranging from a filmmaker in West Adams to a Hawthorne-based stylist to a curator from South Central. Impressively, Benjamin taught herself photography along the way. By trade, she is a professional stylist and costume designer; over the years, she's dressed the likes ofDonald Glover,OutKast,Anderson .Paak, and Miguel. (Remember Miguel’s pivot into a masterful mix of sharp tailoring with a rock ‘n roll edge duringhis “Kaleidoscope Dream” era? That was all Benjamin.)City of Angelscaptures the oft-overlooked style of Los Angeles, a robust collection of individuals and fashions that manages to do the near-impossible task of synthesizing the multicultural style of a sprawling metropolis. Benjamin chatted withGQabout the city’s longstanding love of workwear, how she rounded up well-dressed Angelenos from all corners of the city, and what the project taught her about LA style along the way. YG Jasmine Benjamin: I just made an Excel sheet and wrote down every person I would love to see in this book. People who I think have great style but also really represent the local Los Angeles community. I wrote down probably 70 names. I would then add more because I wanted to make sure that I had all the diverse types of people and subcultures here. So, I would eliminate or add from that. The only time I did a street casting, I went to Lee [Spielman] from [the clothing brand]Babylon. Lee and Garrett [Stevenson] have a band called Trash Talk. And I was like, “I want to go to a Trash Talk show.” I kept telling Lee, and Lee was like, “Oh, you don’t want to go to this show. People are getting their noses broken and stuff.” And I’m like, “Isn’t there a safe spot for me to go? I want to see the crowd!” He’s like,No, no, no... But I finally went, and two of the kids in my book were from that show. Vince Staples Lauren Halsey I did, especially with certain items of clothing. Workwear is a really important essential to Los Angeles. So, for instance,Dickiesare worn by people in the hood, you know what I mean? Gang culture. But Dickies are also worn by the Latin community. Dickies are also worn by the skaters. There were so many similarities, and that’s another reason why I wanted to capture all of these different people. To show the differences, but there’s still a throughline of what Los Angeles style is. Denim is obviously popular everywhere, but denim is such a part of LA style. Converse shoes orVans, depending on what subculture you were in. I mean, those kinds of things. There were definitely throughlines. I did not, and I didn’t style anyone. Some people would ask, “What should I wear?” And I’m like, “What would you usually wear?” Sometimes, I might have scrolled through their Instagram and suggested, “Wear something like this,” but a lot of the subjects came dressed as they usually do. The goal was for them to dress in the style they're known for. Jerry Lorenzo Alex “2Tone” Erdmann and Chris “Spanto” Printup Cali DeWitt. The coolest guy ever. When I see him out, I see him in awhite T-shirtand basketball shorts and he looks amazing with his mouth of metal and all his tattoos. When I was going to take his photo, I thought he would show up like that, which I was very into. And I’m like, “Wow, you got fully decked out for me.” [Editor’s note: DeWitt showed up dressed to the nines in a suit.] And I loved it because it’s still very Cali. He’s an icon, so he’s on his own level. Yeah, I did. I had to think about this a lot, right? One of the big reasons is thered carpet styleand Hollywood dressing. It takes over all of the attention. Of course it would because we’re dealing with huge movie stars. When you are not from here, [the idea of] Los Angeles is focused on Hollywood red carpets and maybe a little corner of town called WeHo [West Hollywood]. If you’re just in WeHo and you're just paying attention to the industry, then maybe LA doesn’t have great style. And this is not to saythatisn't style, because it has its own value, but the overall image becomes leggings andUggsand theErewhon smoothie, and movie stars on the red carpet. LA style just becomes all aboutthat. And so then the local scene gets completely disregarded. Cali DeWitt Hector and Jose Polio That was a big driving force of why I wanted to do this book because the locals are amazing. I hate that when LA is being represented, no matter what the topic is, they’re completely forgotten and taken out of the story every time. There are people here who have spent their entire lives here who are not connected to the industry. The industry is important. I’m not trying to diss it; I work in it, but that’s not where I live. That’s not what inspires me. It takes over the style conversation. Even some of my friends from New York, they’ll have their [negative] opinions too. And I’m like, “Yeah, but where did you go and spend time?” You have to go behind the 10 freeway, you have to go to the other parts of LA. But you have to drive there and it takes effort and you have to know where to go. It’s still very regional, which I love. With social media, there’s more information about what people are wearing in Paris and New York, but I think LA is very much about the classics. Sure, there may be more modern [fashion] pieces showing up now, but I think the classics just always remain. The other thing that makes it great in this moment of time is that it is just frozen with these classics. I’m not really into tons of change with a lot of things. I like that no matter what the style is anywhere else, Los Angeles still keeps its identity. Even though there might be new subcultures popping up and things like that, LA still keeps its identity because every different subculture relies on the same similar classics interpreted in a different way. David Friend Kohshin Finley I hope they admit that LA has style. And that we’re constantly poached by people around the world and around the country for style. In the book’s intro, you can read all of that because it’s true! And I just hope that everyone sees it. LA is such a rich place of culture and style, but I think it’s so easy to disregard it when you don’t see it together. It’s easier to kind of say LA doesn’t have [style] if you’re just looking into one pocket, but when you see them all together, it becomes clear.Workwear. Surf culture.Skaters. The rock scene. Gang culture. I’m glad that I took the long road of making it so that people can see everything together and hopefully it clicks. Let’s just stop this conversation that LA doesn’t have style.

    "title": "Kristen Stewart’s ‘The Chronology of Water’ Stays Too Close to the Surface",
    "article_text": "For her feature directorial debut, the actorKristen Stewarthas chosen to adapt a tough, lyrical memoir about a woman trying to out-swim a traumatic childhood and addiction. InThe Chronology of Water,the writerLidia Yuknavitchdetails the sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of her father and its long aftermath, from a scuttled competitive swimming career to new purpose found, years later, in writing. It’s a difficult piece, but Stewart has shown in her acting work that she’s a fan of daunting tasks. The film, which premiered here at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16, is no timid first foray into filmmaking. Stewart dives in full-body, keeping things ever in rapid motion—flickering forward and backward in time, ratcheting up high emotion and then suddenly breaking into a moment of dreamy peace. The effort is appreciated, even if all that style—however true it is to Yuknavitch’s prose—can sometimes overwhelm the meaning behind it. Imogen Pootsplays a version of Yuknavitch, from adolescence on. A promising freestyle swimmer with prospects of college recruitment, teenage Lidia perhaps sees athletics as her only escape from the routine horrors of her home. Her sister fled years ago, and Lidia is desperate to follow suit. But, of course, physical distance is not all that’s required to escape such lasting harm. Lidia turns to drugs and alcohol to disappear, and soon finds herself booted out of school and stumbling off into an entirely uncertain future, with sex and substances her only constant. There’s a plain, linear story in there, but Stewart is more interested in the jumbled interiority of the mind. Her film bobs and weaves and loops, gradually creating a picture of a woman both trying to rid herself of her pain and, in a complicated and sometimes fruitful way, feeding off of it.The Chronology of Wateris often a difficult sit, an oppressive mood piece steeped in unease and unhappiness. There are transcendent, lovely interludes, but for the first half of the film, we feel ourselves drowning just as Lidia is. Which is effectively the point. It’s hard to ding Stewart for putting us in the proper mindframe. What nettles, or disappoints, aboutChronologyis that Stewart pays more time to flourishes of chaos and despair than she does to really sussing out the memoir’s central metaphors and conclusions. Despite heaps of voiceover straight from the book, we don’t really come to understand Yuknavitch’s thesis. Maybe there isn’t one, but I longed for a stronger tether between the words being said aloud and the images accompanying them. I’ve no doubt that Stewart has a deep grasp on the philosophy ofChronology, but she doesn’t do enough to explain it to us in the audience. A too-close-to-the-case ardor for the material does the film a disservice, as can sometimes happen when a cherished object is adapted. (“There are voices that help you find yours,” StewarttoldVFearlier this weekof Yuknavitch’s work. “It became a sacred text for me overnight.”) The film exists at a remove, more object for formal study than something deeply felt. What does emotionally resonate feels unspecific to any one author; it’s just a generic, if compelling, tale of hard-won recovery. Stewart implies poetry rather than conjures it. The audience will just have to trust her about the wonders of Yuknavitch’s specific power. Some ofChronology’s busy craft is admirable, though, as is the breakneck performance at the center of the film. While Poots sometimes hits a flat note, I think those are more the fault of an over-indicating script. In all other manner, Poots fiercely commits to the long journey of collapse and catharsis. She plays drunk with a bracing veracity, storming through much of the film in a mad reel. She’s resonant in the film’s softer stretches too, ache and bitter disillusionment pooled in her eyes. The film asks a lot of its star, requiring a certain degree of bravery and trust, and Poot’s work would suggest that Stewart provided safe, comfortable haven for a performer looking to take a big leap. I did yearn for more dialogue—for more time to actually get to know Lidia beyond what is poetically but vaguely elucidated in voiceover. Poots is more than a mere vessel for snippets from the book, but she would be better served by a script that gave her more to play in any scene’s present tense. The full effect of Stewart’s fast-cut collage is that Lidia, and Poots, seem only to drift through the film rather than live in it. Still, cheers to Stewart for tackling something bold and complex in her first outing, and for bringing further attention to an acclaimed but lesser known memoir. Maybe read the book first, then watch the film as the artiest kind of supplemental material.

    "title": "Shari Redstone and Paramount’s Own Mission: Impossible—Survive a Trump Lawsuit and a Billion-Dollar Merger",
    "article_text": "Call it Mission: NotTotallyImpossible.Shari Redstone,the controlling shareholder of the $8 billion media giant Paramount Global, began talks to sell her stake in December 2023. A year and change later, staff, shareholders, and even viewers are on the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen next. Paramount’s lawyers are in the midst of settlement talks with PresidentDonald Trumpover his complaints about the editing of a60 Minutesinterview with Vice PresidentKamala Harris.CBS said it left out a clumsy answer to a question about US-Israel relations because of time constraints, though it had used the answer in a promotion for the upcoming interview. Trump believes CBS’s top news show portrayed Harris in a positive light, interfering with the election, and sued under theTexas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a law usually employed to protest false advertising claims. Trump had declined the show’s invitation to speak ahead of the election. He expanded his case in February, claiming $20 billion, up from an initial $10 billion, for having been harmed as a competitor to CBS via his social media network, Truth Social. The network, meanwhile, believes its edited interview has First Amendment protections. Redstone hasreportedlysaid that she is taking herself out of the talks, leaving it to her three chief executives to figure out the mess. That has left some feeling frustrated. “She needs to resolve this. Shari has the most to lose,” said one person familiar with the position of Redstone, who would have to pay a $400 million breakup fee if the deal were not to happen. (A CBS News spokesperson declined to comment. The White House press office didn’t respond for comment.) If things go in Trump’s favor, Paramount Global will become the latest media organization to pay Trump millions, sending one more chill down journalism's spine. On April 30,The Wall Street Journalreported that Paramount is ready to settle the dispute for between $15 million and $20 million. But if the president doesn’t like the number, a deal may not happen at all. Adding to the pressure, a group of nine senators wrote aletter​​, made public on May 7, to the Paramount Global controlling shareholder, imploring her not to settle the case with Trump: “In our view, that would be a grave mistake.” “Rewarding Trump with tens of millions of dollars for filing this bogus lawsuit will not cause him to back down on his war against the media and a free press,” the lawmakers wrote. “It will only embolden him to shakedown, extort, and silence CBS and other media outlets that have the courage to report about issues that Trump may not like.” Trump shared a furious statement onTruth Socialon Wednesday, May 7, about the Emmy nomination that the60 Minutesinterview with Harris received in the editing category. “These antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press, and demand that the Media, very much including60 Minutes,CBS and its owners, be held responsible for their corruption and lies, which is exactly what we are doing in Court!” Meanwhile, Redstone hadbeen in on-again-off-again merger talks withDavid Ellison,the owner of Skydance Media. At one point Redstone even walked away from those negotiations before returning to finalize a complicated deal that will involve her shedding her voting control in Paramount by selling her stake in National Amusements, Inc. The current agreement with Skydance is backed by both Oracle cofounderLarry EllisonandGerry Cardinale’s private-equity firm,RedBird Capital(where former CNN chiefJeff Zuckerhas a joint-venture business). IfBrendan Carr’s Federal Communications Commission gives the deal the go-ahead, Redstone will get to cash a check worth more than $1.75 billion and exit the business her grandfather Mickey Redstone helped establish. Redstone inherited her father Sumner’s controlling stake in what was then known as ViacomCBS in 2020, after his death at age 97. Despite Redstone’s rocky relationship with her father, who, according to a2015WSJarticle, once tried to buy her shares for $1 billion, he would likely be proud of the cards she’s played. Perhaps surprisingly, Redstone is well acquainted with Trump, which may help her navigate these stormy seas. Redstone is also trying to steer the tricky merger through the FCC, which is overseeing the request for the transfer of28 local CBS TV stationsand other licenses to Ellison family–controlled assets, even as it investigates the network for“news distortion” and isforcing Paramountto limit specific corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Paramount owns BET, one of the top cable destinations for African American viewers. Redstone has shown she is unafraid to make tough decisions. But even after the ouster of Paramount CEOBob Bakish(whose salary had hit nearly$87 million) and the installation of three chief executives (being paid around $20 million each), the 71-year-old, one of the most powerful women in media, is left with few good choices. Her relationships may help her survive it. Redstone has done her best to curry favor with Republicans. “She’s right of center, but not by any means extreme,” according to one person who knows her. “She’s generally interested in news being as accurate as possible. People are a mix of things. She’s very supportive of race relations and things that would be called DEI. She’s not dogmatic, and she’s not a party regular for anyone at all.” In January, Paramount hired Trump fundraiser and lobbyistBrian Ballardto help see the company through the rocky merger-approval process. Ballard Partners is also working for big tobacco companies in a fight against unlicensed vape products. Perhaps hoping a Republican government would be more likely to sign off on her plan, Redstone, through the company PAC, gave slightly more to Republican candidates than to Democrats in the most recent full-year cycle, according toopensecrets.org. And Redstone might have hoped for some goodwill from Trump, who once called to offer words of support amid her fight to get rid of former company management before he was ever a presidential candidate. “He would call and tell her to keep up the good fight,” according to the person who knows her. “I think she feels personally appreciative of that.” (Another possible connection:Mark Burnett, producer ofThe Apprentice,soldSurvivorto CBS.) Redstone and Trump have even lunched together. “Part of what is surprising is that he is giving CBS such a hard time when Shari is on one side and [Larry] Ellison is on the other,” that source said. The Oracle cofounder appeared in February at theOval Officeand is an ally of Trump. Speaking at theNew York TimesDealBook Summit in 2016, just after Trump won the presidency, Redstone told interviewerAndrew Ross Sorkin,“I’m actually really optimistic for someone to come in and unify the country. I think he listened to a lot of voices around this country that people weren’t listening to about some of the challenges that we have, and I’m hopeful that he’ll surround himself with really good people and start to solve some of the problems we have.” In 2019, Redstone discussed launching a right-wing news channel to take on Fox News, according toThe Hollywood Reporter. At the centerof Redstone’s dilemma is a news division that is at odds with both her mission to make peace with Trump and her life’s work fighting antisemitism. Redstone’s passion for Israeli causes has caused friction with news operatives for years. “She has no interest in understanding life in the Palestinian world,” one person told me, claiming Redstone did not understand journalism. A source close to Redstone denied this, saying she cared about innocent people on all sides of war. (Redstone declined to comment for this story.) Redstone has weighed in on news coverage numerous times in recent months, including sticking up for anchorTony Dokoupilafter he challengedTa-Nehisi Coateson air. Coates had been onCBS Morningsto discuss his bookThe Message,which is about censorship and includes a section on Israel and Palestine (Vanity Fairexcerpteda portion of the book). But the interview got heated and Dokoupil was accused ofnot meeting editorial standards. (Dokoupil didn’t respond to a request for comment sent via a CBS PR representative.) Only a fewblocks away from its New York headquarters, an adaptation ofGood Night, and Good Luckopened to packed houses on Broadway. The play starsGeorge Clooneyas CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow, who bravely challenges Senator Joseph McCarthy. Amidst all this came the resignation of Bill Owens, the executive producer of60 Minutes,one of American broadcasting’s longest-running, most respected, and most lucrative TV news series. Owens has claimed to be a victim of corporate interference, telling staff in a memo, “Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for60 Minutes,right for the audience,” according to a copy shared withThe New York Times.“So, having defended this show—and what we stand for—from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.” Staff wonder if Owens’s departure might have been a gesture of self-sacrifice, aimed to allow the news division to avoid having to apologize to the White House. His close friend and anchorScott Pelleywent further, unspooling the unhappy tale for viewers on air on April 27, explaining that the company’s corporate parent is waiting on merger approval from the Trump administration for the deal with Ellison. “He did it for us, and you,” Pelleytoldthe60 Minutesaudience in an on-air segment, speaking about Owens’s exit. “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” Pelley has pusheda series of segments critical ofthe president, who has a long-standing beef with the show. (Trump walked off the set asLesley Stahlbegan interviewing him back in 2020. A previous dispute in 2005 between Republican presidentGeorge W. BushandDan Ratherand his producer ultimately ended Rather’s career at the network.) Owens’s accusations have prompted questions internally about what exactly happened, though it appears that Owens felt that the heat kept getting turned up on him viaSusan Zirinsky,who was appointed in January to a role overseeing sensitive news stories. The news division had been beefing up its oversight of news, which had become stretched by multiple growing responsibilities and under fire from critics, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, which had complained about a segment coveringState Department resignationsover PresidentJoe Biden’s Israel defense policies. Two TV news executives said that60 Minutesmade a mistake in the editing of the Harris interview. “You are not supposed to make the edit that they made,” said one person, describing the use of the shorter answer given by the then vice president in response to a question about US relations with Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu.CBS News released thetranscripts,showing it had used one portion of Harris’s wordy answer in a promo duringFace the Nationand a more succinct answer during the Sunday show. “If Mike Wallace had done the interview, he would have said, ‘I can’t believe what you just said to me because it was garbage, and you’re supposed to be president?’” A second experienced TV news executive agreed and said: “Let her do the word salad, and then say, ‘She finally said this…’ You are being true and reflective of the conversation, and they didn’t do that. It’s relevant if you have a commander in chief who can’t communicate.” A person close to the show pushed back on the idea of a mistake: “This is absolutely untrue.” The company responded to the Trump lawsuit in a statement that read: “The interview was not doctored; and60 Minutesdid not hide any part of…Vice President Kamala Harris’s answer to the question at issue.60 Minutesfairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it. The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it.” The first TV news executive believes that Pelley has become too zealous. “The problem is, Trump is a crazy, kooky, dangerous president. It’s not our job to be the place that looks for every angle possible to take him down. The audience as well. It’s not what60 Minutesis meant to be.” This person continued, “It’s hurting the broadcast.” The May 4 edition of60 Minutesincluded a Pelley segment on Trump’s targeting of law firms. The final broadcast of the season, airing this coming weekend (Sunday, May 18), is not expected to include Pelley. Owens’s estimated $3 million contract is being honored, according to a person familiar with discussions. The question is: Who is now running the show? Technically, executive editorTanya Simon,the daughter of legendary anchor Bob Simon, is in charge, but sources say Pelley had made himself the unofficial executive producer, in part because of his close partnership with Owens. A person close to the show said there was no question that Simon was in charge, while another person said staffers were taking their lead from Pelley because of his long tenure, leadership, and tough stance on Trump actions. (Pelley declined a request for comment via a spokesperson.) Several people familiar with internal conversations said there’s also been friction between the Owens-Pelley camp and Zirinsky, the former CBS News chief. She stepped down from CBS News in 2021 and was given a wide-ranging programming-making role at the company, but stepped back in January after asegmentabout Biden’s State Department attracted criticism. Zirinsky returned as part of a broader effort to improve standards oversight across the board, which involved reviewing sensitive content at60 Minutes.The announcement of Zirinsky’s appointment was made not by president of newsWendy McMahon,but by CBS CEO and presidentGeorge Cheeks.The beefed-up standards team includes a returningAl Ortiz,a former EP ofCBS Evening Newswho had previously retired, andTom Cibrowski,working as president of news. (Zirinsky declined to comment.) Zirinsky was given the title of interimexecutive editor. One rumor around CBS News is that Owens banned Zirinsky from appearing at their offices. While a person close to the show said that was untrue, Zirinsky has not physically been to the60 Minutesoffices, which are located near the CBS News main headquarters. Another source said that Zirinsky is close to Redstone and had a difficult relationship with Owens. Management of the show is complicated by the fact that60 Minuteshas historically been given leave to operate outside of the control of CBS News. The new layer of fact-checking, albeit one that had previously existed in other eras, had clearly irked Owens, though he noted in his exit comments that the show’s segments had not been blocked. One TV executive wondered why Owens didn’t call out Redstone by name or reference Trump in his departure statement. As this person put it, “He’s still taking their blood money.” (Owens did not respond to a message requesting comment.) Some people familiar with corporate politics point to McMahon, the president and CEO of CBS News and stations, who also runs CBS Media Ventures, which is jostling in court to retain the rights to distributeWheel of FortuneandJeopardy!And jeopardy is what they say McMahon may be in. She had gone to bat for Owens to get him a significant raise, one source told me, but she isn’t viewed as having strong footing at the moment given that the revamp ofCBS Evening News,which saw the departure ofNorah O’Donnellfrom the anchor chair, ended up losing viewers. “She supported Bill until the very end,” said one TV executive familiar with the company. McMahon declined to comment. As the show’s month-to-month season comes to a close, Trump is scoring some wins—China agreeing to a pause on trade tariff tit-for-tat and the return of the last living American hostage held in Gaza. “The obvious fact is there are wins—tariffs and Trump directly dealing with Hamas. There are victories and they will be reported. CBS has to report the wins when they exist,” said one CBS News insider. Another person familiar with the company summed up the problem thus: “It’s a no-win situation. If you want a deal to go through, you’re going to be in a compromise with the government.” If the deal were to get blocked, the news division would be low on the list of anyone’s investment priorities, according to this person.",

    "title": "Taylor Swift and Blake Lively Have Reportedly “Halted” a Friendship That Began In Social Media Shade",
    "article_text": "Every friendship has ups and downs, right? The truest blue of pals weather the thick and thin, highs and lows, celebrations and commiserations, seeing one another through subpoenas and Super Bowls. Wait, fact check—maybe that last one is more of aTaylor SwiftandBlake Livelything than a normal-people thing. Swift and Lively’s relationship has made headlines recently, thanks to Lively’s ongoing legal dispute withIt Ends With Usco-star and directorJustin Baldoni. Baldoni and Lively have beenentangled in suits and countersuitsagainst one another since late 2024, suing for millions over allegations of sexual harassment, retaliation, defamation, and extortion (which each party denies to the other). Swift, whose song “My Tears Ricochet” is on the film’s soundtrack, has been invoked by name several times in legal proceedings, and was subpoenaed by Baldoni’s legal team on May 8. And yet… “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even seeIt Ends With Usuntil weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,” reads astatement from Swift’s repfollowing the subpoena. “The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, ‘My Tears Ricochet.’ Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.” Baldoni’s legal team has suggestedliterally selling ticketsto court proceedings, and alleged that Lively threatened to extort Swift if she didn't publicly support her, a claim that was thrown out by the judge in the case. Swift and Lively haven’t stepped out together publicly in months, andPeoplereportedthis week, citing an anonymous source, that “their friendship has halted.” “Taylor wants no part in this drama,” the source, described as someone close to Swift, continued. Swift's and Lively’s representatives did not respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment on the current status of the friendship. Now seems like a good time to talk a little pap walk down memory lane and recall the origins of the pair’s bestie-dom: A 2015 Instagram caption promoting shampoo, gone horribly awry.Plus ça change, right? In anow-deleted Instagram poston September 10, 2015, Lively shared a photo of herself and a handful of other celebrities—Karlie Kloss,Julianne Moore,Naomi Watts,Jane Fonda,Amber Heard,Doutzen Kroes,Aishwarya Rai,Liya Kebede,Fan Binbing,Eva Longoria,andJohn Legend—lounging in formalwear and smiling softly at one another with the sort of fond expression usually only found in commercials about probiotic yogurt marketed to women of a certain age. You know the one. The post was part of an advertising campaign for L’Oreal’s Color Riche hair care, evidently. Meanwhile, “Bad Blood” had been released as a single in May of that year. As you’ll recall, the song’s music video, also released prior to the Lively post, features Swift and members of her squad—Selena Gomez,Hailee Steinfeld,Gigi Hadid,Karlie Kloss, Zendaya, and others—as ladies who Do Crime And Also Fashion. Lively had her hook for her #spon: “Soooo, turns out this WASN’T a video shoot for John Legend’s cover of Bad Blood,” she wrote in the caption. \"@lorealparisofficial blew it out for this one. My #pinkobsession is exposed now. Ok your turn. I won’t tell! #AlsoTurnsOutJohnLegendIsntCoveringBadBlood Time to start a petition!” Because the internet is the internet, some interpreted the caption as Lively taking a jab at Swift, to whom she had no public connection at the time. A few days later,Lively posted another now-deleted shot, this one of members of husbandRyan Reynolds’ family backstage with Swift at a stop on her1989tour. “Umm whoever thought I was throwin’ shade clearly doesn't know I have a ‘Taylor Swift Please Be My Wife Voo Doo Doll,’” she wrote. “Look how rad she is here making my niece Heather feel like a rock star. Love my Canadian family almost as much as I love Taylor Lively. I mean Swift. Ok, FIIINE we can hyphenate our last names. Xo Blake Swift-Lively 4eva.” By early December 2015, the two were not married, but didhang out in Australia, and shared photos of themselves bonding with a koala (not entirely dissimilar to a zoo outing Swift would share years later during the Eras Tour with boyfriendTravis Kelce,chilling with kangaroos). The rest is history: Swift has name-dropped Lively’s children across various songs, and even featured a voice cameo from Lively’s daughterJameson her track “Gorgeous.” There have been Fourth of July parties and birthday parties and flowers and so, so,somanypaparazzi shots. There wasone Super Bowl, and then—gasp!—not another. What does it allmean? Is there any possible way that we can interpret all of this as aseries of Easter eggsfor the release ofReputation (Taylor’s Version)? There has to be, just give Reddit, like, 20 minutes and a corkboard. The good(?) news is, the hearing for Lively and Baldoni isn’t until March 2026, so we still have the better part of a year to wade through all this.

    "title": "The Catholic Right Is Deeply Divided Over Pope Leo and What His Papacy Will Do",
    "article_text": "When Pope Francis died, the morning after Easter, prominentright-wing Catholicsleapt at the chance to lobby for a more conservative,even Trumpian, leader of the Church. Far-right punditJack Posobiecbroadcasta call for traditionalist Catholics to “hop a flight to Rome right now, go into St. Peter’s Square, and start taking up space,”remindingcardinals voting in the conclave that would elect the new pope that “now is the time for the traditional ascendance, because we are in a traditional awakening here in the Western Church.”Steve Bannon,who had castigated Francis for years, similarlyvowedto organize an online “show of force of traditionalists” ahead of the conclave. In Rome, Catholic-right journalistsdistributeda report to cardinals, profiling leading papal candidates from a palpably conservative perspective, while US Catholic-right philanthropistscourtedChurch leaders at upscale gatherings, with one “VIP”sayingtheir network “could raise a billion to help the Church. So long as we have the right pope.” But on May 8, when the new pope the conclave had chosen—Pope Leo XIV,formerlyChicago-bornCardinalRobert Prevost, and the first US-born pope in two millennia of Church history—appeared on the Vatican balcony instead, the Catholic right’s fervor shifted to despair and alarm. “I can’t believe the cardinals did this,” said popular traditionalist Catholic podcasterTaylor Marshall,author of a 2019 book arguing that the election of the late Pope Francis was part of a century-old plot to undermine the Church, as more than 100,000 viewers tuned into his live stream; Leo was “definitely on the Pope Francis trajectory,” he continued, and, given his comparative youth, his papacy could be a long one. Marshall’s audience chimed in with their own lamentations: that the Vatican had bucked conventional wisdom in picking an American pope so he could “go head-to-head” withDonald Trumpor fight to restore funding for Catholic relief work the Trump administration had cut. That the “pope Trump stunt”—Trump declaring himselfhis own first pickfor pontiff and subsequently posting an AI-generatedimageof himself in full papal regalia, sitting on a golden throne—had backfired, hurting conservatives’ chances. Almost immediately, conservatives began poring over a since-deleted X account that appeared to belong to Prevost, reporting back with dismay that he’d shared posts expressing prayers for George Floyd, criticism of Trump’s nativist rhetoric, and support for Dreamers, environmental advocacy, and gun-safety laws. In recent months, he’d shared anarticlefrom the progressiveNational Catholic Reportertitled, “JD Vanceis wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others”—in response to Vance’s invocation of ancient Catholic theology to justify Trump’s mass deportation campaign—and anop-edremonstrating Catholics who were indifferent to migrants’ suffering. They dug deeper and found that Prevost may have been involved in the removal of Bishop Joseph Strickland from his Texas diocese in 2023, following years of attacks on Pope Francis. And they unhappily registered how registered, in his first public address as pope, Leo not only praised his predecessor but also called for a “synodal church,” continuing Francis’s vision of lay Catholics and church leaders working together to address important issues. Even one of Leo’s brothers, speaking to media shortly after the announcement,saidthe new pope likely wouldn’t represent “much of a break in the tradition of Pope Francis.” As consensus grew that the conclave had found in Leo a continuity pope, prominent Catholic-right groups and figures voiced their outrage. The right-wingLepanto Institute, a research organization that states it was created to “present the facts” about “dissident and apostate Catholics in politics and other prominent arenas,” responded to Leo’s election byposting, “Prevost!!! Dear God help us!!!” and subsequently declaring Leo a “James Martinpick,” in reference to Jesuit priest Fr. James Martin, an advocate for LGBTQ inclusion in the Church. Fr.James Altman,who gained notoriety in 2020 for aviral videowarning that Catholic Democrats would have to repent “or face the fires of hell,”wrote, “The vast majority of the hierarchy have betrayed and abandoned us once again.” Catholic-right outletLifeSiteNewsmournfullyconcluded, “The man who oversaw the takedown of Bishop Strickland and the rise of [Francis ally Cardinal Robert] McElroy has been handed the keys of Peter. The storm is here.” While a handful of Catholic-right voicescounseledpatience—Michael Matt,editor ofThe Remnanturgedfollowers to consider how a centrist pope might keep the traditionalist Catholic movement united, avoiding the factionalization that could follow the election of a more conservative pope—other commentators, in and out of the Church, proclaimed Leo’s election an intentional rebuke of the MAGA movement. Far-right social media personalityMike CernovichcalledLeo a “shitlib”; Trump allyLaura Loomerwent with “woke Marxist pope.” In his live stream from Rome shortly after Leo was announced, Posobiecsaid, “The choice of an American pope is clearly a reaction to President Trump.” Marshall suggested Leo’s election was an intentional effort to force US traditionalist Catholics into a choice. “We as Catholics are going to be pitted against an American pope and the American president. And I feel the liberals, the bishops, the priests are going to be pushing us: which one are you for? Do you support your president or do you support your pope?” BannonreportedlydeclaredLeo the “worst pick for MAGA Catholics” and an “anti-Trump pope” selected “by the globalists that run the Curia,” subsequentlytellingaFinancial Timesaudience, to laughter, that the conclave “was more rigged than the 2020 election,” and would soon cause a schism. And then, almost overnight, the narrative seemed to change. On Friday, Marshall’s video responding to Leo’s election was no longer public on YouTube. (In an earlier video, Marshall had alsodeclaredPrevost potentially “the worst case scenario.”) He posteda new recordingthat began with the words, “I submit myself to his holiness Pope Leo XIV.” After prayer, he said, his initial shock had given way to a sense of encouragement, and he reminded listeners of historical cases where popes elected as liberal reformers had unexpectedly become staunch conservatives. Noting that Leo’s papacy might last 20 years, he said Leo “needs to know that traditional Catholics are praying for him, that we wish him the best.” Other Catholic-right podcasts issuedapologiesand retractions for their initial response to the news, declaring a “ceasefire” in traditionalists’decade-long waragainst the hierarchy of their church, with one titlingan episode, “Softening our trad hearts to Leo XIV?”LifeSiteNews, which for years has published some of the most strident attacks on Pope Francis,declaredit would “not begin from a place of suspicion or opposition.” The Lepanto Institutewrote,“It’s like finally being able to breathe for the first time in 12 years.” There seemed to be a number of explanations for the turnaround. Shortly after Leo’s papacy was announced, two of the most conservative cardinals in the Church,Raymond BurkeandRobert Sarah,who’d been among Francis’s leading critics, released statements celebrating the new pope or approvinglyquotedhim on social media. A third, CardinalGerhard Ludwig Müller,who before the conclave hadwarnedthat failure to elect an “orthodox” pope would lead to schism,toldreporters that Leo’s election had left everyone “content.” A newnarrativebegan to emerge, that a conservative bloc in the Vatican had allegedly formed an “organized resistance” to block progressive candidates, and that US CardinalTimothy Dolan(Trump’s second-choice for pope) had served as“kingmaker.”Reporting in Italianmediaclaimed that, ahead of the conclave, then Cardinal Prevost had been seen entering Burke’s Rome apartment for a “top-secret summit.” Although subsequentreportingin theNational Catholic Registerthat Burke had never received Prevost at his apartment cast this in doubt, the rumor had already spread widely online, prompting traditionalists to surmise that deals had been made and assurances given. Rumors also spread that anonymous sources had witnessed then Cardinal Prevost preside over a private Traditional Latin Mass, sparking hopes that, as pope, Leo might rescind restrictions Francis had put on the liturgical form, which had become overwhelmingly associated with his opponents on the Catholic right. Conservatives dug up additional social media posts Prevost had shared supporting conservative priorities. Not to mention that Leo wore the formal papal regalia Francis had scorned, that he spoke and sang in Latin, and that he would live in the Apostolic Palace rather than the Vatican guesthouse Francis had chosen. On Monday, traditionalistsexcitedlypointedto arecordingof Leo greeting fans at a public event, and seeming to turn away from someone holding a rainbow flag (only to backtrack when it became clear the flag wasn’t a Pride flag but a peace flag commonly seen in Italy). They were happier yet when Leo’s oldest brother was revealed to be a staunch Trump supporter who’d recently shared asocial media postcallingNancy Pelosia vulgar name. Posobiec responded byofferingto fly the brother to Rome to talk with Leo about Trump, Vance, and “the issue of illegal immigration.” Vance, who will lead the US delegation to Vatican City for Leo’s inaugural Mass on Sunday, which also includes Secretary of StateMarco Rubio,has saidhe didn’t want to “play the politicization of the pope game,”tellingconservative radio hostHugh Hewittlast week, “I’m sure he’s going to say a lot of things that I love. I’m sure he’ll say some things that I disagree with, but I’ll continue to pray for him and the Church despite it all and through it all.” But not everyone on the right is giving Leo the benefit of the doubt, with some traditionalists declaring the abrupt about-face a “massive psy-op,” as “pope-splainers” tried to “neutralize the opposition” and sell “the Traditional movement down the Vatican 2 river.” “I’m guessing there was a memo sent to Trads to use the same talking points: hope, good news, don’t be negative about Leo,” wroteLifeSiteNewsreporterStephen Kokxon X.“My hunch is this is coming from some prominent ‘conservative’ cardinals who may have won some concessions w/ Prevost in exchange for calling off the attacks.” For traditionalists who’d convinced themselves Leo was secretly one of their own, Kokx recalled how “Trad world” had similarly gone “insane” in 2013, after a newly anointed Pope Francis had given “a few sermons about the devil.” “Do yourself a favor: do not engage in this sort of behavior,” he wrote. “It will only end in disappointment and self-delusion.” Fr.David Nix,another of traditionalists’ favorite clerics,wrotein a blog post on Sunday that what he saw “coming down the pike in Rome is more promotion of the heresy of religious indifferentism (the heresy all religions will get you to heaven, usually put under the pretext of the hijacked word ‘ecumenicism’) but this time with a little more Latin, a little more incense and a little more meekness than before.” “I don’t care how nice this pope is. I don’t care how much gold he has on, or his ring, or any of that stuff,”saidanother traditionalist podcaster,Timothy Gordon.“I want the Latin Mass, but I don’t want the Latin Mass traded for homo stuff. I don’t want the Latin Mass forAmoris Laetitiabeing here to stay,” referencing Francis’s 2016 apostolic exhortation  that opened the door for divorced and remarried Catholics to receive communion. “He’s going to trick a bunch of the trads,” Gordon continued. “And then, truly, guys like you and I are going to bevox clamantis in deserto”—voices in the wilderness. But exactly that thought seemed to be in mind for some of those calling on traditionalists to withhold judgment. AsMichael Mattexplainedin a video message this Sunday, it was “really, really important for traditional Catholics now” to present themselves as a “dutiful, loyal opposition,” if only for pragmatic purposes. “We can start denouncing him if we want—shout and yell ‘down with the pope’ out there in the piazza. Couple of weeks later, guess what we’ll be doing? We’re talking to our mother and some of her friends on YouTube and that’s it. We’re not here at all to put any pressure on what the future of the Church is going to be.” Leo was hardly going to be the pope traditionalists dreamed of, he continued, but his lighter touch might “buy some time for us to continue the Catholic counterrevolution.” Or asAnthony Abbate,host of the podcastAvoiding Babylonput it, “I also don’t want to come out bashing him and ruin the gestures he’s giving by giving him the middle finger, and then he says, ‘Ok, well, you know what? Maybe Francis was right to punish you assholes.’” “I can’t see this lasting,” saidMike Lewis,cofounder of the Catholic outletWhere Peter Is, which spent many years of Francis’s papacy tracking the Catholic right’sattacks on the pope. For one thing, over the last 12 years, “the reactionary opposition to Pope Francis had reached a boiling point,” and it would be hard to simply turn off the heat. “We’ve seen people take up this space where it doesn’t even matter if you think the pope is the pope,” he said. “That used to be the point of no return, and they walked right past it.” And assuming Leo does emerge as the continuity pope he’s widely expected to be, the traditionalist detente is likely to quickly sour. “They did that with Pope Francis and they weren’t able to sustain it. I don’t know how the Pope Leo XIV papacy will unfold, but I have a feeling that as he continues to follow in the path of Pope Francis, and to set the Church on a similar trajectory, they will melt down,” he continued. “Whether or not that leads to formal schism, or some huge public clash, remains to be seen. But I think they are ideologically committed to their project, and I don’t see them turning around.” Catholic-right visions of Leo as a closet traditionalist amount to little more than “wish-casting,” saidSteven Millies,a theologian and professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, one of Pope Leo’s alma maters. “The plain fact is that very little has happened yet concretely to tell us what sort of pope Leo will be,” Millies said. Conservatives embracing him now are “seeing a different personality, and so already the papacy feels different.” But Leo’s initial statements as pope—expressing “complete commitment” to Francis’s vision of fully implementing the reforms of Vatican II, to synodality, to care for the marginalized and for “courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world”—to Millies, amounts to “a charter to continue the Francis papacy.” Millies notes that viewing conflicts within the Church in purely political terms misses much of the point. The most potent quarrels at the heart of Francis’s papacy concerned whether the Church is a centralized institution “that exports itself around the globe” or a global “church of churches, capable of many cultural expressions”—the same questions that lie at the heart of Vatican II. And yet there is, he said, a message in the election of Pope Leo, if one more subtle than Steve Bannon put it. In the same way that Pope John Paul II’s election, from behind the Iron Curtain, signaled the Church’s willingness to challenge the Soviet Union in 1978, he said, today, “the cardinals have taken a side against authoritarianism and on the side of free systems of government, because a US-born pope offers a visible sign of a different and Catholic way to proceed through this political moment.” Massimo Faggioli,a Church historian and professor at Villanova University, which Pope Leo attended as an undergraduate, agreed. “The choice of an Augustinian pope who succeeds a Jesuit sends a particular political message to the USA today, of the national-populism nourished by Catholic fundamentalism that is replacing Protestantism in the halls of power. It is not necessary to be a ‘Jesuit of the peripheries’ to oppose the political-religious project that is Trumpism,” Faggioli said. “For subversive Catholic traditionalism in the US at the service of Trumpism, it will be difficult to discard the Augustinian Prevost as a radical progressive, and it will be impossible to paint him as anti-American.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal Descend into Covid-Era Madness in ‘Eddington’",
    "article_text": "Who out there is eager to revisit the hairy, scary first few months of the pandemic, where fights over masks and lockdowns mingled with nationwide protests of police brutality? That is the fiery war zone directorAri Asterplunges us back into in his new filmEddington, a nasty and erratic satire that premiered here at the Cannes Film Festival on May 16. The film begins in strangely laidback fashion, rambling through a small New Mexico town in May of 2020 as it introduces us to a cast of shaggy characters who are mostly just trying to get by. I say surprising because in his past three films—Hereditary,Midsommar, andBeau Is Afraid—Aster started things with a bang. Here he eases us in, almost to the point of tedium. There are mild jokes skewering the rules and neuroses of that time—squabbles over masks in a place where no infection yet exists; the sneakily dangerous pablum of social media hooting to us from our phone screens—but none are particularly energizing. When the local sheriff, Joe (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to run against the town’s smoothie mayor, Ted (Pedro Pascal), it seems that maybe Aster is headed toward an allegory for the 2020 presidential election—or our two-party system more broadly. Joe tries to rally the loonies to his anti-mask cause, while Ted is trying to make big business deals with his eye on a future in Washington. On one side, we have terminally online crazies; on the other, money-minded technocrats. American electoral politics are a worthy target, but a hard one to hit with precision. Aster also takes aim at young social justice warriors, the largely white kids whom the film constantly mocks for their stridency and theatrical racial self-loathing. Those sorts of young people can indeed be annoying, frustratingly quick to judgment or condemnation, and clumsy in their navel-gazing. But the film is as tough on them, if not tougher, as it is on anyone from the other side—conspiracy theorists and anti-science nuts whose ideas and actions carry with them much more immediate threat to other people. Aster needn’t have made some staunchly pro-progressive film, butEddingtondoes at times come awfully close to equating Trumpism with leftism, a common rhetorical tactic used by some of the worst pundits in this country. It’s a false equivalency that has led straight into our current mess—and makes me wonder how Aster might have shifted things if he’d made this film after the most recent presidential election. Maybe nothing would have changed.Eddingtongradually shifts away from the hyper topical and into a despairing, bleakly amusing look at an America prone to violent fantasy and deed, entrenched in escalating conflict, caught in a terrible entropy. When Aster finally knuckles down and ramps up the action,Eddingtontakes strange flight. Comparisons toNo Country for Old Menhave been drawn, but the film is nowhere near as somber and profound as that chilling masterpiece.Eddingtonis instead a comedy of pathetic rot, a film about a bad guy leveraging all the strife around him (that he has helped create) to attend to his own wants and grievances. There’s certainly some Trumpism in there, but I don’t thinkEddingtonis a Trump movie, really. It’s mostly a crime story adorned with political trappings. A better film would tightly synthesize the macro with the micro, but Aster instead lets them hang discordant next to one another, clanging in the desert wind. The boos I heard at the end of the press screening didn’t sound like ones of disagreement, but of dissatisfaction.Eddington’s setup promises a lot, but delivers mostly mayhem and confusion. Then again, that feels apt enough as America struggles to reidentify—or reimagine—its purpose. Phoenix, who played a worrywart Aster stand-in inBeau Is Afraid, is adept at squalid humor like this. He ably plays a scrambling loser, complete with hacking Covid cough. Phoenix’s Joe is unpleasant to watch, which is the whole point. Pascal, meanwhile, doesn’t have much to do beyond light smarm, whileEmma Stone—playing Joe’s addled wife—is handed a small and genuinely sad storyline that feels out of place inEddington’s archness. Credit to Aster, though, for throwing bones to the grand dames of the New York stage.Beau Is Afraidmade fantastic use ofPatti LuPone,whileEddingtonshrewdly employs the greatDeirdre O’Connellas Joe’s hectoring mother-in-law, Dawn. She’s a conspiracy junkie forever urging her daughter to do her own research into wild, absurd theories about shadowy cabals doing nefarious things. (Shadowy cabals certainly do exist in this sorry country—just not the ones that people like Dawn believe in.) O’Connell gets the tone and temperament of such a person exactly right, giving the impression of a hippie faded into libertarian delusion. It’s acute and darkly funny, unlike the film’s increasingly wheezy and outsized gags about Black Lives Matter allies and indigenous politics. Aster is allowed his pessimism, his equal opportunity offense. But his brush is perhaps too broad; nuance gives way toBillMaherian conclusions that everyone is wrong and stupid for caring at all. Given the humanism lingering in his work, I don’t think that’s actually how Aster views the world.Eddington, though, verges on crankism; it’s a film whose anger is sourced in exasperation. It’s grimly telling that the film’s best parts are when it devolves into an anarchic shooting spree. There, maybe, is America’s terminal end: guns blazing away in a now-permanent night.

    "title": "Did a 10-Foot Nude Save the Spring Art Auctions?",
    "article_text": "The week of the New York art auctions each May is usually a pretty splendid affair. At Rockefeller Center, the racks of florals that dot Rock Plaza outside of Christie’s are in full bloom, welcoming into the lobby the world’s richest art collectors and their proxies, ready to spend freely on work by the world’s most in-demand contemporary artists. The mood was a bit different this past Wednesday, and not just because of the soaking rain. During the previous two nights, sales at Christie’s and its uptown rival, Sotheby’s, teetered on the verge of disaster for the entire run, each punctuated by enormously disappointing strikeouts. On Monday, Andy Warhol’sBig Electric Chair,put on the block by Belgian collectors who bought it nearly 60 years ago, wasexpectedto sell for $30 million—a not outrageous number. A similar examplesoldfor $20.4 million in 2014 at Sotheby’s, and Warhol comps reside in the Art Institute of Chicago and The Met. Instead, the work was withdrawn, with the announcement coming moments before the opening gavel rap. The bigger whiff came Tuesday night at Sotheby’s, where the son of the late Manhattan real estate tycoon Sheldon Solow had consigned one of the family’s masterpieces, a haunting sculpture by Alberto Giacometti, the only version of his iconicGrande tête minceworks cast and then painted. This was a discretionary consignment—that is, put on the market by choice, and not because of death, debt, or divorce—with the idea that the proceeds would benefit the Soloviev Foundation’s favorite causes: Henry Street Settlement, Citymeals-on-Wheels, and the Southampton Animal Shelter. Quite a lot of proceeds, so we thought. The auction house and consignor agreed to a $70 million reserve, setting the Giacometti up to win the week as its priciest work—though, in opting out of accepting a guarantee bid in favor of a cut of the buyer’s premium, the Foundation took an enormous risk. After auctioneerOliver Barkeropened the bidding at $56 million and chandelier-bid the price to $64 million, it stalled, fatally, forcing Barker to slam the gavel, saying, “It’s a pass.” The room gasped. Even the auction house, which can always spin a mediocre sale into a passable one, couldn’t fully bite its tongue. “From the moment we announced, we saw interest from the world’s greatest collectors, both private and institutional, but Giacometti’s message has always been that fate rests on the edge of a knife-blade,” saidJulian Dawes, Sotheby’s head of Impressionist and modern art, Americas. “Despite the interest and even offers, it simply wasn’t its moment.” Christie’s, then, had a tall order Wednesday evening: avoiding the auctions suffering their lowest revenues in nearly a decade, thus setting a gloomy tone for the art market heading into Art Basel in Switzerland next month. There was ample opportunity to do just that. The meat and potatoes of the auction consisted of a number of in-demand works from the collection ofTiqui AtencioandAgo Demirdjian,who, a source says, are leaving London for good and shacking up permanently in Monaco due to new non-dom tax policy—thanks,Keir Starmer! So the couple decided to sell the art on the walls along with their Prouvé-stuffed house. There was also a Basquiat triptych owned byPeter Brantthat wasestimatedto sell for a low estimate of $20 million, which back in 2017 was for sale at Art Basel in Switzerland for $30 million—no takers then. So there was some trepidation as the keepers of the cultural flame arrived at Christie’s on Wednesday evening. Less than half an hour before the sale, the dealerBrett Gorvywas finishing up at Lodi, the Italian trattoria that’s the de facto canteen for auction folk and their ilk. After arriving at the sale room,Guillaume Cerutti,the former house CEO—and current director of house ownerFrançois Pinault’s vast art collection—was milling around, surrounded by collectors such asPatrick SeguinandAdam Lindemann,and dealers such asPer SkarstedtandJeffrey Deitch.David Nahmad,the patriarch of the Picasso-stockpiling Nahmad family, was in the second row, andDavid Zwirnerarrived right before the opening gavel. Like nothing else, the seating chart at Rock Center never changes. Zwirner was seated directly in front of the team from Gagosian, which included the former Sotheby’s rainmakerBrooke Lampley,whodecampedto the gallery last year. While the $20 million Basquiat was set to be the biggest lot of the night, it paled compared to the prices paid for the artist’s primo work in years past. The work that insiders hoped would inspire some real fireworks, slotted right in the middle of the sale, was a painting with the potential to makeMarlene Dumasthe most expensive female living artist, ahead ofJenny Saville.It’s calledMiss January,and it’s a 10-foot nude based on a centerfold from the pages ofPlayboy.It wasexpectedto sell for as much as $18 million. In 1997, Dumas was in her studio in Amsterdam preparing for a show at Galerie Paul Andriesse that would open in January the next year. Two years earlier, she achieved her first taste of fame byshowingat the Netherlands pavilion of the Venice Biennale—a series of large nudes she called herMagdalenas.But she wanted to push things further, make them raunchier, and sought out new source material. “Pin-ups, porno stars, fashion models, and beauty contestants,” as Dumas put it. And eventually, she found a muse. “She started out as, or rather her source was, an airbrushed, ultra smooth-skinned, high-gloss centerfold photograph for the January number of a DutchPlayboymagazine (date unknown, but I suspect it was the late ’70s),” Dumaswrotein a book published alongside a show at the Rubell Museum that includedMiss January.“A young, super healthy-looking blonde that combined eroticism with winter sports. Naked, but for her zipper open, short ski jacket and socks—one foot without and one still with a bright-pink, woolen sock on. Not quite a female Santa Claus as Christmas was just over and the December issue had just passed. But her legs, they went on forever.” Marlene Dumas, Miss January. The work made a splash as soon as it debuted in Amsterdam, showing in quick succession in museum shows in Rotterdam, Kassel, and Antwerp. In 2000, Andriessesoldthe work toDonandMera Rubell,the American collectors who were in the process of convincing Art Basel to plant its American art-fair flag in Miami Beach, near where the Rubells moved in 1992. Over the next two decades, the work was chosen for various traveling shows that featured work from the couple’s vast holdings, and was on view in the Rubell Museum as recently as last December. The Rubells hold one of the world’s most impressive troves of contemporary art, which they’ve assembled over the course of more than six decades. Remarkably—becauseno one does this—they almost never sell works at auction. We foundevidencethat they consigned aDamien Hirstspot painting at Christie’s in London in 2007, but it didn’t sell and was returned to the Rubells. The massive scale ofMiss January,and its place in the oeuvre of one of the most celebrated living painters, has made the work a target since just a few years after they purchased it. “We were recently offered $3 million for our Marlene Dumas paintingMiss January,and, yes, we had a family conference about it,” MeratoldTheNew York Timesin 2006. “But really there wasn’t much of a discussion.” When Christie’s announced the consignment last month, it thanked the Rubells for their business and noted that the family was selling the work for one very specific reason. “The Rubell family is parting with its prized Marlene Dumas paintingMiss Januaryin order to continue the family’s mission of collecting and championing emerging artists,” the house said in a press release. On Wednesday night, auctioneerYu-Ge Wangchugged along through the first few lots. Some flew. Others sold at guarantee. The opening lot, a fabulousElizabeth Peytonpainting of the rock godsJarvis CockerandLiam Gallagherpressing cigarette butts together to light up, hammered above the high estimate, at $1.3 million, or $1.62 million with fees. Bidding in the room pushed a sensuousCecily Brownpainting from 1999,Bedtime Story,close to its high estimate, hammering at $5.1 million, with the final tally coming to $6.2 million with fees. The sale wound up being a bit of a workhorse, effective but rarely thrilling, with only three lots through the evening garnering enough excitement to get the bidding past their high estimates. At least a few attendees made furtive glances at their phones, not to get on the horn with a client hell-bent on bidding, but checking the score of the Knicks game. There was very little energy in the room when the Basquiat sold to its guarantor for $20 million, or $23.4 million with fees, well below the asking price at Basel so many years ago. And there was even less energy when works by late icons Ellsworth Kelly and Felix Gonzalez-Torres came up: There were no bids at all, and they passed. Still, a few lots found real bidding. A gigantic sculpture bySimone Leigh—made in 2020 and since shown in her solo survey that traveled to the ICA Boston and the Hirshhorn—sparked a bidding war between deputy chairmanMaria Losand senior specialistNick Cinque,with the work going to Los’s client at a hammer of $4.7 million,or $5.7 million with fees, well above the artist’s record. A small painting byDanielle McKinneywent well above its high estimate, as did a painting byEmma McIntyre,who was scooped up in 2023 by David Zwirner and is co-repped by tastemaking Los Angeles gallery Chateau Shatto. Estimated to sell for a high estimate of $70,000, it sold for $201,600 with fees. Then came the Dumas, with bidding opening at $9 million. She chandeliered untilSara Friedlandercame in at $10 million, and the bids went back and forth until Friedlander placed the $11.5 million bid that was presumably coming from the guarantor, as it was just under the low estimate. A few slots down the rostrum, Christie’s global presidentAlex Rotterhad his hands cupped over the phone in his hands, speaking to a mystery client on the other end of the line. “Alex, are you coming in here?” Wang asked. After a few seconds of muffled chatter from Rotter, he tossed out an arm in defeat—there would be no more bidding. “Are we all done then?” Wang asked, before banging the gavel, indicating the work had sold for $13.6 million with fees. It was, like much of the night, just a tad anticlimactic. But everyone was rooting for the sale, hoping that artist records still mean something, even in the midst of a slumping market. After all, Marlene Dumas is now the world’s most expensive living female artist, a major feat for someone so thrilling and boundary-pushing. And it happened with an uncompromising painting,Miss January. And it contributed to the sales not quite hitting a feared nadir. This is what qualifies as a good thing at the moment, right? After a few seconds of pause in the auction house, with the crowd seemingly unsure what response was warranted, the sale room erupted in applause. …On Wednesday,Page Sixbroke the newsthat BookHampton, the venerable bookseller on Main Street in East Hampton, has been purchased by none other thanLarry Gagosian.“I have lived in Amagansett for 35 years and always loved the fact that Main Street in East Hampton had a wonderful independent bookstore,” Gagosian told thePost.“BookHampton is an important part of the community, and I felt it was crucial that it was preserved.” Indeed, former ownerCarolyn Brodystarted telling friends she planned to sell last fall, and the future of the store was uncertain until Gagosian swooped in. …The Dia Beacon Spring Benefit went down on Saturday, and if you want to know exactly what it’s like to have lunch with 600 of the most important people in the art world, well, read myprofileofSteve McQueenin our most recent Hollywood Issue. That story goeslongon the phenomenon that is the Dia Beacon Spring Benefit. One fun new twist from last Saturday: The lunch has long been co-chaired by Bottega Veneta, and its new creative director,Louise Trotter,used the occasion to step out in an official capacity for the first time. Those at the Bottega table included playwrightJeremy O. Harris,Past LivesdirectorCeline Song,musicianJack Antonoff,and Oscar-winnerJulianne Moore. …It’s been nearly four years since art-collecting Citadel founderKen Griffinoutbid the crypto-collective known as ConstitutionDAO to buy a first edition copy of the US Constitution, placing the winning $43.2 million bid at Sotheby’s. Where has the time gone! Now, Griffin is planning to loan his copy to the National Constitution Center in Philly, along with a cool $15 million donation. …We wrote about all the art fairs last edition, sure, but TEFAF opened late and stuck around longer, not closing until Tuesday. And we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention some of the biggest transactions that went down in New York last week. Among the items selling into the seven figures at TEFAF wereBridget Riley’sReverse,which sold for more than $7 million at the Ben Foster booth; a Ruth Asawa work that sold at the Zwirner booth for $2.8 million; Milton Avery’sMorning Dunes, which sold at the Karma booth for $2 million; and a Warhol that sold at the Stellan Holm booth for about $1 million. …Lots going on in Manhattan this week. On Saturday,Loïc Gouzer,the founder of the one-lot, invite-only auction endeavor Fair Warning, hosted a backgammon tournament at the private club Coco’s, which also serves as the auction company’s HQ.Vanity Faircame on board as a co-host, which was fun. And all that came before Fair Warning’s bigger event, the auction of Picasso’sTête d’homme à la pipe,estimated to sell for between $6 million and $8 million. Bidding via the Fair Warning app opened at 5 p.m. Thursday, with former Christie’s presidentJussi Pylkkänenon the rostrum at Coco’s for those bidding in person. After a few minutes of bidding, the Picasso ended up selling for $7.8 million with fees, a very healthy figure for a work on paper. …Elsewhere around town,Miuccia Pradaasked artistGoshka Macugato reprise the collaboration with Mrs. Prada’s Miu Miu brand thattook Paris by storm last October—and this time, they did it in New York. A private preview went down at the gigantic Terminal Warehouse on 11th Avenue last Friday, and then the show was open to the public on Saturday and Sunday. Very much not open to the public was the cocktail dînatoire (their term!) at the Chelsea Hotel Friday following the opening, where a smattering of fashion and Hollywood folk were joined by art world bigwigs likeJeffrey Deitchand artistAllison Katz.Also, in gala-land, the Rose Art Museum gala honored artistHugh Haydenon Monday, while the MoMA PS1 bash honored collectorEmily Wei Ralesand artistKara Walkeron Wednesday.

    "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Explains How He’s Making Himself Obsolete With AI",
    "article_text": "In 2019, Microsoft launcheda significant partnershipwith OpenAI, and the legacy software company has gone all in on adding ChatGPT-inspired technology to its offerings, paying no heedto the legacy of Clippy. Ever since, Microsoft CEOSatya Nadellahas become one of the most prominent boosters of the idea that large-language models will pave the way for artificial general intelligence. A newBloombergprofile of the executive, who took the reins at Microsoftin 2014, shows that he is serious about it both at work and in his private life, where he is already using Copilot to replace podcast hosts and put himself in every episode. According to Bloomberg, Nadella uses at least 10 custom “agents,” or LLM-driven bots, to summarize messages, prepare for meetings, and do research during the course of a workday. The CEO joked that his job has already been reduced. “I’m an email typist,” Nadella told the reporter. He also copies podcast transcripts into the Copilot app, and during his commute, he listens to AI summaries—he even has a back-and-forth with the voice assistant while he drives. Executives loveto invite reportersalong as they engage with their companies’ powerful new software. Still, this scene makes the parasocial relationships the rest of us form with our favorite hosts and influencers seem downright healthy. Nadella might benefit from a little more time spent appreciatingthe native conifers of Washington State. Nadella isn’t the only CEO who is hard at work rebuilding the meaning of life. Meta CEO andfellow podcast aficionadoMark Zuckerberghas been on this tipfor years. In an April interview withDwarkesh Patel,the CEO brought up another potential use for his company’s products, which will be more “compelling” as AI has more of your data. “The average American has fewer than three friends,” he said. “And the average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it’s something like 15.” Zuckerberg made this comment while wearing off his company’s new coke-bottle Ray-Bansmeant to let us use the whole world as our smartphones. Jack Clark,the cofounder ofchatbot companyAnthropic, says that he’s looking forward to giving his kids an AI-powered teddy bear that can use an LLM to generate new stories. “I am annoyed I can't buy the teddy bear yet,” he told economistTyler Cowenon theConversations With Tylerpodcastearlier this month. “I think most parents, if they could acquire a well-meaning friend that could provide occasional entertainment to their child when their child is being very trying, they would probably do it,” he added.

    "title": "The Uproar Over James Comey’s Instagram Post Is Dumb and Could Get Dangerous",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumponce suggested that “Second Amendment people” were the only ones who could stopHillary Clinton. He mused last summer about howLiz Cheneymight feel when “guns are trained on her face.” He said at a rally that to shoot him, someone would need to shoot through the media, “and I don’t mind that so much.” And, when asked by ABC News’Jonathan Karlwhat he thought of the January 6 rioters chanting “hangMike Pence,”Trump respondedsimply, “Well, the people were very angry.” So, excuse us for being a little incredulous that Trump is now accusing former FBI directorJames Comeyof putting a hit on him when he posted an Instagram photo Thursday of seashells on the beach arranged to spell out “86 47.” The number “86” ismost commonly definedas meaning \"to throw out” or \"to get rid of.\" But Trumpworld skipped right over those more obvious definitions and decided Comey’s message could only mean one thing: “Just James Comey causally (sic) calling for my dad to be murdered,”Donald Trump Jr.posted on X. Comey quickly took the post down, writingin a statement on Instagramthat he “didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence” and that he “oppose[s] violence of any kind.” Comey didn’t respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment. By Thursday night, Department of Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemhadannounced an investigationinto Comey’s alleged call “for the assassination of @POTUS Trump” and Director of National IntelligenceTulsi Gabbardwascalling for Comey’s imprisonment.On Friday, Trump himself was making the most of it on Fox News. \"He knew exactly what that meant. A child knows what that meant,”Trump said. “That meant 'assassination.'\" Was it dumb of Comey to post a message so primed for willful misinterpretation by the right, particularly given they’ve played this same game of dictionary roulette with Michigan GovernorGretchen Whitmer? Yes. Is it just as dumb for the Trump administration to willfully misinterpret a seashell message as a death threat? Also yes. Is it extra dumb that this ordealhas America frantically Googlingthe definition of “86” like we, as a nation, are all about to give the world's worst best man speech? You bet!Merriam-WebsterpresidentGregory BarlowtoldVanity Fairthat, as of Friday morning, “86” was the most frequently searched term on its website. According to Barlow, their research shows \"it probably comes from 1930s soda counters, where it began as rhyming slang of nix, which means ‘to veto’ or ‘to reject.'” The irony, of course, is that no one has accused the liberal pearl-clutchers of stirring up faux outrage over semantics more than Trump. Of course, he wasn’t suggesting “Second Amendment people” shoot Clinton,his 2016 campaign argued; he was just encouraging them to vote! He wasn’t calling for Cheney to face a firing squad; he was pointing out that “warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves,”his 2024 campaign said. But the problem with this administration is that just because something’s dumb doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous. The outrage over Comey’s post is a mere pretext for the Trump administration to do what it has established a solid track record of doing: Making perceived political enemies pay for their words. Last month, thepresident orderedAttorney GeneralPam Bondi, as well as Noem, to investigateChris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, whocountered Trump’s unfounded claimsthat the 2020 election was stolen. Trump has ordered another investigation into former DHS officialMiles Taylor, who served in his first administration and wrote an anonymous book warning about Trump's dangers. And earlier this month, the FBIalso openeda criminal investigation into New York Attorney GeneralLetitia James, whoprosecuted Trump in a civil fraud case, for alleged mortgage fraud. James has denied the allegations. Whatever the findings of these investigations turn out to be, the fact that they exist at all has real consequences for their targets. Krebs has left his job, saying that fighting the order would require his “complete focus and energy.”Taylor told NBC Newsthat he’s received a barrage of death threats and has been told by security experts to update his will. “People need to know how real it is to be blacklisted by the president,” Taylor said. “What I worry about is that they will try to use this tactic, this bludgeon of the bully pulpit of the presidency, to go shut people up.” Meanwhile, Tufts studentRumeysa Ozturkhas only just been freedfrom six weeks in federal detention after being snatched off the street for the apparent offense ofwriting an op-edcriticizing her university’s response to the war in Gaza. Other international students, includingMahmoud Khalil, havesimilarly been detainedfor their speech and remain in custody or have beenforced to leave the country. We now live in a world in which the president pardons people convicted of actual political violence (and, incidentally, alsorape and sexual abuse of a child) as long as they support him, while simultaneously casting a seashell message from someone who doesn't as the highest crime of all. If recent history is any indication, Comey’s problems have just begun.

    "title": "In Season 2, the Secret Lives of Mormon Wives Aren’t So Secret Anymore",
    "article_text": "The Mormon church does not officially dictate how its members should celebrate Halloween. But what the women ofThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wivesdo inseason two, now streaming on Hulu, probably isn’t what Joseph Smith had in mind. Dozens of 20- and 30-something Mormons descend upon the Utah home of cast memberJessi Ngatikaura.One Mormon husband in a Chippendales costume (a season one callback) hurls insults at another, who’s dressed asJustin Bieber.His “Hailey” is wailing about how she wants to go home when the cops arrive. Asked to explain all the fighting, Ngatikaura replies: “Have you watchedThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives?” Who hasn’t? The first season ofMormon Wiveswas Hulu’smost watched unscripted premiereof 2024, launching all eight of its MomTok influencers into reality-TV stardom—and late-night encounters with celebrities likeLana Del Rey,who Ngatikaura sayspartiedwith the group at the Stagecoach music festival. This season delves further into the cast’stradwife-esque TikTok content, made by women who inject Botox, make babies, and bake sourdough with equal enthusiasm. At the start of season two,Whitney Leavittgives birth to her sonBilly Genewhile wearing one of her signature oversized headbands. By the finale, three of her castmates have revealed that they’re pregnant again too. The husbands judge a “Great Mormon Bake-Off,” sampling Jesus-adorned pumpkin pies and peanut butter bars made in homage to Smith, the founder of Mormonism. Meanwhile,Taylor Frankie Pauldisguises a store-bought apple pie as her own creation. “I don’t know if you know my backstory, but I’ve been through really bad things in the public eye,” Paul tellsVanity Fair.She’s referring to the“soft swinging” scandalthat went viral on TikTok in 2022. Paul ignited the controversy after she confessed to engaging in extramarital activities with others in her friend group; the fallout inspired Hulu to makeMormon Wives. “Most people would never show their face again,” says Paul. But she has no problem laying her life bare—most prominently, her on-again-off-again romance with boyfriendDakota Mortensen,father to her one-year-old son,Ever True.This season she confronts a woman Mortensen was also dating during the early days of their relationship in a castmate’s living room, surrounded by Home Goods–purchased fall decor. “It was the beginning of a lot that I didn’t know. That was the least of my worries unfortunately,” Paul says of her ex now. “I’m just exhausted. Always.” When we speak in mid-May, Mortensen and Paul are separated. “I am just working on myself. That is the only way that we were ever going to come together, whether it’s good coparenting or maybe one day in the future…I don’t know what that looks like,” she says. “But there’s no way this would ever work if we don’t separate.” Paul is also keen to detach her real life from the show. “It really messes with your mental health,” she says. “But this is also a job, not just for kicks and giggles.” Paul acknowledges her castmates as coworkers—including new arrivalMiranda McWhorter,who was directly involved in the swinging scandal, but oncevowedto never appear on the show. “There was a genuine five-year friendship there. So I understood [her casting] from a business point,” says Paul. She also welcomes the emotionally fraught presence of her mother,Liann,who enters season two with a fresh facelift. “She can get very invested in the moment, but by the end of the night, we could be hugging and laughing.” Adopting an everything-is-copy mentality can be lucrative. “The more open you are, the more backlash you can get—but also the more relatable you are,” says Paul. It’s a strategy everyone in the ensemble embraces in season two.Mikayla Matthewstalks aboutsexual abuse she experienced as a child.Mayci Neeleyvisits the grave of her boyfriend who died when she was pregnant with their young son.Layla Taylorreveals she’s never achieved orgasm, leading MomTok to throw a “Remove the Taboo” party, accented by a plethora of sex toys. “Everyone’s been a bit more open, which is great,” says Leavitt. “Because when a show this big comes out, people get scared and self-edit.” But no one could accuse Ngatikaura of self-censorship. After chronicling her labiaplasty in season one, she slams rumors in season two about the size of her husband’s penis by passing around a blurred photo of it. In an interview, the hairdresser shrugs the moment off. “When you’re on reality TV, you have to be okay with 99% of your life being out there,” she says. “And at least you’re telling the story instead of someone else telling it for you.” That temptation to set the record straight is what keeps 25-year-oldJenAffleck,now in the third trimester of her third pregnancy, from leaving the show. She considered quitting multiple times, she says, particularly as Affleck navigated “spiritual warfare” during season two. Though she’s currently uncomfortable physically, Affleck says, “I’m mentally doing better now.” The rocky state of Jen’s union withZac,once-allegedcousin ofBenandCasey Affleck,was a major plot point in the show’s first season. If you’ll remember, Zac threatened to divorce Jen because she wanted to see a Chippendales show when she and the other Mormon wives took a trip to Las Vegas. The repercussions of sharing so much of her personal life on camera were swift. “When season one came out, I lost a lot of friends and relationships with family members. And to be honest, I didn’t know where I stood with my marriage,” says Affleck. Filming on the second season resumed less than a month after the first season’s release. “I had no time to regroup,” she says. “Zac and I were in the thick of trying to heal, just walking into chaos.” The couple attempts to fix their issues on the very show that’s tearing them apart. In one episode, the pair engages in ketamine therapy: “Even though that’s taboo within our religion, at this point we’re kind of past all the church guidelines,” Affleck tellsVF.Their conflict reaches its stunning peak when Affleck, in the grand tradition of MTV’sTeen Momand Bravo’sBethenny Frankel,takes a pregnancy test on camera. “When I found out I was pregnant, which was very unplanned—and at the time felt like the last thing I needed—I just hit a breaking point,” she says. Affleck admits to her husband and a few trusted cast members on camera that she is struggling with prenatal depression and suicidal ideation. Shortly after that, she decides to sit out the remainder of the season. “I truly was incapable of moving forward with filming,” she says now. “My priority was to take care of not only myself, but the baby.” Affleck understands the risk she took by sharing such a vulnerable moment during an already delicate period in her life. “You get so used to the camera that you kind of forget your boundaries and what you should or shouldn’t show,” says Affleck. But she has no regrets about the scene, or the pregnancy revealed during it. “I am not afraid to show the real. The real is what inspires people,” Affleck adds. “I truly believe that God has a plan, and I believe that was his plan for me.” Speaking of divine intervention: Affleck spends her abbreviated time in season two pointing out cracks in the marriages of costarsDemi Engemannand Ngatikaura. She claims during our interview that they’ve been “using my marriage to deflect from theirs.” “My point was, Hey, my shit stinks—but your shit stinks too,” Affleck says. She’s also found levity in the darkness by making jokes about her now dubious ties to Ben Affleck and evenmaking nice with Chippendales, posting a clip of herself and Zac at the dance revue that’s drawn more than 3 million views on TikTok. Having a sense of humor seems key to reality-TV longevity. Unlike some of her costars, Leavitt stays off Reddit and devotes her time instead topoking fun at the rumorssurrounding her husbandConner’s sexuality. One video about their alleged “lavender marriage” has earned 4.2 million views. “I did social media for so long before even getting on a reality TV show,” says Leavitt. “I had a lot of experience of getting people’s opinions about my relationship and who I am and blah, blah, blah. It doesn’t bother us.” Ngatikaura denies that the cast’s frequent social media trolling is done solely to market the show, but admits that she and her fellow content creators sometimes struggle not to make posts that accidentally spoil the series. “We’re just so used to living online that it doesn’t feel weird to us,” she says. “As a group we’ve decided, ‘Okay, wearefilming a show. Let’s try not to do that as much.’ But it doesn’t always work out that way.” Fans took notice when Engemann recentlyunfollowedmost of her fellow castmates—including Jessi Ngatikaura, her former best friend. The two, whose identical caramel tresses and penchant for pot-stirring made themnearly interchangeablein season one, are now sworn enemies. “I would say that the friendship has died, so RIP,” Ngatikaura says, laughing bitterly. That characterization is “a bit dramatic,” says Engemann, but she agrees that things between them have gone south: “If fame and attention has gone to anyone’s head, it’s Jessi for sure.” That’s not a perspective shared by many in MomTok. When asked who has changed the most betweenMormon Wivesseasons one and two, Engemann wins the popular vote. “She came off originally very levelheaded and ready to work as a team,” says Paul. Now Engemann sits on a “high horse, better than thou.” Multiple women say that during contract negotiations for the second season, Engemann was willing to boot her closest onscreen ally off the show to secure a higher paycheck for herself. “It was really hurtful to know that someone could throw away a friendship and ruin an opportunity for a friend because of money,” Ngatikaura says. Adds Paul, “If she’s willing to do that to her best friend, then she’s willing to do that to any of us.” Engemann denies any wrongdoing. “I never once lobbied to get Jessi, specifically, out of the show,” she says, claiming that Ngatikaura was the first to “go rogue” and ask to receive more money than the rest of the cast. Engemann says that when she, in turn, asked for a raise, she was told that bumping her salary could mean other cast members getting cut. “I basically was like, Okay, it’s every man for themselves.” (Vanity Fairhas reached out to Ngatikaura for comment. A source close to production refutes Engemann’s version of events.) Money discomfort aside, Ngatikaura forgave Engemann. At first. “Then she talked badly about my business, and it just made me realize, Oh, maybe this friendship isn’t what I think it is,” Ngatikaura says. Engemann alleges that she was only voicing things that the rest of their costars also believed. “Three of the girls in the group said that they had a terrible color job from Jessi. When Taylor came to me asking for an opinion on how to fix her hair, I had relayed the girls’ experience. I had never even been to Jessiyet,” she says. “I shouldn’t have relayed other people’s opinions, and I own that. However, it is strange to me that I’m taking the fall when I wasn’t the only person involved.” Engemann believes she’s catching all this heat because of her popularity coming off the show’s first season. “Fame doesn’t matter to me at all. The girls think that it does because I was a fan favorite, and I’m a confident person,” she says. “Knowing what you’re worth does not mean that you’re conceited. That’s going to be threatening to anyone who maybe doesn’t share that same self-confidence.” But statements like this are precisely what alienate Engemann from her castmates. “Did you cause some drama [in the first season]? Absolutely,” Paul adds. “But you didn’t actually share any of your real struggles. To think you’re the one person that brings it all—that’s delusional.” In season two, Engemann emotionally details her yearslong infertility struggles during a painfully ill-timed (and, I must say, utterly deranged) game of “pregnancy test roulette” during a girls trip to New Orleans. During the game, Mikayla Matthews and Mayci Neeley reveal their pregnancies to the group—but it leaves Engemann in tears. She and husbandBret,16 years her senior, also confront rumors of his infidelity. “Trust me: If something happened, I would know. We spend 90% of our time with each other,” says Engemann. “At one point in my life I would’ve freaked out about something like that. But with Bret, I’m so stable and secure.” She faces some cheating speculation of her own this season. Through flashbacks, we see the Mormon wives’ visit to the setting of Hulu’sVanderpump Villa,where it was clear that front-of-house staff memberMarciano Brunettehad a crush on Engemann—but she denies getting involved with him while filming the crossover episode, calling Brunette “delusional.” Her costar Affleck remains unconvinced, alleging that Engemann sent Affleck a cease and desist in response to the cheating rumors. “If that doesn’t say anything, I don’t know what does,” she says. “The only reason you’d want to get a cease and desist against someone would be because you’re trying to hide something.” Engemann refutes this claim, tellingVFshe spoke toMormon Wivesproducers about potentially taking legal action regarding an “inappropriate” occurrence at the villa involving Brunette, “something that I never wanted to come to light.” (Vanity Fairhas reached out to Brunette and Hulu for comment.) Affleck knows about the alleged misconduct, Engemann says, but is “trying to spin it as though I’m hiding something that I did with him. So it’s pretty disgusting, honestly, and unfair given the fact that I’m a victim in this situation.” (Affleck has also been contacted for comment.) Engemann also asserts that gossip about her and Brunette “may have been to cover up what was maybe going on with him and Jessi.” Season two ofVanderpump Villaends with Brunette alleging that he and Ngatikaura made out at TomTom, another one of Bravo starLisa Vanderpump’s restaurants. Both Engemann and Ngatikaura sidestep questions about Brunette’s claim. “Everyone deserves to tell their truth, and hopefully things will come to light eventually,” says Ngatikaura. “But yeah, that was a crazy cliff-hanger.” “I’m not nervous for anything that’s going to come to light because I am standing in truth,” says Engemann. What was the biggest lesson she learned in season two? “How rare it is to have the amount of integrity that I have,” she answers. “I saw a lot of people betray themselves for an opportunity to be viewed as the star pupil. I’m so proud of myself for the way that I’m navigating reality TV, fame, attention.” Shifting group dynamics this season led Engemann to make a surprise alliance with Leavitt, who empathized with her castmate’s isolation. “I know what that feels like, and it’s horrible—regardless of the part that you played,” she says. Leavitt doesn’t totally agree with Engemann’s actions this season, but she knows that each MomTok member longs for her own spotlight. “I don’t care what any woman says. At the end of the day, you wouldn’t be doing this if you didn’t want something out of it,” she says. “It’s a springboard into other things that you want to do in this industry.” Leavitt, who stillmakes more money from social mediathan she does from the show itself, is open to pursuing a career as a solo artist. “Oh,girl,” she purrs. “I’m thinking about it, Savannah.” She’s “been auditioning like crazy” for various acting jobs. But for now, she’s still performing her heart out onMormon Wives,building one of reality TV’s great frenemy dynamics with Taylor Frankie Paul. The two often spar about how to make good TV—which, not coincidentally, makes forverygood TV. “We naturally butt heads. We think differently,” says Leavitt. But game recognizes game. “I love having conversations with Taylor, because I’ll get a different perspective, and I know that she thinks the same.” If reality TV were high school, then Paul would be the student who doesn’t even crack a textbook before acing the final exam. She hadn’t watched her debut season ofMormon Wivesin full until two months ago, after filming the second season, nor does she watch any other reality TV. Meanwhile, Leavitt has done all the required reading. “I was raised on the Kardashians—the founding fathers right there,” she says. “I absolutely love [The Hills’]Heidi Montag.” After meeting Montag in real life, says Leavitt, “her, her husband [Spencer Pratt], and I just fell in love immediately.” But she’s still got her sights set on scripted fare—and dreams of one day starring on the female-fronted Showtime survival dramaYellowjackets.“Put me in a plane that crashes and all of a sudden we’re creating a cult—I’m there.” Come to think of it, that premise isn’t too far from that ofThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives.“We’re just not eating people,” Leavitt says with a knowing laugh. “Not yet.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Sofia Coppola on the Film Execs Afraid of ‘The Virgin Suicides,’ and the “Guys Version” They Didn’t Make",
    "article_text": "The Virgin Suicides,before Oscar-winning writer-directorSofia Coppolamade it, anyway, was exactly as terrifying to Hollywood film executives as the title suggests. “They thought it would start an epidemic and that it was going to start some wave of tragedies,” Coppola tellsVFof her 1999 debut film based on the 1993 novel byJeffrey Eugenides.“But every responsible person in that world that I talked to said it’s actually more helpful to have a conversation around this topic.” Coppola’s film follows the ethereal but troubled Lisbon sisters, and their untimely deaths as they’re suffocated by suburbia one by one, as told in a dream-like haze by the neighborhood boys who worshipped them from afar. Coppola recalls it being well-received when it premiered at Cannes, but the US release of the small independent film, shot over the course of four sweltering summer weeks in Toronto, was almost nonexistent. Coppola, only 29, says she was sad to see her first film fade into oblivion. “Nobody saw it,” Coppola tellsVanity Fair.“That’s why it means so much to me that people even know it and appreciate it now. It was just very much guys, ’90s macho. It was a different environment back then. I think the studio didn’t know what to do with it, and people didn’t seem to get it.” Like the Lisbon sisters, her film was a misunderstood misfit, struggling to find its footing. But 25 years later,The Virgin Suicides,its status cemented in the Criterion Collection, has become the defining work of Coppola’s career, setting the foundation for a filmography steeped in universal girlhood, whether in suburbia, Graceland, or Versailles. Coppola, not knowing whatThe Virgin Suicideswould come to mean to audiences, and young female audiences in particular, asked the late British photographer Corinne Day to document the making of the film. The images Day captured have become iconic unto themselves, from the mundane snapshots of the young girls—Kirsten Dunst, A.J. Cook, Hanna Hall, Leslie Hayman, Chelse Swain—piled onto a bed or asleep between takes to portraits of a young heartthrob in the making,Josh Hartnett. To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the film, Coppola has compiled Day’s photographs into a book,The Virgin Suicides,the first work published by Important Flowers, from her imprint with publishing house MACK. “I’m not very organized, but I remembered there was a box somewhere of her photos. It was such a big deal to me that she came to the set,” Coppola says. “We were going through things forArchiveand we found the binder of her negatives. It was so fun to look at her proof sheets and see all these images. I’ve always loved those images. Since there are more than we could put in [Archive] I wanted to make this a tribute to her.” By the time Coppola started adapting what she still calls her “favorite book,” another project was already in the works. But in a letter,printed in her 500-page retrospective,Sofia Coppola Archive 1999–2023,the first-time director convinced a hesitant Eugenides to consider her script instead. “I know there’s a script somewhere. I can’t remember who it was, but I remember it was really dark and it was a guy’s version, and I was like, This is not how it should be,” Coppola says. “I felt very strongly about that. It was the boys looking at the girls, but somehow the girls are the ones presenting the story.” Eugenides wrote the introduction to the new collection, praising Coppola and Day: “Most everything pictured here—from the prom dresses and the crucifix draped with a brassiere to Trip Fontaine floating in his swimming pool—came from either my experience or my imagination. The film is the second iteration of that and these photos a third.” To celebrate the anniversary, Coppola talks toVanity Fairabout herVirgin Suicides,sharing exclusive images by Day. Vanity Fair:Take me back to when you first decided to call Corinne Day to ask her to come photograph the set ofThe Virgin Suicides. ‘The Virgin Suicides’ MACK Sofia Coppola:I was a big fan. I was a photography fan first and growing up in high school, I was living in the countryside of Northern California andThe Facemagazine was my connection to culture and the world and it meant a lot to me. I knew Corinne fromThe Face and when I made [The Virgin Suicides], I asked if she would come to set. I was happy and surprised that she said “sure.” She came and spent time there taking the photos, and she kind of blends in as one of them with her long blonde hair. I always love her eye and the details that she looked at. I was really happy to get to revisit them in these photos. She was like a journalistic photographer that knew how to be stealthy and get the shots she wanted. We were just all happy that she was there. It must be so different on set now because everyone is always taking behind-the-scenes images on their phones. So many of the photos in the book look like film stills even though a lot of them are just of the actors between shots. You two had a similar eye. I was really inspired by her whole approach to photography, which was very, those kind of in-between moments and it's not perfect. I love that about her work. There's a relaxed naturalness, so that was probably an inspiration on how I've filmed the movie too. When you hang out on set for hours and everyone's been there for hours, you find these moments of everyone with their guard down, a lot of sitting around or falling asleep on set. She's interested in those kinds of moments that are when you're not on. Did looking through these photos spark any memories that might have been buried away, like a particularly hard day on set? My cousinChris, who worked on it, we were talking about that and you forget all the hard parts after it's done. I guess they say that about after having a child. But I have really good memories of that summer. All those kids were so having fun being a part of it, and so helpful and up for trying things. They were such a team with me, all the actors and Ed Lachman, the cinematographer, was so sweet and collaborative and helping me find my way. I remember, Josh Hartnett, when he would come to set and we would all swoon and he felt really self-conscious in that wig because it was so different from his real self. But yeah, I mean, it was stressful. We were shooting on film, and film was expensive and we were low budget, and so the producers were always telling me to shoot less film, and I would do these long takes with the girls lying around. So there were challenges, but I learned a lot and we had a good experience. The photos also tell a coming-of-age story, capturing portraits of young stars in the making. Particularly of Kirsten Dunst, who was just 16 at the time. You two have maintained a decades-long relationship. What was your first impression of her at 16? It's so touching to see Kirsten grow up over the years. When I met her, she was 16 and she said it was the first time she played a part that had elements of growing up in it, and that she was kind going through the same thing at that time. It was so important for me to really capture that moment. She was so open and vulnerable and showing a side of herself that she hadn't shown before. We had an instant click and she trusted me. We were really a team. And the same goes for Josh Hartnett, who is having quite the renaissance right now. I love Josh. I've always been a fan, and he's so cute and nice and such a great guy and a great actor, so I'm happy that he's having a moment. I read that you still have his character, Trip Fontaine’s wig, in storage somewhere. Will that ever see the light of day? I do. I should pull that out. We have a box of costumes in my parents' storage building, and I came across Trip Fontaine's wig. I'm not sure we should put it on display somewhere and break the illusion. Would you ever do an exhibition, with costumes and things like that, bringing your bookArchiveto life? I never thought about it. First you save it in case you have to reshoot, and then it ends up staying. You don't have the heart to toss it. Somebody's doing an exhibit somewhere around Europe about girlhood and girls' rooms, and I think we had a few costumes that we sent. I don't know if we have all the prom dresses, or what. I don't think we have that much. It’’s hard for me to tell what's just old stuff and what is of interest. Next time I am back home I have to see what we have. There are also a few photographs of you behind the camera. You were so young, working on your first film, and making a name for yourself. Looking back at those photos did any emotions come up? It brings back that whole memory of that experience. But when I see it, I say, why am I wearing that dumb cowboy hat? It’s sort of embarrassing. It's hard for me to be objective, I was so focused on making the movie at the time, but it's nice that she captured that moment. You were only 29. Do you remember the weight of being a young woman having to command a set? There's so much to do that you focus on what you have to make. Luckily, I had the support of the people around me. I found a really sweet letter my brother wrote to me before I started and it was like, just make it the way you want to. I had a lot of support and encouragement to make it the way I wanted, which was really helpful. The film means so much to so many people, especially young women. It means so much to me that it still connects with teenagers now because it was something that I connected to. So the fact that there's universal themes that still connect to teenage girls through generations is so touching to me. Do young girls come up to you quite a bit? Yeah. That always makes me happy because it was so long ago, and I feel like teenage girls are such tough critics and sensitive, so that means a lot to me. I recently visited High Valley Books in Greenpoint and ended up with two items from the Sofia Coppola Universe. Josh Hartnett’s February 2000Interviewmagazine cover and the September 2006 issue ofVoguefeaturing Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. Oh my god! That’s so cute. That’s so cool that you have those. I saw that you also recently visited High Valley Books. What did you dig through, and did you pick up anything as book research for Important Flowers? I love photo books. I love magazines. I’ll show you what I got. I got 1973Voguesall bound together. So cool. I went there with my [Important Flowers] team to do some research for some different ideas that we had. And I make collages, so I like to have old magazines to cut out. Is that a pastime of yours? Making collages? Yeah, I love to do that. I’ve been neglecting it but I have old magazines, some of them I don’t like to cut up but I have some that are for that. Last time we spoke you mentioned that both your daughters were reluctant fans of your work. But they are a little bit older now. Have they seenThe Virgin Suicides? I was just asking Cosima, my younger one, if she wanted to see it, because we’re going to show it at MoMA. I don’t think she’s ever seen it on a big screen. I feel like I don’t want to smother them or put my stuff on them. But I think maybe Romy saw it. They are aware of it. They respect it but it’s also like “enough already.” I want to show them on the big screen because it’s such a nice, different experience. I don’t know if you’ve seen this but a lot of people on TikTok say that Romy was “written by Sofia Coppola.” It’s so funny because when she was born, I was like, how do I have a kid that looks like Kirsten? Blonde, blue eyed, like a character in one of my movies, somehow? I always thought that was really interesting and funny. I remember Kirsten holding her as a baby and she looks more like this blonde German. I always photograph that kind of style, so it's funny to have a daughter that's in that aesthetic. Girls will also post their messy bedroom online and call it “Sofia Coppola–core.” It's so funny because messy rooms, I feel like are such a teenage thing. I definitely did not invent that. I have aBill Owensprint of this girl surrounded by her mess in her room that my mom gave me because I always had such a messy room, and now when I see my kids' mess, I'm like, it's just universal. What books from Important Flowers can we expect next? We just sent a book on the history of Chanel Couture to the printer, which I'm really excited about. It looks so beautiful. I can't wait to see it in person. That was so fun. When I'm stressed with the work stuff, I get to escape into these beautiful images. It's really just something I enjoy. That's coming out this fall. We have a couple for next year that I'm excited about. We should wait and announce them when they're ready, but we have a few in the works. Aside from the imprint, can you tell me anything about your next film project and where in the process you are? I'm working on a script right now. I'm still kind of slow with all these side projects, but I'm hoping to get back to stuff, probably next year. Do your daughters give you ideas? Do you think either of them are interested in directing? Sometimes I’ll ask for their opinions. I don't know yet. They're both so creative, so I can't wait, but I don't want to push them in any direction. This interview has been edited and condensed.

    "title": "Trump Calls Bruce Springsteen “Pushy, Obnoxious JERK” After Springsteen Slams “Treasonous” Administration",
    "article_text": "InDonald Trump’s world, he’s the boss—and doesn’t plan on taking orders from another by the name ofBruce Springsteen.After Springsteen criticized the current president while opening his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in Manchester, England, Trump fired back, calling the musician a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” on Truth Social. On Wednesday, 75-year-old Springsteen ridiculed Trump in several separate comments before playing his songs “Land of Hope and Dreams,” “House of a Thousand Guitars,” and “My City of Ruins.” Later, the musician posted atranscriptof his remarks on his website and avideoof them on his YouTube channel. “The mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ‘n’ roll, in dangerous times,” Springsteen said. “In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.” Before a cheering crowd, Springsteen went on to accuse the Trump administration of “taking sadistic pleasure in the pain that they inflict on loyal American workers.” He added, “They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that has led to a more just and plural society. They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom. They’re defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. They’re removing residents off American streets and, without due process of law, are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now.” By Friday, 78-year-old Trump had caught wind of Springsteen’s speeches and responded with some harsh words of his own. “I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, where he also tookanothershotatTaylor Swift,writing that she was “no longer hot.” (Vanity Fairhas reached out to Swift for comment.) As for Springsteen, “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy,” Trump continued. “Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK, who fervently supported CrookedJoe Biden,a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.” Trump also seemed to take issue with the fact that Springsteen made his criticism outside of the United States—and did so while wrinkled. “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare,’” Trump continued. “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” (VFhas reached out to Springsteen for comment.) This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Others in the conservative sphere havecriticizedSpringsteen for speaking out against Trump in another country, includingFox News’sGreg Gutfeldand fellow musicianKid Rock,whocalledit a “punk move.” But theBorn in the U.S.A.singer hasfrequently trolledTrump in all parts of the world,previously callingthe president a “moron” and declaring his 2016 campaign a “tragedy for our democracy.” Springsteen has long endorsed democratic presidential candidates.

When Biden was elected in 2020, he delivered his victory speech after walking out to Springsteen’s song “We Take Care of Our Own.” During his recent concert, Springsteen said that Trump’s agenda would not triumph. “The America I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real and, regardless of its faults, is a great country with great people,” he said. “So we’ll survive this moment.” Springsteen will be back onstage in Manchester on Saturday, May 17.

    "title": "Ruben Gallego Wants Democrats To Stop Being So “Soft” on the Border",
    "article_text": "Ruben Gallegogets worked up when he talks about his party’s immigration platform. Democrats, he says, have been too “afraid” of taking a more assertive approach to the border—and, in so doing, opened the door forDonald Trumpto move on his draconian, unconstitutional agenda. “It just drives me nuts,” he told me. This week, the Arizona senator released his own plan to improve the nation’s immigration system—one the Arizona Democrat says would strengthen border security, while also protecting immigrant rights, ensuring pathways to citizenship, and establishing more avenues to come to the United States legally. “We don’t have to choose between border security and immigration reform,” hesaid, announcing hisproposalMonday. “We can and should do both.” In an interview, which has been lightly edited for clarity and length, the swing-state senator discussed his border plan, criticized Trump’s effort to end birthright citizenship, and explained the lessons he wants his party to take from the successful 2024 campaign he ran in an otherwise dismal year for the Democrats: “Denying reality does not change reality,” Gallego told me. “You can be a very good Democrat and be for strong border security.” Vanity Fair:The Supreme Court recentlyheard argumentsrelated to Trump’s effort to restrict birthright citizenship. Trump beforehandsaidthat allowing birthright citizenship makes the US a “stupid country.” What do you make of all that? Senator Ruben Gallego:You know, in my campaign, where I won some of the same voters that Donald Trump won, I traveled the whole state, and not one person ever asked me to end birthright citizenship. Number one, the Constitution protects it. Number two, it really is what makes this country great. The fact that people who are born here are US citizens is what makes us that melting pot, right? You see other countries that don’t have birthright citizenship, you have problems with assimilation there. We don’t, I think, because this country automatically loves these kids—and these kids, in return, automatically love the country. If you break that and you start creating second-class citizens, you’re going to have bigger problems in the future that don’t exist right now. Trump won in November, proposing this hardline approach we’ve seen. What do you think your party has been missing on immigration and the border, and how do you think your proposal addresses them? The proposal is really what I heard on the campaign trail. Look, the voters who cared about immigration in Arizona? We won their vote. We were more trusted thanKari Lakeon the border. There were voters who went into the voting booth saying,I trust Trump, and I trust Ruben Gallego on border issues.And the reason we are still losing—and I say the royal we—to Trump is because we’re just saying what we’re against and not what we’re for. And we need to make it very clear that we are for border security. That’s what this plan talks about. We are for stopping the abuse of the asylum system. That’s what this plan is about. We’re about getting people out of the shadows. And we recognize we can’t make all 12 million people legal US citizens—but wedorecognize that Americans understand the special place in their hearts for Dreamers, and for the spouses of US citizens. They should have a pathway, and everyone else should at least be able to stay in this country without fear of deportation if they haven’t done any serious crimes. And so the fact that Democrats can’t even start with a point A and saying like,Yes, having a secure border is good and we should continue to figure out how to do that, andthenyou can move on to talk about point B—I think that’s what makes it very hard for a lot of people to take us seriously on the overall conversation of immigration reform. I've seen at least a couple of House Democratsexpress supportfor the plan this week. What kind of reaction have you heard from other colleagues? Have you gotten a sense that there's more of an appetite for these kinds of proposals now? Certainly, on the Senate side, a lot of Democrats have been starting to read it. And my position to them is like, you don’t even have to agree with everything here. You could even add stuff to it. But you have to be able to point to something. It is important to at least have some of the core elements. Like, why don’t we agree that the goal of the Democratic Party should be to have as near zero illegal border crossings as possible, right? It doesn’t mean we have to be assholes about it, either. You could have well-trained border control, you could have asylum judges—all these things. But it should be a functional goal for us to reduce illegal border crossings, and it doesn’t mean that that attitude somehow transfers over to how we deal with Dreamers, how we deal with all the other different situations. It just means that, like, this is a functional aspect of governance, and if we can’t show that we can govern there, the American voters are not going to trust us when we say we need to do something about these poor people that have been in the shadows for generations. I also saw a White House reaction to your proposal—Kush DesaitoldFox News, “We don’t need a new bill to secure our southern border…We just needed President Trump back in office.” I wonder what you make of that. It seems to me that it points not only to an opportunity for the Democrats politically, but also to advance serious policy. The thing that points out the most is how scared [Republicans] are about this common sense approach. Like, they classify this as “amnesty.” This is a very moderate approach. We’re not trying to make 12 million people US citizens. We’re saying,Hey, we understand where the American public is.We’re actually backing up some of the president’s positions. HesaysDreamers should be US citizens. He’s alsosaidif you’re in this country illegally, but you’re working a job, you should also be able to stay here. HesaidI’m for legal immigration. But the problem is, [Republicans] are so scared of losing the one thing that they’re actually polling okay at. They need Democrats to be looked at as being soft on the border. Because if that doesn't continue, then they start losing elections like the one they lost in Arizona, right? But is there anything that can be done that would prevent Republicans from accusing Democrats of being soft on the border? Democrats have to show that they're not. We could do that by legislation or by just saying it, right? But this doesn’t mean that we shirk our responsibilities to stop the abuses that happen. Because, again, the American public doesn’t want families separated. The American public doesn’t want chaos in our communities. They don’t want children to be deported. We can still fight for that, while also saying,You know what? I’m for a secure border. Now, the difference between me and Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is burning through money so fast to secure the border. He’s using troops that should be in training—they’re basically border guards. I’m saying, send the Marines back and hire more border patrol, hire more trained officials, hire more asylum judges to keep this going. Because he hasn’t solved the problem. He’s going to eventually run out of money. He hasn’t solved the problem if you’re still going to have 8 million to 12 million people hiding in the shadows. And, by the way, he’s never going to hit the deportation numbers to get those people out, even in four years. And he certainly isn’t going to solve our labor problem of people that we still need coming into this country. Let’s figure out a way for them to come here legally. Well, another difference between you and the president is your approach, in terms of constitutionality, right? A lot of what he’s doing is outside the constitutional bounds. And also unpopular. Immigration seems emblematic of some of the broader failings of the Democratic sales pitch last cycle. It seems like the party, broadly speaking, was too insistent that the status quo under their leadership was working, and too reliant on getting voters to reject Trump’s extremism. Now, he’s clearly been antidemocratic in all the ways the party warned about and then some. But what do you think Democrats need to do moving forward? So number one: Denying reality does not change reality. Let’s just be clear. I think what separated us from a lot of other candidates is that we didn’t deny reality, whether it was the economy or it was the border. Just doing that helped us connect with voters, which I think, if any other candidate had run, they would probably not have been able to do, to be honest. The Democrats ran a campaign that they wanted to run that would make them feel good, but not necessarily win. What does that mean? I think they were soft on the border. They were soft on the overall crime message. They were too Pollyannaish about the economy. And instead of showing that they are sincere about closing the border, they were afraid to piss off this imaginary voter base of Latinos that is for open borders, which doesn’t fucking exist, Eric! Sorry, it just drives me nuts. I’m going to tell you the two prime examples that really showed me what was happening: WhenKamala Harriswent on camera andsaidto asylum seekers, “Don’t come,” she literally got shit on by left-wingers and organizations. But that was the actual message she should have been sticking to the whole time. But she basically hid after that, because she got so much crap from these groups that were wrong. Latino voters did not like hundreds of thousands of people showing up at the border, claiming asylum, and then automatically getting a work permit five months later. That actually pissed them off a lot. But because she faced such pushback, I think it stopped them from being more aggressive when it came to the campaign side. And even, you know,Joe Bidenin November of 2023—I talked to one of his closest advisers, and they had a pretty good plan about how to deal with the border. I warned them,Do not lift Title 42 unless you have a plan, but they ended up doing it. And what did we see? Chaos. And why didn’t they extend it? Because the plans that they had would have pissed off some of these very liberal immigration groups. So when the Senate came and said,Well, why don’t you let us work on it for you?—they took the easy way. Like,cool, I don’t have to be the bad guy.And they gave it to them. And then what happens? Nothing until March, when they finally dropped the plan. And what happens? The president doesn’t do anything until July of 2024, and what does he do? He does something that automatically starts moving the numbers to a very manageable level. Do we hear this blowback? There was no blowback whatsoever. That’s why we need to be realistic. Had we actually been listening to reality instead of what we wanted the reality to be, we would have run a campaign that was tailored around that. Do you think the winds are shifting on that? I don’t know. What I fear is that we may have a really good year, and people may take the wrong message away from it. But I’m here to spread the word and take the slings and arrows for other people to prove that you can be a very good Democrat and be for strong border security, and be very popular with the Democratic base, too.

    "title": "Ana de Armas and Tom Cruise Are Together—Working Together, at Least",
    "article_text": "Ana de ArmasandTom Cruisehave made multiple appearances together since February, most recentlyatDavid Beckham’s birthdayjust a couple weeks ago—which has led many in the media to speculate that the two actors are involved in a relationship. As it turns out, they are: a professional relationship. One of those meetings in London also involved a third figure: the directorDoug Liman,who had already worked with Cruise onEdge of Tomorrow(2014) andAmerican Made(2017). While doing promotion for her upcoming action movie,From the World of John Wick: Ballerina,the Cuban actor confirmed that she and Cruise are working together on multiple projects, involving both Liman and another Cruise favorite,Christopher McQuarrie. While appearing onGood Morning Americaon Thursday, de Armas confirmed that she has several irons in the fire at the moment: with Liman (whose filmography also includes everything fromThe Bourne Identityto the recent remake ofRoad House), McQuarrie (Cruise’s most frequent director in recent years, responsible for the last four installments ofMission: Impossibleand screenwriter onEdge of Tomorrow), “and of course, Tom. And I’m so excited,” said de Armas. Though we don’t yet know more details about the projects the two actors have cooking, there are a few clues. In December 2024,Liman revealedthat he was in preproduction on a supernatural thriller that would also star Cruise. “I have never done one, and neither has Tom,” the the director said—though that may depend on how we classifyWar of the Worlds.This project has been bouncing between studios for almost 10 years, starting at MGM before landing at Warner Bros. The script, byMax Landis(World War Z), is about an astronaut who has an underwater encounter with something terrifying. We’ll likely know more about what de Armas and Cruise have in the works when the promotional tours forBallerina(releasing June 6) andMission: Impossible(releasing May 23) are over.

    "title": "‘Splitsville’ Wants to Bring Back the Wild Sex Comedy—With a Little Extra Blood",
    "article_text": "Tom Cruisehas shown off some insane stunts here in Cannes, with the world premiere ofMission Impossible—The Final Reckoning.But he may meet his match inSplitsville, the absurdist indie sex comedy made for a tiny fraction of that behemoth’s budget. The new film starringMichael Angelo Covino,also its director, andKyle Marvin,its cowriter and producer, features some outrageous set pieces made using practical effects. There’s a terrifying car crash; one or both of these guys (“no spoilers,” they urge) really do fall through a giant glass window onto a grassy lawn, oozing blood. “Mike is bleeding from his head, and our stunt coordinator comes over and is like, ‘This is the best-case scenario,’” Marvin tells me between sips of his Noisette on a Cannes restaurant patio. “We were, like, ‘Wait, wait, wait. What was theworst-case scenario?’” This may not sound like typical Cannes fare, but Covino and Marvin bring a classic Euro-cinema flair to their deeply American—sometimes, deeply silly—character studies. Their previous collaboration, the moving friendship dramedyThe Climb,premiered in the festival’s Un Certain Regard section and won a special jury prize.Splitsville, which Neon is set to release in August in the US, will launch in the Premiere program on Monday. Covino and Marvin’s new film opens on spouses Ashley (Adria Arjona) and Carey (Marvin), who are heading out of the city to meet their couple friends Julie (Dakota Johnson) and Paul (Covino) at their stunning new beach house. They’ve barely started the engine before Ashley announces she wants a divorce. Carey gets out of the car and makes his own way to Julie and Paul’s, where they discuss the news; during this conversation, he learns that Julie and Paul are in an open relationship. The discovery of this dynamic—its freedom, its pitfalls—opens both Carey’s and Ashley’s minds, just as it’s presenting fresh challenges to Julie and Paul’s marriage. Before long, all hell breaks loose. “It’s a bunch of people who are convincing themselves that they’ve figured it all out, only to go back to their childlike impulses,” Covino says. “We know people where it’s just a conversation right now, this lifestyle. You realize, ‘Oh, no, I’m jealous. I still have these feelings. And this is the way they’re going to come out.’” The film neither condemns nor endorses an open-marriage approach. “It’s very human,” Covino says of howSplitsvilleexamines the topic. “You look in some people’s eyes and they’re, like, ‘Yeah, we’re really happy about it.’ Then it’s, like, ‘Fuck, there’s sadness under there.’” How does this nuanced understanding of an intimate topic lead to bloody scalps? “You’re trying to make a movie that’s, in our minds, a reinvigoration of classic farces—old Italian sex comedies, and the Blake Edwards and Arthur Hiller movies,” Covino says. Marvin, who made his feature directorial debut with 2023’s80 for Brady, adds, “As an audience member, we’re just, like, ‘What a crazy choice—but made with such confidence and such craft.’ That was really the bar.’” “You watch movies likeSeduced and Abandoned, or Lina Wertmüller movies—the audacity of the decisions that the characters make—you just go, ‘What the fuck are they doing?’” Covino continues. “You watch contemporary things, and the character would never do that. But peopledothese things. People are fucking nuts.” After the success ofThe Climb, Covino and Marvin tried to get a bigger-ticket theatrical comedy budgeted around $30 million off the ground—the kind of movie Hollywood basically never invests in anymore. The duo knew they needed to pivot, and landed onSplitsvilleas the sort of big-screen event producible at a modest price. Neon boarded the project early, and Dakota Johnson, who’d previously expressed interest in working with the pair, came on last-minute after another actor dropped out. Johnson’s a full producer on the film as well. “We’re getting smarter and we’re getting better,” Marvin says of navigating the business as indie filmmakers. Still, they had some stressful nonnegotiables. For starters, Covino committed to shooting on film, an expense that forced them to cut six days of shooting. “Shooting on film is sort of like planting a flag,” Covino says. “Every time we roll the camera, you’re lighting money on fire. It sets a tone. It’s a bit more methodical, and you have to be more intentional.” It’s also a trade-off: “To be very honest, the movie would be a lot better if I had those extra days.” That decision left no margin for error, even during the most elaborate of sequences. The aforementioned car crash, which happens early in the movie, was captured in a single take at the last possible minute. “We had to weave in and out of traffic because we had all these other stunt drivers on the road,” Covino says. “The camera pans around, covers the car, goes around, watches the crash, and comes back and lands.” Before that, Covino and Marvin filmed a wild fight scene that runs for about 10 minutes in the movie. Again, it’s real, and again, they had virtually no time—they blocked it out before shooting the rest ofSplitsville. “We had three days of just beating the shit out of each other before we started day one, and we were all bruised up,” Covino says. For Marvin, this was a problem since he had to shoot some nude scenes later. “They had to spray my body because I was bruised everywhere. My chest was purple. They were constantly trying to cover the bruises for two weeks.” This level of commitment is visibly, almost worryingly evident in the film—and that’s equally true of the extreme choices made by Johnson and Arjona’s characters. “We like to give freedom to the actors to own the character,” Covino says. “Their instincts are spot-on. You want them to bring it to life in a way that you wouldn’t imagine.” Because Covino maps out the shots he needs well in advance, there was not much room for improvisation. “There’s a lot of trust between the director and an actor to be, like, ‘But I want to walk over here,’ and I’m, like, ‘Okay, well, you can’t. This isn’t in the scene. This is the way it’s going to be shot.’” Citing old masters of Italian comedies like Ettore Scola, Covino and Marvin hope to show how cinematic rigor and off-the-wall humor can live side by side. “No one wants to watch the muted version,” Marvin says. “We want to watch people fucking blow up and act crazy.” And it’s not unrealistic, exactly. WhileSplitsvilleamps things up beyond any reasonable expectation, anyone has the capacity to lose their minds the way these characters do. “It’s about getting deeper into the understanding of a character who makes an outrageous decision and owns it, and then we empathize. And not only empathize, but we’re, like, ‘Yeah, I get it,’” Covino says. “There’s something palpable and entertaining about that.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’sin-depth2025 Cannes Film Festival coverage,including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Helen Hunt Thinks Her ‘Hacks’ Character’s Shocking Exit Was “Surprising and Inevitable”",
    "article_text": "Helen Huntis a big fan of late-night talk shows. “I’m very plugged into that world and how it’s shifted,” she says. “It’s helped the whole country metabolize a lot of really hard things when they go to bed.” That’s why it’s so hard for her to believe that the fourth season ofHacks,in whichJean Smart’s Deborah Vance becomes the first woman to host a major late-night show, is highlighting a glass ceiling that still exists in the real world. All of the major broadcast networks’ longest-running late-night shows are still hosted by men; the last time a woman hosted one was when Joan Rivers had a short-lived stint behind the desk ofThe Late Showin 1986. And even beyond the big networks, women remain underrepresented in this genre. OnHacks,Hunt plays Winnie Landell, the network executive responsible for helping Deborah land her late-night gig. “That my character would take it on as her mission to put this woman in that position—I had fun taking that really personally,” she says. But sadly for Winnie, Deborah’s success is what leads to Winnie’s demise. In the eighth episode of season four, which aired May 15, Deborah’s show becomes the number one late-night show. While congratulating Deborah, Winnie reminds her that they also need to be pursuing a spin-off series. Deborah complains about Winnie to her media-mogul boss, played byTony Goldwyn.Winnie is then fired, sending shockwaves through Hollywood. Deborah’s cutthroat move reminds Ava (Hannah Einbinder) that even now, her boss is looking out for number one. Hunt, who won four Emmys forMad About Youand has starred in iconic films such asTwisterandAs Good as It Gets,spoke toVanity Fairabout the power dynamics at play in the episode, what she’ll miss about Winnie, and the never-ending battle between art and commerce in Hollywood. Vanity Fair:What did you think when you learned that Winnie would be fired? Helen Hunt:I think these writers are so great and so smart. They know that Jean’s character has to be incredibly likable and fierce and ruthless again and again, unpredictably. What you want good writing to be is surprising and inevitable. There’s a power shift from Winnie to Deborah after Deborah’s show is a hit. How accurately does that represent Hollywood? The thing that I found the most fun—I just watched it last night in preparation for this—is that she doesn’t say “fire her.” She says, “Tell her to back off.” She has more power than she thinks, and so she sort of passively aggressively asks for a slight course correction, and then Tony Goldwyn’s character just lops my character’s head off. And you see Jean’s shock when she hears the news. That goes back to their good writing. It’s much better than Jean diabolically planning my demise. She just complains, and then somebody’s head gets cut off for it, which seems very true to life about that moment of hubris that comes with success—when you don’t realize the power you have, and you don’t realize what you’ve lost touch with. What did you enjoy about playing Winnie over these last two seasons? Jean and Hannah are so good, so good together. They hold their own with each other. They let each other win. They love each other in real life, and it’s a love story, in the way thatBreaking Badwas a love story. So getting to step in with good writing underneath me to that beautiful pair of actors was amazing. I’ve experienced women like the one I was playing. It is really hard. I remember a top, top, top, top movie executive long ago who was, at that point, one of the very few [female execs], and I was developing a movie with her, and she said, “It’s good. It’s got to be even better than you think.” Meaning, as a woman and a woman’s story, it’s got to be absolutely bulletproof. I know a lot of these women. Their handshakes are strong, and they want what they want, and they’ve come in clear as day and don’t bullshit around. They tell you the truth and don’t soft-pedal it. They assume that you, as another woman who’s achieved a certain amount of success, will understand we’re not fucking around here. We’ve got to get this just right. Did playing this role reveal anything new to you about those executives? I don’t know if it revealed anything, but I think it reminded me retroactively to have compassion for the strong women who’ve come in and had marching orders. For me, when I’ve worked on a show or developed a show, and in walks a human being who happens to be a woman, who goes, “Right, but we need all 12 episodes before the end of the year. Great. See you later. Bye”—there’s no wiggle room. And it’s probably because she has no wiggle room with whoever she’s answering to. So it reminded me to have compassion and appreciation for those women. This dynamic speaks to how Hollywood projects have to balance art and commerce. How do you think you do that balance successfully? It’s impossible. I have friends who were painters and friends who were songwriters, and they can go home and paint, they can go home and write songs. Now, are people going to hear them? Are they going to get paid for them? That’s a whole other bloody battle. But if you’re making films or television, there’s no getting around the marriage of art and money. It’s awkward, painful, and brutal. It comes together successfully every blue moon. Hunt in season three ofHacks. Mad About Youwas such a phenomenon and hit at the time. Do you think it was easier to break out like that in TV then, or do you think it’s easier now? It'=’s never easy. It takes a lot of luck and a lot of skill and a lot of homework, and somebody following their instincts. But I had a lot of good luck when I gotMad About You,and I was ready. I’d grown up onI Love Lucy,so they wanted me to play a married woman in New York City. Not a problem. And Hannah comes from a lineage of funny women. I don’t know how much that’s part of it, because part of it is a thing you cant describe or point to. People believe that they have it or they don’t. Was there anything about reuniting with Jean that felt really special for the show? It’s fun to not have to shake someone’s hand and go, I wonder if they’re going to be nice or willing to play. To just know she’s this wildly talented lifer who I’ve gotten to work with twice. We’d been doing the reboot ofMad About You,and our wonderful showrunner,Peter Tolan,had written an episode that was challenging. It was sort of more broad than we usually did, and he just called Jean and said, “Want to do me a favor?” And in walks someone who turns the whole thing into a wonderful bouquet of laughs. Speaking of reboots, did you see the newTwistersfilm? I haven’t seen it, no. You had at one time been developing your own sequel, right? I don’t know how relevant that is to this, honestly, but I did talk to somebody about an idea I had for it. But they made this movie, so that’s how that went down. We don’t know where the next season ofHacksis going to go—but in theory, if you don’t return in some way as Winnie, what are you going to miss about the role? It’s just fun to go to work with great actors and fun people. And to have the goal be to be funny and to have writer-directors throw you funny lines to try and throw out some yourself. I just love comedy. I’ve improvised since I was 16, started at the Groundlings, actually not long after Hannah’s mom, [Laraine Newman], was there. It was fun to be around funny people—as long as they’re not mean, and none of these people are mean. I’ve been really lucky in that way. When I worked withPaul[ReiseronMad About You], he’s just a dear person who also happens to be funny. He doesn’t take bites out of people. That’s a lot of reasons why that show is as successful as it is: It’s talking about something real and serious in a funny way, with great actors and great writing. You can’t cheat those ingredients, and this show has all those things.

    "article_text": "The Post unpacks the current Covid-19 situation in city and provides all-in-one checklist for staying safe Hong Kong health authorities have recorded 30 Covid-19-related deaths among 81 severe adult cases in the past four weeks, with the proportion of positive respiratory samples in the same period hitting a one-year high. But experts have said the overall impact of the virus on the community is weaker than in the past, while there is no evidence suggesting the prevalent strain will lead to more severe disease. The Post unpacks the current Covid-19 situation in the city and what residents can do to protect themselves. According to the Centre for Health Protection’s latest data ending May 10, the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive increased to 13.66 per cent from 6.21 per cent in the week of April 6 to 12, a new high in the past year. In the past four weeks, health authorities also logged 81 severe Covid-19 cases involving adults, including 30 deaths. The per capita viral load of Covid-19 tested in sewage water was around 710,000 copies per litre, jumping from 390,000 copies per litre four weeks ago. The consultation rate of Covid-19 cases at accident and emergency departments, general outpatient clinics and private clinics also saw a significant rise.",

    "title": "Greater healthcare demand drives 55% hike in Hong Kong employee medical premiums",
    "article_text": "Inaugural ‘staff medical insurance index’ highlights surge over past three years with post Covid-19 illnesses among contributing factors Hong Kong bosses are facing significantly higher costs for their employees’ medical insurance, with premiums having increased by 55 per cent over the past three years due to a greater demand for healthcare services, including those related to post-Covid illnesses. The findings were announced on Friday by the College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPCE) at Polytechnic University. They form part of Hong Kong’s first “staff medical insurance index”, a collaborative effort with Mandatory Provident Fund consultant GUM. The index, which covers 19 years of market data from 2006 to 2024, aims to provide a comprehensive illustration of the actual use, expense and premium trends of group medical insurance in Hong Kong. It comprises the utilisation index, the expense index, and the premium index. This year’s analysis showed that the composite premium index under the insurance index had cumulatively surged by 55 per cent, rising from 182 in 2021 to 282 in 2024. The average premium paid by companies last year was HK$3,742 (US$479) for outpatient services and HK$5,445 for hospital benefits. Professor Peter Yuen Pok-man, dean of PolyU CPCE and a health economics expert, said that “the rise in medical premiums [was] mainly driven by high utilisation rates”. “Insurers set future premium rates based on past claim experiences,” Yuen said. “Group medical insurance is facing a dilemma where high utilisation leads to premium increases, which, in the long run, could undermine the sustainability of private healthcare and indirectly intensify the pressure on the public healthcare system.”",

    "title": "Baltimore's historic Pimlico Race Course will begin demolition after the Preakness",
    "article_text": "While Baltimore’s Historic Pimlico Race Course is being prepared for the 150th running of thePreakness Stakes— which you can watch on NBC orPeacockbeginning at 2 p.m. ET on Saturday, with the main event slated for 6:50 p.m. ET — demolition of the venue will begin soon after the last horses leave the oval this weekend. Here is everything you need to know about Pimlico Race Course, its history, why it’s being demolished, the plans for renovation and much more. Located in Baltimore, Maryland, Pimlico Race Course has traditionally hosted the “middle jewel” of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes. Pimlico, nicknamed “Old Hilltop,” officially opened its doors on October 25, 1870 and first hosted the Preakness Stakes in 1873. In 1890, the Stakes moved from Maryland to a track in New York. The race didn’t run from 1891 to 1893, and then moved to a different track in New York until 1908. In 1909, the race returned to Pimlico and has been hosted at the iconic venue ever since. Pimlico is the second oldest racetrack in the country, behind Saratoga, which debuted in upstate New York in 1864. Though the track was renovated in the 1950s, the age of Baltimore’s Historic Pimlico Race Course has been a concern for decades. Back in 2019, nearly 7,000 grandstand seats were closed over safety concerns. Renovation plans were discussed but never carried out. The demolition of the renowned Pimlico Race Course marks the end of an era, but the revitalization of the structure marks the beginning of anewera. On May 7, the state of Maryland released design concepts for a new Pimlico Race Course, which is set to debut in 2027. Demolition is expected to begin in June ahead of a $400 million reconstruction funded by state bonds. The 2026 Preakness Stakes will relocate to Laurel Park, a track that sits about 20 miles south of Pimlico. The 2027 Preakness Stakes are expected to return to Baltimore’s revitalized facility. Then, once Pimlico is back up and running, Laurel Park will close for its own redevelopment. As part of the multi-year project, and in addition to the new and improved Pimlico, a new hotel, event space, and state-of-the-art Thoroughbred training center will be built at Shamrock Farm in Woodbine, Maryland, which is located approximately 20 miles west of Pimlico. The site design features a strong new identity with inspiration from popular Baltimore landmarks like the Rawlings Conservatory in Druid Hill Park and the original Pimlico Clubhouse. The state will direct at least $110 million to the new training facility, which will offer 328 pastoral acres to more than 800 boarded horses, housing for backstretch workers and a training track with dimensions identical to Pimlico.The Maryland Stadium Authority, in partnership with The Maryland Jockey Club and the Park Heights community, will oversee the construction of the new race course, as well as the additional amenities. The decision to revitalize Pimlico is an essential step forward to promoting the future of Thoroughbred racing in Maryland, as well as growing local and statewide economies. The new facility will support approximately 500 jobs and over 100 racing days annually. Pimlico currently hosts around 15 racing days per year. “Today we take another step toward a new, reimagined Pimlico,” said Maryland Governor Wes Moore (Citybiz, May 12, 2025). “Together, we will continue to drive economic growth in Park Heights, throughout Baltimore, and across the entire state.” In April, it was announced that the Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority, which was created in 2023 to assist in managing Pimlico’s transition from private to public ownership, will be dissolved as soon as July 2025. The Maryland Jockey Club will operate under the Maryland Economic Development Corporation (MEDCO). “We are excited to deliver a new, modern Pimlico for racing fans and the Park Heights community,” said Maryland Stadium Authority Chairman Craig Thompson. “This work is bigger than a racetrack, as historic and important as it is. This is about bringing hundreds of millions of dollars in state investment to Park Heights and working in partnership with MEDCO and the local community to realize a shared vision for the future.” Despite 1/ST (formerly known as The Stronach Group) transferring operations of Pimlico to the state of Maryland on January 1, 2025, the company is still spearheading the Preakness this year and next year. For 2027 and beyond, Maryland will adopt control over the Stakes. The state will essentially license the event name from 1/ST as part of a long-term agreement. “It was highly unlikely that a private operator would want to come in because ‘What’s the upside for a private operator?’ They’re in the business of making a profit,” said the Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association chairman and CEO Alan Foreman (Blood Horse, March 2024). “[The tracks] don’t have gaming in Maryland — they get a small piece of gaming revenue for capital improvement purposes. And there’s really no upside for an operator other than they covet the Preakness.” It’s important to note that there are other races held at Pimlico besides the Preakness Stakes. With that being said, the owner of the track record at Pimlico for 1 3/16 mile distance is Farma Way, with a time of 1:52 2/5 in the 1991 Pimlico Special. In 1973, Secretariat secured the Preakness record at 1 3/16 miles, with a time of 1:53 2/5. Note:The Preakness has been staged at seven different distances since its debut in 1873. From 1925 to present day, the distance run is set at 1 3/16 miles. Sign upto watch all of our live sports and events, including horse racing. What devices does Peacock support?

    "title": "You cannot beat the final boss of No Rest for the Wicked's latest saga",
    "article_text": "The founder of Moon Studios has become the action RPG's worst enemy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A year out from its initial early access launch, I can finally see what Moon Studios wants to make withNo Rest for the Wicked. It's big in scope and scale, mashing conventions and mechanics of several genres into one world folded in on itself like its own intricately layered levels. And it invites much comparison: to Dark Souls and Diablo, namely. And also fighting games.Monster Hunter Wilds. Even Animal Crossing. It's an RPG with the action elements of an open world adventure likeElden Ringbut an isometric perspective and emphasis on random loot. It's a game about resource gathering and managing inventories and maybe farming, eventually. It's a game about throwing yourself at the boss for days at a time as the shadows drift with the sun into night and back to day again. Following the newBreach update, it's more a game about making big combos and managing poise and stamina and focus, almost like Sekiro. Not all the changes in the update have gone over well with fans, and negative reviews on Steam have prompted the game's developers to speak out against the public criticism. In doing so, they havemanufactured a controversythat implicates journalists, an imagined leftist coalition, and, of course, the usual minority scapegoats we are all tired of hearing about in every conversation. This has made finishing The Breach—and writing about it—an unwinnable proposition. Which is all a shame, because No Rest for the Wicked has charmed me over the past year with its relentless focus on nuanced animation, a prime example being the way my sorcerer holds her staff out in front of her chest to balance when crossing a narrow beam over the gap. Every weapon has its own pose for such occasions, just as each reveals unique combos with bespoke flourishes to bring life to this stormy outpost of a great, shining kingdom on the mainland, a heart of darkness called Sacra. Something is rotten on the island of Sacra. Survival, rebellion, inquisition, and pilgrimage collide in this world of sword and sorcery with vistas pulled fromFriedrich’s canvas, ruins from Giger's airbrush, and monsters from Bosch's hellscapes. Its epic dark fantasy quests would be at home in Game of Thrones, but the art direction often reminds me of Princess Mononoke: The breeze through the painted grass, flowers swaying so gently before the screen—the whole world—erupts in violence and bloodshed. In a new questline, I travel south of Sacrament, a day’s journey to the massacre at Hunters Vale. I follow the river to the dell, haunted by the cries that echo across the lowland meadows.Save me! Please! Help me! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And then I see her. The Lost Huntress: the corpse of a girl reaching clit-like from the gaping, ribbed mouth of a wolfish beast. My halberd rings with each swing. She wails with regret, trapped by the monster she could not stop in life or death. Then the flame at the end of my polearm catches matted fur and a warm blaze brings light to dark. Each quest in The Breach becomes a memorable journey thanks to the music, the lighting, the sound design, the environmental exploration. But by the time I could play and write about the update, another boss was staring me down. Moon Studios earned the status of indie darling with its Xbox exclusive Ori and the Blind Forest and cemented itself with its sequel. Then in a 2022 GamesBeat report, former employees accused studio co-founders Thomas Mahler and Gennadiy Korol of creating an“oppressive” workplace. With a pivot to a dark fantasy game unlike Ori in almost every way, the studio perhaps could've left some of the baggage behind and declared reinvention, but Mahler could not. Mahler has implied in tweets that the fallout from the report wascancel cultureandcontinues to echoGamerGate talking points aboutethics in journalismto this day, all of which makes it hard to take his most recent posts as anything but revisionist history. Last weekend, Mahler claimed on the game's public Discord serverthat Moon was in danger of closingdue to the growing number of negative reviews on No Rest for the Wicked's Steam page. He thenpicked a fightwith a journalist who wrote about his posts whilewalking backthe suggestion that Moon was in a financial crisis, suggested the negative reviews were the result of an organized backlash by an imagined group of leftists. He hassince claimedthat he used incorrect wording in his initial post because English is not his first language, while also saying he can \"sometimes be impulsive and emotional.\" And yet he continues to post. Hecontinues to postabout how unfair the game's negative reviews on Steam are to the studio. Hecompared himselfto Italian philosopherGiordano Bruno, who was burned at the stake by the Catholic church's inquisition for challenging geocentric doctrine. Considering therecent conservative responseto an American pope that has tepidly rejected the Trump regime's anti-immigrant policies, the invocation feels loaded. (In before the claim I am reading too much into it and Mahler is Austrian anyways.) After following him for a few years, I don't think Mahler is himself a reactionary, but a populist. He wants to be \"cancelled\" for the cultural clout it has brought figures he relates himself to. But the same rhetoric he has used to court gamers has attracted a vitriolic following seeking adrenaline and titillation. So, yes, an unfun balance change in an early access title will lead to more negative reviews.We've seen this blowback before. Mahler has made himself the final boss of No Rest for the Wicked, turning a compelling ARPG that I want to play more of into an unwinnable game for us both. I can only assume after an offhand comment about trans people in his screed that Mahler will dismiss whatever I have to say; perhaps he will even suggest I am organizing my own campaign to undermine the studio. But for him, and for Moon, there are few bridges left to burn, let alone cross, and he has surrounded himself with torch bearers. Autumn Wright is a critic of games and animation.
