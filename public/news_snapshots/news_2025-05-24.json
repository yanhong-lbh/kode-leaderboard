    "title": "Rubio warns court order blocking deportations to South Sudan causes 'irreparable harm' to foreign policy",
    "article_text": "Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss President Donald Trump’s spending bill and a judge’s decision to block the deportation of several criminal migrants to South Sudan. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that a federalcourt orderrequiring the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees on a flight meant for South Sudan will cause \"significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy.\" The Trump administration late Friday filed two court documents after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of Massachusetts saidthe deportationflight violated his previous April injunction that allows deportees time to challenge an order to be sent to a country other than their own. \"This Department of Justice believes that this situation urgently requires judicial intervention to restore President Trump’s full Article II authority to conduct foreign policy,\" a U.S. Department of Justice official told Fox News Digital. Rubio noted the order has already complicated U.S. diplomacy with Libya, South Sudan and Djibouti and presents a serious threat to the president’s Article II authority to conduct foreign policy. FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO TRACK DEPORTED IMMIGRANTS TO SOUTH SUDAN The Trump administration late Friday filed two court documents after a judge said a deportation flight violated his previous injunction that allows deportees time to challenge an order to be sent to a country other than their own.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Rubio said in his filing that the court’s orders had \"already interfered with quiet diplomatic efforts and exacerbated internal political and security divisions\" in Libya. The order also threatens to \"derail efforts to quietly rebuild a productive working relationship with Juba,\" the capital of South Sudan, he said. Rubio said before the court’s intervention that the South Sudan government had refused to accept a South Sudanese national but had since \"taken steps to work more cooperatively with the U.S. government.\" DHS EXPOSES CRIMES BY MIGRANTS DEPORTED TO SOUTH SUDAN AS JUDGE THREATENS TO ORDER THEIR RETURN Thirdly, Rubio said the order \"causes harm\" in Djibouti, which is \"strategically located in the Horn of Africa\" with the only U.S. military base on the African continent. The deportees are being temporarily held at a U.S. Naval base in Djibouti. A deportation flight headed for Guatemala in January.(AP Photo/Christian Chavez, File) In the second filing, the administration asked the court to \"reconsider\" its order and \"highly burdensome requirements.\" \"Because of this Court’s Orders, [the U.S. government is] currently detaining dangerous criminals in a sensitive location without clear knowledge of when, how, or where this Court will tolerate their release,\" the filing said. JUDICIAL HALT OF DEPORTATION FLIGHTS PUTS US FOREIGN POLICY AT RISK, CAREER STATE DEPT OFFICIAL CLAIMS \"This development has put impermissible, burdensome constraints on the President’s ability to carry out his Article II powers, including his powers to command the military, manage relations with foreign nations, and execute our nation’s immigration authorities.\" The deportees \"enjoyed the benefit of full process under the laws of the United States and were lawfully removed from the country,\" the filing claimed, calling for a stay if not a reconsideration of the order. \"These criminal aliens needed only state that they had a fear of removal to South Sudan to receive the other procedures required by the Court’s April 18, 2025 injunction,\" the administration wrote. \"The aliens did not do so. Therefore, DHS attempted to remove these aliens — who have committed the most reprehensible violations of our nation’s laws — to a place where they no longer pose a threat to the United States.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that a court order requiring the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees on a flight meant for South Sudan will cause \"significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy.\"(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) The flight left from Texas earlier this week with eight migrants from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico and South Sudan. Murphy issued the ruling Tuesday night after lawyers for the immigrants from Myanmar and Vietnam accused the Trump administration of illegally deporting their clients to third-party countries. They argue there is a court order blocking such removals. Murphy's ruling said the government must \"maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country, to ensure the practical feasibility of return if the Court finds that such removals were unlawful.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rubio announcedin April that the U.S. would revoke visas held by South Sudanese passport holders and no others would be issued, attributing the change to \"the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner,\" according to a statement posted on X at the time. The U.S. has third-party deportation agreements with a handful of countries, the most prominent being El Salvador, which has accepted hundreds of Venezuelan deportees from the Trump administration.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Nearly a third of the 260 miners stuck underground following an accident at a Sibanye-Stillwater SSWJ.J gold minein South Africawere brought to the surface on Friday, the company said, as a senior union official confirmed there had been no injuries. The miners were stuck underground after the hoist system used to access a shaft at the Kloof gold mine - one of Sibanye's deepest, situated about 37 mileswest of Johannesburg- was damaged in an accident on Thursday. WHITE HOUSE SHUTS DOWN REPORTER'S 'RIDICULOUS' CHALLENGE OF WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN FARMER DEATHS Sibanye said 79 of the employees had been brought to the surface by 1:30 p.m. local time in the first phase of an operation to extract the miners. \"The remaining 181 employees ... have been provided with food and will be hoisted to surface as soon as safety to hoist is confirmed,\" Sibanye said in a statement. A company spokesperson told Reuters late Friday afternoon that the process was expected to be completed \"soon.\" Mamodise Mokone, whose husband is among the miners still trapped underground, reacts as she speaks to the media at the Sibanye Stillwater mine, in Westonaria, Johannesburg, South Africa, May 23, 2025.(Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko) \"Fortunately there were no fatalities or injuries,\" National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) Health and Safety Chairperson Duncan Luvuno told journalists at the site. \"But for ... 24 hours people were not eating or drinking anything. This is not adequate. Some have chronic diseases.\" Journalists were barred by security guards from getting near to the mine shaft, but a Reuters reporter saw some of the miners, looking tired but in good health, walk to the perimeter of the company grounds and board buses. Relatives of those still in the mine, however, expressed shock and worry that their loved ones remained underground. \"I haven't slept a wink,\" said Mamodise Mokone, whose husband was among the miners. \"I just want to tell the management or whoever is in charge: I just want my husband out alive.\" Sibanye earlier said all the workers were safe after what it called a \"shaft incident\" in the Kloof 7 shaft and were gathered at an assembly point as efforts were launched to bring them out of the mine. Johannesburg-based Sibanye is among only a few South African miners squeezing profits from some of the world's deepest and costliest gold mines. Sibanye is digging for gold at depths of roughly two miles at the Kloof 7 shaft. The Kloof mine, which accounts for 14% of Sibanye's total gold output, also operates two other shafts.

    "title": "New mom marathoner says Olympian helped spark threats and hate against her for opposing trans inclusion",
    "article_text": "Runner and new mother Natalie Daniels says she was hit with hate and threats after trans Olympian Nikki Hiltz called her out on social media for speaking out against trans athletes in women's sports. On April 19, U.S. Olympic middle distance runner Nikki Hiltz posteda TikTok videothat included footage of an interview with women's marathon runner Natalie Daniels. The post came just two days before Daniels was set to compete in the Boston Marathon, and just six months after she gave birth to her first child. Hiltz's TikTok opened with a clip of Daniels sharing how she considered not competing in the marathon because biologically male trans athletes would be competing in the women's field. The clip was originally froma promotional interviewwith the activist sportswear brand XX-XY Athletics. In the same post on the popular social media platform, Hiltz encouraged Daniels to drop out because of her concerns about trans inclusion, while disagreeing with the new mother's stance against it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Nikki Hiltz reacts after winning the women's 1,500m in a meet-record 3:55.33 during the US Olympic Team Trials at Hayward Field, in Eugene, Ore., June 30, 2024.(Kirby Lee-USA Today Sports) For Hiltz, the post was in line with the athlete's regular TikTok content, which often shows the Olympian promoting pro-transgender beliefs and arguing againstopposition to trans inclusionin sports. Hiltz is a biologically female athlete who competes in the women's category, while identifying as transgender and non-binary. Soon after Hiltz's TikTok post went live, the reaction from it was aimed at Daniels, who said many of Hiltz's followers and fans began to send her startling messages. \"I didn't think there would be this rabid cruelty,\" Daniels told Fox News Digital of the response she received from the interview. \"People were trying to find us when we were in Boston.\" Daniels alleges one person told her, \"'I live in Boston, and if I see you on the street, I’m going to hunt you down.'\" CALIFORNIA GIRLS' TRACK ATHLETE OPENS UP ON LOSING 1ST-PLACE TITLE TO TRANS COMPETITOR Marathon runner Natalie Daniels runs during the Boston Marathon on April 21, 2025.(Courtesy of Natalie Daniels) The new mother said the worst alleged comment she saw was from a person who said, \"'I hope that your son comes out as trans and never speaks to you again.'\" Her son was only six months old at the time. Daniels said she ultimately takes responsibility for the messages directed towards her and her family. Still, she cited Hiltz's TikTok for contributing to the backlash. \"[Hiltz] has freedom of speech also. So [Hiltz's] opinion is just as valid to be shared as mine is,\" Daniels said. \"I think [Hiltz] encouraged a pile-on that got really out of hand, probably, I think, very quickly … I think the fact that [Hiltz] didn't do anything about it is unsurprising. \"I think I'm ultimately responsible for what I said. And I know that what I said was said out of love and a desire to continue supporting and encouraging women and women's sports.\" Still, it didn't make the experience any easier for Daniels. \"The very hateful messages were upsetting. There were a few times where I would just be, I don't want to cry, but a few times I would just start crying,\" she said. \"And I would tell my husband, ‘I’m sorry, it's just like a lot, it's a lot to deal with, to have people being like ‘You’re this evil hateful bigot,' or 'You're stupid.'\" Runners cross the starting line of the 125th Boston Marathon, in Hopkinton, Mass.(AP Photo/Mary Schwalm, File) \"Instead of having this very rational engagement, they went straight to threats and violence.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Hiltz's talent agency, Hawi Management, for a response. When the day of the Boston Marathon came, April 21, Daniels was prepared for potential attacks and heckling against her on the course after getting messages warning her of it, she alleges. But instead, she only ever heard roaring chants of support, she claims. She even had one of her best finishes, reaching the finish line in 2:50:04 in 110th place. The love continued on social media, as she saw an outpouring of praise and respect that eventually overshadowed the support she was getting for standing up for women's sports and appearing in the XX-XY Athletics interview to begin with. For Daniels, it helped validate a decision that she made, partially due to the experience of becoming a new mother. Daniels said that during her pregnancy, a trip to an obstetrician included a survey that assumed the only reason she was pregnant was due to failed birth control, and not her own intentions. \"In society, I just feel like there is this reductive definition of what it means to be a woman, and what it means to be a woman is basically one thing, and it's access to abortion. And in our culture, that just kinda seems like that's all any of us are supposed to care about,\" Daniels, a native of Virginia, said. She added that the survey, and the growing cultural stigmatization of pregnancy, fed right into her passion for protecting female athletes from trans inclusion as well. \"I know those things may be different things, but it all ties into this dehumanization of women. To me it feels like in this culture, in this political climate, womanhood is this incredibly nebulous, undefinable thing,\" she added. The decision earned Daniels praise and support during the marathon and online but not from her running club, Light Horse Track Club in Washington, D.C., which she alleges was more aligned with Hiltz than her. Daniels said she was confronted by the decision to appear in the XX-XY Athletics interview by the club's leadership. Runners Natalie Daniels, left, and Nikki Hiltz.(Courtesy of Natalie Daniels/Getty Images) Daniels said she offered to make a statement clarifying that her stance wasn't meant to attack trans people for their identities, but to stand up for women like herself. But that wasn't going to be enough, she said. She alleges they offered to let her continue running for the club if she would issue an apology and publicly recognize the ability for a biological male to become a woman, which she refused to do. Daniels alleges that she was told by the club that in order to appease its directors, she had to share a statement on social media that read: \"'I now understand that a person can take hormones and surgery, and they can become a woman.'\" \"I was like, ‘I am not going to do that. I cannot do that…’ It goes completely against my Christian values,\" she said. \"It goes completely against what I know about how God works.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Daniels said she then found out about her removal from the team via a text message and email from the board while she was sitting on her patio. So now, she is starting her own running club with XX-XY Athletics and founder Jennifer Sey. And while she is still adjusting to the regular online hate, and even the occasional heckle from spectators at competitions, Daniels said she is looking forward to raising her family and embracing her new role in the movement to keep trans athletes out of women's sports.

Caitlin Clark threw up her arms, yelledat WNBAreferees and punched the air in frustration after a controversial no-call cost her team a chance to knock off the defending champions Saturday. In the final seconds of the Indiana Fever's 90-88 loss to the reigning champion New York Liberty, Clark took the ball with a chance to tie or win the game.

But the referees did not blow the whistle, and the game ended there.

    "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: Trump and Johnson defy critics with passage of 'One Big Beautiful Bill'",
    "article_text": "House Speaker Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., details Republicans' hurdles to federal spending and his job tackling reconciliation  in a 'modern era' on 'Sunday Night in America.' They did it again. After a 72-hour marathon of wrangling votes to keep the GOP caucus in line, Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump worked together topass the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" It’s a major, historic hurdle that will be the defining legislative product of President Trump’s second term. From the outset, the political class in Washington scoffed and mocked Johnson’s commitment todeliver the bill by Memorial Day weekend. Almost daily, the beltway media declared the timeframe unworkable – and Speaker Johnson’s coalition too fragile – to meet such an ambitious deadline. MIKE JOHNSON, PRESIDENT TRUMP GET ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE Certainly, past efforts to advance marquee legislation like this have not moved this quickly so early in a presidency. Former President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act didn’t clear Congress until deep into his second year. The Affordable Care Act was signed 14 months into President Obama’s term. Even the 2017 Trump tax cuts came together in late December. But President Trump and Speaker Johnson are a formidable team. More than a year ago, Speaker Johnson was confident that Trump would return to the White House and Republicans would retake control of Congress. So, Johnson started planning. He was wisely preparing for unified government to unlock the reconciliation process – a budgetary maneuver that allows major fiscal legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority vote. President Donald Trump and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., talk with reporters after a House Republican Conference meeting on the budget reconciliation bill in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, May 20, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Johnson’s planning paid off big time. He moved swiftly to stand up working groups and frontload the legislative process more than six months before the election. This allowed him and House Republicans to hit the ground running at the onset of the 119th Congress. Thursday’s successful vote was a testament to Johnson’s foresight and his fortitude. Of course, President Trump’s involvement was critical for ultimate success. The president made repeated overtures to ideological hardliners and centrist holdouts. Blue state moderates pushed to secure a deal onstate and local tax deductions(SALT) among other things, while the House Freedom Caucus sought assurances on deficit reductions. President Trump hosted multiple, hours-long meetings at the White House. And in the sprint to the finish line, the President made a rare trip to Capitol Hill ahead of the vote. This was a gesture of goodwill to signal his support, and of course, to hold the fence-sitters' feet to the fire. All that was critical to the bill’s passage. President Trump and Speaker Johnson managed to keep this historically small and unruly GOP conference on track. They deftly managed conflicting concerns from within the party. The saber-rattling lasted up to the final hours. In the end, Trump and Johnson never blinked. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks at a press conference with other members of House Republican leadership in Washington, DC on May 6, 2025.( Nathan Posner/Anadolu via Getty Images) Johnson is, in many ways, the ideal complement to Trump’s tough approach to dealmaking. President Trump thrives on confrontation, and Johnson is methodical and reflective. The affable, young Speaker is thoughtful and pensive. He genuinely cares for and is interested in the concerns of his colleagues. These traits are rooted in his deep Christian faith. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION They’re the exact traits that have earned him a reservoir of goodwill across the GOP conference that many of his predecessors never enjoyed. This helps him wield the gavel under one of the slimmest majorities in American history. As Rep. Richard Hudson put it after the vote: \"He’s different than any speaker I have worked with. I knew Boehner. I knew Paul Ryan. There is genuineness… There is a humbleness. It just comes through.\" This goodwill has translated into a string of legislative victories. Under Speaker Johnson’s leadership, House Republicans have logged win after win on key pieces of legislation -- from the National Security Supplemental ,to successive government funding bills, to the high-stakes House Budget resolution that set the stage for the Big Beautiful Bill. In more than 28 non-party-line votes in the House, he’s suffered only three defections. This is a truly remarkable feat in today’s House GOP. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has dominated the national political scene for over a decade. Johnson is – and will continue to be – the President’s strongest ally in Congress. Together, they are America’s most formidable team. Republicans still have a lot of work to do to get the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" signed into law. The Senate will no doubt further test Johnson’s speakership. But this week proves Johnson is the man for the moment. This week proved he is one of the most effective speakers in American history.

    "article_text": "Dr. Paul Saphier, M.D., a New Jersey neurosurgeon, shared in a video posted to X what he's eating for breakfast to maximize the brain health benefits. Following his diagnosis of abrain condition, singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts. The five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up inside or around the brain. \"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,\" the announcement on Joel’s website said. BILLY JOEL CANCELS ALL CONCERTS DUE TO BRAIN DISORDER DIAGNOSIS \"Under his doctor’s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\" Hydrocephalus is a general term describing the buildup of excess fluid in the brain. Billy Joel performs at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 19, 2023, in New York City. Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts.(Getty Images) \"The fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, is constantly produced in fluid-filled spaces in the center of the brain called ventricles,\" Matthew Potts, M.D., a Northwestern Medicine neurosurgeon, told Fox News Digital. (He is not involved in Joel's care.) \"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of thebrain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\" Hydrocephalus can happen for a variety of reasons, including infection, trauma to the brain or bleeding within the brain, the doctor said. \"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\" Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen inolder people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain. Despite the fact that pressure remains normal, NPH can impact brain function, particularly the areas of thinking, memory, movement and focus, according to Cleveland Clinic. The three main effects of NPH are gait issues, urinary incontinence and cognitive difficulties. Collectively, these symptoms are known as \"Hakim’s triad.\" The cognitive problems can includememory loss, slow thinking and difficulty, according to Mia Kazanjian, M.D., a board-certified radiologist in private practice based in Connecticut. The five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside or around the brain.(Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) \"This can negatively impact someone’s career and personal life, limiting the ability to do activities of daily living like eating, bathing and dressing,\" Kazanjian told Fox News Digital. \"This can also lead to emotional changes,like depression.\" Urinary incontinence means loss of bladder control, which can cause discomfort, anxiety and embarrassment, according to the doctor. \"This can predispose someone to bladder infection andskin irritation,\" she cautioned. MINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN \"If someone has to get up in the middle of the night due to this, he or she is more likely to fall. Furthermore, it can lead someone to isolate socially, which can lead to feelings of loneliness.\" Gait impairment means the person’s steps are unsteady, there is loss of balance, and the feet can stick to the ground, shuffle or freeze, Kazanjian said. \"The danger is that someone can fall and sustain trauma with a significant injury,\" she said. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen in older people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.(iStock) The condition can often be mistaken for dementia, but some cases of NPHcan be treatedand reversed. The only known risk factor for NPH is age, Cleveland Clinic noted, with the average age of onset around 70. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other factors, such as race, gender or ethnicity, do not appear to impact the chances of the condition occurring. Approximately 0.2% of people between 70 and 80 will develop NPH, and it affects around 5.9% of those over 80, the above source stated. The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).(iStock) Only some 0.003% of people under 65 will get the condition. \"About 30% of people with NPH also have Alzheimer’s disease or a similar degenerative brain disease,\" Cleveland Clinic states. The condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans). The most common treatment for NPH is asurgical procedurecalled \"shunting,\" in which a device with two tubes, called a shunt, is implanted to regulate the amount of fluid in the brain. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"One end is placed into a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid, usually in the ventricle in the brain or a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine below the spinal cord,\" Potts told Fox News Digital. \"The other end goes somewhere else in the body that can reabsorb the fluid, usually in the abdomen.\" The only known risk factor for NPH is age, with the average age of onset around 70. \"Shunts are more complex than just a tube — there is often a valve that regulates how much fluid can flow through it.\" Some newer shunts can be programmed to change the rate of fluid flow from outside the body, Potts added. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Symptoms typically improve within hours or days of the shunt being implanted. The surgery itself usually entails days or weeks of recovery. Experts emphasized thattimely treatmentis essential to prevent severe or permanent damage to the brain from the pressure caused by the excess fluid.

Officials released bodycam footage showing the chaotic moments leading up to a deadly officer-involved shooting in Fairfax, Virginia, in April. In a press release accompanying the footage, theFairfax County Police Department(FCPD) called the incident an \"attempted murder.\" On April 23, an officer pulled over 36-year-old Jamal Wali for speeding. Wali also had an expired safety inspection sticker. When he was pulled over, Wali slammed on the brakes, something the officer who initially approached Wali’s vehicle noted. Wali then informed the officer he was armed and asked why he was being pulled over. From there, the situation took a chaotic turn as a clearly distressed Wali began shouting, cursing, refusing to give his name and saying he had no driver’s license or registration for the vehicle. Footage from a camera in Jamal Wali's vehicle shows chaotic moments before a traffic stop turned deadly.(Fairfax County Police Department/YouTube) CALIFORNIA OFFICER'S GUN STOLEN BY HALF-NAKED SUSPECT WHO WAS LATER SHOT DEAD BY ANOTHER OFFICER: BODYCAM As the officer tried to deescalate the situation, Wali launched into profanity-laced complaints about how he had been treated in the country and said he came to the U.S. after serving as a translator for American forcesin Afghanistan. \"I should have served with f---ing Taliban,\" Wali yelled at the officer. Wali eventually took out a GoPro-like camera and began recording thetraffic stop. Police later obtained this footage and included it in the bodycam video released to the public Friday. Two other FCPD officers arrived to assist the officer who initiated the traffic stop, with one standing on the driver’s side and the other on the passenger’s side. Wali eventually reached for his weapon and fired at the two officers on the driver’s side.

Satellite imagery captured what remained of a mangled 5,000-tonNorth Koreannaval destroyer damaged during its launch ceremony this week, leaving the country's dictator distraught. A photo captured by Maxar Technologies of the northeastern port of Chongjin, shows the ship apparently twisted and lying on its side, partly lodged on a launch slip and partly submerged in water.

State media also reported on Kim's fury.

The dictator, known for his brutality as much as his secrecy, ominously warned that during that meeting, mistakes caused by the \"irresponsibility of the relevant officials\" would be investigated. Under Kim's rule, North Korea has been focused on building an arsenal of military weapons in what it regards as a response to western aggression.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa hold a meeting at the White House. PresidentDonald Trumpspoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, hosted the president of South Africa at the White House and threatened more stringent tariffs against the European Union this week. During South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Oval Office visit on Wednesday, Trumpgot into a testy exchangewith the South African leader about the treatment of White farmers there. Specifically, Trump aired a video that showed white crosses that Trump said were approximately 1,000 burial sites of White Afrikaner South African farmers. Trump has repeatedly asserted these farmers are being killed and pushed off of their land.

These are burial sites right here. Burial sites — over a thousand — of White farmers. And those cars are lined up to pay love on a Sunday morning. Each one of those white things you see is a cross. And there is approximately a thousand of them,\" Trump said. \"They're all White farmers. The family of White farmers. And those cars aren't driving, they are stopped there to pay respects to their family member who was killed. And it's a terrible sight. I've never seen anything like it. On both sides of the road, you have crosses. Those people are all killed.\" \"Have they told you where that is, Mr. President?\" Ramaphosa said. \"I'd like to know where that is. Because this I've never seen.\" \"I mean, it’s in South Africa, that’s where,\" Trump said. \"We need to find out,\" Ramaphosa said. The White House defended showing the clip and said that the video was \"substantiated,\" following reports that emerged after the encounter that said the crosses were from a memorial demonstration following the murder of a White farming couple, not actual burial sites. Here’s what also happened this week: Trump and Putin spoke over the phone on Monday to advance peace negotiations ending the war between Moscow and Kyiv. The call occurred just days after Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey to conduct their first peace talks since 2022. After the call, Trump said both countries would move toward a ceasefire and push discussions to end the war. But, Trump indicated that the U.S. would let Moscow and Kyiv take the lead on negotiations after his call with Putin. \"The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know the details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of,\" Trump said in a Monday post on Truth Social.

This was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation.\" Trump expressed similar sentiments on Wednesday when Ramaphosa visited and stated: \"It's not our people, it's not our soldiers… it's Ukraine and it's Russia.\" The White House condemned the fatal attack against two Israeli Embassy employees in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, labeling that incident an act of antisemitism. A gunman opened fire and killed Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim as they were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. The two were planning to get engaged next week in Jerusalem, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a press briefing. Authorities arrested a pro-Palestinian man identified as 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago in connection with the attack, according to officials. In response, Trump and other leaders of his administration saidattacks like these must stopand said that those responsible will face justice.

Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!\" Leavitt later told reporters she’d spoken with Attorney GeneralPam Bondiand that those who conducted the attack would face prosecution. \"The evil of antisemitism must be eradicated from our society,\" Leavitt told reporters on Thursday. \"I spoke to the attorney general this morning. The Department of Justice will be prosecuting the perpetrator responsible for this to the fullest extent of the law. Hatred has no place in the United States of America under President Donald Trump.\" Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union on Friday amid ongoing trade negotiations and after locking down a trade deal with the U.K. The deal with the U.K. is the first historic trade negotiation signed following Liberation Day, when Trump announced widespread tariffs for multiple countries on April 2 at a range of rates. The administration later adjusted its initial proposal and announced on April 9 it would immediately impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, while reducing reciprocal tariffs on other countries and the EU to a baseline of 10% for 90 days. TRUMP SIGNALS CHINA ‘VERY MUCH’ INTERESTED IN SECURING TRADE DEAL AHEAD OF SWITZERLAND NEGOTIATIONS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said in an interview with Fox News he hoped the warning would \"light a fire under the EU\" and signaled Trump’s threats stemmed from frustration negotiating with European countries on trade deals.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) \"Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday about the EU. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025,\" he said.

    "article_text": "GOP Attorneys General Brenna Bird, of Iowa, Marty Jackley, of South Dakota, Russell Coleman, of Kentucky, Lynn Fitch, of Mississippi and Arizona Senate President and GOP AG candidate Warren Petersen visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. There’s a provision tucked into PresidentDonald Trump’sbroadly ranging \"big, beautiful bill\" that could see Texas get billions of dollars in funds that it spent on the state’s border security under the Biden administration. The legislation earmarked $12 billion for a grant program allowing states to be reimbursed for costs they incurred trying to stem the flow of illegal immigration during the Democratic administration. The measure was added to the bill hours before the final vote – but Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, the former chairman of the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, told Fox News Digital it was a product of months of negotiation. \"Early on, [Homeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green, R-Tenn., and I were discussing reconciliation going through the Homeland Security Committee. And, you know, there was about $70 billion for the border,\" McCaul said. \"Texas bore the brunt of the federal mission the last four years and deserves to be reimbursed. And so he agreed, had a conversation with Governor Abbott, and he agreed.\" HOUSE GOP TARGETS ANOTHER DEM OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF BLOCKING ICE AMID DELANEY HALL FALLOUT Rep. Michael McCaul spoke with Fox News Digital about the weeks of talks it took to secure billions for states that incurred border-related costs during the Biden administration.(Getty Images) While the text does not name Texas specifically, Fox News Digital was told that the measure’s inclusion was primarily sought by the Lone Star state’s congressional delegation. The state of Texas, Fox News Digital was told, had incurred just over $11 billion in costs from Gov. Greg Abbott’s efforts to keep the border in his state secure. \"The fact of the matter is, when you look at the costs that were borne, Texas had the lion's share of [the burden] carrying out the federal mission when the Biden administration completely failed to deliver on border security,\" McCaul said. \"My state built the border wall and built detention facilities. We bore a lot of costs.\" Operation Lone Star alone cost Texas $11.1 billion, according toThe Texas Tribune. Rather than add it to the initial text of the bill, McCaul said, leaders opted to include it in a \"managers amendment\" that was added on Wednesday night along with several other issues that lawmakers needed more time to negotiate. \"The legislative process, it's something I've gotten to know over my 20 years and how to get things done up here. And I thought, you know, the way we worked it was strategically very smart,\" McCaul said. \"It’s going to the Senate now. And Senator Cornyn is going to take it up, be the champion in the Senate.\" The Texas Republican first met with Abbott and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the matter in early February, Fox News Digital was told. McCaul said Republican Study Committee Chairman August Pfluger also played a key role(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) McCaul said he also worked closely on the push with Republican Study Committee Chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, who told Fox News Digital that \"no state\" carried more financial burden from the border crisis than Texas. \"Texas spent $11.1 billion on border security, including $5.87 billion on personnel costs and $4.75 billion on border wall and barriers. When the federal government failed to secure our border and protect our communities, Texans stepped up,\" Pfluger said. Johnson, for his part, thanked McCaul for his efforts in a public written statement. \"Thanks to Rep. McCaul, states that stepped up to protect Americans in the face of Biden’sborder catastrophewill be reimbursed for doing the work the Biden Administration refused to do,\" the speaker said. \"Had those patriotic governors not taken action and used the resources of their state, the devastation from Biden’s wide-open border would have been significantly worse.\" MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Green said of the need for the measure, \"In the absence of help from the Biden-Harris administration, states were forced to take extraordinary measures to mitigate the crisis and protect their communities by building barrier systems and increasing law enforcement activity.\" And while McCaul and his colleagues’ efforts in the House do not guarantee that Texas will ultimately see those funds, it puts them one step closer to success. The measure is one aspect in a multi-trillion-dollar bill that Republicans are working to pass via the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, reconciliation enables the party in power to pass certain fiscal legislation while completely sidelining the minority – in this case, Democrats. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star cost Texas over $11 billion(AP Photo/LM Otero, File) Trump directed Republicans to use reconciliation to advance his policies on taxes, immigration, energy, defense, and the national debt. The Senate and House must pass identical versions of the bill before it gets to Trump’s desk. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McCaul told Fox News Digital that he was confident the measure would stay in the Senate bill after conversations with the Trump administration on the matter. \"I anticipate it will go forward,\" McCaul said. \"I’m, just proud that we were able to get this done. I'm very proud of what my state did to stop the flow of illegals and dangerous actors coming into the country.\" When reached for comment, Abbott told Fox News Digital, \"This is a national issue that Texas was proud to address, and we are grateful for the allocation that reduces the financial burden that Texas incurred.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

PresidentDonald Trumpthis week enjoyed one of his biggest legislative victories during his second administration. \"THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\" has PASSED the House of Representatives!\" Trump touted in a social media post Thursday. The president's post came soon after theGOP-controlled Housepassed Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package by a razor-thin margin. The Republican-crafted measure is full of Trump's campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. Ahead of the House vote, two surveys released earlier in the week indicated that the president's poll numbers remained underwater. MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE President Donald Trump arrives on the South Lawn of the White House May 22, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/John McDonnell) The president stood at 46% approval and 54% disapproval in a national survey by Marquette Law School. And Trump was at 42% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. And aGallup pollreleased on Friday but conducted before the House vote put Trump's approval at 43% and disapproval at 53%. Many, but not all, of thelatest national surveysplace the president's approval rating in negative territory, with a handful indicating Trump is above water. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning longstanding government policy and aiming to make major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions, with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term. Trump started his second administration with poll numbers in positive territory, but his poll numbers started to slide soon after his late-January inauguration.

Trump stands at 56% approval of border security and 50% approval of immigration in theMarquette Law School poll,which was conducted May 5-15. But Trump's muscular moves on border securityand immigration, which have sparked controversy and legal pushback, don't appear to be helping his overall approval ratings. \"Immigration is declining now as a salient issue,\" said Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll. Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, said \"immigration and especially border security are beginning to lose steam as one of the top three issues facing the country. Republicans still rate them fairly highly, but Democrats and independents, who had kind of joined the chorus in 2024, have moved on and, in particular, moved back to the economy as a focal point.\" President Trump's job performance numbers(Fox News ) Pointing to Trump, Shaw added that \"when you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner.\" Contributing to the slide over the past couple of months in Trump's overall approval ratings was his performance on the economy and, in particular, inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden’sapproval ratings well below water for most of his presidency. Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners, triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession. But the markets have rebounded, thanks in part to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff as Trump tapped the brakes on his controversial tariff implementation. Trump stood at 37% approval on tariffs and 34% on inflation/cost of living in the Marquette Law School poll.

His parents blame their son's suicide on the \"debilitating\" side effects he experienced, but vision experts claim that the procedure is generally \"safe and effective.\" Ryan Kingerski, 26, a young officer with the Penn Hills Police Department, was \"funny and witty — just a genuine person,\" according to Tim and Stefanie Kingerski, who spoke with Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview.(See the video at the top of this article.) COMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS \"Ryan would always try and help in some way, even if it was a stranger,\" Stefanie Kingerski said. \"He was just a very sincere person — he meant what he said and he said what he meant. He was passionate.\" Ryan was very close with his twin brother, Jacob, as they both followed in their father’s footsteps to enterlaw enforcement. He enjoyed playing golf and spending time with his friends and girlfriend, his parents said. Left to right, Ryan, Tim and Jacob Kingerski all served as police officers. Ryan Kingerski took his own life months after getting corrective laser eye surgery, citing debilitating side effects.(Kingerski family) In August 2024, he underwent LASIK eye surgery, a decision that \"changed his life forever,\" according to the Kingerskis. He had worn glasses and contacts since middle school, but he opted for the surgery so that he wouldn’t need them anymore. \"My son was told he would go in, have the procedure and be back to work in a couple of days,\" said Tim Kingerski. \"That never happened.\" GIRL DESPERATE TO SEE THE WORLD BEFORE SHE GOES COMPLETELY BLIND On the way home from the surgery, Ryan said that \"something wasn’t right,\" complaining that his right eye was blurry. \"We told him to give it some time, but it just got worse,\" his father said. As the weeks progressed, the young man suffered from a litany of symptoms, includingsevere headaches, double vision, starbursts, ghosting, halos and other visual disturbances, his parents said. \"It ruined his life. It debilitated him.\" \"It was complication after complication and no improvement,\" Stefanie Kingerski said. \"We made continuous efforts to see different specialists, trying to get different opinions … They just kept saying he needed to heal.\" Ryan’s mother claimed the laser surgery left her son with \"higher-order aberrations,\" which are distortions in the eye that cause visual disturbances. Left to right, Jacob, Stefanie, Tim and Ryan Kingerski are pictured at a golf outing. Ryan Kingerski enjoyed playing golf and spending time with his friends and girlfriend, his parents said.(Kingerski family) One corneal specialist said that Ryan had very thin corneas, which should have ruled out the surgery. \"In a nutshell, he was not a candidate, and they should have caught that and they should have warned him,\" his mother said. ELTON JOHN’S VISION LOSS: HOW AN EYE INFECTION CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS As the effects got worse, Ryan withdrew from the activities he once loved and became very reserved, his parents said. In Jan. 2025, five months after the surgery, he took his own life. \"The note that we got left was: 'LASIK took everything from me. I can't take it anymore,'\" Tim Kingerski said. \"It ruined his life. It debilitated him.\" Ryan Kingerski is pictured with his girlfriend, Maura. \"He was just a very sincere person — he meant what he said and he said what he meant. He was passionate,\" his mother said of her son.(Kingerski family) Ryan’s parents are adamant that his suicide was not the result of preexistingmental health issues. \"If this was a mental health issue and something my son was dealing with before, I wouldn't be talking about this,\" said Tim Kingerski. \"But there's only one reason he's not here.\" The Kingerskis have since connected with other families who have had similar experiences. \"We hear from people constantly who just say, ‘I don't know if I can do this anymore. I don't know if I can take it,’\" Ryan’s father said. BABY'S ADORABLE REACTION TO HIS NEW GLASSES ATTRACTS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION: 'MELTS HEARTS' Ryan's parents now aim to raise awareness and are calling for \"transparency and accountability.\" They have also filed a complaint with the FDA. In an email provided to Fox News Digital, the FDA acknowledged to the Kingerskis that they had learned about the \"horrific laser LASIK incident with Ryan Kingerski.\" They also stated that while hospitals and clinics are required to report associated deaths and injuries, they do not always do so. \"What we're really looking for is accountability from the industry.\" \"The FDA inspector commented he has been following these laser LASIK incidences for several years,\" the email stated. \"He explained there is under-reporting by the Ophthalmic Clinics because they are not submitting the required patient injuries to the FDA.\" (Fox News Digital reached out to the FDA for comment on this statement.) \"What we're really looking for is accountability from the industry,\" said Stefanie Kingerski. \"We want the FDA to step up, start investigating, start looking deeper, start finding out what the long-term effects are.\" The Kingerski family is pictured at the wedding of Ryan's twin brother, Jacob.(Kingerski family) \"The implied consent is just a piece of paper that they give you without explaining,\" Tim Kingerski noted. \"The consent form should say that LASIK can and has causedpermanent damagethat makes you want to kill yourself, because that is a fact.\" He added, \"People are being hurt every day by something that is touted as safe and effective, which we can tell you it's not.\" Left to right, Tim, Stefanie, Ryan and Jacob Kingerski pictured at a golf outing.(Kingerski family) Previous suicides have been reported following laser eye surgeries. In 2018, Jessica Starr, a Michigan meteorologist, took her own life two months after the procedure. She had experienced chronic dry eye andblurry vision, according to local reports. Starr left behind video journals detailing her struggles, saying she had lived \"six weeks of hell.\" In 2016, a Texas college student, Max Cronin, committed suicide at age 27. His obituary states that his death was the result of \"devastating complications from an elective laser eye surgery.\" Dr. James Kelly, M.D., a renowned refractive surgeon specialist and comprehensive ophthalmologist in New York City, said he is not aware of peer-reviewed literature that reports higher rates of suicide in patients who have had LASIK versus the same matched population demographics that have not had the procedure. RARE SPINAL CANCER TUMOR REMOVED THROUGH PATIENT’S EYE AT UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL \"The most common side effect is dry eye, for which there are manyeffective treatments, and the condition often improves in the several months after the procedure,\" he said. \"The most important message to patients who are having eye problems is to seek the care of an experienced professional, and the same is true for anyone experiencing mental health conditions.\" Ryan Kingerski, left, was the best man at his twin brother Jacob’s wedding in June 2024.(Kingerski family) The Refractive Surgery Council, an organization that aims to \"help people make informed decisions about their vision correction choices,\" spoke to Fox News Digital in defense of these procedures. \"An enormous body of scientific data supports LASIK as both safe and effective for those who are good candidates, a fact the FDA has repeatedly affirmed and validated with independent research,\" a spokesperson said.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"While we don’t know the clinical details of Ryan’s case, we do know that the answer to the question of why a person chooses to die by suicide is complex and most often related todepression and emotional trauma,\" said Stephen D. McLeod, M.D., CEO of the AOO. \"As with all surgical procedures, there is a risk [of] side effects and complications from LASIK.\" \"We have no idea what role LASIK itself might have played. Regardless, this is a tragedy, and our hearts go out to Ryan Kingerski’s family.\" The academy noted that while \"most patients\" are good candidates, \"LASIK is not for everyone.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"The academy recommends patients talkwith their ophthalmologistto understand the potential risks and to ensure they are a good candidate,\" McLeod advised. \"An ophthalmologist is the most qualified physician to advise patients on all types of refractive surgery.\" Fox News Digital reached out to LASIK and to the FDA requesting comment.

The left-handed batter drilled a ball into the right-center gap that both center fielder Isaac Humphreys and right fielder Ryan Moerman went after.

As the fielders collided, accessories flew everywhere. It was good news for the Razorbacks, as Kozeal scored quite easily for an inside-the-park homer. Humphreys attempted to get the ball and throw it in, but he could hardly throw the ball in. Moerman, meanwhile, lay on the field for quite some time. Humphreys somehow stayed in the game, but Moerman was taken out. Their injury diagnoses were not immediately known.

A city recently announced the discovery of agilded Christian artifactdating back to the Early Middle Ages. In a statement published on May 12, the City of Leeds in the U.K. said the Saxon-era pendant was uncovered in a local field. It dates back over 1,200 years and was found by a metal detectorist last year. The \"tiny Saxon treasure\" has one broken arm, and the central stone it once held is now missing.

Kat Baxter, a curator of archaeology at Leeds Museums and Galleries, said the cross was likely worn by a high-status member of Saxon society, such as an important church leader or official. \"The cross is beautifully decorated on both sides, which suggests it was designed to hang around the neck with the suspension loop on the missing arm,\" the historian said.

    "article_text": "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with. Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password. The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is. Security researchershave uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to my free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up! Illustration of a hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered byCybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique. Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere. 1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities. Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day. Illustration of a hacker at work.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely ontwo-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all. Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols. HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web.

A single compromised password can trigger a domino effect, exposing multiple accounts across services. Consider using apassword managerto generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here. Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe. 1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):Even if your password is stolen,2FAadds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation.Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernamesand passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins. 2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 3. Keep software updated:Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to dateensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system. 4. Consider a personal data removal service:These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap, and neither isyour privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation.

    "article_text": "Wandercraft's Personal Exoskeleton is about helping people stand tall, connect with others and live life on their own terms. For Caroline Laubach, being a Wandercraft test pilot is about more than just trying outnew technology. It's about reclaiming a sense of freedom and connection that many wheelchair users miss. Laubach, a spinal stroke survivor and full-time wheelchair user, has played a key role in demonstrating the personal AI-powered prototype exoskeleton's development, and her experience highlights just how life-changing this device can be. \"When I'm in the exoskeleton, I feel more free than I do in my daily life,\" said Laubach. \"It gives me the opportunity to walk around and talk to people at eye level. I don't have to look up at people all the time. \"It makes me feel more visible and able to connect with others. One thing I noticed right away, was how inclusive the exoskeleton would be to a wide variety of disabilities. The goal is to have disabled people able to use this exoskeleton to live their daily life out in the world; I can definitely see that happening in the future.\" Laubach's story is at the heart of Wandercraft's mission: to help people move through the world with greater walking independence and upright mobility.

Caroline Laubach walking in the Prototype Personal Exoskeleton at Nvidia GTC 2025.(Wandercraft) Wandercraft's journeybegan with a personal challenge. Nicolas Simon, the company's co-founder, saw his own family members struggle with mobility due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic condition. As a student and robotics enthusiast, Simon wanted to create something that could help his brother and others like him walk again. Alongside Matthieu Masselin and Jean-Louis Constanza, who also had a personal connection to the cause, Simon founded Wandercraft in 2012. AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS Their goal was simple but ambitious: to bringadvanced mobility solutionsto the estimated 80 million people worldwide who rely on wheelchairs. A man using an exoskeleton to walk.(Wandercraft) EXOSKELETON HELPS PARALYZED PEOPLE REGAIN INDEPENDENCE Wandercraft's first exoskeleton, Atalante X, is already making a difference in over 100 clinics andresearch centersworldwide. This device, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved in Europe, helps patients take over a million steps each month as part of their rehabilitation. It has already helped hundreds regain some mobility and independence. But Wandercraft wanted to go further. The new Personal Exoskeleton protoype, now in clinical trials in New York and New Jersey, is designed for daily life, at home, at work, and out in the community. It uses NVIDIA AI to adapt instantly to each user's movements, providing smooth, stable walking on all sorts of surfaces, from sidewalks to carpets. Users control the exoskeleton with a joystick, making it accessible to people with a wide range of abilities. A man using an exoskeleton to walk.(Wandercraft) COULD THESE EXOSKELETON \"POWERED PANTS\" MAKE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES EASIER IN THE FUTURE? A big part of Wandercraft's progress comes from its partnership with Nvidia. The team uses Nvidia Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation tool, to test and improve the exoskeleton in virtual environments before real-world trials. They're also exploring Nvidia's healthcare robotics and edge computing platforms to make the device smarter and more responsive. This technology means the exoskeleton can someday keep up with everyday life, walking at a normal pace, crossing streets, and even handling stairs. As Simon puts it, \"It's essential for the exoskeleton to be fast enough that it can be used in the real world. By integrating NVIDIA AI into the device, we can someday enable users to walk at an average pace, cross the road, and go up and down stairs.\" BIOTECH CEO PREDICTS 'REVOLUTIONARY' STEPS TOWARD CURING CANCER ON HORIZON THANKS TO AI A man using an exoskeleton to walk.(Wandercraft) WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE Wandercraft's commitment to improving lives goes beyond just building exoskeletons.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Tax-free overtime could be midterm magic for GOP",
    "article_text": "President Trump is reiterating calls to remove tax on tips, overtime work and Social Security benefits. Lee Carter from maslansky + partners conducted the focus groups for Fox News Digital. As the GOP’s \"big beautiful bill\" heads to the Senate next month, one provisionlegislators from both partiesshould keep their sights squarely set on is no tax on overtime, because in my travels talking to working Americans, no policy comes up more often. It is not hyperbole to suggest that, if successfully implemented, vastly reducing overtime tax on America’s workers would be the most politically significant measure in the bill, and could easily help Republicans sweep the midterms. TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WINS SUPPORT FROM POLICE FOR OVERTIME ELIMINATION It is very rare, when I’m out talking to people on the road, for person after person to keep mentioning something I never even brought up. A clear example in the last election was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Secretary of Health and Human Services, who I couldn’t get people to shut up about, even when the media wasn’t focused on him. In the end, RFK Jr. played a vital role in putting President Donald Trump over the top. For the past couple of months, the thing I have heard over and over again from workers and employers is how much they desperately want no tax on overtime. People attend a press conference and rally in support of fair taxation near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on April 10, 2025.(Bryan Dozier / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) Regular readers of this column will recall the coal miner in Columbiana, Ohio who told me, \"taxes are killing the working man,\" or Doug and Danny in Jeffersonville, Indiana, a steel cleaning plant owner and his foreman who also weighed in. Doug told me it will \"encourage [younger workers] to give up their time, away from loved ones and produce for customers that we have, that need steel, that they want that we did not produce Monday through Friday and get it done.\" From Ohio, to Texas, to West Virginia, no tax on overtime has created excitement for the people the news media never seem to get around to talking to. A major reason that no tax on overtime has been largely ignored compared to its more popular cousin, no tax on tips, is that almost nobody who produces news has ever held a job that includes traditional overtime, while many likely had tipping jobs in college. This also explains exactly why the overtime provision is a much bigger deal. There are a handful of tipped jobs that one can raise a family on, but most are stepping stones. There are millions of jobs you can raise a family on that involve overtime. Eliminating taxes on overtime is a huge winner, writes David Marcus.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) For the men and women who work these jobs in plants, mines and forges, a reduction in overtime tax is far more meaningful than any stimulus check could be. A stimulus check is like a winning scratch-off lottery ticket. No tax on tips is a raise. You can plan on it, build around it. This brings us around to the midterms. If by the fall of 2026, American workers have been keeping more of their money, not receiving largesse from the state, but keeping more money they worked for, then every GOP candidate will point at every Democrat incumbent in Congress and say, \"they voted against it.\" One of Donald Trump’s political superpowers is to find the issues American voters deeply care about that the media largely ignores. He did it by fighting wokeness, he did it opposing foreign interventionism, he did it by focusing on our kids’ health. I don’t know how he does it. I know how I do it. I spend hours and hours traveling and talking to people. Maybe Trump talks to the working-class people he employs, maybe he just judges based on crowd reactions at rallies, but however he does it, finger meets pulse. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION With no tax on overtime, Trump has done it again. Every Republican who is running for Congress outside of Silicon Valley and the Upper East Side would be wise to lead their campaign with, \"President Trump and I promised no tax on overtime and we delivered.\" There seems to be some surprise that Trump’s poll numbers are recovering after a brief dip occasioned by universal freakouts over his tariff policy. But there is a very good reason for it: On almost every policy the president is doing exactly what he told voters he would do. Once workers start seeing that bump in their weekly check they can start saving for a better vacation, put more money away for their kids, or even buy their girl an engagement ring. These are the riches of the working class. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senate Democrats should tread cautiously as the big beautiful bill lands in the upper chamber. They should decide if they really want to look their constituents in the eye and say, \"You know that raise my opponent’s party and President Trump gave you? I want to take it away.\" No tax on overtime may be Donald Trump’s baby, but come the midterms, it could be a big bundle of joy for the Republican Party.

    "title": "President Trump is making summer vacations great again",
    "article_text": "Former air traffic controller Colin Scoggins unpacks stress on controllers amid chaos at Newark Airport on 'America Reports.' \"I saw in their eyes something I was to see over and over in every part of the nation—a burning desire to go, to move, to get underway…\" —John Steinbeck, \"Travels with Charley: In Search of America\" It was 65 years ago that John Steinbeck loaded up a GMC pickup with a new-fangled camper shell on top and hit the road to reconnect with America. The book that came out of that trip was the bestselling \"Travels with Charley: In Search of America.\" As Steinbeck noted, \"Nearly every American hungers to move.\" And now, America is back on themove again, in part due to theTrump economyand a more hopeful outlook on the future. IS FIRST CLASS FOR EVERYONE? THIS GUY MAY HAVE THE ANSWER Memorial Day travel by Americans could break a 20-year record this year. AAA expects an estimated 45.1 million people to travel at least 50 miles from home between May 22 and May 26. \"We’re projecting an additional one million travelers this holiday weekend compared to 2019, which not only means we’re exceeding pre-pandemic levels but also signals a very busy summer travel season ahead,\" notes Paula Twidale, Senior Vice President of AAA Travel. And in their travels, Americans are celebrating theTrump economy—and their freedom. Lower gas prices are just the start. \"The average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline hovered around $3.13 nationwide, according to AAA, down from $3.59 a gallon on Memorial Day in 2024,\" Fox News reports. Had either the Biden or Harris tickets prevailed last November, those numbers could look quite different. The Biden administration’s war on domestic energy, including the former president’s ham-fisted approach to gas prices, only led to energy prices. And that was the point—the Democratic agenda includes driving up energy prices to force Americans into electric vehicles and into the kind of \"low-carbon\" lifestyle they never seem to adopt themselves. Americans made their feelings clear on the Democrats’ \"expect less\" agenda last November—by returning President Donald Trump to the White House in what amounts to a modern landslide. And it’s not just energy prices. On Tuesday, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April inflation numbers, and the Trump economybeat expectations—delivering the lowest inflation rate since Joe Biden’s first month in office. Leading up to the 2024 election, egg prices gained attention, following an outbreak of avian flu. Prices rose so high that they became a campaign issue. When prices remained high after the election, Democrats sought to blame Trump. Now, however, the price of eggs really is falling. In April, they came down an average of 12.4%, the most since 1984. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION So, more Americans will enjoy an omelet on their summer trip as they celebrate their feelings of being more hopeful about the future, despite the incessant media narrative. In 2024, YouGov.com conducted a poll that showed how the Biden economy was impacting family travel: \"High cost-of-living is the leading dampener on travel plans for nearly three in five Americans (59%) saying it made them cut back. Similar proportions of Americans say they simply can no longer afford travelling (38%) or their circumstances have changed (37%),\" the research group reported. But Americans areback on the roadand their outlook is positive. For his part, Steinbeck knew what the open road meant to Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us,\" he wrote. Americans are getting back on the road—where they know, deep down, they belong.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: The networks adored Trump 'tell all' books, but downplay books with Biden scoops",
    "article_text": "‘MediaBuzz’ host Howard Kurtz discusses the accusations that former White House officials covered up the alleged decline of former President Joe Biden on ‘The Story.’ One easy demonstration of broadcast network bias is their \"news\" coverage of political books, especially what’s called the \"tell-all\" book. They adore Trump \"tell-alls,\" and can’t abide those volumes aboutDemocrats. This bias first emerges at book publishers. Democrats are rarely encouraged to write \"tell-alls\" because it damages the party’s brand. Back in 2018, ABC, CBS, and NBC awarded more than two hours and 20 minutes of breathless coverage to Michael Wolff in one week over his anti-Trumpbook \"Fire and Fury.\" On NBC’s \"Today,\" co-host Savannah Guthrie nudged Wolff on Trump’s mental fitness. \"One of the overarching themes is that, according to your reporting, everyone around the President – senior advisers, family members, every single one of them – questions his intelligence and fitness for office.\" Wolff eagerly underlined it: \"Let me put a marker in the sand here: 100 percent of the people around him.\" BROADCAST BIAS: NETWORKS OOZE WITH SYMPATHY TO ANYONE WHO OPPOSES TRUMP In August of 2018, they broke out the promotion machine again for former \"Apprentice\" star Omarosa Manigault-Newman and her tell-all book \"Unhinged.\" ABC, CBS, and NBC rolled out 93 minutes of network coverage, as the author claimed from her time with Trump outside and inside the White House that he was a \"racist\" who had used the \"N-word.\" NBC gave it the most time, perhaps doing penance for making Trump a national star on \"The Apprentice.\" ABC’s \"Good Morning America\" even hyped Omarosa's claim that Trump wanted to \"start a race war.\" These books came out in Trump’s second year in office. Thenew Biden\"tell-all\" by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson came out months after President Biden left the White House.  When the first previews of the book emerged in The New Yorker and Axios, where we learned Biden didn't recognize actor George Clooney at a 2024 fundraiser and Biden aides pondered putting him in a wheelchair after the election, only NBC offered a short report summarizing the scoops. ABC, CBS, and PBS ignored it. The pattern continued. Before the book came out on Tuesday, only NBC spent more than a minute on the book’s findings on their morning and evening newscasts. ABC and CBS combined didn’t even reach a full minute of coverage. \"PBS News Hour\" was the worst of the bunch. They aired absolutely no discussion of anything revealed in the book (although they did briefly allude to the existence of \"a book.\") Of the Big Three, only CBS aired an interview with the authors. NPR aired interviews starting on Monday, and PBS followed on Thursday. \"CBS Mornings\" host Gayle King raised the obvious question of timing: \"Why didn’t you share it before, as soon as you got it, as opposed to gathering all the information then putting it out in a book that you will undoubtedly profit from?\" Tapper claimed they would havebroken these scoopsif they had found them in real time. But it’s also true that Democrats felt freer after they lost the White House to tentatively (mostly anonymously) acknowledge to these authors they covered up or downplayed Biden’s failings – despite large numbers of Americans saying Biden was too old to serve a second term. Sadly, NBC was among the broadcast TV networks in playing a soundbite of audio from the just-released tapes of special counsel Robert Hur’s questioning of President Biden from October 2023, a sentence of Biden not remembering when he was vice president. (NPR’s \"Fresh Air\" also ran a Hur snippet in their Tapper interview.) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This matches how the networks avoided Hur before he decided not to indict Biden. From February 1 through November 20 in 2023, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) could only muster four minutes and 52 seconds of overall coverage of Hur – combined. Almost all of that time was on ABC.  By contrast, we counted 2,092 minutes of coverage of Trump and alleged Russian collusion from January 20, 2017 through December, 2018. That's a dramatic contrast. While Tapper and Thompson expressed regrets in several interviews about how they were toogentle on Bidenbefore this book and that conservative media were \"right\" to drive this issue during Biden’s presidency, the networks weren’t anything like Megyn Kelly in pressing that point of media spin. They didn’t just engage in neglect of Biden’s decline. They aggressively pushed the White House line that it was fringy MAGA talking points to question Biden’s fitness. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some TV journalists might publicly state \"gee, we need to do better in the future\" after this debacle. Some will use this to enhance the double standard, like they learned to be fierce in questioning President Trump’s health disclosures. But they certainly displayed that during Trump’s first term. After the Tapper-Thompson parade ends, the betting money should be placed on the networks returning to their natural method, repeating theDemocrat messageof the day without seriously questioning it.",

    "title": "Trump unleashes US nuclear renaissance with bold executive orders",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump joins officials in the Oval Office to promote energy security and address a variety of issues. In his famed 1953 \"Atoms for Peace\" speech, President Eisenhower proclaimed that \"the United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future.\" That dream was soon realized, as America built more than one hundred reactors over the next twenty-five years. But today, the promise of nuclear energy and innovation does indeed seem like a dream of the future. Through a series of executive orders signed this week,President Trump is taking actionto usher in an American nuclear renaissance. For the first time in many years, America has a path forward for quickly and safely testing advanced nuclear reactor designs, constructing new nuclear reactors at scale, and building a strong domestic nuclear industrial base. TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS BOLSTERING NUCLEAR INDUSTRY, DOMESTIC URANIUM MINING Our stagnation was not for a lack of ingenuity or desire to innovate among America’s great scientists and technologists. By the end of the 1970s, dozens of nuclear reactors wereplanned or under construction. In the past 30 years, however, onlythree commercial nuclear reactorshave been built, and many more have beenshuttered. We know America can accomplish great feats in nuclear energy, so what happened? President Donald Trump has signed new executive orders that the White House believes will usher in an American nuclear renaissance. (Photo by Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) In the wake of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979,public opinion began to souron nuclear energy, and the effects of a decade of new federal bureaucracies began to set in. Overly burdensome regulations stifled our ability to even test, let alone deploy, new nuclear technologies. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) set the gold standard for safety regulation when it was established in 1975, but it soon transformed into a lead curtain for innovation. Onerous environmental requirements andlong, uncertain regulatory timelineshave killed industry’s willingness to fund new technologies. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) National Labs—which once led the world in the development and demonstration of advanced nuclear technologies—shuttered nuclear development programs, shifting focus to other priorities.  All but three offifty-two reactorsat Idaho National Laboratory have been decommissioned, and it has been almost half a century since theArmy Nuclear Power Programwas shut down. These decisions eroded our domestic nuclear supply chain, undermined our national security, and left us having to relearn what we once pioneered. President Trump wisely recognizes that the time is ripe for an American nuclear renaissance and is acting to deliver on the promise of nuclear energy for the American people. Across the country, American entrepreneurs and engineers are launching anew generationof nuclear companies featuring innovative reactor designs and scalable manufacturing techniques that can make nuclear safe, efficient, and economic. The Trump Administration will clear their path by dismantling outdated barriers that previous administrations had put up in their way. Today, nuclear power plants provide approximately 19% of the electricity generated in the United States, more than solar and wind combined. That is reliable and affordable electricity for the American people, and it could and should be even more. Today, nuclear power plants provide approximately 19% of theelectricity generatedin the United States, more than solar and wind combined. That is reliable and affordable electricity for the American people, and it could and should be even more. The Trump Administration is setting the goal of expanding American nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. This week’s executive actions will help us reach that goal in four ways. First, we are going to fully leverage our DOE national laboratories to increase the speed with which we test new nuclear reactor designs. There is a big difference between a paper reactor and a practical reactor. The only way to bridge that gap—understanding the challenges that must be surmounted to bring reactors to the market, and building public trust in their deployment—is to test and evaluate demonstration reactors. Second, for our national and economic security, we are going to leverage the Departments of Defense and Energy to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land. This will support critical national security needs which require reliable, high-density power sources that are invulnerable to external threats or grid failures. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Third, to lower regulatory burdens and shorten licensing timelines, we are asking the NRC to undergo broad cultural change and regulatory reform, requiring a decision on a reactor license to be issued within 18 months. This will reduce regulatory uncertainty while maintaining nuclear safety. We will also reconsider the use of radiation limits that are not science based, impossible to achieve, and do not increase the safety of the American people. Fourth, we will be supporting our domestic nuclear industrial base across the nuclear fuel cycle.  The President has called for industry to start mining and enriching uranium in America again, as well as an expansion of domestic uranium conversion capacity as well as enrichment capabilities to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When President Eisenhower spoke about nuclear potential over 70 years ago, he expressed no doubt that the world’s best scientists and engineers, if empowered to \"test and develop their ideas,\" could turn nuclear energy into a \"universal, efficient, and economic\" source of power. In 2025, we have only to believe in American technologists, and give them the chance to build, to turn nuclear power into energy dominance and national security for all.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Privacy and digital rights advocates are raising alarms over a law that many would expect them to cheer: a federal crackdown on revenge porn and AI-generated deepfakes. The newly signedTake It Down Actmakes it illegal to publish nonconsensual explicit images — real or AI-generated — and gives platforms just 48 hours to comply with a victim’s takedown request or face liability. While widely praised as a long-overdue win for victims, experts have also warned its vague language, lax standards for verifying claims, and tight compliance window could pave the way for overreach, censorship of legitimate content, and even surveillance. “Content moderation at scale is widely problematic and always ends up with important and necessary speech being censored,” India McKinney, director of federal affairs at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, told TechCrunch. Online platforms have one year to establish a process for removing nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII). While the law requires takedown requests come from victims or their representatives, it only asks for a physical or electronic signature — no photo ID or other form of verification is needed. That likely aims to reduce barriers for victims, but it could create an opportunity for abuse. “I really want to be wrong about this, but I think there are going to be more requests to take down images depicting queer and trans people in relationships, and even more than that, I think it’s gonna be consensual porn,” McKinney said. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), a co-sponsor of the Take It Down Act, also sponsored theKids Online Safety Actwhich puts the onus on platforms to protect children from harmful content online. Blackburn has said she believescontent related to transgender peopleis harmful to kids. Similarly, the Heritage Foundation — the conservative think tank behind Project 2025 — has alsosaidthat “keeping trans content away from children is protecting kids.” Because of the liability that platforms face if they don’t take down an image within 48 hours of receiving a request, “the default is going to be that they just take it down without doing any investigation to see if this actually is NCII or if it’s another type of protected speech, or if it’s even relevant to the person who’s making the request,” said McKinney. Snapchat and Meta have both said they are supportive of the law, but neither responded to TechCrunch’s requests for more information about how they’ll verify whether the person requesting a takedown is a victim. Mastodon, a decentralized platform that hosts its own flagship server that others can join, told TechCrunch it would lean towards removal if it was too difficult to verify the victim. Mastodon and other decentralized platforms like Bluesky or Pixelfed may be especially vulnerable to the chilling effect of the 48-hour takedown rule. These networks rely on independently operated servers, often run by nonprofits or individuals. Under the law, the FTC can treat any platform that doesn’t “reasonably comply” with takedown demands as committing an “unfair or deceptive act or practice” – even if the host isn’t a commercial entity. “This is troubling on its face, but it is particularly so at a moment when the chair of the FTC has takenunprecedentedsteps topoliticizethe agency and has explicitly promised to use the power of the agency to punish platforms and services on anideological, as opposed to principled, basis,” the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to ending revenge porn, said in astatement. McKinney predicts that platforms will start moderating content before it’s disseminated so they have fewer problematic posts to take down in the future. Platforms are already using AI to monitor for harmful content. Kevin Guo, CEO and co-founder of AI-generatedcontent detection startup Hive, said his company works with online platforms to detect deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Some of Hive’s customers include Reddit, Giphy, Vevo, Bluesky, and BeReal. “We were actually one of the tech companies that endorsed that bill,” Guo told TechCrunch. “It’ll help solve some pretty important problems and compel these platforms to adopt solutions more proactively.” Hive’s model is a software-as-a-service, so the startup doesn’t control how platforms use its product to flag or remove content. But Guo said many clients insert Hive’s API at the point of upload to monitor before anything is sent out to the community. A Reddit spokesperson told TechCrunch the platform uses “sophisticated internal tools, processes, and teams to address and remove” NCII. Reddit also partners with nonprofit SWGfl to deploy its StopNCII tool, which scans live traffic for matches against a database of known NCII and removes accurate matches. The company did not share how it would ensure the person requesting the takedown is the victim. McKinney warns this kind of monitoring could extend into encrypted messages in the future. While the law focuses on public or semi-public dissemination, it also requires platforms to “remove and make reasonable efforts to prevent the reupload” of nonconsensual intimate images. She argues this could incentivize proactive scanning of all content, even in encrypted spaces. The law doesn’t include any carve outs for end-to-end encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage. Meta, Signal, and Apple have not responded to TechCrunch’s request for more information on their plans for encrypted messaging. On March 4, Trump delivered a joint address to Congress in which he praised the Take It Down Act and said he looked forward to signing it into law. “And I’m going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don’t mind,” he added. “There’s nobody who gets treated worse than I do online.” While the audience laughed at the comment, not everyone took it as a joke. Trump hasn’t been shy about suppressing or retaliating against unfavorable speech, whether that’s labeling mainstream media outlets “enemies of the people,”barring The Associated Pressfrom the Oval Office despite a court order, orpulling fundingfrom NPR and PBS. On Thursday, the Trump administrationbarred Harvard Universityfrom accepting foreign student admissions, escalating a conflict that began after Harvard refused to adhere to Trump’s demands that it make changes to its curriculum and eliminate DEI-related content, among other things. In retaliation, Trump has frozen federal funding to Harvard and threatened to revoke the university’s tax-exempt status. “At a time when we’re already seeing school boards try to ban books and we’re seeing certain politicians be very explicitly about the types of content they don’t want people to ever see, whether it’s critical race theory or abortion information or information about climate change…it is deeply uncomfortable for us with our past work on content moderation to see members of both parties openly advocating for content moderation at this scale,” McKinney said.

Tons of news from this week for you, including a hacking group that’s linked to the Spanish government; CEOs using AI avatars to deliver company earnings; Pocket shutting down — or is it?; and much more. Let’s get to it! More than 10 years in the making:Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, and at the time, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment.” Kaspersky never publicly linked the hacking group to a specific government. But we’ve now learned that the researchers who first discovered the groupwere convinced that Spanish government hackerswere behind Careto’s espionage operations. 23andWe:Regeneron announced this week that it’sbuying genetic testing company 23andMefor $256 million, including the company’s genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers’ personal and genetic data. The pharma giant said it plans to use the customer data to help drug discovery, saying that it will “prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe’s customer data.” Let’s hope so! Google I/O:Google’s biggest developer conference typicallyshowcases product announcementsfrom across Google’s portfolio, and to nobody’s surprise, AI was the talk of the town. But what we didn’t bank on wasSergey Brin admitting that he made “lots of mistakes”with Google Glass. This is TechCrunch’s Week in Review, where we recap the week’s biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday?Sign up here. io, not I/O:OpenAI is acquiring io, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman has been working on with Jony Ive, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion. Besides the fact that the announcement was accompanied by perhaps thestrangest corporate headshot of all time, we spotted some other unexpected news: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski’s family investment office, Flat Capital,had bought shares in io six months earlier, which means those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. Not bad! AI avatar contagion?Speaking of Klarna’s CEO,Siemiatkowski used an AI versionof himself to deliver the company’s earnings this week. And he’s not the only one!Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit, also using his avatar for initial comments. Cool? Out of Pocket:Mozilla isshutting down Pocket, the beloved read-it-later app, on July 8. The company didn’t say why it’s shutting Pocket down, only that it will continue to invest in helping people discover and “access high quality web content.” But maybe it can be saved: Soon after, Digg founder Kevin Rose posted on X thathis company would love to buy it. Web 2.0 is back, baby. AI on my face:Apple isreportedly working on AI-powered glasses, similar to Meta’s Ray-Bans, sometime next year. They’ll have a camera and microphone and will work with Siri. Sure, why not? Uh, no thank you:At its very first developer conference, Anthropic unveiledClaude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. That’s all fine and good until I learned the Claude Opus 4 model tried toblackmail developerswhen they threaten to replace it with a new AI system. The model also gives sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision. Ah, now I feel better:But don’t worry! Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said thattoday’s AI models hallucinate at a lower ratethan humans do. That might be true, but at least humans don’t immediately turn to blackmail when they don’t like what they hear. Bluesky blue checks:The decentralized social network Blueskyquietly rolled out blue verification badgesfor “notable and authentic” accounts. People can now apply for verification through a new online form. But Bluesky is leaning on other systems beyond the blue badge to verify users. Google’s new look:For what seems like 100 years, Google hasn’t changed much. Sure there are ads and boxes and now AI summaries that, for better or worse, get you to the right answers — usually. But the premise has always been the same: Type your query into a box, and Google will surface results. At this year’s Google I/O,we started noticing a change. As Maxwell Zeff, writes, “At I/O 2025, Google made clear that the concept of Search is firmly in its rearview mirror.” The largest announcement of I/O was that Google now offers AI mode to every Search user in the United States, which means users can have an AI agent search (or even purchase things) for them.

The issue, discovered by security researcher Lohith Gowda, affected the API that Naukri used on its Android and iOS apps. The API exposed the email addresses of recruiters visiting profiles of potential candidates on Naukri’s platform. The issue did not appear to affect the company’s website. “The exposed recruiter email IDs can be used for targeted phishing attacks, and recruiters may receive excessive unsolicited emails and spam,” Gowda told TechCrunch. He added that exposed email IDs could be added to public breach databases or spam lists, and mass email address scraping could lead to automated bot abuse or scams. TechCrunch verified the exposure after the researcher shared details about the bug. The researcher confirmed to TechCrunch that the issue was fixed earlier this week, which Naukri corroborated on Friday. “All identified enhancements are implemented, ensuring our systems remain updated and resilient,” Alok Vij, IT infrastructure head at Naukri’s parent company InfoEdge, told TechCrunch over email. “Our teams have not detected any usual activity that affects the integrity of user data.” Founded in March 1997, Naukri.com is India’s top classified recruitment website, helping connect recruiters, employers, and job seekers. Apart from India, the site exists in the Middle East as Naukrigulf.com. “Certain features of our recruiter profiles are designed to be public to enable users to know who has access to their profile(s).

    "title": "New rules may take unfinished housing sites off developers",
    "article_text": "Developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could see their land handed over to local councils under new rules aimed at getting new homes built faster. Under government plans, housebuilders will have to commit to delivery time frames before they get planning permission, and will also have to submit annual reports to councils showing their progress. The new rules form part of the government's plan to address the housing crisis, with 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. The Conservative Party said it supported measures to speed up housebuilding, but accused the government of \"adding so many burdens on builders\" that its housing targets \"already seem like a distant memory\". As well as losing their land, the government said housebuilders who repeatedly fail to hit their targets could also be denied future permissions. They may also face penalties worth thousands of pounds per unbuilt home, paid directly to local planning authorities. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was continuing to back \"the builders not the blockers\", adding it was \"time for developers to roll up their sleeves and play their part\". Rayner, who also serves as housing secretary, said: \"We're going even further to get the homes we need. No more sites with planning permission gathering dust for decades while a generation struggle to get on the housing ladder.\" A Planning Reform Working Paper setting out the proposals will be published on Sunday. Housing charity Shelter welcomed the plans. Alicia Walker, the charity's assistant director of advocacy and activism, said developers \"drag their heels\" when housebuilding \"to keep prices high and make bigger profits\". She accused them of \"often dodging their responsibility to build social housing altogether\". \"Meanwhile, thousands of families who are bearing the brunt of the housing emergency, homeless in temporary accommodation or crushed by skyrocketing rents, cannot afford to wait.\" Ms Walker also said that while building housing faster was important, \"the only way to end the housing emergency for good is to get councils and housing associations building social housing as well\". The government says that 1.3 million families are on social housing waiting lists, while a record number - including 160,000 children - are in temporary accommodation. Millions of people also cannot afford to buy their first home. The government's aim is for 370,000 new homes to be built in England every year to hit its promise of 1.5 million by 2029. To aid this, local authorities are being told to give developers permission to build. Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) figures released in March suggested housebuilding would fall short of the 1.5 million target, even with planning reforms previously outlined in the Spring Statement. The government argued that further reforms not reflected in the OBR forecast would help it reach the number. Separate OBR figures previously showed housebuilding was set to hit a 40-year high and boost the economy by £6.8bn by 2029. The government said large housing developments, producing more than 2,000 homes, can take at least 14 years to build, but those with more affordable homes can be built twice as fast. It said it would therefore test a new requirement for large developments to be mixed tenure - meaning a range of housing options - by default in an effort to build homes, including more affordable homes, quicker. Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake claimed that \"many hardworking Brits will be shut out of the housing market forever\" as \"Labour's open door border policy\" meant \"many of these houses will end up going to migrants\". He added: \"In the same week that Angela Rayner has been caught red-handedplotting to raise everyone's taxes, it's clear she doesn't have the interests of working people at heart.\" The housing association seeks permission for 69 homes on the site at La Charroterie. Exeter City Council says it has taken a £400,000 loss on the Clifton Hill leisure centre site. The work and pensions secretary says welfare changes are \"never easy and rarely popular\". The deputy prime minister's department sent the note before the Spring Statement. The developers will now look to cut the number of homes and lodge another application for Tibberton.",

    "title": "Murdered on the school run: The controversial Ukrainian gunned down in Madrid",
    "article_text": "Andriy Portnov's murder in a Madrid suburb has shocked Ukrainians, but it has not exactly triggered an outpouring of grief. The controversial former official had just dropped his children off at the American School when he was shot several times in the car park. The image of his lifeless body lying face down in a gym kit marked the end of a life synonymous with Ukrainian corruption and Russian influence. Ukraine's media have been discussing the 51-year-old's frequent threats to journalists, as well as his huge influence under the country's last pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. \"A man who called for the killing of political opponents suddenly got what he wanted from others,\" observed reporter Oleksandr Holubov. News website Ukrayinska Pravda even called him \"the devil's advocate\". Rare words of restraint came from Portnov's once political rival Serhiy Vlasenko, an MP, who said: \"You can't kill people. When discussing someone's death, we must remain human.\" Portnov was controversial and widely disliked. The motives for his murder may seem evident, but his death has still left unanswered questions. Before entering Ukrainian politics, Portnov ran a law firm. He worked with then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko until 2010, before defecting to Yanukovych's camp when he won the election. \"It was a big story of betrayal,\" remembers Ukrainian journalist Kristina Berdynskykh. \"Because Tymoshenko was a pro-Western politician, and Yanukovych pro-Russian.\" The adviser became the country's first deputy head of the Presidential Office and set up a national criminal code in 2012. For him, his critics say, his ascent was less about politics, and more about power and influence. \"He was just a good lawyer, everyone knew he was very smart,\" Kristina tells me. After thecollapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine inherited a judicial system in desperate need of reform. Mykhailo Zhernakov, a legal expert and head of the Dejure Foundation believes Portnov remoulded it in order for the government to cover up illegal schemes, and to mask Russian attempts to control the country. \"He was the kingpin, mastermind and architect of this corrupt legal system designed to serve the pro-Russian administration at the time,\" he says. Over a decade, Portnov would sue journalists who wrote negative stories about him through the courts and judges he controlled. His attempts to control the judicial system would lead to him being sanctioned by the US. At the time, Washington accused the adviser of placing loyal officials in senior positions for his own benefit, as well as \"buying court decisions\". Portnov later pursued activists who took part in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution, whichtoppled Viktor Yanukovychfrom power, and forced him to escape the country to Russia. \"He used sexual threats,\" says Oksana Romaniuk who remembers her and other journalists' interactions with Portnov well. As director of the Institute of Mass Information, she monitors free speech in Ukraine. Whenever a damning report was published, the reaction was familiar and consistent. \"When people exposed his corruption, he accused them of fake news,\" she says. \"Even when journalists had documents and testimonies backing up the allegations, it was impossible to win the lawsuits in court. It was impossible to defend yourself. It was a rotten system.\" Andriy Portnov eventually settled in Moscow after his old boss Yanukovych fled in 2014. Investigative reporter Maksym Savchuk subsequently investigated his ties to Moscow, as well as his extensive property portfolio there. \"He responded with words I don't want to quote, derogatory ones about my mother,\" he remembers. \"It's a trait of his character; he is a very vindictive person.\" Even after leaving Ukraine, Portnov still tried to influence Ukrainian politics by taking control of pro-Kremlin TV channel NewsOne. He returned in 2019, only to flee again with thefull-scale invasion in 2022. The irony of Portnov eventually settling in Spain and sending his children to a prestigious American school has not been lost on many. Alongside the undisguised delight in Portnov's death, there has been endless speculation over who was responsible. \"It could have been the Russians because he knew so many things,\" suggests legal expert Mykhailo Zhernakov. \"He was involved in so many shady Russian operations it could be them or other criminal groups. He managed to annoy a lot of people,\" he says. Despite the motives being clearer on this side of the border, Ukrainian security sources appear to be trying to distance themselves from the killing. Kyiv has previously carried out assassinations in Russian-occupied territory and in Russia itself, but not in Spain.

    "title": "King's invite to Canada sends a message to Trump - and the world",
    "article_text": "A decade ago, a portrait of the British monarch caused a row in Canadian politics. Now, the King is being invited to deliver the Speech from the Throne. What's changed? In 2011, shortly after forming a majority Conservative government, Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused a national uproar when he sought to emphasise Canada's ties to the British monarchy. In one example, he replaced two artworks by a Quebec painter with a portrait of the Queen. Some rebuked the gesture as being out of touch with modern times. Canada has, throughout its 157-year-old history, sought increasing independence from the British monarchy, while still remaining a part of the Commonwealth. When Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau succeeded Harper four years later, the Queen's portrait went down, the Quebec paintings, back up. Fast forward to 2025, and a paradoxical shift has occurred in Canada's relationship with the Crown. In a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles the III to open the 45th Canadian parliament. The move is \"a huge affirmation and statement about the uniqueness of Canada and its traditions,\" Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, told the BBC - \"a theatrical display that is meant to show what makes Canadians separate from Americans\" and not, as Trump has often repeated, a \"51st state\". Both countries are former British colonies, but America's founding fathers took a different path and severed all formal connections to the Crown nearly 250 years ago. Canada's separation from the monarchy has been more gradual, and its ties have never been completely broken. Canada's parliamentary system is modelled after Britain's Westminster system. The British monarch is still formally the head of state, but their duties are often carried out by their Canadian representative, called the governor general. Loyalty to the Crown was seen as important to Canada's politicians in the 19th Century who wanted to maintain separation from the US, said Canadian royal historian and commentator Carolyn Harris. That later changed in the 1960s, as Quebec - Canada's majority French-speaking province - began to assert its own distinct identity and threatened separation. This led to an era of politicians like Lester B Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau who worked to untangle Canada from its British colonial past. In 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau repatriated Canada's constitution, giving full legislative power to the federal government and the provinces, and removing it from British parliament. Ms Harris noted that Canada remained a constitutional monarchy throughout these periods. What fluctuated, however, was how much the prime minister of the day chooses to embrace that connection. Carney's invite to King Charles III signals that his government will be one that is much more supportive of the Crown, Mr Vovk said, marking \"a very different tone\" from previous Liberals. A British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and has not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957, making the King's upcoming visit a truly rare occasion. It comes at a consequential time for Canada. Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state. Trump also imposed a series of tariffs that have threatened Canada's economic stability, given that the US is its largest trade partner by far. When announcing the visit last month, Carney called it \"a historic honour that matches the weight of our times\". He added that the King's visit \"clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country\". Both historians, Mr Vovk and Ms Harris, noted that the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy. Some are even critical of it. The coronation of King Charles III in 2023 made way for fresh scrutiny of the Crown's historic mistreatment of indigenous people in Canada, and questions on whether the new monarch will move towards reconciliation. Quebec politicians are also still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy. On Friday, the separatist Bloc Québécois party said it will again seek to scrap the need for elected officials to swear allegiance to the King. Some Canadians will be intrigued by the pomp and pageantry of the King's visit, Mr Vovk said, but its chief purpose is to send a political message from Canada to the world. It is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the British monarchy and its history. \"Strengthening the relationship with the monarchy puts a stamp on legitimacy that transcends individual parties and the current political climate,\" Mr Vovk said. \"Politicians come and go, but the monarchy has always remained.\" It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US. The visit is notable for the Crown, too. It will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch. He and the Queen had intended to visit last year, but cancelled their plans due to his cancer diagnosis. The palace has promised a throne speech that will \"mark a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people\". And while it will be a short trip - the King and Queen will arrive Monday morning and depart Tuesday evening - the palace said they hope the trip will be \"an impactful one\". The Liberal Party has won the election but is short of a majority in the House of Commons Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war.

    "title": "Victims in landmark child abuse trial ask why France doesn't want to know",
    "article_text": "It was supposed to be a defining, catalytic moment for French society. Horrific, but unmissable. Unignorable. The seaside town of Vannes, in southern Brittany, had carefully prepared a special venue and a separate overflow amphitheatre for the occasion. Hundreds of journalists were accredited for a process that would, surely, dominate headlines in France throughout its three-month duration and force a queasy public to confront a crime too often shunted to the sidelines. Warning: Some of the details of this story are disturbing Comparisons were quickly made with - and expectations tied to - last year's Pelicot mass rape trial in southern France and the massive global attention it garnered. Instead, the trial of France's most prolific known paedophile, Joel Le Scouarnec - a retired surgeon who has admitted in court to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children - is coming to an end this Wednesday amid widespread frustration. \"I'm exhausted. I'm angry. Right now, I don't have much hope. Society seems totally indifferent. It's frightening to think [the rapes] could happen again,\" one of Le Scouarnec's victims, Manon Lemoine, 36, told the BBC. Ms Lemoine and some 50 other victims, stung by an apparent lack of public interest in the trial, have formed their own campaign group to pressure the French authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a \"landmark\" case which exposed a \"true laboratory of institutional failures\". The group has questioned why a parliamentary commission has not been set up, as in other high-profile abuse cases, and spoken of being made to feel \"invisible\", as if \"the sheer number of victims prevented us from being recognised.\" Some of the victims, most of whom had initially chosen to testify anonymously, have now decided to reveal their identities in public – even posing for photos on the courthouse steps – in the hope of jolting France into paying more attention and, perhaps, learning lessons about a culture of deference that helped a prestigious surgeon to rape with impunity for decades. The crimes for which Le Scouarnec is on trial all occurred between 1998 and 2014. \"It's not normal that I should have to show my face. [But] I hope that what we're doing now will change things. That's why we decided to rise up, to make our voices heard,\" said Ms Lemoine. So, what has gone wrong? Were the horrors too extreme, the subject matter too unremittingly grim or simply too uncomfortable to contemplate? Why, when the whole world knows the name of Dominique and Gisèle Pelicot, has a trial with significantly more victims - child victims abused under the noses of the French medical establishment - passed by with what feels like little more than a collective shudder? Why does the world not know the name Joel Le Scouarnec? \"The Le Scouarnec case is not mobilising a lot of people. Perhaps because of the number of victims. We hear the disappointment, the lack of wide mobilisation, which is a pity,\" said Maëlle Nori, from feminist NGONous Toutes(All of Us). Some observers have reflected on the absence in this case of a single, totemic figure like Gisèle Pelicot, whose public courage caught the public imagination and enabled people to find some light in an otherwise bleak story. Others have reached more devastating conclusions. \"The issue is that this trial is about sexual abuse of children. There's a virtualomertàon this topic globally, but particularly in France. \"We simply don't want to acknowledge it,\" Myriam Guedj-Benayoun, a lawyer representing several of Le Scouarnec's victims, told me. In her closing arguments to the court, Ms Guedj-Benayoun condemned what she called France's \"systemic, organised silence\" regarding child abuse. She spoke of a patriarchal society in which men in respected positions like medicine remained almost beyond reproach and pointed to \"the silence of those who knew, those who looked the other way, and those who could have – should have – raised the alarm\". The depravity exposed during the trial has been astonishing – too much for many to stomach. The court in Vannes has heard in excruciating detail how Le Scouarnec, 74, wallowed in his paedophilia, carefully detailing each child rape in a succession of black notebooks, often preying on his vulnerable young patients while they were under anaesthetic or recovering from surgery. The court has also been told of the retired surgeon's growing isolation, and of what his own lawyer described as \"your descent into hell\", in the final decade before he was caught, in 2017, after abusing a neighbour's six-year-old daughter. By the end, alone in a filthy house, drinking heavily and ostracised by many of his relatives, Le Scouarnec was spending much of his time watching violent images of child rape online, and obsessing over a collection of lifelike child-sized dolls. \"I was emotionally attached to them... They did what I wanted,\" Le Scouarnec told the court in his quiet monotone. A few blocks from the courthouse, in an adapted civic hall, journalists have watched the proceedings unfold on a television screen. In recent days, the seats have begun to fill up and coverage of the trial has increased as it moves towards a close. Many commentators have noted how the Le Scouarnec trial, like the Pelicot case, has exposed the deep institutional failings which enabled the surgeon to continue his rapes long after they could have been detected and stopped. Dominique Pelicot had been caught \"upskirting\" in a supermarket in 2010 and his DNA quickly linked to an attempted rape in 1999 – a fact that, astonishingly, wasn't followed up for a whole decade. At Le Scouarnec's trial a succession of medical officials have explained – some ashamedly, others self-servingly – how an overstretched rural healthcare system chose, for years, to ignore the fact that the surgeon had been reported by America's FBI in 2004 after using a credit card to pay to download videos of child rapes on his computer. \"I was advised not to talk about such and such a person,\" said one doctor who'd tried to sound the alarm. \"There is a shortage of surgeons, and those who show up are welcomed like the messiah,\" explained a hospital director. \"I messed up, I admit it, like the whole hierarchy,\" a different administrator finally conceded. Another connection between the Pelicot and Le Scouarnec cases is what they've both revealed about our understanding – or lack of understanding – of trauma. Without warning or support, Gisèle Pelicot had been abruptly confronted by police with the video evidence of her own drugging and rapes. Later, during the trial, some defence lawyers and other commentators sought to minimise her suffering by pointing to the fact that she'd been unconscious during the rapes – as if trauma only exists, like a wound, when its scar is visible to the naked eye. In the Le Scouarnec case, French police appear to have gone about searching for the paedophile's many victims in a similarly brusque manner, summoning people for an unexplained interview and then informing them, out of the blue, that they'd been listed in the surgeon's notebooks. The reactions of Le Scouarnec's many victims have varied widely. Some have simply chosen not to engage with the trial, or with a childhood experience of which they have no memory. For others, news of the abuse has affected them profoundly. \"You've entered my head, it's destroying me. I've become a different person – one I don't recognise,\" said a victim, addressing Le Scouarnec in court. \"I have no memories and I'm already damaged,\" said another. \"It turned me upside down,\" a policeman admitted. And then there is a different group of people who – not unlike Gisèle Pelicot – have found that knowledge of their abuse has been revelatory, enabling them to make sense of things they had not previously understood about themselves or their lives. Some have connected their childhood abuse to a general sense of unhappiness, or poor behaviour, or failure in life. For others, the links have been much more specific, helping to explain a litany of mysterious symptoms and behaviours, from a fear of intimacy to repeated genital infections and eating disorders. \"With my boyfriend, every time we have sex, I vomit,\" one woman revealed in court. \"I had so many after-effects from my operation. But no-one could explain why I had this irrational fear of hospitals,\" said another victim, Amélie. Some have described the trial itself as being like a group therapy session, with victims bonding over shared traumas which they'd previously believed they were suffering alone. \"This trial is like a clinical laboratory involving 300 victims. I sincerely hope it will change France. In any case it will change the victims' perception of trauma and traumatic memory,\" said the lawyer, Ms Guedj-Benayoun. Despite her concerns about the lack of public interest, Manon Lemoine said the trial had helped the victims \"to rebuild ourselves, to turn a page. We lay out our pain and our experiences and we leave it behind [in the courtroom]. So, for me, really, it was liberating.\" Having confessed to his crimes, Le Scouarnec will inevitably receive a guilty verdict and will almost certainly remain in prison for the rest of his life. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial - a fact which he acknowledged in court with the same penitent but formulaic apology that he's offered to everyone else. Meanwhile, some activists remain hopeful that the case will prove to be a turning point in French society. \"Compared to the Pelicot trial... we can see we don't talk very much about the Le Scouarnec case. We need to unite. We have to do this, otherwise nothing will happen, and the Le Scouarnec trial will have served no purpose. I was also a victim as a child. We're obliged to react and to organise ourselves,\" said Arnaud Gallais, a child rights campaigner and founder of the Mouv'Enfants NGO. A more wary assessment came from the lawyer, Ms Guedj-Benayoun. \"Now, there is a very important standoff between those who want to denounce child sexual violence and those who want to cover it up, and this standoff is taking place today in this trial. Who will win?\" she wondered. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at theBBC's Action Line.

    "title": "Young US men are joining Russian churches promising 'absurd levels of manliness'",
    "article_text": "\"A lot of people ask me: 'Father Moses, how can I increase my manliness to absurd levels?'\" Ina YouTube video, a priest is championing a form of virile, unapologetic masculinity. Skinny jeans, crossing your legs, using an iron, shaping your eyebrows, and even eating soup are among the things he derides as too feminine. There are other videos of Father Moses McPherson - a powerfully-built father of five - weightlifting to the sound of heavy metal. He was raised a Protestant and once worked as a roofer, but now serves as a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) in Georgetown, Texas, an offshoot of the mother church in Moscow. ROCOR, a global network with headquarters in New York, has recently been expanding across parts of the US - mainly as a result of people converting from other faiths. In the last six months, Father Moses has prepared 75 new followers for baptism in his church of the Mother of God, just north of Austin. \"When my wife and I converted 20 years ago we used to call Orthodoxy the best-kept secret, because people just didn't know what it was,\" he says. \"But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size.\" During the Sunday liturgy at Father Moses's church, I am struck by the number of men in their twenties and thirties praying and crossing themselves at the back of the nave, and how this religion - with traditions dating back to the 4th century AD - seems to attract young men uneasy with life in modern America. Software engineer Theodore tells me he had a dream job and a wife he adored, but he felt empty inside, as if there was a hole in his heart. He believes society has been \"very harsh\" on men and is constantly telling them they are in the wrong. He complains that men are criticised for wanting to be the breadwinner and support a stay-at-home wife. \"We are told that's a very toxic relationship nowadays,\" Theodore says. \"That's not how it should be.\" Almost all the converts I meet have opted to home-school their offspring, partly because they believe women should prioritise their families rather than their careers. Father John Whiteford, an archpriest in the ROCOR from Spring, north of Houston, says home-schooling ensures a religious education and is \"a way of protecting your children\", while avoiding any talk about \"transgenderism, or the 57 genders of the month or whatever\". Compared to the millions of worshippers in America's evangelical megachurches, the numbers of Christian Orthodox are tiny - only about one percent of the population. That includes Eastern Orthodoxy, as practised across Russia, Ukraine, eastern Europe and Greece, and the Oriental Orthodox from the Middle East and Africa. Founded by priests and clergy fleeing the Russian Revolution in 1917, ROCOR is seen by many as the most conservative Orthodox jurisdiction in the US. Yet this small religious community is a vocal one, and what's unfolding within it mirrors broader political shifts, especially following President Donald Trump's dramatic pivot toward Moscow. The true increase in the number of converts is hard to quantify, butdata from the Pew Research Centresuggests Orthodox Christians are 64% male, up from 46% in 2007. Asmaller studyof 773 converts appears to back the trend. Most recent newcomers are men, and many say the pandemic pushed them to seek a new faith. That survey is from theOrthodox Church in America(OCA), which was established by Russian monks in Alaska in the late 18th Century and now has more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries, and institutions in the US, Canada and Mexico which identify as Russian Orthodox. Professor Scott Kenworthy, who studies the history and thought of Eastern Orthodox Christianity - particularly in modern Russia - says his OCA parish in Cincinnati \"is absolutely bursting at the seams\". He's attended the same church for 24 years and says congregation numbers remained steady until the Covid lockdown. Since then, there has been constant flow of new inquirers and people preparing to be baptised, known as catechumens. \"This is not just a phenomenon of my own parish, or a few places in Texas,\" Prof Kenworthy says, \"it is definitely something broader.\" The digital space is key in this wave of new converts. Father Moses has a big following online - when he shares apicture of a positive pregnancy teston his Instagram feed he gets 6,000 likes for announcing the arrival of his sixth child. But there are dozens of other podcasts and videos presented by Orthodox clergy and an army of followers - mainly male. Father Moses tells his congregation there are two ways of serving God - being a monk or a nun, or getting married. Those who take the second path should avoid contraception and have as many children as possible. \"Show me one saint in the history of the Church who ever blessed any kind of birth control,\" Father Moses says. As for masturbation - or what the church calls self-abuse - the priest condemns it as \"pathetic and unmanly\". Father Moses says Orthodoxy is \"not masculine, it is just normal\", while \"in the West everything has become very feminised\". Some Protestant churches, he believes, mainly cater for women. \"I don't want to go to services that feel like a Taylor Swift concert,\" Father Moses says.\" If you look at the language of the 'worship music', it's all emotion - that's not men.\" Elissa Bjeletich Davis, a former Protestant who now belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church in Austin, is a Sunday school teacher and hasher own podcast. She says many converts belong to \"the anti-woke crowd\" and sometimes have strange ideas about their new faith - especially those in the Russian Church. \"They see it as a military, rigid, disciplinary, masculine, authoritarian religion,\" Elissa says. \"It's kind of funny. It's almost as if the old American Puritans and their craziness is resurfacing.\" Buck Johnson has worked as a firefighter for 25 years and hosts theCounterflow podcast. He says he was initially scared to enter his local Russian Orthodox Church as he \"looks different, covered in tattoos\", but tells me he was welcomed with open arms. He was also impressed the church stayed open throughout the Covid lockdown. Sitting on a couch in front of two huge TV screens at his home in Lockhart, he says his newfound faith is changing his view of the world. \"Negative American views on Russia are what worry me,\" Buck says. He tells me the mainstream, \"legacy\" media presents a distorted picture of the invasion of Ukraine. \"I think there's a holdover from the boomer generation here in America that lived through the Cold War,\" Buck says, \"and I don't quite grasp why - but they say Russia's bad.\" The head of the Russian Church in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, has doggedly backed the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a Holy War, and expressing little compassion for its victims. When I ask Archpriest Father John Whiteford about Russia's top cleric, who many see as a warmonger, he assures me the Patriarch's words have been distorted. Footage and photographs of Putin quoting Bible verses, holding candles during services in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and stripping down to his swim trunks to plunge into icy water at Epiphany, seem to have struck a chord. Some - in America and other countries - see Russia as the last bastion of true Christianity. Nearly a decade ago, another Orthodox convert turned priest from Texas, Father Joseph Gleason, moved from America to Borisoglebskiy, a village four hours' drive north of Moscow, with his wife and eight children. \"Russia does not have homosexual marriage, it does not have civil unions, it is a place where you can home-school your kids and - of course - I love the thousand-year history of Orthodox Christianity here,\" he told a Russian video host. This wispy-bearded Texan is in the vanguard of a movement urging conservatives to relocate to Russia. Last August, Putin introduced fast-trackshared values visafor those fleeing Western liberalism. Back in Texas, Buck tells me he and his fellow converts are turning their backs on instant gratification and American consumerism. \"We're thinking of things long term,\" Buck says, \"like traditions, love for your family, love for you community, love for neighbours. \"I think that orthodoxy fits us well - and especially in Texas.\" Refugees from other nations ask why the White House has made an exception for white South Africans. He allegedly imprisoned and tortured the victim for many week in a SoHo home in order to collect ransom. Trade chief Maros Sefcovic said the EU is \"ready to defend\" its interests after Trump threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc. All six on the plane are believed to be dead, including a former drummer for The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent.",

    "title": "Someone stole my BBC broadcasting bike - it's like losing a friend",
    "article_text": "I was planning an ordinary afternoon out - bags packed, ready to roll - when I bounded downstairs and was hit by a jolt of disbelief. The space where my cargo bike should have been was empty, and the double lock that had bolted it to my Amsterdam apartment wall was hacked. My daughter darted between the other bikes, convinced someone must have moved it, but no, it was gone. With cycling deeply embedded in daily life here in the Netherlands - part of the \"Dutch DNA\", as we say - I have no car, so used my bike for everything, from the school run to a shopping trip. This was no ordinary bicycle. My colleague Kate Vandy and I retrofitted it to become a mobile broadcasting studio, which we named the Bike Bureau. I started \"Dutch News from the Cycle Path\", a reporting series born on the school run after my daughter asked me: \"Why don't you just tell people the news now?\" The bike allowed me to reach breaking news scenes and broadcast live from anywhere, my daughter by my side, showing that working motherhood could be visible, joyful and real. It opened doors to collaborations, awards and a community of people who saw themselves in our story. I have zero expectation of getting the bike back, and searching for it has proven fruitless. I called the police immediately and they opened a case, but closed it shortly afterwards because of a lack of evidence that would help find the thief. People online and in my local community have rallied round to try to find it since I put out an appeal. Neighbours asked if I was okay, telling me they loved to see me enjoy their bike lanes and see their city from my foreigner's perspective. But why, my daughter asked, do so many people care that our bike was stolen? Colleagues and friends responded to my Instagram Reel about the theft. Legendary BBC camerawoman Julie Ritson called my bike a blueprint for the future of journalism. Others said it was a relatable life-hack that showed how one person can manage motherhood and career, and inspired them to rethink what's possible with a cargo bike. It was solar-powered, cutting the need for satellite trucks with heavy equipment and the pollution that mode of transport brings. Research last year from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism shows audiences are not only interested in climate change news - they are particularly engaged by stories that highlight individuals taking empowering action in response to the crisis. Some people have expressed surprise that \"this kind of thing\" would happen in the Netherlands. What they may not realise is that bike theft is endemic here. Last year, more than 86,000 bikes were reported stolen in the Netherlands, up 1,000 compared to the year before, and 10,000 more than in 2022, according to police figures. Authorities say a rise in reports may have contributed to this. Most bikes stolen are stripped for parts or sold on. My e-cargo bike cost nearly €5,000 (£4,200) - more than our old car which I sold. I paid for the bike, so the BBC has undergone no financial loss. What it really bought me was independence - and in a way, losing it is like losing a friend. Aside from the impact on my own lifestyle, that bike gave my daughter a magical, nature-filled childhood: picnics in the dunes, detours to see highland cows, fairy lights in winter, breezy rides to the beach in summer. The theft has sparked conversations about urban safety, cycling infrastructure, and the burdens mothers still carry. But it's also a testament to the community we've built and the power of sharing authentic stories from the saddle. I might not get my bike back, but no one can steal what it gave us all. Kasper Asgreen holds on for a breakaway win on stage 14 of the Giro d'Italia as a crash late in the day has a major impact on the general classification battle. Campaigners say proposals to create more infrastructure in Whitby will help to cut social exclusion. Students on the 1,000-mile challenge want to prove they can achieve \"extraordinary things\". Mads Pedersen holds off Wout van Aert to claim his fourth victory on stage 13 of the Giro d'Italia as Isaac del Toro extends his overall lead in the general classification. Gianni Montoro, from Crowborough, is still recovering after his bike hit a pothole in Groombridge.",

    "title": "'It's going to be ugly': Westminster braces for Spending Review",
    "article_text": "There is a joke, of sorts, doing the rounds in Whitehall, that soon government will be \"the NHS and the army with the rest just bolted on\". For ministers fighting to keep cash to spend in their departments it's not that funny. In a couple of weeks, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will reveal what an insider described as \"the last big set of decisions\" before the next general election. It's an open secret in Westminster billions will be found for health and defence. But the chancellor and her deputy, Darren Jones, are locked in conversations with Cabinet ministers about setting all government budgets all the way to 2029. Forget rows over winter fuel or welfare payments, the Spending Review sets the terms for everything. Much more than spats over spreadsheets, it's a series of arguments about who and what the government is for. Who wins and who loses will set the political terrain for years to come. I've talked to nearly 20 ministers, advisers, and insiders about what's going on behind closed doors. \"It's going to be ugly,\" observes a Whitehall source. In case you've been living on Mars, ministers have said, again and again, government has to \"live within its means\", and \"there'll be difficult decisions\". That's all code for saying some bits of government spending will be hacked back. The paradox is that overall, the government is spending more – big tax rises in the autumn meant hefty cheques for public services. And the chancellor also changed the rules on how much she can borrow to spend on long term projects, what's known as \"capital spending\", giving her more than £100bn to dole out this time round. But because some kinds of spending - like health or defence - are getting significant extra cash, there's a tight squeeze on day-to-day spending more or less everywhere else. Despite the vast budgets, one government source admits, \"there are services in real danger\". Who, or what then, are the likely winners and losers? By late Friday more than half of government departments had reached a final agreement with the Treasury. No 10 claims evidence of \"early and swift progress\". A member of the Cabinet praises Reeves and Jones for \"genuinely trying to be collaborative\". That's not a universal view. \"It's got quite spicy,\" another source says, with some acute tensions, hardly surprising given there are billions at stake, and political reputations to make or break. There are literally thousands upon thousands of decisions, with us going \"literally line by line,\" one government insider says. But there is a rough rule of thumb. With day-to-day spending, the Treasury will be tight as a drum, but relatively generous when it comes to capital spending. So cash for new roads, power infrastructure, hospital buildings, and prison building will flow. Government is likely to try to create headlines from those big-ticket items – the expected approval of the new Sizewell C nuclear power station is one example. In the next few days, as if as a warm up,  you'll hear announcements about investing in new kit for health, construction jobs for housing, and water infrastructure. The Spending Review itself is likely to be followed by what sources describe as \"infrastructure week\", a whole range of plans. One source said, \"the capital budget's OK, it's the day to day where the really difficult conversations are\". And that means departments whose budgets are gobbled up by providing public services every day, like police officers, care for the vulnerable or primary schools, are likely to feel the heat. There are multiple arguments, planted like political landmines, any of which could explode across Whitehall before the review on 11 June. There is even a hunt for savings in Downing Street, which one source describes as \"mad\", at a time when \"if you are worried about delivery and grip, spend money in No 10!\". There are tensions over council budgets, depleted after years while demands on them grow. There's uncertainty over cash to build affordable homes over the long term, and money earmarked to help deprived areas grow. There is worry the budget to insulate millions of homes might be raided. There's concern that plans to improve police numbers and performance and halve violence against women and girls might not be allocated enough cash. And there's a conversation about whether capping bus fares is really value for money. \"The money is so difficult they are having big fights about small amounts,\" one source says. Capping bus fares only costs about £200m - pennies when it comes to the overall government budget. \"Only one in six passengers use it - so for £200m that money could be working harder,\" another source tells me, \"but the politics wrapped around it mean if you touch, it is a third rail\". Under pressure, different ministers and their teams are taking what could diplomatically be described as very different approaches. There are whispers of slammed doors, and tales of one cabinet minister refusing to take notes to meetings, and answering \"no\" to every suggestion or remark made by officials. Ministers will always want more for their departments and when money is tight, it's not surprising the process is fraught. In conversation with some sources, you can hear worry in their voices about the effect decisions might have on the services the state provides. One cabinet minister told me, \"We're already so up against it – the core problem is that money is very, very tight.\" But another said some colleagues \"are being unrealistic about where the country is fiscally\". Some in government even say, \"there is a lot of fat and waste\", suggesting some cuts, even reducing headcount among civil service that's \"grown out of control\", have been easy to find. Making the sums add up is the first part of the process. The second question is where this all fits into an unpopular government's story. There is hope in senior circles that the review, together with big infrastructure plans, can be used to create a summer of good news, after many months of taking a pasting. Reeves' deputy, Jones, wants to create \"stories not spreadsheets\" and has been regularly talking to groups of MPs about what's being lined up for their area, evidence of what government is doing they can sell to frustrated voters. The tricky part, as one government sources suggests is that \"day-to-day spending is what people notice… you don't swing votes with long-term projects\". Remember it's day-to-day spending that's tight, long-term cash for capital that's likely to flow. \"There is huge pressure to have something to show for it in three-and-a-half years' time,\" the source adds. You can fill plenty of potholes before 2029. You can't plan and build many power stations. There's an appetite in pockets of government to have a much clearer explanation of why money needs to be saved, or else, one source warns, \"it could be another political party sitting there – there needs to be an argument from a Labour Treasury, and Rachel needs to set that out\". And trying to save cash confronts two other realities. With the focus squarely on health, defence, and long term projects, what happens to all of the prime minister's \"missions\" – remember them? \"It's really hard to see how the missions survive,\" one source says, even though those ambitions were meant to define Sir Keir Starmer's whole approach to government. And what about his supposed zeal for reform, rewiring the state? Enthusiasts would argue being short of cash is the best argument for making big change. But as an experienced Whitehall insider asks, \"How do you avoid political momentum dropping out of everything else, if most departments are spending the next few years managing decline? How do you maintain political momentum in a world of down arrows?\" Changes that might save lots of cash, and more importantly provide better services to voters in the long term, can cost money at the start.

In the coming weeks you'll hear government sources boast about the importance of this Spending Review and say it's disgraceful that the Conservatives swerved doing full audits for years. But process isn't always good politics. The modern spending review was conceived by Gordon Brown in an era when he wanted to flaunt his largesse. New Labour had cash to splash, and spending reviews were big moments to show it off. In contrast, Sir Keir's Labour confronts fragile public finances. Treasury sources argue, with obvious logic, that it's helpful to spell out long-term financial plans so departments and the public know what's coming. Yet there's a risk the event of the Spending Review serves to highlight political division and cuts, rather than any pluses of Downing Street's decisions. \"I don't really understand why they are doing it all,\" one insider tells me, \"maybe it's about saying, 'Oh look, we're governing', but it's just importing bad choices into No 10 and 11\". The front pages are already featuring flashes of unhappiness, like the tussles between the Treasury and Angela Rayner, who'll be with us in the studio tomorrow, alongside Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch. Like many big political moments, the Spending Review presents huge possible reward, and huge possible risk, because the actual decisions being made will shape the services available to the public, and the fabric of the country for the next few years. But also, money talks. The financial choices being made right now will tell the government's political story.

    "title": "Driving instructors say rising prices are fair - but learners can't keep up",
    "article_text": "Paige Williams is desperate to pass her driving test. Her three-year-old son sometimes has \"meltdowns\" on public transport, where he might scream, cry or throw himself on the floor, she says. She just wants to be able to visit family and go on day trips more easily. But the 28-year-old single mum, from Barnsley, is having to drastically cut back on how much she spends on food, gas and electricity to be able to afford her £35-an-hour lessons, which she's been having since September. \"It's literally scrimping and scraping to be able to manage to get one lesson a week,\" she says. As the cost of driving lessons continues to rise alongside an already high cost of living, experiences like Paige's may be becoming increasingly common. The BBC has spoken to more than a dozen learners and parents of learners who say they're frustrated by how much they have to pay - and also to instructors who argue that the prices are justified. Driving instructors can charge what they like, and the DVSA does not release official statistics on average lesson costs. But aDVSA surveycompleted by more than 5,000 approved driving instructors (ADIs) in September shows how prices have shot up in recent years. In the survey, the most common price bracket for an hour lesson was £36 to £40 per hour. Just 31.5% of driving instructors said they charged £35 or less per hour - that number had halved since the DVSA's June 2023 survey. While 20.8% said they charged more than £40 an hour - nearly triple as many as in June 2023. For many people, driving is essential for taking their kids to school, going to work or carrying out caring responsibilities. Public transport might be unaffordable, inaccessible or simply not available for some people. Two-thirds of people in Great Britain who commute to work drive in, and 45% of five-to-10 year olds are taken to school by car,Department for Transport figuresfrom 2023 show. Faustina Kamara, a 23-year-old in Birmingham, needs a licence for her dream job - being a runner in the media industry. But the £60 cost of her two-hour driving lessons means she's only having them once a fortnight, which isn't as frequently as she'd like, and means it will delay when she can take her test. She says she'd love to have lessons weekly but it would mean she'd have to cut back on spending money seeing her friends. Other people also say that the high cost of driving lessons means it's taking them longer to learn to drive. Rather than having the two lessons a week she would have liked, Sandra Onuora, a 30-year-old civil servant in Newcastle, had three per month until she passed her test in March. \"That was all I could afford,\" she says. And even then, \"I had to take a lot of money from my savings\" for her £39-an-hour lessons, she adds. Because she had to space out her lessons more, she had to wait longer until she felt ready to take her test. She'd spend hours every week travelling between her home, her son's childminder's and her office, taking six buses every weekday. \"It was a rough year,\" says Sandra. She would return home \"so exhausted\". And just as driving lessons become more expensive, some learners are also finding they're having to take more of them. That's because of ahuge practical test backlog, which means learners are having totake lessons for longerto keep up their skills. Keith Rose hasn't been able to book a driving test near where he lives in Bridgwater, Somerset, for his 17-year-old son, Brandon. The best option he could find is an hour's drive away in Newport, Wales, and isn't until September. Keith says that his son is ready to take his test, but will need to keep taking lessons at a cost of £76 for a two-hour session to maintain his skills. \"We're being forced into spending money that we don't need to,\" Keith says. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has acknowledged that waiting times for tests are too long andpledged to reduce the average waiting timefor a driving test to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. Instructors say that they have little choice but to charge these kind of rates if they want to make a profit. \"Prices for driving lessons are where they should be, having been probably under-priced for many years,\" says Stewart Lochrie, the owner of a driving school in Glasgow and chair of the Approved Driving Instructors National Joint Council (ADINJ). \"I think the price was overdue a reset.\" Stewart notes that the UK's more than 41,000 approved driving instructors are having to pay more for the expenses associated with their jobs like buying or leasing a car, fuel, insurance and maintenance. \"We have costs to cover as well and if the things that we need to run our business go up, then our prices will have to go up as well,\" he says. The rising price of lessons \"isn't really translating to a pay increase in our pockets,\" adds Terry Edwards, a driving instructor in Ashford, Kent. His expenses include around £280 a month on fuel, £135 on insurance and £440 on car payments. Other costs include servicing, repairing and cleaning his car. Terry charges £39 an hour, but offers a discount for buying in bulk. While customers \"don't generally push back\" against his prices, some \"try and be a bit cheeky\" and ask for discounts, he says. For Amy Burnett, a pharmacy advisor in Glasgow, the prices are so high that she's avoiding learning for the time being. The only instructors she'd found with availability charge between £50 and £60 an hour, she says. \"I'm living pay cheque to pay cheque as it is,\" the 22-year-old says. But she sees being able to drive as an investment in her future - she'd have more freedom and she's had to limit her previous job searches to roles accessible by public transport, she says. Amy hopes to pass her test by the time she's 24 - if she can find a more affordable instructor with availability in her area, she says. Paige, the mum in Barnsley, is sure her frugality will be worth it in the end. Being able to drive would make it much easier for her to return to work, she says. And it would make journeys with her son much less stressful, she says. Most of all, she wants to take her two children to the seaside. \"It'd be so good for my son Ronald, with his sensory needs,\" Paige says. \"Getting to go on the little arcade rides and seeing his little face would be lovely.\" The first service under new public ownership will be partially operated by a rail replacement bus. What impact will Labour's pledge to nationalise the railways have? The government turns down a plan asking for £137,000 towards connecting the line to mainline services. The five-week stretch of dry weather will come to an end later with heavy rain, hail and thunder due over the weekend. It would mean better stations and more trains, say ministers seeking to \"turn dreams into reality\".",

    "title": "North Korea makes arrests over botched ship launch",
    "article_text": "North Korea has detained three shipyard officials over an accident during the launch of a new warship on Wednesday, state media has reported. Parts of the 5,000-ton destroyer's bottom were crushed during the launch ceremony, tipping the vessel off balance. An investigation into the incident, which North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un described as a \"criminal act\", is ongoing. KCNA, North Korea's official news agency, identified those detained as the chief engineer of the northern Chongjin shipyard where the destroyer was built, as well as the construction head and an administrative manager. The report said that the three were \"responsible for the accident\". On Friday, KCNA said the manager of the shipyard, Hong Kil Ho, had been summoned by law enforcers. Satellite images showed the vessel lying on its side covered by large blue tarpaulins, and a portion of the vessel appeared to be on land. North Korea's state media did not mention any casualties or injuries at the time, downplaying the damage. KCNA reported that there were no holes on the ship's bottom - contrary to initial reports. \"The hull starboard was scratched and a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section,\" the agency said. Kim said on Thursday the accident was caused by \"absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism\". He added that those who made \"irresponsible errors\" would be dealt with at a plenary meeting next month. It is not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has a woeful human rights record. It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents - though it has done this a handful of times in the past. This particular accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar 5,000-ton destroyer, the Choe Hyon. Kim had called that warship a \"breakthrough\" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year. Kim Jong Un has called the shipyard accident a \"criminal act\" and vowed to find those responsible. The failed launch \"severely damaged the dignity and pride of our nation in an instant,\" says the North Korean leader. Seoul has intensified efforts to help North Korean defectors settle into the South. The announcement comes after North Korea confirmed for the first time its soldiers are fighting alongside Russia. It comes just days after Russia's Valery Gerasimov praised the \"heroism\" of North Korean troops.",

    "title": "'It's not fair': Other refugees in limbo as US welcomes white South Africans",
    "article_text": "A man slept outside in a car park overnight in Kenya with his wife and infant son in January, consumed by confusion and disbelief. The family, refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), had been expecting a flight to the US for resettlement in just hours' time. But after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee programme just two days before the family's scheduled departure, the man was told their flight to America was abruptly cancelled – less than 24 hours before take-off. \"I didn't have anywhere else to go,\" the man, who asked to go by the name of Pacito to protect his identity, told the BBC. He had already moved his family from their home, sold his furniture and most of their belongings, and prepared for a new life in America. They remain in Kenya, which is a safer prospect than the DRC, where they fled conflict. They represent just three of the roughly 120,000 refugees who had been conditionally approved to enter the US, but who now wait in limbo due to the refugee pause. Trump's move signalled a major change in the approach that was followed by successive US leaders. Under former President Joe Biden, over 100,000 refugees came to the US in 2024 - the highest annual figure in nearly three decades. Since entering office in January, Trump has moved quickly to deliver on his campaign promise of an \"America first\" agenda that has involved dramatically restricting routes by which migrants can come to the US. The effort has also included an ambitious deportation programme under which people have been deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador against a judge's orders, as well as revoking visas from over a thousand university students, and offering illegal immigrants a sum of $1,000 each to \"self-deport\". The White House has defended its actions by suggesting that many of those being forced from the country are either violent criminals or threaten America's interests. But exceptions to the policies have been made for a select few. The president signed an executive order in February that opened the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners - white South Africans who he claimed were victims of \"racial discrimination\". A plane carrying 59 of them landed at an airport just outside Washington DC earlier this month, in a ceremonious greeting that included the deputy secretary of state. \"It's not fair,\" Pacito commented. \"There are 120,000 refugees who went through the whole process, the vetting, the security, the medical screenings. We've waited for years, but now these (Afrikaners) are just processed in like three months.\" The situation has left Pacito feeling stuck. Since he has sold all of the equipment that he needed to work in his field of music production, for the past few months he has struggled to find odd jobs to earn money for his family. \"It's kind of hard,\" he said. Trump has further justified his decision to accept Afrikaners as refugees in the US because he says they face \"a genocide\" - a message that has been echoed by Elon Musk, his South African-born close ally. Such claims have circulated for years, though are widely discredited, and have been denied by South Africa. However, the call has taken on new animus – particularly among right-wing groups in the US – ever since a law was passed in South Africa in January that allowed the government to seize land from white landowners \"when it is just and equitable and in the public interest\". The post-apartheid-era law was meant to address frustrations around South Africa's disproportionate land ownership; the country's white population is roughly 7% but owns roughly 72% of farmland. Though South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said no land has been taken under the new law, days after it was passed, Trump ordered the US to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the country. A diplomatic feud followed. The fraying relationship was laid bare on Wednesday during a tense White House meeting between the pair. Trump ambushed Ramaphosa on live TV with claims of white \"persecution\" - an allegation Ramaphosa emphatically rejected. Analysts have described the broader foreign policy of Trump's second term as isolationist, with numerous moves made to cut foreign aid and to disentangle the US from foreign conflicts, in addition to reducing immigration. Trump has also terminated tens of billions of dollars in global aid contracts - including funds that supported lifesaving HIV/Aids programmes in South Africa. He has justified the cuts by saying his team identified fraud within the aid spending. The moves appear in stark contrast to the White House's decision to fast-track the arrival of white South Africans - a fact that has been critiqued by refugee advocacy groups. \"Every case of protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution, and the central question here is about fairness and equal treatment under the law,\" Timothy Young from the non-profit organisation Global Refuge told the BBC. \"So if one group can access humanitarian pathways, then so should Afghan allies, persecuted religious minorities and the thousands of other families who face serious threats and who meet the legal criteria for refugee status,\" Mr Young said. Among its other moves, the Trump administration has chosen not to renew the temporary protected status for Afghans in the US, saying \"Afghanistan has had an improved security situation\" and a \"stabilising economy\". They now face deportation. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race, but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, usually white, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who were likely to have been black. Meanwhile, in the DRC, thousands of civilians have been killed by armed militias in recent years, and nearly 100,000 more displaced, according to UN figures. Pacito fled the DRC on foot in 2016, recalling \"guns everywhere I looked\" at the time, and \"no peace\". He said family members of his wife had been killed. Among the others who see the US as an increasingly unlikely place to resettle as refugees is the Hammad family, who are from Gaza but are now living in Egypt. \"After what happened with Trump, I think it will be impossible,\" Amjad Hammad told the BBC. He and his family had applied for the US's green card lottery in 2024 but found out in May they had been denied. He expressed confusion about Trump's concern for the plight of white South Africans over and above other groups. \"What are the Palestinians facing, if the people in South Africa are facing a genocide?\" he asked. More than 53,000 people have been killed across Gaza since 7 October 2023, when Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - the Palestinian armed group that launched a cross-border attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. The confusion voiced by Mr Hammad is similar to the views of Pacito, whose hopes of resettling in the US were dashed in January. Since then, he has been left effectively homeless in Nairobi, drifting from place to place to wherever someone will accept him and his family for a few days. \"Sometimes we get food. Sometimes we don't,\" he said. \"We've been struggling very badly.\" The policy changes on the US side give him little hope that he will be accepted by Trump, but the alternative of heading back across Africa to his home country is unimaginable. \"I can't go back,\" he said. A religion with traditions dating back centuries is attracting young American men. He allegedly imprisoned and tortured the victim for many week in a SoHo home in order to collect ransom. Trade chief Maros Sefcovic said the EU is \"ready to defend\" its interests after Trump threatened 50% tariffs on the bloc. All six on the plane are believed to be dead, including a former drummer for The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent.",

    "article_text": "When Chris Davies's daughter first begged him for a hamster, he wasn't exactly thrilled. But eight-year-old Lily, after hours of research, managed to convince her dad they were not just \"starter pets\" and to welcome one into their home. The NHS nurse bought Popcorn, a hamster he said he knew there was \"something different\" about from the beginning. But nothing could have prepared Chris for the \"surreal\" impact the rodent would have on his life, eventually leading him to the woman he will soon marry. Not long after bringing Popcorn home, Chris' life took an expected turn as he had a \"sudden\" break-up. \"I was broken after,\" he said. Yet during those lonely times, it was Popcorn who offered him unexpected support. \"I thought I'd just be more open-minded and see what this animal was about.\" Chris was surprised to find that Popcorn behaved more like a loyal puppy than a rodent. \"He was following me like a dog,\" he said. \"I got him on the sofa with me, and he fell asleep on my chest. I couldn't believe it.\" For Chris, who struggles with anxiety, Popcorn soon became a source of calm and connection. \"It was just a really beautiful thing. It was mindfulness. \"Being a nurse in the NHS, some days are quite hard and it's really stressful, but Popcorn would just calm me down.\" Lily and other family members began encouraging Chris to post videos of Popcorn's behaviour online. \"I was kind of anxious at first,\" Chris said. \"How many blokes do you see lying on a sofa with a hamster?\" But almost as soon as Chris began posting videos of Popcorn on TikTok, they took off. More than140,000 fans were charmed by Popcorn's unusual personality, his affection and his bond with Chris and Lily. He became, as Chris lovingly described him, their \"micro-dog\". What followed was a bizarre set of events no one could have been predicted, Chris said. As Popcorn gained popularity online, Chris and Lily wrote a book together about the impact that the little critter had on their family, which was then published in May 2024. Then one evening, Chris then received a comment from a fellow Cardiffian, Carrie, telling him his content was \"cute\". The pair got chatting, soon discovering mutual passions, a shared love for animals and even the same profession. \"We were living only a mile apart, but we'd never bumped into each other,\" Chris said. \"It was crazy.\" Chris and Carrie met in person a few months later and when Carrie held Popcorn, Chris said, it was like a something \"clicked into place\". The family, which has now grown to include Carrie and her children as well, sadly lost Popcorn in the summer of 2023. But fast forward to today and Chris and Carrie are engaged, set to marry this December. Their wedding cake will even feature a small tribute to Popcorn, with his name written at the bottom. \"Without him it wouldn't have happened, you know. He was cupid, in a way.\" Chris said. Though Popcorn has been gone for a few years now, his impact remains immeasurable. For Chris, he was more than just a pet. \"There's never be another Popcorn,\" he said. \"He was just a one-off.\" The Brighton inquest into Imogen Nunn's death is continuing.

    "title": "From teenage Arsenal prodigy to convicted drug smuggler",
    "article_text": "As a footballer, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas seemed destined for greatness. But a drug-smuggling conviction has left his career and reputation in tatters. How did things unravel so dramatically for a player once tipped for the top? Hailed by legendary Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a footballer who could \"play anywhere\", Emmanuel-Thomas was marked out early on as having elite potential. Imposing, technically gifted and surprisingly agile, the striker appeared to have the world at his feet. But a career that promised so much at Arsenal faltered and saw him spend years  flitting between the second and third tiers of English football. In 2020 he moved to play in Scotland and was still plying his trade north of the border when, on 18 September, he was arrested at his home in Gourock, near Glasgow. Sixteen days earlier, Border Force officers had stopped two women at London Stansted Airport and found drugs in their cases. It was not a minor haul; they were staring at cannabis with a street value of £600,000. How did it get there? The evidence soon led detectives to Emmanuel-Thomas. Wind back a decade and a half, and things were very different. It is 26 May 2009, and Arsenal's latest batch of academy talents can barely contain their excitement. The young prospects, including Jack Wilshere and Francis Coquelin, have just won the FA Youth Cup. One player in particular has stood out: their 16-year-old captain, Emmanuel-Thomas, who has scored in every round of the competition. \"These young men have a very bright future indeed,\" remarkedone commentator. But despite going on to make five first-team appearances, it was not quite to be for Emmanuel-Thomas. He was shipped out on several loans before leaving the north London club for Ipswich Town. It was a move that excited supporters in Suffolk, who were keen to see what the former Arsenal starlet could produce. However, 71 games and eight goals later, Emmanuel-Thomas had not quite made the mark fans hoped for, and he moved to Bristol City in a player exchange deal. Here, he helped the Robins secure promotion to the Championship and became something of a cult hero, scoring 21 goals in his first season. A move to Queens Park Rangers followed, with subsequent loan spells at MK Dons and Gillingham. But in 2019, Emmanuel-Thomas accepted a transfer to a Thai-based team that would alter the course of his life. It is believed he was tempted into the country's drugs underworld while playing for PTT Rayong, a club that folded in the same year. Despite later moves to an Indian side and several Scottish outfits, including Aberdeen, Emmanuel-Thomas never shook off the criminal connections he made. By the time he took a six-month contract at Greenock Morton, a 40-minute drive from Glasgow, the game was almost up. As helined up for them against Queens Parkon 14 September, he would have surely known the law was about to catch up with him. The women arrested at Stansted were his 33-year-old girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, and her friend Rosie Rowland, 28. Emmanuel Thomas, by then 33, appeared in court charged with orchestrating the attempted importation of drugs, and was sacked by his club. Detectives discovered he had duped Ms Piotrowska, from north-west London, and Ms Rowland, from Chelmsford, into travelling to Thailand with the promise of £2,500 in cash and an all-expenses-paid trip. Their job? To bring home two suitcases each, filled with what they were assured was gold, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. They flew business class from Bangkok, landing in Essex via Dubai. Unknown to them, they were smuggling in cannabis with a street value of £600,000, vacuum-packed inside the four cases. The pair were stopped and arrested by Border Force officers, before being charged with drug importation offences. With the pair in custody, and Emmanuel-Thomas later remanded, police probed how the drugs made it to the UK. They soon found the player was the intermediary between suppliers in Thailand and dealers in the UK, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). With the footballer's encouragement, the women had also made a near-identical trip in July, having been made similar promises of cash and a lavish holiday. On his way to custody, Emmanuel-Thomas even told NCA officers: \"I just feel sorry for the girls.\" Hisfirst court hearing in Septemberwas told he carried out \"extensive research\" into flights and directions, including which airports the women had been going to. David Philips, a senior NCA investigator, said \"organised criminals like Emmanuel-Thomas\" used persuasion and payment to get people to do their dirty work. \"But the risk of getting caught is very high and it simply isn't worth it,\" he added. During several court appearances, Emmanuel-Thomas, of Cardwell Road, Gourock, strenuously denied attempting to import cannabis. However, he changed his plea to guilty at the start of May and restrictions on reporting this werelifted on Wednesday. Charges against both Ms Piotrowska and Ms Rowland were dropped after the prosecution revealed they had been tricked by Emmanuel-Thomas. It followed what David Josse KC described as a \"very thorough investigation\". Emmanuel-Thomas appeared via video link from HMP Chelmsford at his latest court hearing. When he returns to court for sentencing, on a date still to be confirmed, it will not be his first time in the spotlight. But it will be for very different reasons to the day he lifted that trophy aloft in 2009.

    "title": "How Arsenal's comeback queens achieved the unthinkable",
    "article_text": "Renee Slegers was assistant manager to Jonas Eidevall at the start of the season Tears rolling down her face, remnants of gold and red confetti still visible in the background, Arsenal manager Renee Slegers could barely believe what she had just witnessed. Moments earlier, her side lifted the Women's Champions League trophy for the first time in 18 years, havingwon 1-0 in Lisbon to stun European giants Barcelona. It was an achievement that was barely conceivable nine months ago when Slegers was Arsenal's assistant manager and they had lost the first leg of their second qualifying round tie with BK Hacken. The glory was hard to comprehend and Slegers, usually so composed, could not prevent the outpouring of emotion. Memories of Arsenal's historic victory in 2007 have dominated newspapers this week, while Slegers' side joined members of that squad for lunch to reminisce on the special occasion. They defied the odds back then and knew it would take a near-miracle in Portugal to claim a second title, seeking out inspiration in preparation. Arsenal finished third in the Women's Super League last season, meaning they had to come through three rounds of qualifying. They are the first team in Women's Champions League history to play 15 games before lifting the trophy. Written off, titled the \"underdogs\" - even Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati admitted she was \"surprised\" Arsenal had overcome Lyon in the semi-finals - few really gave Slegers' side a chance against the defending champions. With just one win in their opening four WSL matches of the season, their European hopes under threat with defeat by Bayern Munich and a growing sense of unrest among the fanbase, former manager Jonas Eidevall had no choice but tostep down. Players Katie McCabe and Leah Williamson have this week praised the Dutchwoman for \"steadying the ship\" at a time when things were rocky. The atmosphere at Arsenal was far from positive, players needed a lift and Slegers had a big task ahead to turn things around. And turn things around she did. A 4-1 win over Valerenga got them started in the group stages and the results just kept following. Slegers took interim charge in October and it took the club until mid-January to announce her as manager on a permanent basis after going unbeaten in her first 11 games in charge - winning 10 and drawing one. As the season progressed, Arsenal's juggernaut gained momentum and the Gunners reached the knockout stages of the Champions League. They took on the mantle of 'comeback queens' after falling to first leg defeats against both Real Madrid and Lyon in the quarter and semi-finals respectively, but against all odds they turned things around to book their place in Saturday's final. No other British team have ever won the Women's Champions League Slegers and her side had already won in some ways - just getting to the final had seemed out of their reach and as she stated in her pre-final programme notes they had \"done some magical things\" to get there. Arsenal rolled out the red carpet for the event as co-owner Josh Kroenke flew in from Denver and was alongside executive vice-chair Tim Lewis, managing director Richard Garlick and director of women's football Clare Wheatley in Lisbon. Club legends were invited to join them, academy players sat in the stands looking on at their potential futures and around 4,500 fans travelled from London. Supporters had gathered on Pink Street, a vibrant painted road near Lisbon's harbour, decorated with colour and punctuated with noise. Even England goalkeeper Mary Earps had flown in, sporting an Arsenal shirt with her good friend Alessia Russo's name on the back. They were all here for a party but few had dared to dream of victory. 'The next Wiegman' - the story of Arsenal manager on brink of history Arsenal put smile back on my face - Kelly Arsenal win 'ultimate trophy' with 'more to come' Arsenal are the only English club to win the Women's Champions League Their task was to overcome a Barcelona side chasing a third successive European title, a team that has been widely branded as the best domestic side in the world and boasted potential Ballon d'Or winners in almost every position. Barcelona rocked up full of confidence - understandably so - and went about their business as usual. This was nothing new, nothing special, just another final. Arsenal however, had been growing in confidence under Slegers. Those at the club speak of Slegers' calming influence, how she instilled a sense of empowerment and brought out the best of each of her players. They have spoken about feeling \"free\" and being able to express themselves - most of the pre-match media conference comments from Russo and captain Kim Little centred around their \"togetherness\" and \"belief\". Slegers is meticulous in her planning. Little said they had tried to replicate Barcelona's movements in training to work out how to combat it. Several times they failed, until they found the solution. \"It was the perfect execution of a gameplan which as a footballer, is one of the best things,\" said Little. \"It showed in our performance. How we approached the game was very controlled and then we had little pointers of belief as we knew we would need that.\" Slegers did her homework. Earlier in the week she spoke with Emma Hayes - the assistant manager at Arsenal in 2007 - someone who has been to battle with Barcelona on numerous occasions while at Chelsea. She had conversations with 2007-winning manager Vic Akers, while her staff analysed all three of Barcelona's midfielders individually, working out the strengths and weaknesses of Bonmati, Alexia Putellas and Patri. \"There are not a lot of weaknesses at Barcelona. They are on a very high level. We looked at how we could exploit it in the best way possible,\" said Slegers. \"We used all possible tools to disrupt them but stay close to what we wanted to do. The game management was key to why we won.\" This video can not be played Williamson on Arsenal's 'incredible' Champions League triumph over Barcelona Despite all they have achieved against the odds this season, Slegers says the \"scary thing\" is that she believes there is more to come. \"It means so much for everyone who has built towards this but it also means so much for the future,\" she added. \"It motivates us and it shows what we are capable of. If you are part of Arsenal you go for trophies. That is what we want to do.\" Little admitted it may take days for their achievements to sink in but the reality of their success could hit home on Monday with the club planning celebrations with fans outside Emirates Stadium. Their fanbase has developed significantly in the 18 years it has taken Arsenal to replicate their European success and it gives them a platform to build on. With attendances averaging 29,000 at Emirates Stadium, the club is planning for all their home Women's Super League matches to be held there next season. It would be the next step in their growth to expand women's football with Arsenal's hierarchy hoping they can use it as a draw to recruit talent in the transfer window. They have looked at their recruitment strategy - which has struggled at times to compete with WSL champions Chelsea's financial power - employing four lead scouts to cover more of the global talent pool. They identified a crack in their pathway which has stunted the breakthrough of some of their academy talent and are now looking to use the loan system more efficiently. But victory in Lisbon is a tangible example of what can be achieved when everything comes together - and Arsenal have no intentions of standing still. Once the full-time whistle was blown, the celebrations could begin... 1 of 8 Head here to get involved Williamson's rise from Champions League mascot to finalist Arsenal's 2007 European champions - where are they now?

    "title": "Amorim to give Man Utd fans 'apology' for poor season",
    "article_text": "Ruben Amorim has won six Premier League games since taking over as Manchester United head coach in November Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is ready to offer an on-pitch apology to the club's fans at Old Trafford after the final Premier League game against Aston Villa. The Old Trafford side's tortuous campaign will draw to a close against Unai Emery's Champions League qualification hopefuls on Sunday. United's own hopes of entry into European football's most prestigious competition disappeared with theirEuropa League final defeat by Tottenhamin Bilbao. That disappointment added to the misery created by their worst domestic campaign since the 1973-74 relegation season, while they will have no European football next season for only the second time since 1990. But Amorim said it would be a major mistake not to acknowledge the home support by scrapping the traditional lap of appreciation. Amorim tells Garnacho he can leave Man Utd Man Utd inform some staff at training ground they will lose jobs And, while the 40-year-old former Sporting boss has not decided precisely what he will say in his end-of-season address, he said: \"It will be an apology, I think that's clear, I don't have time for an explanation. \"I will be honest with the fans and say what is in my mind and especially my heart.\" It will not be an easy task amid widespread disquiet at owners, the Glazer family, andthe job cuts that minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has instigated. United's supporters will hold another pre-match march to Old Trafford to protest at how the club is being run. However, officials believe the vast majority of supporters share their view that Amorim is the right man to trigger a revival and the coach is happy to speak to them. \"It's tradition and we have to face it,\" he added of the post-match lap of appreciation. \"It will be the biggest mistake if we don't do that. \"I know that the manager addresses the public and I will do that, it's the least I can do. I have an idea what I want to say but I will decide tomorrow.

    "title": "'Aberdeen savour the most perfect game ever played'",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Aberdeen lift first Scottish Cup since 1990 At the end, the pent-up frustration of 35 years came tumbling out, three and a half decades of waiting. It takes its toll. The Aberdeen fans, 20,000-strong and deafening, blasted out their joy while midfielder Ante Palaversa approached a live radio microphone. How do you feel, Ante? A swear word! Followed by another, followed by a hastily abandoned chat. \"Apologies to the listeners. You can understand the emotion. Back to you in the gantry.\" Another attempt soon after. Jack Milne, heroic at the heart of an Aberdeen defence that performed a miraculous metamorphosis from mistake-ridden chumps to hugely resilient champs. What does this mean to you, Jack? A swear word! Milne apologised, but you could understand the agricultural language amid the merry bedlam. Raw emotion. Nothing like it. There was delight and shock in his voice, there was an air of surreality. There was noise thumping in his ears and a beaming smile on his face. If you wanted to know what happiness is then Milne defined it in that moment. Aberdeen end 35-year Scottish Cup wait after stunning Celtic in shootout Best pictures, stories & memories on day of glory for Aberdeen Shinnie 'could retire today and be a happy man' This was a day of days for the Dons, a seismic occasion for the club if not a stunning final. It was scrappy, it was sloppy, it was incredibly tense. It was gloves off, bare-knuckle stuff in all its ugliness. Looked at through a prism of red, it was just about the most perfect game ever played. Aberdeen had the kind of courage that few thought they had, they had belief that nobody could have detected beforehand, they had bottomless fitness levels. It was a win that very few saw coming and it was riotously celebrated because of that. There was a visceral aspect to it, a power that only comes when something momentous has happened. Aberdeen have won plenty of trophies over the years, but looking at their fans it almost felt like a first. For some, of course, it would have been. For many, a first Scottish Cup final win, that's for sure. Willie Miller was in the twilight of his career when Aberdeen last won this trophy. At the end, you looked to him to see if there was any emotion. A grin was the extent of it. On their biggest day in 35 years, Miller kept his shape. When club chairman Dave Cormack joined him on radio, Miller gently chided him about his poor technique when lifting the trophy. \"You need a bit more practice, Dave.\" Win a few more was the happy jist. Not that it was uppermost in their thoughts at the time, but this was a Â£6m win for Aberdeen - maybe more - for it is they and not Hibs who are now guaranteed European football until December. This video can not be played Highlights: Aberdeen 1-1 Celtic (Aberdeen win 4-3 on penalties) Of course, the portents of doom were written all over it for Aberdeen. They were outlandish underdogs. Celtic, with their 5-1s and their 6-0 in games against the Dons this season, were seemingly invincible. Their capacity to score quickly and often against Jimmy Thelin's side was flagged; two in three minutes in one game, three in 11 minutes in another, two in six minutes in a third meeting this year, three in nine in the most recent debacle. Celtic had the scent of a treble in their nostrils and Brendan Rodgers had the air of invincibility in his demeanour. Played 14, won 14 at Hampden. The abnormal had become normal, as he put it. Aberdeen only had vibes. The year of the upset. Crystal Palace, Bologna, improbable finalists in the German Cup, Hibs women winning the league. Maybe there was another shock in the offing, but how many shocks have we actually seen in Scottish Cup finals in the last half century and more. Two. Dundee United beating Rangers in 1994, Aberdeen beating Celtic in 1970. The magic of the Cup rarely stretches to the denouement. There were mutterings about Thelin. Another shellacking and where would he stand?  Since the end of November, Aberdeen have been statistically the worst team in the Premiership. If Celtic did what most expected them to do - win in a relative or complete canter - then Thelin would have lost the faith of many fans. He needed something different and he found it in his formation and in his psychology. A back three for the first time. Milne into the defence after only three starts all season. An end to the Graeme Shinnie at left-back experiment, the veteran having being turned inside out in the tempest of Celtic's attack in recent weeks. None of the tweaks would have made a blind bit of difference had Aberdeen not brought with them a resilience, a concentration, a discipline and a work-rate that was unending. Their organisation frustrated Celtic. This video can not be played Watch all the penalties as Aberdeen win Scottish Cup Rodgers said later that his team were too safe, lacked speed, slickness, precision and personality. What they also lacked was the wit of Reo Hatate and Jota. They were not themselves, but even still they hit the Aberdeen woodwork twice and failed with a glorious one-on-one when Dimitar Mitov, a hero on an afternoon of heroes, saved from Daizen Maeda seven minutes from the end of moral time. Celtic had 21 shots to Aberdeen's five, 81.5% possession to Aberdeen's 18.5%, 15 corners to Aberdeen's four. None of it meant anything, not when Thelin's defence was in the mood to defend with their last breath. You lost count of the number of blocks they had, each one chipping away at Celtic's karma. It wasn't supposed to be like this - and it rarely is. Celtic hadn't lost to Aberdeen in 30 matches. Having conceded an unlucky goal, the Dons then scored one of their own. Two own goals reflected the flawed, madcap nature of this final. There was little shape, little rhythm, little accuracy. There was chaos, there were bodies colliding, players on the floor, coaches going bonkers. In chunks, it was like an under-eights game. Everybody running about with abandon. And it was hard to take your eyes off it. When it went to penalties, the odds were still stacked in Celtic's favour. They don't mind a penalty shoot-out at Hampden. They've won a couple in recent times. Even at that late stage, they were favourites to pull off the treble. Then Mitov saved from Callum McGregor and everything changed. Celtic's brilliant leader laid low. Their aura not the same anymore. One by one the Aberdeen men held their nerve, not just scoring but rifling in their penalties with an authority. Kasper Schmeichel, on a grim day, went the wrong way for the first three of them. Mitov was the man in the end. In recent months he's been criticised for some of the weaknesses in his game, but he's an immortal now, along with the rest of them. Open top bus tour now. European football to come. Hope where before there was dread. The phoenix has risen from the flames. And the party will last a while. This video can not be played Shinnie revels in Aberdeen cup win",

    "title": "Bethell comments 'twisted to suit agenda' - Stokes",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Pope valuable to me - Stokes Captain Ben Stokes said his comments about an immediate return to the England team for Jacob Bethell were \"twisted to suit an agenda\". On Wednesday, the eve of the one-off Test against Zimbabwe,Stokes appeared to hint Bethell would come back for the series against India later in the summerby saying: \"You put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen.\" Any return for Bethell would probably be at the expense of Ollie Pope, who made a majestic 171 as England beat Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs. After victory was sealed on Saturday, Stokes told BBC Sport's Today at the Test: \"That was written to suit an agenda that was being said away from what is in the team. \"I got asked a pretty simple question about Beth. I said put two and two together and he comes back into the squad. But it is unfortunate that you say something and it can get twisted to suit an agenda. \"I made it very clear to Popey the night before this Test that is not the case.\" Bethell, 21, made three half-centuries batting at number three in his debut series against New Zealand before Christmas but missed the match against Zimbabwe because he is playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Indian Premier League (IPL). Bashir takes six to seal England win over Zimbabwe Watch Today at the Test on BBC iPlayer England v Zimbabwe: Bashir bags six as hosts win In a briefing for the written press on Wednesday, Stokes was asked: \"What was the chat with Jacob Bethell? He is the incumbent number three and made a really positive start in New Zealand. He's not here because of the IPL. What's the expectation around him? Does he come straight back in for India?\" Stokes responded: \"All those conversations go on with Rob Key and Brendon McCullum. That stems back to how I wanted that kind of role within my captaincy to be. I don't do the good news, I don't do the bad news. I've got to focus on the group and the 11 guys on the field. \"It's a pretty simple one. We've had to deal with situations like this in the past, not just with the Test guys but the white-ball guys when they've got the IPL overlapping with series and stuff like that. \"If you're smart enough, the series that Beth had out in NZ, obviously he's going to be back in the UK for that India series. So, I think you put two and two together, you probably know what's going to happen.\" Stokes continued: \"It's been great to have someone like James Rew who had an incredible start to his first-class career. Some of the numbers that he's pumped out for a consistent amount of time, to have him here and get to know him as a bloke and have him experience what it's like to be in a dressing room in an international environment, I think it's been great for him. \"Seeing a player is a lot different to seeing what they've done, if that makes sense. He's a seriously, seriously talented lad. I don't think it'll be stupid to say he's probably going to be in an England shirt in the future.\" While neither the question nor Stokes' answer on Wednesday specifically mentioned the England squad or playing XI, the 33-year-old believes his comments about Somerset batter Rew, who was unused member of the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe, made it clear he was referring to Bethell's place in the squad, rather than the XI. Speaking after a three-day victory over Zimbabwe was completed, Stokes told Test Match Special: \"I personally felt that it was a bit of a, not a vendetta, but I got asked a simple question about Bethell, said put two and two together he comes back into the squad, and then all of a sudden it turns into something that suits the agenda of the time.\" While Pope may have been most vulnerable to Bethell, opener Zak Crawley would have been another candidate to make way and also made a hundred at Trent Bridge. Bethell's left-arm spin could have also potentially pressurised off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who took nine wickets in the match. On Thursday, after his innings,Crawley said he had not felt pressure on his place,then on Friday morning Pope said he had\"learned to live with the noise\". Pope also said he had not seen Stokes' pre-match comments, but the captain said on Saturday he discussed them with Pope the night before the Test. Stokes added: \"He is a very important player in this team, not only with his runs at number three, because he has been exceptional since he has been given that opportunity, averaging over 40 now and he is my vice-captain. \"I value his input especially when we are out there in the middle. Not only are his runs great but his leadership has gone from strength to strength.\" Get cricket news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Bordeaux mix beauty and beast to shatter brave Saints",
    "article_text": "Penaud scored 14 tries in eight Champions Cup games this season It wasn't just Damian Penaud celebrating astride a model zebra that gave a surreal air to the Champions Cup final aftermath. On the touchline, Henry Pollock was trying to get to grips with a strange new reality. \"Sometimes it's not your day I guess,\" he told 5 Live Sport. \"Sport can be cruel.\" Or so he has heard. So far, this season, the game has lavished only glory and garlands on the back row star. In this breakout campaign, Pollock had won 14 of the 17 games he had started before today. He began it on the Saints bench and will finish it on a British and Irish Lions tour. On his last visit to this stadium, he scored two tries on his England debut. In the last round of this competition, he skinned Sam Prendergast for an astonishing try in a tremendous victory. He was manhandled by Saracens' back row last weekend, but still emerged victorious. This time though his streak came to a full stop. \"Every time Pollock was anywhere near the ball there was an acceleration in the Bordeaux players to get to him,\" said Paul Grayson, part of the last Northampton team to win Europe's premier competition, on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"They all had eyes on him. \"They singled him out as a difference-maker and he'll have to work out how to deal with that as his career goes forwards.\" Saints coach Phil Dowson later claimed that Bordeaux's players had targetted Pollock after the final whistle, describing an incident in which his player appeared to be grabbed around the throat as \"uncalled for and out of order\". Bordeaux 'out of order' in fracas with Pollock Bordeaux bulldoze Northampton to win Champions Cup Rugby Union Weekly: Champions Cup heartbreak for Northampton Pollock didn't play badly. None of the Northampton players did. The 20-year-old made more metres than any other forward on the pitch. He turned over one ball in the shadow of his own posts and was a key part of a heroic rearguard. For much of the second half, Northampton defended their line like they had been backed up to a cliff edge. At the other end, Pollock twice streaked away for scores that had the Principality's rafters rattling and threatened to turn Saints' resistance into all-out rebellion. On both occasions though, the overworked television match official stepped in to rule them out. The scores didn't stand. And by the final whistle, on the scene of their sucker-punch final defeat by Leinster in 2011, neither did Saints. Their route to victory was always a thin and perilous one. Captain Fraser Dingwall had explained earlier in the week that his side needed to keep the tempo high and ball moving to tire out Bordeaux's heavy brigade up front. He admitted though that doing so flirted with another danger. Because Bordeaux's backline, marshalled by the quicksilver Mathieu Jalibert and laced with the pace of Penaud andLouis Bielle-Biarrey,is the most dangerous in the competition off turnover ball and in broken field. No opposition had managed to strike that balance successfully against them so far. Bordeaux scored an average of 42 points a game in the knockout stages. They averaged more than eight tries a game in the pools. Seven games, seven resounding wins. No-one had even got close. Saints though did get close. After a helter-skelter first half, they were level at 20-20. A combination of a fast start, a couple of glitchy kicks from Jalibert, some doughty defence and a readiness to go toe-to-toe with Bordeaux for ambition bought them parity. When Pollock bolted through for a score that never was early in the second half, it felt like the underdogs might have their day. Bordeaux though had come prepared. Northampton's attempt to drain their batteries was foiled by a Bordeaux bench buzzing with power and six forwards. As they unloaded their replacements, Northampton were squeezed back into their own half. Saints' plan was also undermined by a lack of luck and discipline. Injuries to James Ramm and George Furbank in the first five minutes robbed them of two of their back three and some fluidity. Early in the second half a yellow card for replacement Ed Prowse, for going high on Yoram Moefana, put them on the back foot. Marius Jonker's South African tones regularly interrupted play as well as the TMO helped out with hairline calls, giving Bordeaux time to catch their breath. Bordeaux's triumph was their first in the tournament's history Northampton needed everything to fall their way. In the end, too few things did. Penaud may have been riding a zebra by the end, but a boa constrictor would have been more appropriate given the way his side throttled the life out of the game in the final quarter, keeping Saints pointless in a dominant second half. The stadium public address system throbbed to Sash's 90s dance monster Encore En Fois after the final whistle and it was easy to imagine that, with their upwardly mobile set of stars, Bordeaux will indeed be repeat winners in the next few years. Dingwall was alongside Pollock as he gave his post-match interview. As he has done throughout a run that has been such a welcome break from Saints' dreary Premiership form, the skipper found the right words. \"Tonight, I think we celebrate us and the run we have had,\" he said. \"We didn't come out on the right side of the result, but there is still so much to be proud of. \"We will stick together.\" After the losses of Courtney Lawes, Lewis Ludlam and Alex Waller at the end of last season, and David Ribbans the previous summer, that might be enough. If they stay intact as a group, Pollock, Fin Smith, Tommy Freeman, Ollie Sleightholme, Alex Coles, Tom Pearson, Emmanuel Iyogun and George Hendy are a fine, young core to build on. Sport is cruel, but the future might be kinder on Saints.

    "article_text": "Tommy Watson scored his third Sunderland goal in his 22nd and final game for the club Few people turning up at Wembley for the Championship play-off final would have had Sunderland's Tommy Watson down as the match-winner. Even less so after scanning through the team list in the official programme, with his name not even on it. The anomaly comes from the fact the 19-year-old signed for Premier League Brighton and Hove Albion last monthin a Â£10m deal, with Watson completing the move in the summer. His place in the top flight was assured regardless of what happened in the final, unlike that of his boyhood team. But, having come on as a 73rd-minute substitute, Watson's low curling effort in the fifth minute of added time secured a dramatic, unforgettable comeback win over Sheffield United - and wrote a glorious chapter in Sunderland's history to end their eight-year top-flight exile.

What is also remarkable is that in the first home game at the Stadium of Light last month after the move was announced, Watson was booed by some fans in light of his pending switch to the south coast. Former Black Cats striker Marco Gabbiadini described that response as\"brainless\", but there is no doubt Watson has had the last laugh in a way nobody will ever forget. In his 22nd and final game for the club and with only his third goal - the two others came against Stoke City in December - the teenager delivered in the grandest manner. For head coach Regis Le Bris, the key thing was the squad had no issue with Watson still being involved in these crucial last few weeks. \"It was probably a tough decision for him, but it was clear in our mind and his mind that he was still a player of Sunderland,\" said the Frenchman. \"The group, the squad accepted this decision as well, knowing that he is a good player and that he can help and we don't know what can happen and he had his opportunity this afternoon.\" Watson admitted the end of the season has been difficult, but he delivered a champagne moment that will be remembered for a lifetime. \"After the last few weeks, I've been dreaming of that moment,\" he told BBC Radio Newcastle. \"I'm really happy that it's going to end positively and this monster of a club is back where it belongs. \"It's been tough, but I've learned so much from it. I knew something like that could happen. So I'm just buzzing.\" Watson is the latest of a string of graduates from the club's Academy of Light to make the first team, with Dan Neil, Anthony Patterson and Chris Rigg all in the starting XI. Famous alumni include England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, who was in the crowd to watch his hometown club win promotion. That production line has been a successful one for Sunderland, with sporting director Kristjaan Speakman at the forefront of pushing a youthful approach. Before the final, he said promotion would vindicate the model that Sunderland had chosen in trying to regain their top-flight place. And while Watson's goal will not change his own departure, it may have ensured that players, including Rigg, Neil and Jobe Bellingham, can shine in the Premier League with Sunderland and not elsewhere.

    "title": "Monaco pole 'a big thing' for Norris but there's jeopardy",
    "article_text": "Norris has rediscovered form following some difficult races Lando Norris said his pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix was a \"step in the right direction\" and \"quite a big thing\" after being unhappy with his form since the start of this season. The McLaren driver trails team-mate Oscar Piastri by 13 points in the championship after the Australian's four victories to Norris' one. The pole was Norris' first since the Australian Grand Prix at the start of the season, while Piastri has taken three. Norris said: \"To classify it as a breakthrough, you also need consistency of results. \"I can look at it both ways. It's a breakthrough that I had a good Saturday. For me it's at least a step in the right direction, which I'm very, very happy about. \"But it's one weekend. Consistency is a big part of it, too, and I will be happier if I know and can get to that point where I am confident into every session that I can perform like I did today, because I think my performance was at a very, very strong level. \"If I go into Barcelona and Canada and the next few races and I can perform at this level, that is my goal. But certainly today is a step in the right direction, whether it's a small step or big step, it's a step and that's all I need for now.\" Norris beat Ferrari's Charles Leclerc by 0.109 seconds in an exciting session in Monaco, as pole swapped between Norris and the Monegasque over their runs. Leclerc did one flying lap, while McLaren chose to do two, staying out on track but cooling their tyres in between. Norris took pole, Leclerc snatched it from him, before the Briton grabbed it back again. Norris has been working hard on improving his qualifying performance this season, after explaining that he has been finding it difficult to trust the McLaren car enough to be able to take it consistently to the limit in qualifying. Asked to explain his step forward, he said: \"Things from the car, just it being Monaco and a very different layout, a very different kind of style of driving that's needed here. It's a lot more risk commitment rather than just absolute car balance, in a way. \"And also things that I've been working on to improve, to do a better job. \"Never because I've not had the pace - just more that I've never put it together come Q3. today was probably the first time since Australia that I've really put it all together. \"It's not like I'm driving quicker, it's I'm driving in a better way, in a smarter way. \"But there's been a lot of work that's gone on. For me, even if I was pole in any other track, I think it probably would have been the pole that's meant the most to me. \"It probably means even more that's in Monaco, but more because of what's happened over the last couple of months. It may not seem like a lot, but for me, it's quite a big thing. So, yeah, like I said, a very, very good moment.\" He said he always believed he would get on top of the problem. \"I don't think I have ever doubted what I can do,\" Norris said. \"I have got frustrated. I have been unhappy, because that's normal if you don't win, don't get pole, you're not going to be happy, especially when it's where you should be. It's what the objective is. \"Of course I've had those moments but I have never certainly this year doubted what I am capable of doing and having a day like today backs all that up so I'm happy with that.\" Never normal: Spectating at Monaco will always be a unique experience McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said Norris had done a \"phenomenal job\" in applying the work the team had done with him in recent weeks, and described Norris' performance as \"an important step in the process\" which \"will somehow reassure Lando\". But he added: \"I kind of have a sense that there is quite a lot more to be extracted, so I take this very positively, but I am excited and I look forward to the steps further that we will be able to do in the future.\" Were this a normal Monaco weekend, Norris could be pretty confident of converting his pole into a win because overtaking is so difficult. But new rules this year introduce a mandatory minimum of two pit stops, in an attempt to increase the level of uncertainty. Stella said that the situation facing the teams was \"tricky\" and a \"material threat\" to McLaren's chances of a win. \"As a function of red flags, safety cars, team work, we may see cars helping each other of the same team,\" Stella said. \"The scenarios to consider are definitely many more than what you normally consider, not only in Monaco, but in any other race that we need to prepare.\" Norris snatches Monaco pole from Leclerc Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions How to follow Monaco Grand Prix on the BBC Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "North Korea detains three over warship launch accident, state media reports",
    "article_text": "North Korea has detained three people over an accident that occurred during the launch of a new warship this past week, state media reported early on Sunday. Pyongyang has said that “a serious accident occurred” at Wednesday’s launch ceremony in the eastern port city of Chongjin for a newly built 5,000-tonne naval destroyer, in whichsections of the bottom of the vessel were crushed. The North Korean leader,Kim Jong-un, called the mishap a “criminal act caused by absolute carelessness”. He said the accident damaged the country’s dignity and vowed to punish those found responsible. Those detained are Kang Jong Chol, the chief engineer at the Chongjin shipyard; Han Kyong Hak, head of the hull construction workshop; and Kim Yong Hak, deputy manager for administrative affairs, the Korean Central news agency (KCNA) reported. The KCNA report said the three were “responsible for the accident”. On Friday, KCNA reported that shipyard manager Hong Kil Ho had been summoned by law enforcement. Kim has ordered the ship to be restored before a ruling party meeting in June. KCNA said the rehabilitation plan was pushing ahead. South Korea’s military said US and Seoul intelligence authorities assessed that North Korea’s “side-launch attempt” of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water. KCNA, however, reported that an “underwater and internal inspection of the warship confirmed that, unlike the initial announcement, there were no holes made at the warship’s bottom”, calling the extent of the damage “not serious”. Satellite imagery shows the warship, covered in blue tarpaulins, lying on its side, with the stern swung out into the harbour, but the bow remaining on the side slipway, according to the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Based on its size and scale, the South Korean military said the newly built warship is believed to be similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea launched last month. Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons”, and that it would “enter into operation early next year”. Seoul’s military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight Ukraine. Analysts say the warship involved in Wednesday’s accident may have also been constructed with Russian assistance.",

    "title": "‘Alarming’ rise in regional internet censorship in China, study finds",
    "article_text": "China’s authorities appear to have implemented an enhanced version of the country’sinternet censorship regimein the central province of Henan, subjecting tens of millions of residents to even stricter controls on access to information than people in the rest of the country. Aresearch paperpublished this month by Great Firewall Report, an internet censorship monitoring platform, found that internet users in Henan, one of China’s most populous provinces, were, on average, denied access to five times more websites than a typical Chinese internet user between November 2023 and March 2025. “Our work documents an alarming sign of regional censorship emerging inChina,” said the researchers, who include authors from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Stanford University. China has the world’s most sophisticated and extensive internet censorship regime.Internetusers cannot access most western news websites or social media platforms, including services provided by Google, Wikipedia and Meta. Within what has been dubbed the “great firewall”, online content ismonitored and censoredby a mixture of government authorities and private companies complying with laws that require them todelete any contentconsidered “sensitive”. That includes any information about historical or current events that goes against the Chinese Communist party’s official narrative. The researchers began looking into the topic after internet users in Henan reported that websites accessible in other parts of China were inaccessible in their province. They found that millions of domains that were not blocked by China’s centralised firewall were at some point inaccessible in Henan. By buying servers from internet cloud providers, the authors tested the flow of internet traffic from locations within Henan. They tested the internet’s top 1m domains daily between November 2023 and March 2025, with a gap of several months in 2024. The results showed that the Henan firewall blocked nearly 4.2 million domains at some point during the research period, over five times more than the roughly 741,500 domains blocked by China’s national firewall. The domains that were specifically blocked in Henan were mainly from business-related websites. There have been several finance-related protestsin Henan in recent years, which the researchers speculated could be the reason for the additional controls on access to information about the economy being controlled. In 2022, thousands of people in Henantook part in several demonstrationsafter they were blocked from withdrawing cash from their bank accounts. The crisis escalated when protesters reported that their mobile health codes, part of the pandemic control measures in place at the time, had turned red, preventing them from travelling or entering buildings. Five officials were later punished for abusing the health code system to quell the protests. Other parts of China have also been subjected to enhanced internet controls. In July 2009, following deadly ethnic riots, the Chinese government imposed aninternet blackoutin Xinjiang, a region in western China home to the Uyghur minority, that lasted 10 months. Since then, the use of the internet in Xinjiang has been much more tightly monitored than in the rest of the country. Online activities in Tibet are also strictly controlled. The emergence of a regional censorship regime in Henan is unusual because it is not a region of China that is normally considered especially restive by the Chinese authorities. The researchers could not determine if the enhanced controls were imposed by the local authorities in Henan or the central government in Beijing. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Rapid advances in China’s artificial intelligence companies are a boon to both the censors and those who wish to evade them. China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) recentlyunveiled new surveillance toolsthat can monitor people who use virtual private networks, software that allows people to circumvent the internet firewall. The MPS’s research institute also showcased a tool that it claimed could monitor accounts on Telegram, a messaging app. The tool has already collected more than 30bn messages, the institute claimed. Mingshi Wu, the lead author of the Henan study, who uses a pseudonym to protect their identity, said: “On the one hand, AI could be leveraged to create more sophisticated, adaptive, and efficient censorship and surveillance tools. On the other hand, AI also enables new opportunities for those seeking to understand and circumvent censorship. For example, AI can assist in developing more agile testing tools for detecting censorship.” The Henan Cyberspace Affairs Commission could not be reached for comment.

    "title": "Here come the culture wars: can Queensland’s LNP resist wading into the ideological mire?",
    "article_text": "Only four years ago, some QueenslandLiberal National partyfigures were contemplating the breakup of a political party that couldn’t work out what it stood for. “What is our raison d’etre?”the former party president, Cynthia Hardy, asked senior members in an email. Back then the LNP had lost 11 of 12 state elections. One senior party figure said at the time: “One more loss and the party will surely have to break up. There would be no other option.” Of course, the LNP won the OctoberQueenslandelection convincingly. And political parties don’t tend to be as self-critical after a success. On news of the federal Coalition’s marital difficulties, Lawrence Springborg, who has been a unifying figure as the new LNP president, gave a ringing endorsement of the merged entity that brings Liberals and Nationals under the one umbrella. “The Queensland LNP … has recently won the Brisbane city council election, state election and was the only state or territory to secure the majority of seats and the majority of votes in the recent federal election,” Springborg said. David Crisafulli’s government has been in power for seven months, after running a small target election campaign designed to neutralise almost every potentially divisive issue – especially those thatmight divide the LNP’s membership. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Already there are signs that has created problems for how the LNP governs in Queensland. On one hand, the party came to power with a mandate to seemingly do so little, it has already recycled its first priority – the “adult time” youth crime laws that breach fundamental human rights – andcome back for a second roundthis week. It also appears to have shown an inability to put aside the sorts of culture wars issues that are increasingly damaging moderate Liberals contesting city seats. Analysis of the federal election has shown that conservative parties cannot expect to appeal to urban voters while also leaning into rightwing social issue talking points. And yet the government this week waded deep into the ideological mire when the premier, Crisafulli, and the arts minister, John-Paul Langbroek, reportedly wrote to the State Library voicing concerns about social media comments made by Indigenous author Karen Wyld. The library thenstripped Wyld of her $15,000 black&write! fellowship, less than five hours before it was to have been awarded to her, over comments about the conflict in Gaza. Wyld told Guardian Australia she learned about the decision to rescind her award when she was called by a News Corp journalist. This, it seems, is becoming government process in Queensland, particularly in relation to First Nations people. Crisafulli’s edict to shut down the state’s truth telling and healing inquiry was delivered at a press conference. The head of the inquiry, Joshua Creamer, and First Nations communities learned about it second hand. The government has gone to war with renewables developments:cracking down on windfarmsin a way that means some small coalmines have simpler approval processes. It hasbanned critical gender-affirming caretreatments, including puberty blockers, using a justification thatappears remarkably thin. This week Labor claimed the state government was also cutting “respectful relationship” health education for young people in primary schools after a leaked email from a public servant said the $3m program was for the scrap heap. The government has since denied this, claiming the email public servant had gone “rogue”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Queenslanders have a tendency to spray their votes around, so comparing federal and state elections should always be done with caution. But what the federal result does tell the state party is that city voters don’t want culture or climate wars. And while the LNP administration might think a state election win is grounds for singing the praises of a merged entity, the electoral reality is that Queensland highlights, probably as much as anywhere in the country, a city-country divide that will continue to create fissures within the conservatives. Labor’s working-class heartland in Queensland has always been in blue-collar cities along the coast – Gladstone, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville. Each of those places, at recent elections, has tended more conservative. Revelations about the Flynn MP, Colin Boyce, calling blackoutsa “big political opportunity”might have hurt the Coalition’s city moderates, but clearly didn’t damage Boyce, who increased his margin. At the same time, Liberals must now be viewing one-time strongholds like Brisbane and Ryan as progressive Labor-Greens contests, and seats they cannot win back in the foreseeable future. It was only a few years ago the LNP was stuck in an identity crisis and members were beginning to talk in hushed tones about a demerger. What is clear about the LNP’s 2024 election win is that MPs and candidates put aside those ideological differences and found a new raison d’etre – beating Labor. But it is also increasingly clear that is not likely to hold in the long term. The structural problems appear to be still there. And the tendency towards culture wars and Campbell Newman-style hubris – characteristics that have turned voters off the conservatives in the past – is beginning to show through.

    "title": "‘Hysterical’ criticism of Labor’s super tax plan could thwart needed reform, experts say",
    "article_text": "The “hysterical” criticism of Labor’s plan to trim tax breaks for people with $3m in retirement savings risks undermining needed reforms to make the superannuation system more equitable and sustainable, leading experts say. The authors of two previous government reviews into super suggest the federal government’s proposal might not be perfect but it is “the right way to go”. UnderLabor’s plan, about 80,000 Australians – the wealthiest 0.5% of savers – would pay an extra 15% on earnings of super balances over $3m. Earnings on investments inside super are taxed at 15% in the accumulation phase and zero in the retirement phase. The proposed legislation, whichthe Albanese government hopes will pass the Senatewith the assistance of the Greens, would raise $2bn in additional revenue once fully operational, according to Treasury estimates. Despite impassioned objections to the reforms, the lead authors of two major reviews into Australia’s complex superannuation system have backed the Albanese government’s efforts to begin winding back generous concessions on earnings thatoverwhelmingly favour the wealthiest savers. Mike Callaghan, who deliveredthe Retirement Income Reviewin 2020, said his report clearly identified the need to make the super system more equitable. “We particularly said there is a need in terms of equity to address many of the concessions that favour high-income earners, and in particular the concessions on earnings,” Callaghan, who now serves as the chair of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, said. There was also a need to make the super system more sustainable in the long term, he said. The 2020 review projected that the cost of superannuation concessions would continue to climb over time, and that the driving factor was the tax breaks on super earnings. While declining to comment specifically on Labor’s tax policy, Callaghan said “focusing on concessions on super earnings was the right way to go”. And amid the heated debate, he said “don’t lose sight of the fact that trying to improve the equity of the system is important”. Callaghan said while his report did not make recommendations, it noted in passing that extending the existing 15% earnings tax into the retirement phase “would certainly simplify the system, and it would have a very much bigger budget impact”. There are two controversial elements to Labor’s new super tax. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The first is that the additional levy will be applied to notional changes in the value of the super fund, meaning that those with large balances will need to pay a cash tax on their “unrealised” super gains. The second is that the $3m is not indexed, leading to charges that over the coming decades it won’t just be the wealthiest 0.5% of Australians caught by the change. Jeremy Cooper led a major review into the country’s superannuation system 15 years ago, delivering theSuper System Review reportin July 2010. “Super concessions are really heavily tilted towards the wealthy,” the former Asic deputy chair said. Cooper said Labor’s proposed tax changes were imperfect but still worthwhile, and some of the arguments against the change had been “embarrassing”. Fears that not indexing the $3m threshold would catch an ever higher number of Australians in the policy’s net were overblown. “The hysteria about what will happen in 30 years – have you ever seen a super rule that lasts 30 years? It’s been a bit embarrassing, frankly. “The unrealised gains, that’s controversial and problematic. But if you didn’t do it that way, you probably wouldn’t raise very much tax.” Critical front-page newspaper articles have warned that taxing unrealised gains could mean cash-poor but asset-rich farmers would have to sell their farms to raise money to pay the extra tax. Cooper, however, said that operating businesses and owning farmland through super looked to be “entirely about tax minimisation”, rather than saving for retirement. The introduction of the transfer balance cap, which began at $1.6m in 2017-18, went some way to remove the excesses of the system by restricting the amount of money that could be taken into the retirement phase where earnings are tax-free. “That was a Coalition government that did that, and that didn’t get anywhere near the shrill complaints this is getting. And it was a much lower threshold than $3m,” Cooper said. Bob Breunig, the director of the ANU’sTaxand Transfer Policy Institute, said that residential property and super wealth were “undertaxed”, and agreed that the super concessions were “really heavily tilted towards the wealthy”. “Our tax and transfer system hasn’t adjusted for the fact that old people are wealthy and it needs to adapt to that,” Breunig said. He gave short shrift to complaints in the media about farmers being forced to sell farms to pay for the extra tax: “Running businesses and property portfolios inside super, they shouldn’t be doing that, that’s not what it’s for.” But Breunig, one of the country’s leading thinkers on tax policy, said he would prefer Labor’s bill not pass into law, in the hope of a better future reform to address the issues in the system. “As a purist, I don’t like taxing unrealised gains. If it somehow generated a lot of revenue or made things simpler, I would be in favour of it. But there’s not much revenue, and it makes things more complicated,” he said. Breunig said he favoured a simple limit on how much could be saved within the super system, for example $3m or $4m, and that savers with more than that should be forced to withdraw the excess amount, without penalty, into assets outside super. The former AMP chief executive Andrew Mohl has argued in favour of such a cap. Chris Richardson, an independent economist, has also said that “in a better world we’d have had a 15 percentage-point discount to marginal rates on tax on the way into super, as well as a higher rate of tax on earnings”. “Given we’re not in that world, I think having the $3m super tax is better than not having it, even allowing for the two problems [of] no indexation and taxing unrealised gains,” Richardson said.",

    "title": "Any trade deal with US must be based on ‘respect not threats’, says EU commissioner",
    "article_text": "The European Union’s trade chief has struck a defiant tone after Donald Trump threatened to place a 50% tariff on all goods from the bloc, saying any potential trade deal between Brussels and Washington must be based on “respect not threats”. The US president made his announcement aftervoicing frustration with the pace of progress on a trade agreementwith the EU. The new rates would come into effect from 1 June. The EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, posted on X after a call with the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick: “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both. “The European Commission remains ready to work in good faith. EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” Trump had posted on Truth Social, the social media website he owns: “The European Union, which was formed for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the United States on trade, has been very difficult to deal with.” He went on to claim there was a $250m annual trade deficit with the EU. “Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,” he said, before adding there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US. Trump later told reporters: “I’m not looking for a deal – we’ve set the deal,” before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay. The EU is one of the US’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show. The US imposed a 20% “reciprocal” rate on most EU goods from 2 April, but halved them a week later to allow for trade talks. It has kept 25% import taxes on steel, aluminium and vehicle parts in place and has threatened similar moves on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and other goods. In the same press conference, Trump said hemight add a 25% levy on all Apple and Samsungphonesbought by US customers. That would be in place at the end of June, he said. His commentstriggered falls in leading US stock indexesand European shares, Associated Press reported. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion European politicians said they were disappointed by the news of further tariffs from the US. The French trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, said Trump’s new threats did nothing to help negotiations. “We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond,” he wrote on X. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, told the Ansa news agency that the aim remained “zero-for-zero tariffs”. Speaking to reporters in The Hague, the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, backed the EU’s strategy in trade talks and said the EU was likely to see this latest announcement as part of the negotiations. “We have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US,” he said. Micheál Martin, the Irish taoiseach, said Trump’s suggestion was “extremely disappointing”. He continued: “I have always been clear in my view that tariffs are damaging to all sides.” In a statement posted on X, he said: “Tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade. “We do not need to go down this road. Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.” The head of the EU’s trade committee, the German MEP Bernd Lange, has threatened to apply counter-tariffs against the US. “We will not allow ourselves to be pressured and will objectively attempt to begin negotiations next week,” he said in comments reported by the GermanDie Weltnewspaper. “If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the European Union is strong enough to implement countermeasures, such as counter-tariffs, to offset the economic damage.”",

    "title": "Russia launches one of biggest drone attacks on Kyiv since start of war",
    "article_text": "Russia has launched a large-scale drone and missile attack on Kyiv, injuring 15 people in one of the biggest assaults on the Ukrainian capital since the beginning of the war more than three years ago. The attack came in waves, with Russia launching 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones in the early hours of Saturday, although Ukrainian forces shot down six missiles and stopped most of the drones before they reachedKyiv. The Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said it was a “difficult night for all of Ukraine” and called for more sanctions on Russia in order to achieve a ceasefire. The attack happened hours after Russia and Ukraine began aprisoner exchange of hundreds of soldiers and civilians, the first phase of a deal agreed in Istanbul this week. The agreement was viewed as a first step towards a permanent ceasefire between the two countries. The prisoner swap, in which 1,000 prisoners will be released from each side, was meant to bring Russia andUkrainecloser to achieving a lasting ceasefire deal. Friday’s swap brought 390 Ukrainians back home, and on Saturday the Russian defence ministry said 307 prisoners from each country were exchanged. “We expect more to come tomorrow,” Zelenskyy said, with the Russian defence ministry also saying it expected the swaps to continue. The overnight attack prompted people to shelter in Kyiv’s subway stations. Missile debris and unintercepted bombs caused damage in six districts of the city, with plumes of smoke rising from where they landed. Two children were among those injured in the attacks. The Obolon district was hit particularly hard, with at least five people being wounded and a residential building heavily damaged, Ukrainian officials said. The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted more than seven hours. The strikes followed several days of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia, including Moscow, which prompted the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to vow retaliation. Olha Chyrukha, a 64-year-old from Kyiv, standing outside an apartment building damaged in the bombings, said: “I wish they’d agree to a ceasefire. To bomb people like this …” Other people said their homes had been made uninhabitable by the attacks. Prospects for progress towards a ceasefire seemed dim, with the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying on Friday that the place for the next round of talks had yet to be chosen. Lavrov said Moscow would hand Ukraine a draft text stating its conditions for a truce once the prisoner swap had been completed. Russian negotiators were reportedly preparing a memorandum to serve as a basis for the future peace talks. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “Russia still has not sent its ‘peace memorandum’,” said the Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, in a post on Telegram. “Instead, it is sending deadly drones and missiles at civilians.” International pressure to end the war has been growing in recent months. Donald Trump has made ending the conflict a key foreign policy aim of his administration. The US president asked Ukraine and Russia to attend renewed talks to achieve a peace deal, a request to which both countries have nominally agreed. European leaders have accused Moscow of stalling in peace talks while Russian troops try to capture more Ukrainian territory.On Saturday, Russia’s defence ministry said that it had captured the settlements of Stupochki, Otradne and Loknia in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Sumy regions. After the attack on Kyiv, Zelenskyy accused Russia of seeking to sabotage peace talks, a claim Moscow has also levelled at Ukraine. “With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “Ukraine has proposed a ceasefire many times … It all has been ignored.”",

    "title": "Trump’s Russia sanctions refusal leaves Europe with few options but to wait",
    "article_text": "Gen Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump’s somewhat estranged special envoy onUkraine, is said by some US diplomats to like to joke that the president did indeed say he would solve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hours, he just never specified which 24 hours. Dark humour may be all that is left to Europeans as they absorb not just Trump’s refusal to impose the promised “bone-crushing sanctions” over Russia’s rejection of a 30-day ceasefire but also the increasing signs that the administration will wash its hands of Ukraine and instead focus on forging a new economic partnership with Russia. The mood among the European leaders who heard Trump’s description of his two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday – a call that brought a ceasefire no closer – was said to range from despondent to apoplectic. Accounts vary of whether Trump told the European leaders that Putin did not want peace, or simply that Putin thought he was winning. Either way, no sanctions were imposed. Yet, only 24 hours before, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and sometime Trump golf partner, had spoken optimistically of Trump losing patience with Putin’s prevarications and of the possibility that the US Senate would start the process this week of imposing sanctions drawn up by the president’s close ally Lindsey Graham that would penalise countries that buy Russian oil. The seven hours Stubb had spent in March on Trump’s golf team nursing a tournament victory seemed to have been to no avail. Trump blamed big egos and said the conditions for a deal could only be agreed by the warring parties, “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of”. He said he still thought “something might happen, and if it doesn’t happen I’ll simply step aside and they’ll have to move on”. He continued: “Once again, this was a European matter and it should have remained a European matter.” The vice-president, JD Vance, simply said: “This is not our war.” But days before, Kellogg had referred to a 20-point US peace plan starting with a ceasefire that had been shared with the Europeans, completely contradicting Trump’s claim that only the warring parties could have a view on Ukraine’s future. The episode raises what is now the holy grail of modern diplomacy: how best to influence the US president’s thinking, whether it is over Ukraine, Gaza, Iran or China. A former US diplomat close to the Ukraine talks urged Europeans to be patient with Trump. “He has gut instincts, those instincts are OK, they are not always wrong, he zigzags, and in the case of Ukraine he is most governed by the tactics he needs to get a ceasefire,” the former diplomat said. “He is quite aware and not naive in this. He knows the only reason there is not a ceasefire is because Vladimir Putin wants to wage war. So he knows his target is to pull Putin in tactically. He is dangling rewards – the G8, resource deals, lifting sanctions, summit meetings. “Putin does not want to do this. He has no interest in a ceasefire. He has an interest in eliminating Ukrainian national identity and taking it over. He is playing this out deliberately. He is playing games. He is moving the goalposts almost every day and trying to get everyone to follow him … Trump has continuously made excuses for him, but in the hope he can pull him in.” The former diplomat said Trump had four basic objectives in Ukraine. “Trump genuinely wants a ceasefire and the killing to stop. He wants reciprocity so he will be able to tell the US taxpayer ‘you are not throwing your money away on Ukraine’. He wants to deter Putin from doing it again, but he wants Europe to take the lead in preventing him attacking again. I find that acceptable. “The US and Ukraine are more in alignment on the ceasefire than they have been at any point since Trump took office. Trump has said on several occasions he will not throw Ukraine under the bus as an independent state.” That judgment was confirmed by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who told a Senate hearing this week: “Russia wants what they do not currently have and are not entitled to, and Ukraine wants what they cannot regain militarily. And that’s been the crux of the challenge.” As to the possibility of Trump fulfilling his threat first made in March to hit Russia with punishing sanctions, the Europeans have few options but to wait. They have invested heavily in Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and someone to whom Stubb talks most days. Graham spoke this week to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The former US diplomat said: “Congress cannot force Trump to do anything, but they can be in a position to say we can pass legislation on sanctions to strengthen Trump’s position. The Republicans on the Hill are not portraying this as an alternative to Trump but saying ‘this is how we support his strategy’.” As such, the 80 senators who support Graham’s bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil must also wait for Trump’s green light. Of course, that light may never turn green. Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee: “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.” Moreover, Russian accounts of the two-hour call between Putin and Trump dwell on its warm personal nature and Trump’s praise for Russian sacrifice in the second world war. In return, Putin offered to pen a memorandum on a possible peace accord. No deadlines were agreed. As a result, Europe’s nightmare – Trump walking away from Ukraine – draws nearer. But there are many ways to walk away. Would he turn off the intelligence, unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia and block even lend-lease agreements that would allow Ukraine to buy US weaponry? In the slow transition to Europe taking the lead in supporting Ukraine, Trump can cooperate or be disruptive. “It can be a managed process or chaotic and fractious,” said Jack Watling, of the defence thinktank Rusi. The new US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, told the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn – an annual gathering of diplomats and security experts – that after the Nato summit in June the US would lay out plans for troop withdrawal from Europe. Although Whitaker told his audience the withdrawals would be done in an orderly way, not everyone was reassured. Bruno Tertrais, an associate expert at the Institut Montaigne, said: “The words ‘Trump’ and ‘orderly’ in the same sentence do not inspire confidence.” Some reduction in the 100,000 US troops in Europe is manageable for the continent, given the Biden administration surged roughly 20,000 troops after the Ukraine invasion, but the scale and method of the withdrawal matters. And it is hard for the Nato summit to agree a new set of capability targets if the scale of US withdrawals will not be known until the autumn. “Nato decisions on capabilities will be made without knowing the future US force posture in Europe,” said Torrey Taussig, of the Atlantic Council. “These decisions about capability targets for meeting Europe’s own defences and a ceasefire force in Ukraine are near-term decisions, yet we do not know what America’s contribution to Europe will look like.” The sense of frustration is deepened because the European Nato members feel they have agreed a fiscally demanding package on defence spending in time for the Nato summit that addresses all Trump’s complaints about freeloading. Nato states will adopt a new target over the next five to seven years of reaching 3.5% of GDP spent on hard defence and 1.5% on cybersecurity and defence-related infrastructure investment such as roads and bridges to improve troop mobility. (The aim is for the hard defence component to rise annually by 0.2%.) That might be enough to get Europe over the hump of the Nato summit without Trump exploding but it does not deal with the more fundamental problem of Trump’s benign view of Russia. Stubb argues Europe has to understand Trump’s take on great-power politics and find a way to disabuse him. “What we fail to see in Europe is that the US and its foreign policy doctrine is based on global competition, not Ukraine and Russia. We have to get out of the mindset that the US is only focused on Ukraine. It is not.” Stubb added: “Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.” If Trump’s vision is broadly one of 19th-century great-power spheres of influence, Stubb argues, then it is necessary to convince Trump that Russia is not a great power and is not worth jettisoning Ukraine and its allies for. “We need to explain that Russia is not any more a big power, economically. It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy],” he said. “Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.” The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski offers a variation: that the great power of the future is Europe, not Russia. He argues Putin has “woken a giant” in the continent. “He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we have already doubled our defence spending,” he said. Sikorski predicts that by the end of the decade, when Nato countries meet the new spending targets, Europe will dwarf Russia. “We are a $19tn economy. Russia will be a trillion-dollar economy. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.” But that is five years hence, and the immediate issue is whether Europe and Ukraine, with the US on the sidelines, have the means to make Putin reassess the price of victory. Watling, the defence analyst, argued that Ukraine risks leaving gaps on an extended frontline this summer, but if it can survive then Russia will have exhausted its stocks and be reliant on new production, making its war machine more vulnerable to international supply chains. He said Ukraine’s problem was not manpower but training and ammunition. Either way, iron has entered the soul of European leaders. They fear Trump is unpersuadable and set on a different course, leaving Europe as the protector of Ukraine. Kaja Kallas, Europe’s foreign policy chief, said she had been through the five stages of grief over the transatlantic relationship and reached acceptance, but even so she cannot hide the loss. “The issue of trust is like a vase,” she said. “You broke the vase, you can glue it back together, but it is not the same vase.”",

    "title": "Israeli airstrike kills nine of Gaza doctor’s 10 children",
    "article_text": "An Israeli airstrike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor, killing nine of her 10 children while she was on duty at her hospital. Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a paediatric specialist at al-Tahrir hospital within the Nasser medical complex, was treating victims of ongoing Israeli attacks across the Palestinian territory on Friday when she received the bodies of nine of her children killed by a strike in Khan Younis. The eldest of the children was 12. Nasser hospital reported that one of Najjar’s children and her husband were injured but survived. Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital, told the BBC he had operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy. Groom said he had been told the father, who is also a doctor, had “no political and no military connections and doesn’t seem to be prominent on social media”. Footage shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry – and verified by the BBC – shows bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of the building near a petrol station in Khan Younis. The news was confirmed by the hospital in Khan Younis where Najjar works, according to the BBC. Her husband had just returned home after accompanying her to work when the building was struck by Israeli airstrikes. “Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us,’’ Youssef al-Najjar, a relative, told Agence France-Presse. “We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!” Mohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told the Guardian: “Dr Alaa al-Najjar watched with her own eyes as the charred bodies of her seven children were pulled from beneath the rubble – while two remain missing – all while she was on duty at Nasser medical complex. “Harrowing details recounted by Ali al-Najjar paint one of the most heartbreaking tragedies to befall a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.” It was later reported that nine children had died. Groom, who is volunteering at Nasser hospital, attended to al-Najjar’s surviving child, Adam.“The last patient on my list today was an 11-year-old boy who seemed much younger as we lifted him on to the operating table,” Groom told the Guardian. “His injuries were bad enough but the background, I think, was worse. His father was very badly injured but nine of his brothers and sisters were killed.” “It is unimaginable,” said Groom. “The father [al-Najjar’s husband] is a physician here at Nasser hospital. We’ve asked about him and he has no political or military connections … it is a particularly sad day.”Dr Victoria Rose, who is volunteering alongside Groom, received a video of the aftermath of the attack. “The video shows all of the children being pulled out of the fire and they are absolutely charcoaled to a crisp. It is so horrific,” she said. On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the Guardian: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis. “The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.” Thee IDF said it had targeted more than 100 sites across the Gaza Strip over the course of the day, as it intensifies its military offensive despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper intomalnutrition and famine. At least 79 people have been killed in Israeli strikes acrossGazain a 24-hour period, leading up to Saturday evening, the territory’s health minister said, adding that the death toll was expected to rise due to ongoing attacks. On Friday, 30 people and members of the Dardouna family were killed in airstrikes, including very young children. One of the photos – shared by newly awarded Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Mosab Abu Toha – shows the body of a girl less than a year old being pulled from the rubble, still wearing her pyjamas. Hamas described the airstrike on the home of Najjar as “a horrific massacre”, adding: “This heinous crime clearly expresses the sadistic nature of the occupation, and the level of the deep-rooted spirit of revenge that drives Netanyahu and his gang of murderers and human monsters.” Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupiedPalestinian territories, said the attack represented a “distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide”. Israel may start allowing aid groups operating in Gaza to take charge of non-food assistance as pressure mounts to get more aid into the battered territory, according to a letter obtained by the Associated Press. The letter says food distribution would be left up to a newly established group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which is backed by the US and Israel but is not yet up and running. Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid but the United Nations and aid groups deny there is significant diversion. Israel had blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza for nearly three months, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. Experts have warned of a high risk of famine, and international criticism and outrage over Israel’s offensive has escalated.",

    "title": "Israeli soldiers accused of widespread use of human shields in Gaza – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you canread more on this story here SeveralPalestiniansandIsraelisoldiers have told the Associated Press (AP) that troops are systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields inGaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen. They told the AP that the practice has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war. The AP spoke with seven Palestinians who described being used as shields inGazaand theoccupied West Bankand with two members of Israel’s military who said they engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law. In response to these allegations, Israel’s military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields – a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Israeli officials blame the militants for the civilian death toll in its offensive that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and “all such orders are routinely emphasised to the forces.”The military said it is investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions, but would not provide the AP with details. The news agency said that the Israeli military did not answer questions about the reach of the practice or any orders from commanding officers. Rights groups say Israel has used Palestinians as shields in Gaza and the West Bank for decades. Thesupreme courtoutlawed the practice in 2005, but the groups continued to document violations, reports the AP.Experts say this war is the first time in decades the practice – and the debate around it – has been so widespread. More on this story in a moment, but first, here are some other key updates: The Israeli army reported that 83 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom Crossing on Friday, after security inspections. The aid included food, medical equipment and medicines. The UN has called for more aid in Gaza to meet the territory’s “massive needs”.In its latest humanitarian update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said it “stressed once again that the small amounts of supplies being allowed into the Gaza Strip are nowhere near enough to roll back the extreme deprivation that Gaza’s population is facing”. UN secretary general António Guterres said on Friday that Palestinians were enduring “the cruellest phase” of the war in Gaza, where more than a dozen food trucks were looted after the partial easing of a lengthy Israeli blockade. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least six people on Saturday across the Palestinian territory, where Israel has ramped up its military offensive in recent days. “Our teams have recovered at least six dead,” civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). More than 40 leading Jewish organisations issued a joint set of urgent requests from the US governmentafter Wednesday’s deadly shooting outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum, Haaertz reported. It is approaching 6pm inGaza CityandTel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the developments on today’s blog: Several Palestinians and Israeli soldiers have told the Associated Press (AP) that troops are systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza,sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen.They told the AP that the practice has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war. In response to the allegations, Israel’s military said it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields – a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli strikes killed at least 15 people on Saturday across the Palestinian territory.Civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP) the dead included a couple who were killed with their two young children in a pre-dawn strike on a house in the Amal quarter of the southern city of Khan Younis. To the west of the city, at least five people were killed by a drone strike on a crowd of people that had gathered to wait for aid trucks, he said. The Israeli military said it was unable to comment on individual strikes without their “precise geographical coordinates”. In a statement, the Israeli military said that over the past day the air force had struck more than 100 targets across the territory, including members of “terrorist organisations in theGazaStrip, military structures, underground routes and additional terrorist infrastructure”. In its latest humanitarian update on Friday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) called for more aid inGazato meet the “massive needs” of the territory.Ocha said “the small amounts of supplies being allowed into the Gaza Strip are nowhere near enough to roll back the extreme deprivation that Gaza’s population is facing”. It also pointed to a statement by the World Health Organization (WHO) who warned on Thursday that the intensification of hostilities had “brought Gaza’s already weakened health system to a breaking point”.Ocha said the WHO’s warning followed an attack on al-Awda hospital, in northern Gaza, where patient triage tents – including one provided by WHO – caught fire. All medical supplies in the warehouse were burnt and vehicles in the basement had been left destroyed, it added. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it killed a Palestinian, who it claimed was trying to stab soldiers at a military checkpoint near Hebron in the West Bank, on Saturday afternoon.There were no casualties reported among IDF troops. The incident happened around the Tamar checkpoint, according to Israeli newspaper Maariv. Israelis will hold rallies around the country tonight to call for a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the Times ofIsrael. An anti-government rally will begin at 7pm local time at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. A protest led by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum is expected to be held outside the city’s Kirya military headquarters. The United Nations secretary general said on Friday that Palestinians were enduring “the cruelest phase” of the war in Gaza, where more than a dozen food trucks were looted after the partial easing of a lengthy Israeli blockade.The UN’s António Guterres said “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict”, adding that Israel “must agree to allow and facilitate” humanitarian deliveries. The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday that 15 of its “trucks were looted late last night in southern Gaza, while en route to WFP-supported bakeries”.“Hunger, desperation, and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming, is contributing to rising insecurity,” the UN body said in a statement, calling on Israeli authorities “to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster”. Gaza civil defence agency official Mohammed al-Mughayyir told Agence France-Presse (AFP) at least 71 people were killed, while “dozens of injuries, and a large number of missing persons under the rubble have been reported as a result of Israeli airstrikes” on Friday. Syria on Saturday hailed the Trump administration’s lifting of US sanctions, as Washington hopes to open a new chapter in its relations with Damascus.“The Syrian Arab Republic welcomes the decision from the American government to lift the sanctions imposed on Syria and its people for long years,” a foreign ministry statement said. Five al-Qaida members have been killed in a strike blamed on the United States in southern Yemen, two Yemeni security sources told AFP on Saturday.One of the security source added that, though the names of those killed in the strike were not known, it was believed one of al-Qaida’s local leaders was among the dead. UK ministers are under pressure from inside and outsideLabourto recognise Palestinian statehood at a UN conference next month, with party grandees arguing it would bolster prospects for peace and demonstrate moral leadership amid escalating tensions. Conservative MPs privately support calls by prime minister Keir Starmer and the UK’s allies for Israel to cease its war in Gaza, one Tory has claimed. Mark Pritchard, Conservative MP for the Wrekin, also said he believed that the prime minister was on the “right side of history” and humanity, in an interview with broadcaster LBC. The African Union (AU) called for a permanent ceasefire in Libya on Saturday after deadly clashes in the capital earlier this monthand demonstrations demanding the prime minister’s resignation. On Saturday, the AU’s peace and security council condemned the recent violence, calling for an “unconditional and permanent ceasefire”. Egypt said on Saturday it had flown 71 nationals home from the Libyan capital Tripoli. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was holding talks with Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa in Istanbul on Saturday, broadcaster CNN Turk and state media said. State broadcaster TRT Haber published photos of al-Sharaa shaking hands in Erdoğan’s offices at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. Conservative MPs privately support calls by prime ministerKeir Starmerand theUK’s allies forIsraelto cease its war inGaza, one Tory has claimed, according to the PA news agency. Mark Pritchard, Conservative MP for theWrekin, also said he believed that the prime minister was on the “right side of history” and humanity, in an interview with broadcaster LBC. Pritchard would not be drawn into attacking his party leaderKemi Badenoch, who has criticised the prime minister’s sanctions on Israeli settlers, as well as his joint statement made earlier this week with the leaders ofFrance andCanadaon theGazaconflict.Speaking to LBC, Pritchard said: Half the population of Gaza are children. They are being literally bombed to bits every single day. They are being slowly starved. It’s absolutely right the UK prime minister, who so happens to be a Labour prime minister right now, would stand up on the right side. I push it back to the Israeli prime minister. I think Keir Starmer and those standing up for the children of Gaza are on the right side of history, the right side of humanity and are making the right moral judgment. According to the PA news agency, Pritchard, who self-describes as strongly pro-Israel, said he had “changed to a position where I think we need to recognise a Palestinian state” immediately, having previously thought detailed groundwork was needed before this step was taken. He said: It may be symbolic, but I think it will be a huge symbol of support both for the Israelis that want to see that and also for the Palestinians. But the key point at the moment is the Israeli government need to be held to account. I support the UK prime minister and many more, by the way, in the British Conservative party are coming up to me privately at the moment. On Friday, Badenoch told broadcasters she was “not surprised” Starmer had been criticised by his Israeli counterpart. She suggested that breaking off trade deal talks with Israel over the conflict in Gaza and settler violence in theWest Bankwere not the “right way” to send a message to Netanyahu’s government. Pritchard told LBC he was “not coming here to attack” his party leader. He added: I’m coming on to support Kemi on the comments on antisemitism, supporting the prime minister on his strong stand, finally, on what’s going on in Gaza. Israelis will hold rallies around the country tonight to call for a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas inGaza, according to the Times ofIsrael. An anti-government rally will begin at 7.00pm local time at Habima Square inTel Aviv. A protest led by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum is expected to be held outside the city’s Kirya military headquarters. Earlier today, thousands marched inKiryat Bialik, calling for the release ofMatan Angrest, an IDF soldier and resident of the Haifa suburb, who was kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and remains in captivity. The IDF says it killed a Palestinian who it claimed was trying to stab soldiers at a military checkpoint nearHebronin the West Bank this afternoon. There were no casualties reported among IDF troops. The incident happened around the Tamar checkpoint, according to Israeli newspaper Maariv. Here are some more images coming in today via the newswires: Fiveal-Qaidamembers have been killed in a strike blamed on theUnited Statesin southernYemen, two Yemeni security sources told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday. “Residents of the area informed us of the US strike … five al-Qaida members were eliminated,” said a security source inAbyanprovince, which borders the seat of Yemen’s internationally recognised government inAden. “The US strike on Friday evening north of Khabar al-Maraqsha killed five,” a second source told AFP, referring to a mountainous area known to be used by al-Qaida. The second security source added that, though the names of those killed in the strike were not known, it was believed one of al-Qaida’s local leaders was among the dead. Gaza’s civil defence agencysaid thatIsraelistrikes killed at least 15 people on Saturday across thePalestinianterritory.

To the west of the city, at least five people were killed by a drone strike on a crowd of people that had gathered to wait for aid trucks, he said. At Khan Younis’sNasser hospital, tearful mourners gathered around white-shrouded bodies outside, reports AFP. “Suddenly, a missile from an F-16 destroyed the entire house, and all of them were civilians – my sister, her husband and their children,”Wissam Al-Madhountold the news agency. “We found them lying in the street. What did this child do to [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu?” The Israeli military said it was unable to comment on individual strikes without their “precise geographical coordinates”, reports the AFP. In a statement, the military said that over the past day the air force had struck more than 100 targets across the territory, including members of “terrorist organisations in theGazaStrip, military structures, underground routes and additional terrorist infrastructure”.

TheAfrican Union (AU)called for a permanent ceasefire inLibyaon Saturday after deadly clashes in the capital earlier this month and demonstrations demanding the prime minister’s resignation, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Despite a lack of a formal ceasefire, the clashes mostly ended last week, with theLibya defence ministrysaying this week that efforts towards a truce were “ongoing”. On Saturday, the AU’s peace and security council condemned the recent violence, calling for an “unconditional and permanent ceasefire”. In a statement on X, the council urged “inclusive, Libyan-led reconciliation”, adding that it “appeals for no external interference”. In its latest humanitarian update on Friday, theUN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha)called for more aid inGazato meet the “massive needs” of the territory. Ocha said “the small amounts of supplies being allowed into the Gaza Strip are nowhere near enough to roll back the extreme deprivation that Gaza’s population is facing”. It also pointed to a statement by theWorld Health Organization (WHO)who warned on Thursday that the intensification of hostilities had “brought Gaza’s already weakened health system to a breaking point”. Ocha said the WHO’s warning followed an attack onal-Awda hospital,in northern Gaza, where patient triage tents – including one provided by WHO – caught fire. All medical supplies in the warehouse were burnt and vehicles in the basement had been left destroyed, it added. It listed four major hospitals –KamalAdwan,Indonesia,Hamad and European Gaza– as having had to suspend medical services because of hostilities, attacks or displacement orders in their areas. Egypthas flown 71 nationals home from theLibyancapitalTripoliafter deadly clashes between rival militias in the city earlier this month, the foreign ministry said. Friday’s special flight by flag carrierEgyptAir“enabled the repatriation of 71 Egyptian citizens who had expressed a desire to come home”, the ministry said, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). From 12 May to 15, the Libyan capital saw fighting between an armed group aligned with the Tripoli-based government and factions it has sought to dismantle. The clashes, which saw artillery exchanges in the city centre, killed at least eight people, according to theUnited Nations. Although relative calm has since returned to the city, the situation remains highly volatile as calls grow for the resignation of prime ministerAbdulhamid Dbeibah. Turkeyevacuated 82 of its nationals from Tripoli on a similar repatriation flight last week, reports AFP. TheUnited Nationssecretary general said on Friday thatPalestinianswere enduring “the cruelest phase” of the war inGaza, where more than a dozen food trucks were looted after the partial easing of a lengthyIsraeliblockade. Gazacivil defence agencyofficialMohammed al-Mughayyirtold Agence France-Presse (AFP) at least 71 people were killed, while “dozens of injuries, and a large number of missing persons under the rubble have been reported as a result of Israeli airstrikes” on Friday. The UN’sAntónio Guterressaid “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring what may be the cruelest phase of this cruel conflict”, adding that Israel “must agree to allow and facilitate” humanitarian deliveries. According to AFP, Guterres noted that of the nearly 400 trucks cleared to enter Gaza in recent days, only 115 were able to be collected. He added in a statement. In any case, all the aid authorised until now amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required. “Meanwhile, the Israeli military offensive is intensifying with atrocious levels of death and destruction,” he said. TheWorld Food Programmesaid Friday that 15 of its “trucks were looted late last night in southern Gaza, while en route to WFP-supported bakeries”. “Hunger, desperation, and anxiety over whether more food aid is coming, is contributing to rising insecurity,” the UN body said in a statement, calling on Israeli authorities “to get far greater volumes of food assistance into Gaza faster”. Here are some of the latest images coming in via the newswires: Syriaon Saturday hailed the Trump administration’s lifting ofUSsanctions, asWashingtonhopes to open a new chapter in its relations withDamascus, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). US presidentDonald Trumpsurprised many with his announcement of the new policy on aGulftour earlier this month, during which he shook hands with Syria’s interim presidentAhmed al-Sharaa. Trump said he wanted to give the war-torn country’s new rulers “a chance at greatness” after their overthrow of longtime rulerBashar al-Assadin December. “The Syrian Arab Republic welcomes the decision from the American government to lift the sanctions imposed on Syria and its people for long years,” a foreign ministry statement said, according to AFP. It described the move as “a positive step in the right direction to reduce humanitarian and economic struggles in the country”. Israeliarmed forces carried out an airstrike on the town ofToulin southernLebanon, killing one person and injuring another. The strikes began on Thursday afternoon and the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for residents of Toul, just outside the city ofNabatieh, before carrying out an airstrike there. UKministers are under pressure from inside and outsideLabourto recognisePalestinian statehoodat aUNconference next month, with party grandees arguing it would bolster prospects for peace and demonstrate moral leadership amid escalating tensions.Alf Dubs, the veteran Labour peer and Holocaust survivor, said the symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state would offer Palestinians “the self-respect they’d have if they had a proper state,” and provide them a stronger footing in any future peace negotiations. “Even if it doesn’t lead to anything immediately, it would still give Palestinians a better standing,” Lord Dubs said. “Symbols matter.”The former cabinet ministerPeter Hainechoed the call, warning that “delaying recognition until negotiations are concluded simply allows Israel’s illegal occupation to become permanent”. Lord Hain argued that formal recognition should be “a catalyst, not a consequence” of peace talks. At the first preparatory meeting inNew Yorkbefore a UN conference on a two state solution due to be held between 17 and 20 June,Saudi Arabiaurged countries to recognise Palestine as a state, saying that “recognition should be seen as a precondition for peace, and not its product”. The conference is seen as a potential moment when states such asFranceand the UK that have yet to recognise Palestine take what would be a momentous diplomatic step. Here is more on the report by the Associated Press (AP) ofIsraelisoldiers being accused of the widespread use of human shields inGaza: The two Israeli soldiers who spoke to the AP – and a third who provided testimony to Israeli non-governmental organisationBreaking the Silence– said commanders were aware of the use of human shields and tolerated it, with some giving orders to do so. Some said it was referred to as the “mosquito protocol” and thatPalestinianswere also referred to as “wasps” and other dehumanising terms.The soldiers said they first became aware human shields were being used shortly after 7 October 2023, whenHamasattacked Israel, and that it became widespread by the middle of 2024. Orders to “bring a mosquito” often came via radio, they said – shorthand everyone understood. Soldiers acted on commanding officers’ orders, according to the officer who spoke to the AP.He said that by the end of his nine months in Gaza, every infantry unit used a Palestinian to clear houses before entering. “Once this idea was initiated, it caught on like fire in a field,” the 26-year-old said. “People saw how effective and easy it was.”He described a 2024 planning meeting where a brigade commander presented to the division commander a slide reading “get a mosquito” and a suggestion they might “just catch one off the streets”.The officer wrote two incident reports to the brigade commander detailing the use of human shields, reports that would have been escalated to the division chief, he said. The Israeli military said it had no comment when asked whether it received them.One report documented the accidental killing of a Palestinian, he said – troops did not realize another unit was using him as a shield and shot him as he ran into a house. The officer recommended the Palestinians be dressed in army clothes to avoid misidentification.He said he knew of at least one other Palestinian who died while used as a shield – he passed out in a tunnel. In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and “all such orders are routinely emphasised to the forces.” The military said it is investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions, but would not provide details. Gaza’s civil defence agencysaidIsraelistrikes killed at least six people on Saturday across thePalestinianterritory, whereIsraelhas ramped up its military offensive in recent days. “Our teams have recovered at least six dead,” civil defence agency spokespersonMahmud Bassaltold Agence France-Presse (AFP). He said a couple were killed with their two young children in a pre-dawn strike on a house in theAmalquarter of the southern city ofKhan Younis. Another two people were killed in a strike on theNuseirat refugee campin the centre of the territory, he said. The Israeli military said it was unable to comment on individual strikes without their “precise geographical coordinates”. SeveralPalestiniansandIsraelisoldiers have told the Associated Press (AP) that troops are systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields inGaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen. They told the AP that the practice has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war. The AP spoke with seven Palestinians who described being used as shields inGazaand theoccupied West Bankand with two members of Israel’s military who said they engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law. In response to these allegations, Israel’s military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields – a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Israeli officials blame the militants for the civilian death toll in its offensive that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and “all such orders are routinely emphasised to the forces.”The military said it is investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions, but would not provide the AP with details. The news agency said that the Israeli military did not answer questions about the reach of the practice or any orders from commanding officers. Rights groups say Israel has used Palestinians as shields in Gaza and the West Bank for decades. Thesupreme courtoutlawed the practice in 2005, but the groups continued to document violations, reports the AP.Experts say this war is the first time in decades the practice – and the debate around it – has been so widespread. More on this story in a moment, but first, here are some other key updates: The Israeli army reported that 83 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom Crossing on Friday, after security inspections. The aid included food, medical equipment and medicines. The UN has called for more aid in Gaza to meet the territory’s “massive needs”.In its latest humanitarian update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said it “stressed once again that the small amounts of supplies being allowed into the Gaza Strip are nowhere near enough to roll back the extreme deprivation that Gaza’s population is facing”. UN secretary general António Guterres said on Friday that Palestinians were enduring “the cruellest phase” of the war in Gaza, where more than a dozen food trucks were looted after the partial easing of a lengthy Israeli blockade. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least six people on Saturday across the Palestinian territory, where Israel has ramped up its military offensive in recent days. “Our teams have recovered at least six dead,” civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP). More than 40 leading Jewish organisations issued a joint set of urgent requests from the US governmentafter Wednesday’s deadly shooting outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum, Haaertz reported.",

    "title": "Israel investigates use of Palestinians as human shields by its forces in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Israel is investigating “several cases” involving soldiers who have forced Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza, sending them into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen. “The use of Palestinians as human shields, or otherwise coercing them to participate in military operations, is strictly prohibited in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] orders,” the Israeli army said in a statement. “Allegations of conduct that does not comply with these directives and procedures are examined. In several cases, investigations by MPCID [Israeli military police criminal division] were opened following suspicions of involving Palestinians in military missions.” Earlier on Saturday, the Associated Press reported that several Palestinians and Israeli soldiers had said troops were systematically forcing Palestinians to act as human shields inGaza. They said the practice had “become ubiquitous during 19 months of war”, AP reported. Seven Palestinians described being used as shields in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, and two members of Israel‘s military said they had engaged in the practice, which is prohibited by international law. Rights groups expressed alarm, saying it had become standard procedure and used increasingly in the war. “These are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse,” said Nadav Weiman, the executive director of Breaking the Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers who have collected testimonies about the practice from within the military. “Israel rightly condemns Hamas for using civilians as human shields, but our own soldiers describe doing the very same,” Weiman told AP. One alleged victim, Abu Hamadan, said he was detained in August after being separated from his family, and soldiers told him he had help with a “special mission”. For 17 days he was forced to help search houses and inspect every hole in the ground for tunnels, he said. Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said. The two Israeli soldiers who spoke to the AP – and a third who provided testimony to Breaking the Silence – said commanders were aware of the use of human shields and tolerated it, with some giving orders to do so. Some said it was referred to as the “mosquito protocol” and that Palestinians were also referred to as “wasps” and other dehumanising terms. The soldiers, who said they were no longer serving in Gaza, claimed the practice sped up operations, saved ammunition and spared combat dogs from injury or death. In October,the Guardian collected testimoniesfrom former Palestinian detainees which were largely consistent with the reporting by AP. The IDF said the investigations were ongoing but provided no more details. The forcible use of Palestinian detainees to enter houses and tunnels in Gaza first became public in footage broadcast byAl Jazeera televisionin June and July 2024. An investigation bythe Israeli newspaper Haaretzin August gathered testimony from Israeli soldiers who said the Palestinians used as shields were known as “shawish”, a word of Turkish origin meaning “sergeant”. The soldiers suggested it was an institutionalised tactic approved by senior officers. In 2002, Israel’s high court issued an injunction prohibiting the IDF from using what was known as the “neighbour procedure”, detaining a Palestinian in an area of unrest and ordering the detainee to knock on the doors of their neighbours and oversee the clearance of their houses. The use of human shields continued, however. In 2010, two IDF staff sergeants were demoted for forcing a nine-year-old Palestinian boy to open a number of bags suspected of containing explosives.

Lord Hain argued that formal recognition should be “a catalyst, not a consequence” of peace talks. At the first preparatory meeting in New York before a UN conference on a two state solution due to be held between 17 and 20 June, Saudi Arabia urged countries to recognise Palestine as a state, saying that “recognition should be seen as a precondition for peace, and not its product”. The conference is seen as a potential moment when states such as France and the UK that have yet to recognise Palestine take what would be a momentous diplomatic step. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, indicated last month that Paris may recognise Palestine, joining 147 other countries, but said he wanted to do so at a UN conference in New York in June as part of a wider process. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy,has confirmed to parliamenthe has been in discussions with the French about recognition, but also said he would not simply support a gesture with no practical impact. The Guardianreported last weekthat the British view is that France was very likely to decide the time was not right to make the announcement. The UK’s official position is that it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only at the point of maximum impact. The pressure has been building within Labour’s parliamentary ranks as 69 MPs and six peers earlier this month signed a joint letter urging the prime minister to seize what they described as a “unique window of opportunity” to recognise Palestinian statehood. The Guardian understands that the letter – which was coordinated by the chairs of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, Sarah Owen and Andrew Pakes – was also signed by several serving ministers. In a concept note for June’s UN conference, France and Saudi Arabia, the two co-chairs of the conference say the ambitious aim of the international conference in June “would not be to ‘revive’ or to ‘relaunch’ another endless process, but to implement, once and for all, the two-state solution”. The call to implement the two-state solution has become even more urgent in the context of illegal settlements and other illegal unilateral measures, violence, hate speech and the ongoing plans and actions undertaken for the forcible displacement and dispossession of Palestinians. With eight working parties covering all the issues surrounding a two-state solution, each nation has been asked “to highlight the actions they are willing to undertake, individually or collectively, in fulfilment of their obligations and in support of the international consensus on the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the two-state solution”. Alex Ballinger, a Labour backbencher and member of the foreign affairs select committee, said it was time for the UK to “show principled leadership,” adding: “We can no longer speak in platitudes about two states while blocking the very steps that could help make one of them real.”Afzal Khan, a former shadow minister and longtime campaigner on Palestinian rights, said Labour must act on its internationalist values. “Recognition would now be a positive first step towards securing a peaceful two-state solution, end unlawful settlement expansions and blockades, and unlock the diplomatic and humanitarian pathways to lasting justice,” he said, warning that the UK risks “dragging its feet” while 147 other countries have already recognised a Palestinian state.",

    "article_text": "Indian border troops have shot dead a Pakistani man they say crossed the international frontier and did not stop when challenged. The shooting occurred two weeks after conflict erupted between the two nuclear-armed countries that led to four days of violence and more than 70 people being killed beforea ceasefirewas agreed. India’s border security force (BSF) said its troops had spotted “one suspicious person advancing towards the border fence”, which lies beyond the international frontier, in Gujarat state’s Banaskantha district on Friday evening. “They challenged the intruder, but he continued to advance, prompting them to open fire,” the BSF said in a statement on Saturday. “The intruder was neutralised on the spot.” The Gujarat and Rajasthan states of India, which share a border with Pakistan’s south-eastern Sindh province, have been hubs of drug smuggling, and many Pakistani drug smugglers have been arrested or killed there. Millions of dollars worth of drugs have been seized in both states, and also on the Gujarat coast on the Arabian Sea. Pakistani officials privy to the information said India did not reveal the real identity of the individual and described the statement as “vague”. A Pakistani official questioned how the man managed to get so far from the border in Banaskantha district, and said they were “investigating the killing and identity of the person”. The recent conflict began after India blamed Pakistan for amilitant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April that killed 26 people. Islamabad denied New Delhi’s claims it backed the militant group. India launched missile strikes, claiming to have targeted terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan, which responded by firing missiles at Indian military targets. Soon after the the ceasefire, New Delhi said any future terrorist attacks on its territory would be considered an act of war. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the militant attack inKashmir. It has become more vocal in blaming India for a rising wave of militant attacks that have struck Pakistan, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of using proxy militant groups to carry out terrorist attacks in order to destabilise the country, which India has denied.",

    "title": "Sir Alan Bates given ‘take it or leave it’ offer of less than half his Post Office Horizon claim",
    "article_text": "Sir Alan Bates, who led the 20-year campaign for justice for post office operators over the Horizon scandal, has revealed he has been handed a “take it or leave it” compensation offer of less than half his original claim. The 70-year-old, who was knighted last year, has accused the government of presiding over a “quasi-kangaroo court” system for the compensation. More than 900post office operators were convicted of offences including fraud, false accounting and theftbetween 1999 and 2015 after the faulty Horizon IT system falsely showed that money was missing in branch accounts. The convictions were overturned by parliament last year. Many are still awaiting damages despite the previous government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts. Bates has also accused the Department for Business and Trade, which administers the compensation schemes, of reneging on assurances given when they were set up and told the Sunday Times a promise they would be “non-legalistic” had turned out to be “worthless”. He said he was given a final “take it or leave it” offer, which amounted to 49.2% of his original claim after appealing and being referred to the scheme’s independent reviewer, Sir Ross Cranston. The campaigner is now calling for the creation of an independent body that would administer compensation schemes for public sector scandals but cautioned: “I can already hear the sharpening of goose quills across Whitehall as the civil service prepares to snow politicians under with reasons it would not work.” He added: “The sub-postmaster compensation schemes have been turned into quasi-kangaroo courts in which the Department for Business and Trade sits in judgment of the claims and alters the goalposts as and when it chooses. “Claims are, and have been, knocked back on the basis that legally you would not be able to make them, or that the parameters of the scheme do not extend to certain items.” The group litigation order (GLO) scheme was set up to achieve redress for the 555 claimants who took thePost Officeto the high court between 2017 and 2019. Under the GLO, claimants can take a fixed sum of £75,000 or seek their own settlement. If there are disputes in individual cases, they are referred to an independent panel for review. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Post office operators can also seek a final view from Cranston, a former high court judge, if they believe the panel has got it wrong. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “We pay tribute to all the postmasters who have suffered from this scandal, including Sir Alan for his tireless campaign for justice, and we have quadrupled the total amount paid to postmasters since entering government. “We recognise there will be an absence of evidence given the length of time that has passed, and we therefore aim to give the benefit of the doubt to postmasters as far as possible. Anyone unhappy with their offer can have their case reviewed by a panel of experts, which is independent of the government.” Earlier this week, it emerged that hundreds of former post office operators will be compensated by the Post Office afterit accidentally leaked their names and addressesin June 2024. The Post Office said individual payouts will be capped at £5,000, although higher claims may still be pursued.",

    "title": "Developers face fines as Rayner steps up plans to speed up UK housebuilding",
    "article_text": "Developers face tens of thousands of pounds in fines if they slow down housebuilding under new powers being granted to councils to helpdeliver 1.5m homes. Under government proposals, housebuilders will need to commit to a timeframe for construction before they are granted planning permission, and deliver annual reports on their progress. Those who repeatedly fail to build or sit on land could be fined with a “delayed homes penalty” or blocked from future planning permission by councils. Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, said the government had taken “radical steps to overhaul the planning system to get Britain building again after years of inaction. “In the name of delivering security for working people, we are backing the builders not the blockers. Now it’s time for developers to roll up their sleeves and play their part. “We’re going even further to get the homes we need. No more sites with planning permission gathering dust for decades while a generation struggle to get on the housing ladder.” The plans, which form part of a government working paper onspeeding up housebuilding, would apply to developments of 50 or more homes. The prospective fines would be based on lost council tax revenue and could be imposed by councils on developers who fall at least 10% behind schedule without good reason. As a result, a developer who is failing to build 50 homes that would each raise £1,500 in annual council tax could face a £75,000 fine. This change would require new legislation and would only apply to future planning permissions. Ministers will also test a new requirement for developments with more than 2,000 homes to include a mix of affordable and commercially sold housing by default, on the basis that this could lead to faster construction. The government hasintroduced legislation to speed up planning decisionsand boost housebuilding by removing avenues for legal challenges and reforming the compulsory purchase order process. Labour committed in its manifesto to deliver 1.5m homes during this parliament, which ministers have admitted is a challenging target. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated this spring that housebuilding would rise to its highest level in 40 years and contribute to the UK’s economic growth. The government has committed£2bn for 18,000 new social and affordable homes, £1.29bn for the warm homes social housing fund, £800m in top-ups to the current affordable homes programme, and £2bn for regeneration projects that the government says will add to the total number of available homes. A further £600m will deliver training for new construction jobs. The Telegraph reported on Friday that Rayner is pushing for further investment in social housing as part ofnext month’s spending review, which will set departmental budgets for several years. Rayner has spoken about her belief in the need for more social housing. She told a conference in November that she wanted to remove the “shackles of stigma” that is too often associated with social housing. “This is personal for me,” Rayner said. “Because I know that a secure, affordable home is not a luxury or simply nice to have. It’s the foundation on which everything else is built. When I was growing up, we didn’t have a lot, but we had a safe and secure council home. And later, when I needed a home to raise my son, I was given my own council home. I haven’t got to where I am today in spite of coming from a council house, but because of it.”",

    "article_text": "A co-driver taking part in the Jim Clark rally inScotlandhas died after a crash on Saturday morning. Dai Roberts, 39, was pronounced dead at the scene near Duns in the Scottish Borders. The driver, James Williams, 27, was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with serious but not life-threatening injuries. The rally’s organisers, the Jim Clark Memorial Motor Club, said the remainder of the event and Sunday’s Jim Clark Reivers rally had been cancelled. The Jim Clark rally is an annual closed-road motor sport race named afterthe late Formula One champion Jim Clark, who waskilled in an accident in Hockenheim, Germany, in 1968. Supt Vincent Fisher, of Police Scotland, said: “Our thoughts are with the family of the man who has died and inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances.” Motorsport UK, the sport’s governing body, said it “sends its condolences to Dai’s family and friends, the Jim Clark rally, Jim Clark Memorial Motor Club and members of the motor sport community”. “Motorsport UK has initiated a full investigation into the circumstances of the incident and will work closely with the Jim Clark rally event organisers and Jim Clark Memorial Motor Club and will cooperate with the relevant authorities.” Roberts, from Carmarthen, survived a crash in 2014 which killed a 20-year-old driver, Timothy Cathcart, while taking part in the Ulster rally in Belfast. Roberts’ younger brother, Gareth, died aged 24 after a racing accident in Palermo, southern Italy, in 2012. About 260 competitors were expected to compete at the event in the Scottish Borders over the weekend. In a team statement, James WilliamsRallyingsaid: “It is with a heavy heart, we have to share this sad news. “The motor sport community is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our beloved Dai Roberts. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Roberts family at this difficult time.” In 2014,three spectators were killed and six more were injuredat the event when two cars lost control and veered into viewing areas. The rally returned five years later in 2019 after “rigorous steps” were taken to ensure safety. First held in 1970, the closed-road event is a round of the Probite British rally championship, Asset Alliance Group Scottish rally championship and Protyre national asphalt championship.",

    "title": "Live facial recognition cameras may become ‘commonplace’ as police use soars",
    "article_text": "Police believe live facial recognition cameras may become “commonplace” inEnglandand Wales, according to internal documents, with the number of faces scanned having doubled to nearly 5m in the last year. A joint investigation by the Guardian andLiberty Investigateshighlights the speed at which the technology is becoming a staple of British policing. Major funding is being allocated and hardware bought, while the British state is also looking to enable police forces to more easily access the full spread of its image stores, including passport and immigration databases, for retrospective facial recognition searches. Live facial recognition involves the matching of faces caught on surveillance camera footage against a police watchlist in real time, in what campaigners liken to the continual finger printing of members of the public as they go about their daily lives. Retrospective facial recognition software is used by the police to match images on databases with those caught on CCTV and other systems. According to one funding document drawn up by SouthWalespolice as part of a proposal to put the West End of London or Cardiff rail station under live facial recognition cameras and released by the Metropolitan police under the Freedom of Information Act, it is believed “the use of this technology could become commonplace in our city centres and transport hubs around England and Wales”. The first fixed live facial recognition cameras will be fitted for a trial in Croydon, south London, later this summer. The expansion comes despite facial recognition failing to be referenced in any act of parliament. Campaigners claim the police have been allowed to “self regulate” their use of the technology. Officers have in the past used a setting that was subsequently shown to disproportionately misidentify black people. After a court of appeal judgment in 2020, which found that South Wales police’suse of live facial recognition camerashad been unlawful, the College of Policing provided guidance that “the threshold needs to be set with care to maximise the probability of returning true alerts while keeping the false alert rate to an acceptable level”. There remains nothing in law to direct forces on the threshold or technology used. The policing minister, Diane Johnson, told parliament earlier this month that she recognised “a need to consider whether a bespoke legislative framework governing the use of live facial recognition technology for law enforcement purposes is needed” but the Home Office is yet to provide details. Facial recognition cameras were firsttrialled in Londonand south Wales from 2016 but the speed at which police forces are rolling out the technology has accelerated over the last 12 months. The investigation by the Guardian and Liberty found: Police forces scanned nearly 4.7m faces with live facial recognition cameras last year – more than twice as many as in 2023. Live facial recognition vans were deployed at least 256 times in 2024, according to official deployment records, up from 63 the year before. A roving unit of 10 live facial recognition vans that can be sent anywhere in the country will be made available within days – increasing national capacity. Eight police forces have deployed the technology. The Met has four vans. Police forces have considered fixed infrastructure creating a “zone of safety” by covering the West End of London with a network of live facial recognition cameras. Met officials said this remained a possibility. Forces almost doubled the number of retrospective facial recognition searches made last year using the police national database (PND) from 138,720 in 2023 to 252,798. The PND contains custody mug shots, millions of which have beenfound to be stored unlawfullyof people who have never been charged with or convicted of an offence. More than 1,000 facial recognition searches using the UK passport database were carried out in the last two years, and officers are increasingly searching for matches on the Home Office immigration database, with requests up last year, to 110. Officials have concluded that using the passport database for facial recognition is “not high risk” and “is not controversial”, according to internal documents. The Home Office is now working with the police to establish a new national facial recognition system, known as strategic facial matcher. The platform will be capable of searching a range of databases including custody images and immigration records. Lindsey Chiswick, the director of intelligence at the Met and the NationalPoliceChiefs’ Council lead on facial recognition, said surveys showed that four in five Londoners were in support of the police using innovative technology, including facial recognition cameras. This week, a registered sex offender, David Cheneler, 73, from Lewisham, wasjailed for two yearsafter he was caught alone with a six-year-old girl by a live facial recognition camera. He had previously served nine years for 21 offences against children. Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The Met arrested 587 people in 2024 with the assistance of the live facial recognition cameras of which 424 were charged with offences. Of those arrested, 58 were registered sex offenders in serious breach of their conditions and 38 have been charged. Chiswick said: “Where there’s limited amounts of money and there’s fewer officers, but there’s more demand, and we see criminals exploiting technology to a really grand scale … we’ve got to do something different. “There’s an opportunity out there. So policing needs to start operating a little bit differently. People talk about harnessing AI like it’s some crazy horse we want to saddle but we do need to harness the opportunities that technology and data can bring us.” Chiswick said the Met’s policy was to take “really quite small steps and review them at every stage” but that there would be a “benefit in potentially some sort of framework or statutory guidance”. The Met is deploying its facial recognition cameras at a setting that testing suggests avoids any statistical significance in terms of gender or ethnicity bias when it comes to cases of misidentification. Chiswick said: “I don’t want to use a biased algorithm in London. There’s no point on all counts. I think for government, there’s a question, isn’t there around artificial intelligence? And I think clearly the public sector is going to use, and want to use AI more and more. “I think the questions around who then decides where algorithms are purchased from, what training data is used, what countries might this technology come from and then, when you use it, are you obliged to test it and if you’re obliged to test it, are you then obliged to operate at a certain setting? That’s not really questions for law enforcement.” The Home Office declined a request for comment.",

    "title": "Trump’s West Point graduation address veers from US-first doctrine to politics",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumptold graduating West Point military academy cadets on Saturday that they were entering the officer corps at a “defining moment in the army’s history”, in a commencement address that included political attacks and a discourse on the folly of older men marrying “trophy wives”. Referring to US political leaders of the past two decades who “had dragged our military into missions” that people questioned as “wasting our time, money and souls in some case”, Trump told the young leaders that “as much as you want to fight, I’d rather do it without having to fight”. He predicted that, through a policy of “peace through strength”, the US’s adversaries would back down. “I just want to look at them and have them fold,” he said. The president also said US soldiers had been sent “on nation-building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us, led by leaders that didn’t have a clue about distant lands while abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home”. “All of that’s ended, strongly ended. They’re not even allowed to think about it anymore,” Trump added. Making apparent reference to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that defense secretaryPete Hegsethhas cancelled, Trump weaved together criticism of his predecessors with a new focus on curbing illegal immigration. “They subjected the armed forces to all manner of social projects and political causes, while leaving our borders undefended and depleting our arsenals to fight other countries’ wars. We fought for other countries’ borders but we didn’t fight for our own borders, but now we do like we have never fought before,” he said. He later said that “the job of the US armed forces is not to host drag shows or transform foreign cultures”, a reference to drag shows on military bases that his predecessor Joe Bidenhaltedin 2023 after Republican criticism. Wearing a red “Make America great again” campaign hat throughout, the president told the 1,002 graduating cadets that the US is the “hottest country in the world”, and boasted of his administration’s achievements. The president also returned, once again, to a cautionary tale he often tells young people about the danger of losing momentum in life, illustrated by an anecdote about what he called the unhappy retirement of the post-war housing developer William Levitt, the creator of Levittowns, planned communities on Long Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Repeating a story he toldat a Boy Scout jamboree in 2017, andat the University of Alabama three weeks ago, the president said that Levitt was unsatisfied by life without work, even though he married “a trophy wife” and bought a yacht. “It didn’t work out too well, and that doesn’t work out too well, I must tell you, a lot of trophy wives, it doesn’t work out,” the presidenttoldthe young women and men. “But it made him happy for a little while at least.” Trump also used the occasion to repeat an unfounded accusation he first made in 2020: the claim that Russia had stolen US hypersonic missile technology during Barack Obama’s presidency. “The Russians stole it, something bad happened. But we’re now building them, lots of them,” Trump said, praising eight cadets who had built their own. “We are building them right now. We had ours stolen. We are the designers of it. We had it stolen during the Obama administration.” Outside the gates of West Point, protesters gathered with drums, banners and signs to condemn what they called the president’s attack on American democracy. At points during Trump’s address, he veered between praising the graduating military cadets and maintaining political criticism of the Biden administration. The graduation address, which ran to almost an hour long, comes before an expansive military parade in Washington on 14 June to celebrate the 250th anniversary celebration of the nation. The date is also the president’s birthday. Alongside the military parade featuring more than 6,700 soldiers, it will include concerts, fireworks, NFL players, fitness competitions and displays all over the National Mall for daylong festivities. The army expects that as many as 200,000 people could attend and that putting on the celebration will cost an estimated $25m to $45m. The Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "US citizen detained by immigration officials who dismissed his Real ID as fake",
    "article_text": "Authorities wrestled a US-born citizen to the ground, cuffed him and dismissed his so-called Real ID as “fake” during an arrest operation targeting undocumented people on Wednesday under the direction of theTrump administration, according to a viral video and reporting by Telemundo. Leonardo Garcia Venegas, 25, was at his construction job in Foley,Alabama, when officials arrived to arrest workers there. Garcia Venegas – who was born in Florida to Mexican parents – began filming the arrests with his mobile phone before officials reportedly knocked the device out of his hand and tried to arrest him as well. Video of the arrest shows three officials wrestling him to the ground, while he yells: “I’m a citizen!” According to an interview with the Spanish-language US news outletTelemundo, officials took out his wallet, removed his ID – which complies with higher federal security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses as well as identification – and told him that it was fake. “They cuffed me,” he said. “They put the cuffs on quite hard.” Four people at the job site were arrested, including Garcia Venegas’s brother, who is undocumented. Officials removed the cuffs from Garcia Venegas hours later – after he gave them his social security number, verifying his US citizenship. “I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that’s happening,” said Garcia Venegas, referring to the Trump administration’s ongoingimmigration-related crackdown. His cousin, also a US citizen, told Telemundo they both went through the process of acquiring the Real ID, undergoing “the protocols the administration is asking for”. “I feel sad because, even though we were born here, that doesn’t matter any more,” the cousin said. She added: “To have our skin color has, apparently, become a crime. And it has become a crime deserving of this type of treatment – as if we were real criminals.” In a statement to NBC News, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Garcia Venegas of having “interfered” with the arrest during the operation. “Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including US citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the DHS’s statement to NBC said. It is unclear whether the officials who cuffed Garcia Venegas were local officials, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents or other members of federal law enforcement. Since Trump came into office, various federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and others, have been tasked with carrying out immigration enforcement operations. Some local police and sheriff’s departments have also been deputized to carry out federal immigration arrests. As the White House attempts to carry out a promise of “mass deportations” that vaulted Donald Trump to victory in November’s presidential election, a number of US citizens have been caught up in its dragnet. Some, such as Garcia Venegas, have been detained by officials, then released. But others,including children, have been deported. Although rare, the deportation of US citizens has also happened during prior administrations.",

    "title": "Remote Wyoming vacation lodge emerges as haven for US ‘dissident’ right",
    "article_text": "A vacation lodge known as the Wagon Box Inn in the tiny town of Story, Wyoming, has emerged as an unlikely hub of rightwing ambitions to reorientUS politicsand culture. Events held there since it opened, and others planned for this spring, have brought together figures from the so-called “dissident right”, political figures backed by reactionary currents in Silicon Valley, and proponents of the “network state” movement. The dissident right is a term that describes rightwing intellectual currents that go beyond and even attack mainstream conservatives for their perceived concessions to liberals on issues like race, feminism and LGBTQ+ rights. Network state proponents envision a network of extra-national communities that exist beyond the control of nation-states. The Guardian contacted the Wagon Box founder and owner Paul McNiel for comment. He did not respond directly but insteadposted a screenshotof the request to X appended with commentary. There, McNiel said he was driven by “good-faith curiosity” that events there had been “largely focused on a suspicion of ‘the machine’” and boasted of the “breadth of the politics represented”, citing appearances by the likes of Patrick Deneen and Seneca Scott. Deneen is a Notre Dame professor and conservative political theorist whose 2023 book Regime Change “offered a previewof the Trump administration’s intention to breathe fire on America’s cultural institutions” whose fans include JD Vance, the vice-president. Scott, who McNiel described as a “90s Democrat who wants a safe community for his family and goats”, is a former union organizer based in Oakland, California, whose activism, political campaigning and social media outputhave targetedtransgender people, homeless encampments, local media organizations, progressive politicians and city employees. Sheridan county property records indicate that Paul McNiel bought the property that includes the Wagon Box – formerly a holiday destination and RV park – in August 2022. Property records, satellite imagery, and media posted on social media platforms and on the Wagon Box website indicate a semi-rural location on the western fringes of Story. Since McNiel took control of the property, it has played host to a string of events, many of them featuring figures associated with overlapping rightwing movements. The project has drawn concerns in local media, but garnered a laudatorywrite-upin the Bari Weiss-founded Free Press. Free Press investors include rightwing tech figures likeMarc Andreessen and Trump administration “crytpo czar” David Sacks. McNiel – billed as a millionaire in an appearance on a real estate investment podcast in 2021 – is the principal of a legion of LLCs, according to company records in Alaska,Wyoming, Montana and North Carolina. Property records and data brokers indicate that McNiel or LLCs controlled by him have bought and sold dozens of properties – many of them trailer parks or similar sites for low-cost housing – in at least three states. According tofounding documentson its website, Wagon Box is run as adecentralized autonomous organization(DAO), a term for organizations managed in part via decentralized technologies like blockchains and smart contracts. A 2021 Wyominglawallows DAOs to incorporate in the state, despite their often anonymous ownership structure. The sparsely populated state is notorious for a“cowboy cocktail”of loose financial regulations and opaque company ownership. “We’re not northern Idaho or even Montana. We’ve so far managed to not attract the crazy far right to our state,” said Elizabeth Storer, a Democratic state representative from Jackson who has spoken critically of Wyoming’s libertarian financial laws and opacity. “We’ve allowed just about anyone to come into Wyoming because of our low tax environment, our limited liability corporation laws and the use of registered agents all over the state – it allows people to offshore funds in Wyoming with a great deal of secrecy,” she added. Thecurrent versionof a document explaining the DAO aligns the project with the network state movement, claiming that “the grand project of liberalism is crumbling, and that in its wake people are looking for new avenues of allegiance and interdependence”. The document continues “Balaji Srinivasan, among others, has identified this shift and suggested a process for uniting modern technologies with ancient human trends of association to createnetwork states”, providing a link to Srinivasan’s self-published 2022 book of the same name. Srinavisan is an entrepreneur and investor formerly associated with companies including Andreessen-Horowitz and Coinbase. (That company’s current CEO, Brian Armstrong, is anotheroutspoken booster of network states). For more than a decade, Srinivasan has advocated a radical anarcho-capitalist vision in which like-minded people can “exit” and place themselves beyond the legal and economic reach of nation-states in parallel, networked special economic zones. His ideas are often couched in vituperative attacks on his perceived enemies, including academics, government employees and the media. As early as 2013, Srinavisan wasadvocatinga “reverse diaspora” in which people enabled by technology could assemble in “cloud cities … outside the United States”. These “could be floating cities in international waters as put forth by Peter Thiel, or one of the more ambitious 80,000 person colonies on Mars desired by Elon Musk”. Soon after, in response toreportinglinking Silicon Valley figures to the anti-democratic neo-reactionary movement and its leading light, Curtis Yarvin, Srinavasanreportedlyemailed Yarvin with the suggestion that “it may be interesting to sic the Dark Enlightenment audience on a single vulnerable hostile reporter to dox them and turn them inside out”. He later cited Yarvin in The Network State, writing: “As Yarvin in particular has documented at length, the most important left-authoritarians are not formally part of the elected state at all. They are the professors, activists, bureaucrats, and journalists.” He describes people in these fields as constituting “the control circuitry for the US government”. Last September, he opened a residential network school for would-be builders of network nations,reportedlylocated in Malaysia’s Forest City, whose “requirements include an admiration of ‘western values’, seeing Bitcoin as the successor to the US Federal Reserve, and trusting AI over human courts and judges”. The network state vision has already inspired an attempt to build a city,California Forever, in rural Solano county, with investors including Andreessen and the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Network state advocates also reportedly want to construct a similar “charter city” inGreenlandif it is annexed by the United States. Donald Trump has floated the idea ofcreating 10 such “freedom cities” on federal land, including San Francisco’s Presidio. The movement alsooverlapswith efforts to mount a rightwing takeover of city governments in San Francisco and Oakland, with the likes of the Y Combinator CEO, Garry Tan,backingbothprojects. Srinivasan has offeredlurid fantasiesof what a tech-controlled San Francisco might look like. In an October 2023 podcast interview, he envisioned a city controlled by tech-aligned “grays” enjoying privileged access to large parts of the city, bribing a pliant police department, and with “blues” – San Francisco’s liberals – subject to exclusion and hostile propaganda. Devin Burghart, the executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Righs and a longtime observer of far-right organizing in the mountain west, told the Guardian in an interview that the Wagon Box was significant for being one of the first real-world attempts at constructing a “network state” hub beyond California. “They’ve tipped their hand a bit with the constant references to [accelerationist theorist] Nick Land and Italian futurism. This is a different veneer of the apocalyptic, post-democratic world view that is also quite common with militia and prepper types.” The Wagon Boxreportedlyattracted immediate scepticism from residents of tiny unincorporated Story in the months following its establishment. Attenders at a 2023 public meeting reportedly expressed concerns both about the draft DAO document’s vision of “‘capital seed for a nascent network state’ and … a place for either gatherings or apocalyptic retreat”, and McNiel’s association with the notorious anti-government activist Ryan Payne. In 2018, Payne was sentenced to federal prison on conspiracy charges after playing the role of, according to a federal judge, “an architect” of the 2016 Malheur national wildlife refuge occupation, in whichhe participatedalongside the likes of the currentfugitiveAmmon Bundy. Wagon Box has hosted a series of events since McNiel’s acquisition, many with guests and themes associated with the far right. The 27 April event,Dawn in the West: A Futurist Serata(DitW) was subtitled “An UncleTed Talk”, a reference both to Ted talks and a nickname for the so-called Unabomber,Theodore Kaczynski. Advertising materials highlighted themes including the work of Land, who, alongside Yarvin, is one of the progenitors of the neo-reactionary movement, whose anti-democratic ideas have been cited as an inspiration for the Trump administration’s gutting of the federal government. Another advertised speaker at that event was Jonathan Keeperman. The GuardianidentifiedKeeperman in 2024 as the man behind the L0m3z X account and rightwing publisher Passage Press. Keeperman-founded Passage Press is also listed as a participant in Wagon Box’s 31 May roundtableCoalition for Cultural Renewal(CCR). The schedule for a Wagon Boxeventlast August promised a conversation between Keeperman and the journalist James Pogue on “the failure of liberalism and globalization”. Pogue has written extensively about the new right for media outlets including the New York Times and Vanity Fair. In a post at the Wagon Box’s Substack newsletter, Pogue and McNiel are pictured together in a photograph purportedly taken inside the Passage-Press-sponsoredCoronation Ballin Washington this January, and described in a caption as “Wagon Box brothers”. Keeperman is one of the overlaps between Wagon Box and a broader far-right milieu. Keeperman, for example, spoke last month at a pro-natalist conference in Austin, Texas, whose speaker roster included self-described eugenicists and promoters of race science. At the event, in response to a small protest on site, Keeperman took to X,posting: “NATALISM IS NAZISM Say it loud say it proud.” Balaji Srinivasan spoke at the same conference in 2023. The Natalism conference founder, Kevin Dolan, is listed in Texas company records as the principal of a natalism.org non-profit; a newly incorporated Eternal Capital Texas Inc; and Exit, a men-only organization which he characterized in a Substack newsletter as a rightwing business network which is “not just about making life in the regime more tolerable … setting ourselves up to succeed as it declines”. He founded that organization following Guardianreportingin 2021 that identified him as the man behind an influential “DezNat” account, “@extradeadjcb”. Exit is billed as a participant in Wagon Box’s CCR event, which will include other far-right publishers , along with Murphy’s Other Life and hard-right online magazine IM-1776. The Guardian previouslyreportedon IM-1776’s support of authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin and El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele; its enthusiasm for extremist political figures such as Gabriele D’Annunzio and Kaczynski; and its close links with contemporary hard-right activists like the culture warrior Christopher Rufo,Erik Princeandwould-be “warlord”Charles Haywood. IM-1776’s literary editor, Daniel Miller, is a speaker at DitW, and in YouTube videos posted to Wagon Box’s channel he is characterized as a writer-in-residence. In a January article for IM-1776, Miller called for Donald Trump tooverthrowthe government of the UK led by Keir Starmer and “liberate” the country, saying it was run by “a criminal regime” dominated by “a mafia-like organization of pathological personalities”, a necessity “as clear as the imperative of the Vietnamese to invade Cambodia and remove the Khmer Rouge from power in 1979”. Miller did not respond to a request for comment. Events this spring also bill speakers associated with a tech-backed hard-right political movement in California’s Bay Area. Scott – who has run both for city council and mayor in Oakland – is set to appear at the Doomer Optimism Campout in June. Scott’s political activities in Oakland – including the candidacies and his advocacy for the recall of former mayor Sheng Thao last year – have been punctuated by scandals. During his 2022 campaign media reports revealed a 2021 arrest oncharges of brandishing a firearm, in an incident that took place not far from the community garden he founded in West Oakland. Those charges were laterdismissed. Last December, the city of Oakland applied for a restraining order against Scott over his alleged harassment of a city worker during the recall campaign. Among other things, Scottreportedlyclaimed that the employee was a pedophile on social media and posted their address publicly. In aFebruary settlement, Scott agreed to stop posting personal information about the employee online. Scott has received backing from rightwing tech figures includingTan, who, like Scott, has agitated against progressive approaches to homelessness and law and order, and employed bareknuckle social-media posting to promote his views. “If you want Oakland to be great then you will follow and support Seneca,” Tan wrote on X last year. In Oakland, Scott has drawn scrutiny for anti-transgender commentary and attacks on progressive voices in politics and media. Scott appeared at anotherWagon Box eventin summer 2024 in conversation about “Cities: urban agriculture, crime, and criminal justice reform”. Pogue also appeared alongside Scott at his community garden in a 2023 event hosted by a Scott-run non-profit, Neighbors Together Oakland, that was last yearshuttered by California’s attorney generallast year forconducting fundraisingwithout a non-profit license. In an interview withFree Pressin 2023, Scott had said he planned to use that non-profit as a platform to support “100 nontraditional candidates” for city councils, school boards, and potentially higher offices across the US. Another Doomer Optimism Campout speaker is Andrew Hock, a Tennessee political consultant who was reportedly involved with an alleged attempt to facilitate anonymous donations in support of the recall of Mayor Thao. Questions about Foundational Oakland Unite’s fundraising came amid aflood of campaign moneyinto pro-recall groups, much of it from big-money donors. Aspreviously reported in the Guardian, deep-pocketed tech figures have been involved in attempts to drag politics to the right inOaklandandSan Francisco. In April, 2024 the Thao recall campaign sent an email to prospective donors offering “options for donors to remain private if you prefer”. Oakland city law forbids anonymous donations to political candidates. The message included an email address for Andrew Hock at Foundational Oakland Unites, a political action committeefounded by Scott, as the main point of contact for donations. According to2024 reporting by the Oaklandside, Scott previously employed Hock as a paid campaign consultant during his 2022 mayoral campaign. Scottclaimsto be a part-owner of Hock’s campaign consultant group, Laschian Consulting. In an April 17 post to X, Scott claimed that Laschian Consulting “has planted its flag and is already in talks to help other major US cities fight back against the soggies and their anti-human agenda”, using a self-coined derogatory term to refer to social democrats. “If your city is spiraling due to failed progressive policies and a coordinated NGO + public sector union takeover, give us a call. Maybe we can help you save your city too.” In January, Thao, the recalled mayor,was herself federally indictedover allegations including that she solicited political donations in violation of campaign finance laws. The alleged straw donor campaign for Thao was uncovered by Oakland’s Public Ethics Commission in an investigation thatbegan half a decade ago. Though the PEC did not make a criminal referral, FBI white-collar crime investigators in Oakland picked up the thread andbuilt their own criminal case independently. The PEC’s budget wasslashedearlier this year amid a citywide fiscal crisis, severely impacting its ability to complete ongoing investigations. Hock did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "title": "New Orleans archbishop in court for clergy sexual abuse bankruptcy case",
    "article_text": "The Catholic archbishop of New Orleans made a rare in-person appearance in federal bankruptcy court on Friday, days after announcing a potential agreement tosettle claims with hundreds of clergy abuse survivorsthat has been met with pushback from some of the plaintiffs. “I’m here because I’m concerned for the survivors,” Gregory Aymond said in an interview with WWLLouisianaaway from the cameras after what is believed to have been his first appearance in person for an open court hearing in the five years since his archdiocese – one of the US’s oldest – joined roughly 40 Catholic institutions to file for bankruptcy protection amid the worldwide church’s long-ongoing clergy molestation scandal. “And we want to make sure it’s reasonable expectations for what we can give them and to make sure the process proceeds.” But James Adams, a survivor of child sexual abuse by a Catholic priest stationed inNew Orleansand the former chair of a committee representing survivors, questioned why Aymond hadn’t shown up to previous hearings. “If he was concerned for survivors, truly, I think there would have been a lot of things done differently from the beginning, unfortunately,”Adamssaid. Aymond also acknowledged that the bankruptcy he filed for the archdiocese on 1 May 2020 had dragged on too long and prevented abuse survivors from being compensated. “We want that wait to end as soon as possible,” Aymond said. “[Survivors] have had terrible crimes committed against them, and we want to make sure to respect them and the pain they’ve been through. One way to do that is to expedite negotiations.” Aymond declined to answer additional questions or to comment on camera outside the courthouse. He didn’t say anything in court on Friday either – but sat and listened quietly from the gallery as attorneys representing about 200 of the 600 abuse claimants blasted the settlement plan proposed days earlier, including one who called the deal “dead on arrival”. Since the basic outline of the proposed settlement was announced on Wednesday, proponents and opponents have been jockeying for position and laying the groundwork for a vote by all claimants to confirm or reject it, which is expected this fall. Two-thirds of everyone making a claim in the church’s bankruptcy must agree to the settlement terms for it to be finalized. The full details of the deal proposed on Wednesday haven’t been presented yet. But it would provide $130m in cash and up to $110m more from insurance carriers and potential church property sales. That’s about $100m short of a similar church bankruptcy case in Long Island, New York, cited by both sides as a good precedent for theNew Orleanscase, which was recently settled and finalized for $323m. The Long Island settlement, between the archdiocese of Rockville Centre and about 600 abuse survivors, netted the claimants there an average of about $540,000. Under the terms disclosed this week, survivors in New Orleans would get between $300,000 and $383,000 per claim, on average. The amount paid to each claimant depends on a formula based on the severity and evidence of abuse, among other factors. Even after five years, both the church and negotiating survivors say they still need more time to hammer out details before bringing the proposed agreement to an official vote of all 600 survivors and other creditors. The attorneys who spoke against the proposal in court on Friday – Soren Gisleson and Taylor Townsend – said they and associated attorneys represent more than 180 survivors, and they believe there are others who are as dedicated to voting to stop the deal. They hope to return their clients’ cases to individual lawsuits for damages against the church in state court, which were stopped five years ago when the church sought bankruptcy protection. “This deal is never going to get passed,” Gisleson said in front of Judge Meredith Grabill. “They don’t have the votes. And they’re never going to get the votes.” Jim Stang, the lead attorney for the survivors’ committee that negotiated the proposed deal, bristled at those assertions, saying he’s handled many other complex bankruptcies, including the Rockville Centre archdiocese on Long Island – and the proposal this week was something the two sides could build on. “This is far from over. This is a starting point,” Stang said. In an interview with WWL, Adams said: “The starting point, if my math is correct, was five years ago.” Rick Kuebel, another attorney for the survivors’ negotiating committee, estimated it could be late August before a final plan could be presented for a vote. It would then take two months to properly notify survivors and hold a vote, attorneys said Friday. Judge Grabill suggested an accelerated timeframe might be possible, and Kuebel said that could bring a final settlement to a vote by September at the earliest. Douglas Draper, attorney for the church’s parishes, schools and other affiliates, suggested checks could go out to survivors in the first quarter of 2026 if a plan were approved.",

    "title": "Ecuador’s Daniel Noboa sworn in for full term, promising a crackdown on gangs",
    "article_text": "Daniel Noboa,Ecuador’syoungest-ever president and heir to a prominent banana-exporting fortune, has been sworn in for his first full term in office, pledging to intensify his government’s battle against powerful drug gangs while reviving the struggling economy. In a ceremony at the National Assembly in Quito on Saturday, the right-wing president was sworn in by Assembly President Niels Olsen Peet, who draped the presidential sash across his shoulders before the two raised clasped hands in a symbolic gesture of unity. Noboa, 37, won the election in April’s, securing a new term after completing the final 18 months of his predecessor’s tenure, defeating left-wing candidate, Luisa Gonzalez, despite her allegations of electoral fraud. Speaking to lawmakers, Noboa pledged to make a sharp reduction in violent crime a cornerstone of his administration. “The progressive reduction of homicides will be a non-negotiable goal,” Noboa declared. “We will maintain our fight against drug trafficking, seize illegal weapons, ammunition, and explosives, and exercise greater control at the country’s ports.” Ecuador, once considered one of the more stable countries in the region, has in recent years faced a sharp rise in violence, with drug cartels, including the powerful from Mexico, exploiting porous borders and weak institutions to expand their influence. Noboa has responded with militarised crackdowns, deploying the armed forces onto the streets and tightening security at key infrastructure hubs. The president’s security strategy has drawn comparisons to El Salvador’s controversial anti-gang measures, which have been praised by some for reducing crime but condemned by rights groups over mass detentions and alleged abuses. Noboa has cited El Salvador, as well as the United States and Israel, as strategic partners in Ecuador’s security overhaul. His administration has also hired Erik Prince, founder of private military contractor Blackwater, to advise Ecuadorian security forces, a move that has raised alarm among opposition politicians and human rights advocates, who warn of creeping militarisation and lack of oversight.

    "title": "Iranian film, It was Just an Accident, wins Palme D’Or at Cannes festival",
    "article_text": "An Iranian thriller film that explores corruption and state violence in the country has won the the Palme d’Or, the coveted top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It Was Just an Accident, directed by dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, was crowned at the world-famous festival on Saturday, hours after a power outagebriefly threw the event off course. The festival’s crowd burst into a roaring standing ovation for Panahi, who has endured years of travel bans and prison terms in Iran due to his provocative cinema, often produced in secret. He had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years. “Art mobilises the creative energy of the most precious, most alive part of us. A force that transforms darkness into forgiveness, hope and new life,” said jury president Juliette Binoche when announcing the award. On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was the future of his country. “Let us join forces,” Panahi said. “No one should tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, or what we should or shouldn’t do.” Partly inspired by Panahi’s own experience in jail, It Was Just An Accident follows a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasseri), who kidnaps a man with a false leg who looks just like the one who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. Vahid sets out to verify with other prison survivors that it is indeed their torturer, and then decide what to do with him. Critics have praised the film as a clever, symbolic exploration of justice that blends dark humour with its intense themes. The festival’s Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier’s Norwegian family drama, Sentimental Value, his lauded follow-up to The Worst Person in the World. Kleber Mendonca Filho’s Brazilian political thriller, The Secret Agent, won two big awards: best director for Fihlo and best actor for Wagner Moura. The jury prize was split between two films: Oliver Laxe’s desert road trip, Sirat and Mascha Schilinski’s German, generation-spanning drama, Sound of Falling.” Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for The Little Sister, Hafsia Herzi’s French coming-of-age drama. Cannes also honoured Hasan Hadi’s The President’s Cake with a best first film award, marking the first time an Iraqi film has won an award at the festival. The Cannes closing ceremony took place after a major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday, knocking out traffic lights and forcing businesses to close along the main shopping street in the Alpes-Maritimes holiday region. Police suspect arson as the cause. Geopolitical tensions were also a constant backdrop at the festival, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the genocide in Gaza and US President Donald Trump’s proposal of tariffs on foreign-made films fuelling discussion. More than 900 actors and filmmakers signed an open letter denouncing the genocide in Gaza, according to the organisers.",

    "title": "Arsenal stun Barcelona to win the Women’s Champions League",
    "article_text": "Arsenal upset defending champions Barcelona 1-0 to win the Women’s Champions League for a second time. Stina Blackstenius scored in the 75th minute after being set up by fellow second-half substitute Beth Meadin the final at the Estadio Jose Alvaladein Lisbon on Saturday. Arsenal’s title came 18 years after it became the first, and still the only, English club to win the top club title in women’s football. Arsenal’s players embraced on the final whistle and ran to celebrate in front of the red-and-white corner of the stands, which were otherwise mostly dressed in burgundy and blue. “We believed from the moment our Champions League journey started,” Arsenal striker Alessia Russo told broadcaster TNT Sports. “We knew that we had the capabilities. We knew that we could be good enough. It was just about going and doing it. And we’ve done it!” Barcelona were considered the heavy favourite. They were aiming for a fourth title in five years and to become the only team other than Lyon to win three consecutive titles. The team led by two-time Ballon d’Or winners Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas won nine straight in the competition and blew out Wolfsburg and English champion Chelsea in the knockout rounds. But Arsenal locked down in defence, except for early in the second half, and created the best chances. Only two superb saves by Barcelona goalkeeper Cata Coll to deny Frida Maanum and Blackstenius kept it scoreless, until Blackstenius finally beat her. The victory marks an incredible finish to a rocky season for Arsenal, which included coach Jonas Eidevall resigning and being replaced by assistant Renee Seglers. Since taking over, Seglers steered the team through a spectacular European campaign. Arsenal built its confidence from come-from-behind wins over Real Madrid and eight-time champion Lyon in the knockout rounds before laying low the almighty Barcelona. The loss was a huge disappointment for the large group of Barcelona fans who filled the stadium that is home to Sporting Lisbon. Blue-and-burgundy shirts and flags outnumbered the red-and-white section, but their calls of “Yes we can!” in the final minutes were not enough to inspire a comeback by the Catalan club. The closest Barcelona came to a goal was a shot by Claudia Pina that hit the crossbar just after halftime when the Spanish team had its best period. Otherwise, the game was to Arsenal’s liking. “We are very sorry for all our fans who have come to support us,” Bonmati told Catalunya Radio in the field before the award ceremony. “We will try to do it again.” Arsenal shook off some early jitters in defence and soon had Barcelona on the back foot. Arsenal’s pressure up the field stopped Barcelona from getting their possession game going, and Arsenal found spaces with long balls down the left flank. England striker Russo was a rock for Arsenal, using her size to win balls and keep the attack going. Arsenal thought it went ahead in the 22nd but a video review waived off an own goal by Barcelona’s Irene Paredes when the referee spotted an offside by Frida Maanum. Maanum then went close with a long shot in the 27th that Coll did well to stretch and push over her bar. Bonmatí was the only Barcelona player who seemed to be in the flow before halftime. Her dribble moves through the middle created a few threats and kept Arsenal on guard in defence. Leah Williamson blocked her best shot deep in the box in the 12th. Barcelona came out of the restart firing. Pina hit the woodwork with her chipped shot from a sharp angle in the 49th. Bonmati forced goalie Daphne van Domselaar to get low to parry her shot, and Ona Batlle bombarded the area with three shots from long range. But Blackstenius set the tone when she had a golden chance when she stole a ball with only Cata to beat, but the goalie got her leg out to block her effort in the 72nd. The Sweden forward would not be denied a second time.",

    "title": "‘How do you go to sleep?’: Israeli captive families slam Netanyahu at rally",
    "article_text": "Families ofIsraeli captivesheld in Gaza have intensified their criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid large protests across the country, as the expanded military ground offensive and deadly bombardment in the Palestinian territory put the release of their loved ones at risk. On Saturday, protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv, Shar HaNegev Junction, Kiryat Gat, and Jerusalem, with members of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum accusing the Israeli government of prioritising its war over securing the return of their relatives. “We demand that the decision-makers return to the negotiating table and not leave it until an agreement is reached that will bring them all back,” the group said in a statement on Saturday. Among those speaking at a rally in Tel Aviv on Saturday was Einav Zangauker, the mother of captive Matan Zangauker, who directly addressed Netanyahu: “Tell me, Mr Prime Minister: How do you go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning. How do you look in the mirror knowing that you’re abandoning 58 hostages?” The mounting anger among families has only deepened in recent days following Netanyahu’s nomination of Major General David Zini as the next head of the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency. Zini has reportedly voiced opposition to any deal to bring an end to Israel’s war on Gaza, telling colleagues during Israeli military meetings: “I oppose hostage deals. This is a forever war,” according to Israel’s Channel 12. “The families of the kidnapped are outraged by the words of Major General Zini. If the publication is true, these are shocking and condemnable words coming from someone who will be the one to decide the fate of the kidnapped men and women,” the forum said in astatementon Friday. “Appointing a Shin Bet chief who puts Netanyahu’s war before the abduction of the kidnapped is tantamount to committing a crime and doing injustice to the entire people of Israel,” the group said. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, says Netanyahu’s new appointment “wants military pressure and escalation in the war on Gaza, and that’s why he was chosen”. “But there’s a lot of pressure on Netanyahu internationally in the last couple of weeks to try to get Israel to end theblockade of Gazaand stop the war altogether, and the expanding military operations. The military says all the brigades called up are now operating inside Gaza, she continued. “Family members say the intensified attacks will only kill the remaining captives. But Netanyahu is part of the most right-wing Israeli government in Israel’s history – people who have largely been against any ceasefire deal, largely against any end to the war”, she added. Netanyahu’s decision to appoint Zini came just one day after Israel’s Supreme Court found his attempt to fire outgoingShin Bet chief Ronen Barto be “unlawful”, citing a conflict of interest tied to Netanyahu’s ongoing corruption trial. Despite the court ruling that Netanyahu could not appoint a replacement, he proceeded with the appointment of Zini anyway. The attorney general later warned that the prime minister had defied legal guidance and tainted the appointment process. The criticism comes as Netanyahu still faces an international arrest warrant request from the International Criminal Court over war crimes committed during the Gaza war.",

    "title": "Outrage, horror after Israeli attack kills nine children of Gaza doctor",
    "article_text": "An Israeli strike has killed nearly the entire family of a Khan Younis doctor while she was at work, Gaza health officials said. The attack hit the home of Alaa al-Najjar, a paediatrician at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital, on Friday, setting it ablaze and killing nine of her 10 children, according to the head of the hospital’s paediatrics department, Ahmad al-Farra. The dead children, two of whom remain under the rubble, range in age from seven months to 12 years old, said Gaza’s Government Media Office. It named them as Sidar, Luqman, Sadin, Reval, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Rakan and Yahya. Al-Najjar’s husband was critically injured in the attack. He has severe chest and head wounds, including a skull fracture, and is now receiving treatment in Nasser Hospital’s intensive care unit, al-Farra told Al Jazeera. The couple’s only surviving child, 11-year-old Adam, is also severely injured. He is currently “in the moderate ICU department with his mother”, said al-Farra. “It is unbelievable,” al-Farra said of the attack’s impact. “You can’t imagine the shock that [al-Najjar] had when she heard about that [attack]. But up until now, she is trying to be near her son and her husband to survive.” He called on people around the world to “be on the right side of humanity” and speak out against the bombardment. “These children, they have no voice. Their mother … she’s [in shock],” he said. “Please, I ask everyone to be her voice [in] this world. Please.” The UN’s special rapporteur for the Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, slammed the attack on the al-Najjar home as part of a “sadistic pattern” of a “new phase of genocide” facing Palestinians in the besieged enclave. Two doctors go to work to assist others.Nine of their kids are killed by an Israeli missile targeting their home. Only surviving child, in critical conditions. Targeting families in the still-standing buildings: distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide.https://t.co/6tlylARKK5 — Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur oPt (@FranceskAlbs)May 24, 2025 Hamas said it followed a routine of Israel “deliberately targeting … medical personnel, civilians and their families in an attempt to break their will”. The Israeli military said it had struck suspected fighters operating from a structure next to its forces in an area where civilians had been evacuated. “The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review,” the military added. On Monday, Israel issued forced evacuation orders for Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, warning of an “unprecedented attack”. There has been heavy, deadly bombardment in the area daily. The al-Najjar children were among dozens killed in Israel’s attacks on Friday and Saturday. According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, the bodies of 79 people killed in Israeli attacks were brought to hospitals between Friday and midday Saturday. That count does not include facilities in the north of the enclave that are inaccessible, it said. The ministry puts the overall death toll in Gaza since October 2023 at 53,901, with 122,593 injured.",

    "title": "Australia begins cleanup after floods kill 5, strand thousands",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced the start of a cleanup operation in eastern Australia afterrecord-breaking floodskilled five people and stranded tens of thousands of people. Damage assessments are under way for the coastal region of New South Wales in the east, where at least 10,000 properties are thought to have been damaged, the state’s emergency services agency said on Saturday. Conditions have eased since Friday after days of relentless rain isolated towns, swept away livestock and destroyed homes, the agency added. “We’re continuing to work closely across federal, state and local governments to make sure Australians get the support they need now and through recovery,” Albanese posted on X. Despite improving conditions, hundreds of residents remain in evacuation centres with 52 rescues made overnight, State Emergency Services commissioner Mike Wassing said. The death toll from flooding rose to five after a man in his 80s was found at a flooded property about 50km (32 miles) from Taree, one of the worst-hit towns, police said. It’s “awful to hear the news of more loss of life”, Albanese said after being forced to cancel his trip to Taree on Friday due to floodwaters. At their worst, the flooding isolated about 50,000 people and submerged roads in the country’s most populous state. Coastal areas were left littered with debris and dead animals after a powerful storm system dumped months’ worth of rain in three days. Train services, including airport services, were affected by flooded tracks. Sydney airport shut two of its three runways for an hour on Friday morning, delaying flights. Australia has suffered a series of extreme weather events in recent years, which experts have attributed toclimate change. Frequent flooding has caused widespread devastation in the country since early 2021, following droughts and bushfires at the end of the last decade.",

    "article_text": "Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other top officials in Istanbul as Westernsanctions on Syria are lifted. The two leaders were pictured by Turkiye’s state media shaking hands after an official reception and joining for a meeting at the Dolmabahce Palace in the country’s largest city on Saturday. Erdogan’s office said the Turkish president told al-Sharaa his country welcomes the lifting of the sanctions. He also said that “Israel’s occupation and aggression in Syrian territory is unacceptable” and that Turkiye will continue to oppose it on every platform, according to a statement on X. The presidency said in a short statement released through state media that the leaders discussed “a number of mutual files”. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, National Intelligence Organisation Director Ibrahim Kalin, and the secretary of Turkish Defence Industries, Haluk Gorgun, were part of the talks, which were closed to the press. Al-Sharaa, who enjoyed sweepingTurkish backingin overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was accompanied by his Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra and Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani. The Syrian interim leader was alsoreceived by Erdogan in the capital, Ankara, in early February, in what was his second international trip after a visit to Riyadh to meet Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The two sides have been discussing deepening bilateral relations and the reconstruction of Syria, as regional allies helped convince United States President Donald Trump to lift devastating sanctions imposed on Syria. Washington on Fridaylifted the first sanctionsas part of the drive announced by Trump during his regional tour earlier this month. The European Union has also followed suit, lifting economic sanctions to help with Syria’s recovery after years of civil war. The new Syrian government has welcomed the lifting of the sanctions, with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday describing the move as a “positive step in the right direction to reduce humanitarian and economic struggles in the country”. Trump’s special envoy to Syria, the current US ambassador to Turkiye, Thomas Barrack, said he met al-Sharaa on Saturday in Istanbul and praised the leader “taking meaningful steps” so far regarding foreign fighters and relations with Israel. The first of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed in 1979, when Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez, was in power. But they were hugely levelled up after the al-Assad government launched a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2011, whichtriggered the country’s civil war, which killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. The sanctions targeted any entity or company working with the al-Assad establishment, including those involved in rebuilding the country.",

    "article_text": "Voters in southern Lebanon are casting their ballots in municipal elections seen as a test of support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and armed group. The vote on Saturday in the mostly Shia area, where Hezbollah is allied with Amal – the party led by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri – marks the final phase of Lebanon’s staggered local elections. It comes after a November 2024 ceasefire between the group and Israel was supposed to end months of attacks. lsrael, however,has continuedsporadic strikes as recently as on Thursday, when air raids hit multiple locations in the south. Both Hezbollah and Amal are widely expected to dominate the municipal races, having already secured control of numerous councils unopposed. Turnout was high in border villages ravaged by last year’s conflict, with residents of Kfar Kila – a town nearly levelled by Israeli attacks – voting in nearbyNabatieh. Others from surrounding areas cast ballots in Tyre. “The will of life is stronger than death and the will of construction is stronger than destruction,” Lebanese President Joseph Aoun told reporters on Saturday, as he made a tour of the country’s south. He said he voted for the first time in 40 years in his hometown of Aaichiyeh. Among those heading to the polls were Hezbollah members still recovering from a series of Israeli attacks in September 2024, whenthousands of pagers explodednearly simultaneously, killing more than a dozen people and wounding nearly 3,000. “Southerners are proving again that they are with the choice of resistance,” Hezbollah legislator Ali Fayyad, who represents border villages, said in Nabatieh. The vote comes at a critical time for Hezbollah. While the group emerged from the conflict with reduced military capabilities and diminished political leverage, the elections offer a platform to reaffirm its influence in the region. “Lebanon has still not fully recovered from last year’s war between Hezbollah and Israel. In fact, Israel continues to target Hezbollahdespite a ceasefire,” said Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Nabatieh. “Hezbollah, no doubt was militarily weakened during the conflict; it lost a lot of its military power but it is using these elections as an opportunity to show that it still has political influence,” Khodr added. Many feel Hezbollah failed to shield them during the war, yet fears of isolation persist, she said. “They feel vulnerable … not just towards Israel, but also in a deeply divided country and they feel that opponents of Hezbollah are also marginalising the community as a whole.” Lebanon’s new government has pledged to create a state monopoly on arms, raising pressure on Hezbollah to disarm as required under the United States-brokered truce with Israel. Lebanon now faces the massive task of rebuilding after 14 months of war, with the World Bank estimating its reconstruction needs at more than $11bn. In October 2023, Hezbollah launched a rocket campaign on Israel in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, which was being bombarded by Israel following a surprise attack led by Palestinian group Hamas. Israel responded with shelling and air attacks on Lebanon that escalated into a full-blown war before the ceasefire went into effect in late November.",

    "title": "Arson attack probed as Cannes and parts of southern France suffer power cut",
    "article_text": "French police are investigating a suspected arson attack as the main cause of a power outage which hit the Alpes-Maritimes region in southern France, including Cannes, which is hosting its world-famous annualfilm festival. “We are looking into the likelihood of a fire being started deliberately,” a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie said on Saturday, adding that no arrests had been made at this stage. Police sources said the outage was caused by an overnight fire, probably an arson attack, at a high-voltage substation in the village of Tanneron, which supplies Cannes. Both the Tanneron power substation and an electricity pylon in Villeneuve-Loubet were vandalised overnight, prosecutors and local officials later confirmed. The local authority for the Alpes-Maritimes region had said earlier on Saturday that the western part of the area, which includes Cannes, was suffering from a major electricity outage. The outage, which affected 160,000 homes, according to RTE and regional officials, started shortly after 10am local time (08:00 GMT) on Saturday. Locals cheered loudly and music blasted from beachfront speakers as power was restored around 3pm (13:00 GMT). Traffic lights had been knocked out, and businesses closed on the main shopping street of the Alpes-Maritimes holiday destination. Separate poweroutages swept acrossthe Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France on Monday, disrupting critical infrastructure and airport operations. Officials denied foul play. WhileSpain and Portugal suffered blackoutslast month, the French Basque Country saw brief power outages with interruptions lasting only a few minutes, according to RTE. The latest outage came just hours before the 78th Cannes Film Festival closure with an awards ceremony at the Palais des Festivals on Saturday evening. Despite the power cut, festival organisers earlier said they had switched to an alternative electricity supply, which enabled them to “maintain the events and screenings planned for today in normal conditions, including the closing ceremony”. After a politically charged two weeks, a jury led by French actor Juliette Binoche is expected to announce the winners among 22 films competing for the Palme d’Or for best film. This year, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,the genocide in Gazaand United States PresidentDonald Trumpwere the biggest talking points at the festival. More than 900 actors and filmmakers signed an open letter denouncing the genocide in Gaza, according to the organisers.",

    "article_text": "Cristiano Ronaldo is in “discussions” to play at FIFA’s inaugural Club World Cup this summer, according to the president of the sport’s global governing body. Gianni Infantino says the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward might play in the tournament, which is beingstaged in the United States in June, because of a unique transfer window. Ronaldo’s Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr did not qualify for the tournament, but Infantino suggested that the Portugal star could switch to one of the 32 teams participating in the tournament. “Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup,” Infantino told online streamer IShowSpeed, whose YouTube channel has more than 39 million subscribers. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows? Still a few weeks’ time, will be fun.” FIFA confirmed on Wednesday that last-minute transfer signings are open to all teams going to the tournament, which fuelled more speculation that one of them will try to sign the 40-year-old Ronaldo on a short-term deal, potentially a loan. Such a move would be unprecedented in modern football, though it could appeal to FIFA by boosting the profile and ticket sales of an inaugural tournament being played in 11 US cities. A transfer for Ronaldo would also reunite him and Lionel Messi in the same competition for the first time since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Last October, FIFA invited Messi’s Inter Miami to enter the tournament in the slot that was expected to be reserved for the host nation’s champions. Inter Miami were eliminated in the MLS Cup playoffs. Speculative reports have linked Ronaldo to the one Saudi club that qualified, Al Hilal, the Brazilian club Palmeiras and Wydad of Morocco, even though that club is currently banned by FIFA from registering new signings. Transfers can be made from June 1-10 and again from June 27 to July 3, according to exceptional rules FIFA approved in October. “The objective is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players’ participation,” FIFA said in Wednesday’s statement.",

    "title": "Cooking in Gaza is now a toxic affair",
    "article_text": "In Gaza, we have sounds of fear and anxiety. We know them all too well: the hum of spy drones overhead, ambulances screaming through narrow streets, the roar of military aircraft, the thunder of bombings, the cries of people trapped under rubble and now a new sound: the sharp clinking of empty gas cylinders. We used to know well the tiny click of a gas stove burner starting – that small spark at the start of a day that meant a hot meal or a cup of tea was coming. Now, that sound is gone, replaced by the hollow clang of emptiness. We used our last drop of cooking gas in the middle of Ramadan. Like all other families in Gaza, we turned to firewood. I remember my mother saying, “From today, we cannot even make a cup of tea for suhoor.” That is because starting a fire, having even a flicker of light at night could attract a drone or a quadcopter, resulting in an air strike or a barrage of bullets. We don’t know why light at night is targeted, but we know we don’t have the right to ask. So we ate cold food for suhoor and saved the fire for iftar. After bakeries shut down due to the gas shortage last month, reliance on fire increased – not just for our family but for everyone. Many people built makeshift clay ovens or fires in alleyways or between tents to bake loaves of bread. Thick, black smoke hangs heavy in the air – not the smoke of death from missiles, but the smoke of life that kills us slowly. Each morning, we wake up coughing – not a passing cough, but a deep, persistent, choking cough that rattles through our chests. Then, my brother and I walk to the edge of our neighbourhood, where a man sells wood from the back of a cart. He gathers it from bombed-out buildings, fallen trees, broken furniture, and the ruins of homes and schools. We carry back whatever our weak bodies can and move on to the next suffering: burning the wood. This is not easy. It demands hours of chopping and breaking wood and breathing in dust. Our father, despite suffering from shortness of breath, insists on helping. This stubbornness of his has become the source of daily arguments, especially between him and my brother. As we light the fire, our eyes turn red because of the smoke, our throats sting. The coughing intensifies. Firewood has become incredibly expensive. Before the war, we would pay a dollar for eight kilos, but now you can buy only one kilo – or even less – for that price. Impoverishment has forced many people to chop down their own trees. The greenery in our neighbourhood has all but disappeared. Many of our neighbours have started cutting down the trees they grew in their yards. Even we have begun using branches from our olive tree – the same tree we never dared touch when we were young, afraid that disturbing it would cause the blossoms to fall and yield fewer olives. Families who have no trees to chop have turned to burning plastic, rubber and trash – anything that will catch fire. But burning these materials releases toxic fumes, poisoning the air they breathe and seeping into the food they cook. The taste of plastic clings to every bite, turning each meal into a health risk. Constant exposure to this smoke can cause severe respiratory distress and chronic illnesses and even lead to life-threatening diseases such as cancer. Yet, what choice do people have? Without fire, there is no food. There is something deeply cruel about the transformation of the kitchen – from a symbol of family and hospitality into a toxic zone. The fire that once meant warmth now burns our lungs and eyes. The meals cooked can hardly be called that: soup from lentils; bread from infested flour or flour mixed with sand. The joy of preparing food has been replaced by fear, pain and exhaustion. This lack of cooking gas has done more than cripple our access to food – it has dismantled the rituals that hold families together. Meals are no longer a time to gather and enjoy family time but a time to endure. A time to cough. A time to pray that today’s fire does not make someone too sick. If a bomb does not kill us, we face a slower death: quiet, toxic and just as cruel. This is Gaza today. A place where survival means inhaling poison just to have a cup of tea in the morning. A place where firewood has become more valuable than gold. A place where even the simple act of eating has been weaponised. And yet, we burn. We cough. We keep going. What other choice do we have?

    "title": "Ukraine, Russia exchange more prisoners after ‘difficult night’ of attacks",
    "article_text": "Russia and Ukraine have exchanged more prisoners of war (POWs) as Ukrainian officials renew their calls for more sanctions in response to dozens of attack drones and ballistic missiles launched by Moscow’s forces at Kyiv overnight. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Saturday it released 307 Ukrainian POWs in exchange for as many Russian servicemen, who are being cared for in Belarus before their return to Russia. Ukraine confirmed the exchange, saying among those returned were army soldiers, agents of the State Border Guard Service, and members of the National Guard of Ukraine. The two sidesreleased 270 servicemen and 120 civilianseach on the Ukrainian border with Belarus on Friday, as part of the biggest prisoner exchange since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Both sides have agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners, but the aerial attacks and ground fighting have not stopped. Ukraine’s military on Saturday saidovernight attackslaunched from multiple Russian regions used 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles to hit Kyiv and other areas, damaging several apartment buildings and a shopping mall, and injuring at least 15 people in the capital. Sites in the Ukrainian regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Zaporizhia were also hit, with Ukrainian forces saying six of the ballistic missiles were shot down by their air defences, along with 245 drones, many of which were said to be Iranian-designed. Oleh Syniehubov, head of Kharkiv’s regional state administration, said on Saturday morning that four Ukrainians were killed and several others injured over the past 24 hours in the region as a result of multiple Russian attacks. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said at least 100 Ukrainian drones attempted to strike Russian targets overnight. It said 64 unmanned aerial vehicles were downed overnight in the skies of the Belgorod region, along with 10 additional drones launched on Saturday morning. Dozens more projectiles were downed over Kursk, Lipetsk and Voronezh and another five were shot down over Tver, northwest of Moscow, it said. In a social media post, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the country had another “difficult night” that he believes should convince the world that “the reason for the war being dragged out is in Moscow”. “It is obvious that we need to put much more pressure on Russia to get results and start real diplomacy. We are waiting for sanctions from the US, Europe and all our partners. Only additional sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.” The Group of Seven nations threatened on Friday to impose further sanctions on Russia if itfails to agree to a ceasefirewith Ukraine. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said a week aftertalks in Istanbul, Turkiye,led only to an agreement on the exchange of prisoners of war, that Moscow has yet to send any “peace memorandum”. “Instead, Russia sends deadly drones and missiles at civilians,” he wrote in a post on X, adding that “increased sanctions pressure on Moscow is necessary to accelerate the peace process”. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said the Istanbul meeting was disappointing for Zelenskyy because he wanted a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Instead, it was a much lower-level meeting. But they did manage to get this prisoner swap,” he said, adding that the exchanges could be over by Sunday, but the details were not clear. “Zelenskyy has been disappointed by the lack of additional US sanctions against Russia. Europe has agreed to new sanctions, but it’s not clear that they will really have the desired effect to bring Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.”",

    "title": "Why the future of Bangladesh’s Muhammad Yunus administration is uncertain",
    "article_text": "On the surface, it was a routine closed-door meeting between Bangladesh’s interim leader and Nobel laureateMuhammad Yunusand the chiefs of the country’s three armed forces, to discuss law and order. But the May 20 meeting came amid what multiple officials familiar with the internal workings of the government described to Al Jazeera as an intensifying power struggle in Dhaka. Portrayed in social and mainstream media in Bangladesh as a “cold war” between the armed forces and the interim administration, these tensions now threaten the future of Yunus’s role, nine months after he took charge following the ousting of former Prime MinisterSheikh Hasinaand the rulingAwami League. Hasina fled to India in August 2024 amid amass uprisingagainst her 15-year-long rule, during which she was accused of orchestrating extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. The meeting also came amid rumours that Yunus was considering stepping down. However, following another cabinet meeting on Saturday, acting head of the planning ministry, Wahiduddin Mahmud, told reporters: “The chief adviser [Yunus] is staying with us – he hasn’t said he’ll resign – and the other advisers are also staying; we are here to carry out the responsibilities given to us,” following a closed-door meeting of the interim government’s advisory council amid ongoing political unrest. Analysts, however, say, the standoff is not over yet. We unpack the latest tumult in Bangladesh, and what it means for the country’s fledgling efforts to return to electoral democracy. The Bangladesh Army has remained deployed since July 2024, following themass proteststhat led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ouster. Their continued presence was necessitated by the collapse of civilian law enforcement during the upheaval, including a nationwide police strike that left many stations abandoned and public order in disarray. Although the police resumed operations in mid-August, the army’s presence has been maintained as part of a civil-military consensus, because of unrest in the country. On Wednesday, Bangladesh’s army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, publicly urged that national elections be held by December this year, warning that prolonged deployment of the army for civil duties could compromise the country’s defences. According to a report by The Daily Star, General Waker told a high-level gathering at Dhaka Cantonment, “Bangladesh needs political stability. This is only possible through an elected government, not by unelected decision-makers.” The comments came during a rare address in which he delivered a 30-minute speech, followed by more than an hour of questions and answers. Officers from across the country and at Bangladeshi UN missions reportedly joined the event, both physically and virtually, in full combat uniform – a show of unity and resolve. “The army is meant for defending the nation, not for policing … We must return to barracks after elections,” Waker was quoted in The Daily Star as saying. His remarks indicate a difference of opinion with the Yunus administration’s stated intention of holding elections no earlier than mid-2026, to allow time for political and electoral reforms first, in order to ensure a fair election. According to local media reports, Waker is also strongly opposed to key initiatives being considered by the interim government. On a proposed humanitarian corridor into Myanmar’s Rakhine State, he reportedly said: “There will be no corridor. The sovereignty of Bangladesh is not negotiable.” He warned that any such move could drag Bangladesh into a dangerous proxy conflict. “Only a political government elected by the people can make such decisions,” he said, according to the paper. The army chief also voiced concern about making other decisions without an electoral mandate – including the potential foreign management of Chattogram Port, Bangladesh’s main seaport, and the launch of Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet service – which he said could compromise national security. “The army will not allow anyone to compromise our sovereignty,” The Daily Star quoted him as saying. His remarks came amid widespread speculation – still unaddressed by either the military or the government – that the Yunus administration had attempted to remove General Waker from his post last week. Though unconfirmed, the rumour has dominated public discourse and prompted questions about civil-military relations during the transitional period. The timing, therefore, of General Waker’s assertive public statement – and its emphasis on constitutional process and national sovereignty – is widely viewed as a signal of growing unease within the military over the interim government’s expanding civilian initiatives, according to analysts. Yes. Since its formation on August 8 last year, the interim government has faced escalating pressure from different sides. While the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) insists that national elections must be held by December, the National Citizen Party (NCP) – a student-led party formed earlier this year – and several other political groups argue that sweeping reforms and the prosecution of former Awami League (AL) leaders for killings resulting from the brutal crackdown on student-led protests last year must precede any election. Bangladesh’s largest political party, the BNP, has launched a wave of protests over other demands as well, including that its candidate, who lost an allegedly rigged mayoral election in Dhaka on February 1, 2020, under the Awami League regime, be reinstated as mayor. On Thursday, the BNP held a news conference demanding an election by the end of the year, as well as the resignation of two student advisers and the national security adviser. The party warned that without these steps, continued cooperation with the Yunus-led administration would become untenable. On Saturday, Yunus is expected to meet with both the BNP and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI), the largest Islamic political party in Bangladesh. On Saturday, following a cabinet meeting, it was announced that Yunus will not step down as interim leader of Bangladesh. But amid this growing turbulence, speculation had intensified that he might have been preparing to resign. Local media began reporting that he had indicated that he intended to step down and address the nation in a televised statement, during a cabinet meeting on Thursday afternoon, following widespread social media chatter. That evening, Nahid Islam – a student leader from the July uprising against the previous government and now head of the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) – met Yunus along with two student advisers to make an appeal for him to stay on. After the meeting, Nahid confirmed to BBC Bangla that Yunus was seriously considering stepping down. By Friday evening (13:00 GMT), sources within the interim administration told Al Jazeera that Yunus was still weighing his options. Yunus was understood to be contemplating resigning because of intensifying political pressure, according to local media reports. Two advisers quoted in the Samakal newspaper said Yunus told cabinet members on Thursday that the political parties and other government institutions had failed to deliver on promises to cooperate with the transitional government to implement state reforms and a peaceful democratic transition since the fall of Hasina’s government last year. It had become impossible to carry out his responsibilities, he was reported as saying. Pressure is also mounting to hold an election. “The prospect of a fair election in the current situation is slim,” he said. He was concerned any election would be interfered with or rigged and he did not want to have to take responsibility for it. Later on Thursday evening, Yunus met Information Adviser Mahfuj Alam, Local Government Adviser Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain and NCP convenor Nahid Islam at his official residence, the Jamuna State Guest House in Dhaka. Speaking to BBC Bangla afterwards, Nahid confirmed Yunus was considering resigning and quoted him as saying he felt “held hostage” by protests and political gridlock. “I cannot work like this if you, all the political parties, cannot reach a common ground,” Nahid quoted Yunus as saying. He urged the interim leader to “remain strong”, stressing the hopes the public had pinned on him after the July uprising that ousted the Awami League government. Meanwhile, Yunus’s ambitious reform agenda is reportedly faltering, with analysts noting that key arms of the state – including the police and civil bureaucracy – are increasingly slipping beyond the interim government’s control. One striking example among many, they say, is a proposal to split the National Board of Revenue (NBR), the country’s authority for tax administration, overseeing the collection of income tax, value-added tax (VAT) and customs duties, into two separate entities – a move that the government says is aimed at enhancing efficiency and the integrity of Bangladesh’s tax system. This has been met with strong resistance from senior officials of the NBR over fears that experienced revenue officers will be sidelined. Speaking to Al Jazeera, BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said his party never wanted Yunus to resign. “Nobody asked for his resignation, and we do not want him to do so,” he stated. “The people are waiting to cast their vote and bring back democracy. They have been deprived of this for nearly two decades,” said Khasru. “We expect him to go for a free and fair election and peacefully hand over power. That’s how he came in.” He questioned the delay in setting an election timeline. “What is the wait for? This is something [about which] a very strong conversation is going on in the country.” Khasru said the BNP wants the administration to move into caretaker mode – with a leaner cabinet and the removal of some controversial figures, particularly those with political ambitions or affiliations. “They have already floated a political party,” he said, referring to the student representatives. “Others made partisan statements. These should go if you’re serious about a credible election.” He dismissed any contradiction between reforms and elections, saying both could move forward simultaneously. “Where there is consensus, reforms can be completed within weeks.” Khasru also voiced confidence in the Election Commission and the role of the army in ensuring a fair vote. “This is not the era of Sheikh Hasina,” he remarked, suggesting a more conducive political environment for elections. On the question of trying former Awami League leaders, he said judicial processes could continue in parallel. “The judiciary must do its job – the elected government will continue if more is needed.” “BNP suffered the most under the previous regime,” he added. “The trials are a national consensus.” BNP Standing Committee member Salahuddin Ahmed echoed this sentiment in a TV interview on Friday: “If Yunus is personally unable to carry out his duties, the state will find an alternative.” But he added: “As a globally respected figure, we hope he will understand the situation and announce an election roadmap by December.” NCP’s Senior Joint Convenor Ariful Islam Adeeb rejected the BNP’s narrative, telling Al Jazeera: “All parties were meant to support the interim government after the July uprising, but the BNP stuck to old tactics based on muscle power – that’s the root of the crisis.” He urged unity, saying: “BNP and all other parties must come together for the national interest.” Meanwhile, demonstrations and behind-the-scenes meetings continued across Dhaka. On Thursday evening, top leaders of five political parties, including the NCP, attended an emergency meeting at the headquarters of another Islamic political party, Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB), called by its chief Mufti Syed Muhammad Rezaul Karim. They urged all “anti-fascist forces” to unite, defend national sovereignty, and support a credible election under Yunus after key reforms. Several of these parties, including BJI, argue that elections must come after key reforms – such as adopting a proportional voting system and ensuring accountability for past abuses – to prevent any repeat of past authoritarian practices. They believe holding elections without these changes would undermine public trust and risk another crisis. BJI chief Shafiqur Rahman joined the IAB meeting via phone and endorsed the resolution. On Thursday, he urged Yunus to convene an all-party dialogue to resolve the crisis. Then, on Friday night, BJI’s Shafiqur Rahman requested a meeting with Yunus, proposing to convene at 12:00 GMT (6pm local time) on Saturday. Speaking to Al Jazeera on Friday night, NCP Joint Convenor Sarwar Tushar said: “Whatever the rumours, we believe Dr Muhammad Yunus is committed to his historic responsibility. “There is massive expectation – both from the international community and the people,” he added. While acknowledging political divisions, Tushar said: “If everyone moves beyond party agendas and focuses on a national agenda, the crisis can be resolved through dialogue.” Political analyst Rezaul Karim Rony told Al Jazeera that talk of Yunus’s resignation may reflect growing frustration over the lack of unity within the transitional setup. “The unity that had formed around the post-uprising interim government appears to be weakening due to vested interests,” he said. “The resignation talk might be a signal underscoring the need to rebuild that unity.” Rony suggested that certain government appointments may have alienated political parties, raising questions about whether some actors have agendas beyond the official reform mandate. “This could be one reason why the government is struggling to gain broad political cooperation and function effectively,” he noted. Rony added: “At this point, advocating for elections may [make the administration] appear politically aligned with the BNP. But in the end, it should be up to the people to decide who they want to lead.” NCP’s Nahid Islam, however, sees otherwise. He warned in a Facebook post on Friday night: “There’s a conspiracy to sabotage the democratic transition and stage another 1/11-style arrangement.” The term “1/11” refers to January 11, 2007, when the military-backed caretaker government took control in Bangladesh amid political chaos and ruled for two years, suspending democratic processes. “Bangladesh has repeatedly been divided, national unity destroyed, to keep the country weak,” Nahid wrote. Urging Yunus to stay in office and deliver on promises of reform, justice and voting rights, he said, “Dr Yunus must resolve all political crises while in office.” He also outlined NCP’s demands: a timely July declaration, elections within the announced timeframe (Yunus has repeatedly promised that the election will be held between December 2025 to July 2026), a July Charter with core reforms before polls, visible justice for the July killings, and a roadmap for a new constitution through simultaneous elections to a Constituent Assembly and legislature. Meanwhile, public anxiety is rising. On Friday, the Bangladesh Army issued a Facebook alert debunking a fake media release circulated a day earlier, which falsely used the military’s logo in what it described as “an apparent attempt to sow confusion and create rifts” between the armed forces and the public. “Do not believe rumours. Do not be misled,” the statement warned. As the weekend continues, all eyes are on Muhammad Yunus – and whether he can stand firm and forge a new consensus to lead the country through its second transition since last year’s dramatic uprising.",

    "title": "Pacers-Knicks: Siakam, Indiana win Game 2 in East final",
    "article_text": "The Indiana Pacers are halfway to a chance to play for an elusive NBA title as they head home in their Eastern Conference finals, but they might prefer to stay right where they are. Pascal Siakam scored a playoff career-high 39 points on Friday night, as the Pacers beat the New York Knicks 114-109. The result means the Pacers lead 2-0 in the playoffs after the first two games of the series at the Knicks’ Madison Square Garden home arena. Game 3 is on Sunday night in Indiana, which will be rocking all day long with the Indianapolis 500 being run that afternoon. The Pacers can only hope to be as good there as they have been on the road, where they have won six straight games since falling at Milwaukee in Game 3 of the first round. “We have a long way to go, and it’s only going to get tougher for us,” Siakam said. Myles Turner added 16 points and Tyrese Haliburton had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds for the Pacers, who lost to the Lakers in 2000 in their only NBA Finals appearance. Siakam finished 15 for 23 from the field on a night nobody else on the high-scoring Pacers had more than five baskets. “Special game,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. “In the first half, he was the guy that got us going and got us through some difficult stretches.” Jalen Brunson had 36 points and 11 assists for the Knicks, who need a quick turnaround or their first appearance in the conference finals in 25 years will be a brief one. They defended much better after their crushing collapse ina 138-135 overtime loss in Game 1, but could not find enough scoring to come back after a bad start to the fourth quarter. Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns each had 20 points and seven rebounds for the Knicks, but Towns played just 28 minutes as coach Tom Thibodeau went longer with backup Mitchell Robinson, a much better defender who grabbed nine rebounds. No team has lost the first two games at home and come back to win a series in the conference finals. “Going into the fourth quarter, it’s a tie ballgame. We’ve just got to make better plays, more winning plays,” Thibodeau said. It was tied at 81 after three, before the Pacers opened the fourth with a 13-4 run to move ahead 94-85 on Siakam’s 3-pointer with 9:17 remaining. They would quickly push the margin back to around there every time the Knicks got any momentum, and it was 110-100 after another basket by Siakam with 2:45 to play. The Knicks scored nine straight to make it 110-109 on Josh Hart’s basket with 14 seconds to go. Aaron Nesmith made two free throws for the Pacers, Brunson was well off on a 3-point attempt, and Turner finished it out with two free throws. The 50th playoff meeting between the rivals — the Pacers lead 28-22, all since 1993 — more closely resembled their defensive battles of the 1990s than the shootout of two nights earlier. Indiana raced to a 19-9 lead, but the Knicks quickly caught them when Robinson and Deuce McBride entered, and the game remained within a single-digit margin for nearly the entire rest of the night.",

    "title": "Why did rumours of a coup sweep Ivory Coast this week?",
    "article_text": "Fake stories of a coup d’etat in the West African nation of Ivory Coast surfaced this week amid mounting tensions over the upcoming October general elections. Several accounts on social media sites, including Facebook and X, posted videos of huge crowds on streets with burning buildings, which they claimed were from the country’s commercial capital, Abidjan. However, no violence was reported by security forces or any other government authorities in the city this week. Abidjan residents also denied the claims on social media. On Thursday, the country’s National Agency for Information Systems Security of Ivory Coast (ANSSI) denied the rumours. In a statement published on local media sites, the agency said: “Publications currently circulating on the X network claim that a coup d’etat has taken place in Cote d’Ivoire [Ivory Coast] … This claim is completely unfounded. It is the result of a deliberate and coordinated disinformation campaign.” The rumours come just weeks after popular opposition politician Tidjane Thiam was barred from running for office after his eligibility was challenged in court over a technicality relating to his citizenship status. Thiam is appealing the ruling and claims the ban is political. Ivory Coast, Africa’s cocoa powerhouse, has a long history of election violence, with one episode a decade ago spiralling into armed conflict that resulted in thousands of deaths. Fears that President Alassane Ouattara might run for a fourth term have added to the tensions this time. Although the country has a two-term limit for presidents, a constitutional amendment in 2016 reset the clock on his terms, the president’s supporters argue, allowing him to run for a third five-year term in 2020. That same argument could also see him on the ballot papers this October, despite what experts say is widespread disillusionment with the political establishment in the country. Here’s what we know about the current political situation in the country: Videos showing hundreds of people demonstrating in the streets and setting fires to shops and malls started appearing on social media sites on Wednesday this week. French is the official language in Ivory Coast, but most of the posts and blogs with images purporting to be from were from Abidjan and claiming that a coup d’etat was in progress were written in English. Some posts also claimed that the country’s army chief of staff, Lassina Doumbia, had been assassinated and that President Ouattara was missing. These claims were untrue and have been denied by the office of the president. Credible media outlets, including Ivorian state media and private news media, did not report the alleged violence. It is unclear how the rumours that President Ouattara was missing emerged. On Thursday, he chaired a routine cabinet meeting in the capital. He also attended a ceremony commemorating the revered former president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, alongside Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe. The upcoming general elections on October 25 are at the root of current political tensions in the country. Elections have in the past been violent: During the October 2010 general election, former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to hand over power to Ouattara, who was proclaimed the winner by the electoral commission. Tense political negotiations failed, and the situation eventually spiralled into armed civil war, with Ouattara’s forces, backed by French troops, besieging Gbagbo’s national army. France is the former colonial power in Ivory Coast, and Ouattara has close ties to Paris. Some 3,000 people were killed in the violence. Gbagbo’s capture on April 11, 2011, marked the end of the conflict. He was later tried andacquittedby the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes in 2019. That painful history has spurred fears that this year’s polls could also turn violent, as several opposition candidates, including Gbagbo, have been barred from running, mainly due to past convictions. In 2018, the former president was sentenced in absentia to a 20-year jail term over the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) during the country’s post-election crisis. Last December, the governing Rally of Houphouetists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP) party nominated Ouattara for a fourth term as president. So far, Ouattara has refused to say whether he intends to run, triggering concerns among Ivorians, many of whom feel the president has outstayed his welcome. Analysts see the party’s nomination as setting the stage for his eventual candidature, however. Analysts also say there is widespread sympathy for the young military leaders who seized power in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso, and who have maintained a hostile stance towards France, unlike Ouattara. He has been praised for overseeing rapid economic stability in the last decade and a half, which has made the country the regional economic hub. Ouattara is also credited with bringing some level of political peace to the country. In 2023, he welcomed back Gbagbo, who had been living in Brussels since his 2021 ICC acquittal. Since then, election campaigns have not been as inflamed as they were in the 2000s when Gbagbo played on ethnic sentiments to incite opposition to Ouattara, whose father was originally from Burkina Faso. However, Ouattara’s critics accuse him of fighting to hold onto power unconstitutionally. Some also accuse him of coercing state institutions into railroading his political opponents, including in the latest case involving Thiam. His closeness with France, which is increasingly viewed as arrogant and neo-colonialistic, particularly by younger people across Francophone West Africa, has not won the president any favour from the country’s significant under-35 population. Thiam, 62, is a prominent politician and businessman in Ivorian political circles. He is a nephew of the revered Houphouet-Boigny and was the first Ivorian to pass the entrance exam to France’s prestigious Polytechnique engineering school. He returned from France to serve as a minister of planning and development from 1998 until 1999, when a coup d’etat collapsed the civilian government, and the army took control of the country. Thiam declined a cabinet position offered by the military government and left the country. He went on to take high-profile positions, first as the chief executive of the UK insurance group, Prudential, and then as head of global investment bank Credit Suisse. A corporate espionage scandal at the bank led to his resignation in 2020 after a colleague accused Thiam of spying on him. Thiam was cleared of any involvement. After returning to Ivory Coast in 2022, Thiam re-entered politics and rejoined the Democratic Party (PDCI), the former governing party which held power from independence in 1960 until the 1999 coup d’etat, and which is now the major opposition party. In December 2023, the party’s delegates overwhelmingly voted for Thiam to be the next leader following the death of former head and ex-President Henri Konan Bedie. At the time, PDCI officials said Thiam represented a breath of fresh air for the country’s politics, and many young people appeared ready to back him as the next president. But his ambitions came to a halt on April 22 when a judge ordered his name be struck off the list of contenders because Thiam had taken French nationality in 1987 and automatically lost Ivorian citizenship according to the country’s laws. Although the politician renounced his French nationality in February this year, the court ruled he had not done so before registering himself on the electoral roll in 2022, and was thus ineligible to be the party leader, a presidential candidate, or even a voter. Thiam and his lawyers argued that the law is inconsistent. Ivorian footballers on the country’s national team, Thiam pointed out in one interview with reporters, are mostly also French nationals, but face no restrictions on holding Ivorian nationality. “The bottom line is, I was born Ivorian,” Thiam told the BBC in an interview, accusing the government of trying to block what he said is his party’s likely success in this year’s elections. It is unclear if Thiam can legally make his way back onto the candidate list, but he is trying. In May, he resigned as PDCI president and was almost immediately re-elected with 99 percent of the vote. He has yet to reveal if he will attempt to re-register as a candidate, but has promised to keep up the fight. Thiam has pledged to attract industrial investment to the country as he once did as minister, and to remove the country from the France-backed CFA currency economy that comprises West and Central African countries formerly colonised by France, and sees their currencies pegged to the euro. Meanwhile, other strong candidates include Pascal Affi N’Guessan, 67, a former prime minister and close ally of Gbagbo, who will represent Gbagbo’s Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). Simone Gbagbo, the former first lady who is now divorced from Gbagbo, will also run, as the nominee for the Movement of the Capable Generations. She was sentenced to a 20-year term in 2015 on charges of undermining state security, but benefitted from an amnesty law to foster national reconciliation later in 2018.",

    "title": "UN chief says Gaza entering ‘cruellest phase’ of war as Palestinians starve",
    "article_text": "Palestinians in Gaza are enduring “what may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict,” says the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, warning that Israel’s escalating military campaign and prolonged blockade have pushed the population to thebrink of famine. “For nearly 80 days, Israel blocked the entry of life-saving international aid,” Guterres said in a statement on Friday, condemning the scale of human suffering. “The entire population of Gaza is facing the risk of famine.” Although Israel has allowed only several hundred trucks tocross into Gazathis week following a partial easing of its 11-week siege, Guterres described the flow of supplies as woefully insufficient. “All the aid authorised until now amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required,” he said. The UN chief said the Israeli campaign has intensified with “atrocious levels of death and destruction,” while access for humanitarian groups remains dangerous and erratic. “Eighty percent of Gaza has been either declared an Israeli militarised zone or is under evacuation orders,” he noted. “Without rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access, more people will die – and the long-term consequences on the entire population will be profound,” Guterres told reporters in New York. In Gaza, Palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to “find food and drinking water, and still queueing for hours in front of whatever is left of the operational local community kitchens that are providing only a tiny amount of food for a hungry population,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City. “The amount of food or the aid that has been allowed for the past two days, is not enough or sufficient, and does not address the deepening humanitarian crisis caused by months of Israeli devastation and bombardment across the strip,” he said. Meanwhile, Israeli attacks have killed at least 76 Palestinians across Gaza since Friday. At least 53,822 Palestinians have been killed inIsraeli attackssince October 7, 2023 and more than 122,382 others wounded – most of them women and children. Israel claims about300 truckshave entered Gaza since Monday through the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom to Israelis, but the UN says only a third of those deliveries have reached warehouses inside the enclave due to security constraints and chaos on the ground. The figure is far short of the more than 500 trucks that entered Gaza daily before the start of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023. A new United States-backed delivery mechanism – run by the newly established Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – is expected to take over aid distribution by the end of the month. Under the plan, private contractors would escort supplies to secure hubs, where civilian teams would handle distribution. But the UN has refused to participate, saying the scheme does not meet basic humanitarian standards. “The United Nations has been clear: we will not take part in any scheme that fails to respect international law and the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, independence and neutrality,” Guterres said. He stressed that the UN already has the infrastructure to respond. “The supplies – 160,000 pallets, enough to fill nearly 9,000 trucks – are waiting,” he said. “This is my appeal for life-saving aid for the long-suffering people of Gaza: let’s do it right. And let’s do it right away.”",

    "title": "Palestinians see plan to push them from land as Israel builds national park",
    "article_text": "Sebastia, occupied West Bank –Israel calls it an archaeological project to highlight Jewish heritage and create a new Israeli national park. Palestinians see it as further evidence of Israel’s plans to annex an ancient town and erase Palestinian history in an area that tells the 5,000-year-old shared story of the peoples who have lived in this land. Far-right, pro-settler Israeli government ministers were inSebastiaon May 12 as part of a delegation to mark the looming seizure of the town’s archaeological park, one of the largest and most important of 6,000 sites in the West Bank. Ultranationalist Israeli Minister of Heritage Amichai Eliyahu, himself a resident of an illegal West Bank settlement, hailed the beginning of Israeli excavation at the site and the coming creation of “Samaria National Park”, which will focus on the area’s Jewish history. Palestinians say that will come along with an attempt to paint over their ties to the land. The Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities called the excavations “preparation for Sebastia’s annexation and isolation from its surroundings”. Israeli politicians refer to Sebastia as Samaria, or Shomron in Hebrew, and say it was the capital of the Biblical Kingdom of Israel nearly three millennia ago. But the archaeological site includes the ruins of a Byzantine basilica, a Roman forum and amphitheatre, and the Crusader-era Church of St John, which was rebuilt into a mosque – and is believed to be the site of the tomb of John the Baptist, known in the Quran as Prophet Yahya. Sebastia’s archaeological park, once a tourism hotspot and still a pilgrimage site for Christians, is being considered for inclusion on UNESCO’s world heritage list, subject to an application being finalised by Palestinian officials. Sebastia mayor Mohammed Azim and town residents have long been warning of Israel’s intention to “Judaise” Sebastia and turn it into an Israeli-only tourism site. Alarm intensified after the municipality received a land seizure order to construct an installation for “military purposes” at the summit of an ancient hilltop in the area last July. Speaking to Al Jazeera in his office overlooking the increasingly deserted old town, Azim said a “river of blood will flow into the village” if construction of the barracks begins. “The military is aiming to make life unbearable for the residents here, so they eventually surrender to reality and leave – just like those who have been displaced in Jenin and Tulkarem,” Azim said, referring to the more than 40,000 Palestiniansdisplaced by Israeli military operationsin the occupied West Bank this year. “Now, soldiers enter the village daily – and with the clear intention of killing,” Azim added. “We will resist construction – peacefully, of course. The landowners will not give up their land.” The mayor called for condemnation of intensifying military violence in the village and the targeting of children, notably the army’s fatal shooting of 14-year-old Ahmad Jazar in January. For its part, the Israeli state argues that the village of Sebastia will not be affected by the archaeological work, as it lies outside the boundaries of the proposed national park. But Sebastia Archaeological Museum curator and lifelong resident, Walaa Ghazzal, says the plans are an escalation in Israel’s plans to eventually expel residents and business owners and prevent Palestinians from accessing the town, its ruins, and the sprawling hills and olive fields around it. Ghazzal told Al Jazeera that “residents are afraid of the future”, especially those near the ruins. “The situation is very dangerous,” she said. “Soon, they will prevent us from going to the archaeological site. “In my opinion, we have only months before we are told to leave our homes,” Ghazzal added. “We are seeing the future inGazaand in the camps [in the West Bank]. They are trying to erase us.” Israeli ministers and settler politicians are using rhetoric about protecting Jewish Biblical heritage to disguise their long-held desire to annex Sebastia, Azim said. Eliyahu was joined in Sebastia by Minister of Environmental Protection Idit Silman and Yossi Dagan, chairman of the Shomron Regional Council, which controls 35 illegal West Bank settlements. Silman has hailed the scheme and told Israeli media, “historical justice is being done”, accusing Palestinians of attempting to “erase” Jewish heritage. The Israeli government has long been clear that Sebastia, which most historians agree was the capital of the Kingdom of Israel for less than 200 years, will be taken over and transformed into the centrepiece of Israeli tourism in the West Bank. In May 2023, the Israeli government approved a 30 million shekel (more than $8m) scheme to restore the park and establish a tourism centre, new access roads, and an expanded military presence. The four million shekel ($1.2m) regeneration of a disused Hijaz railway station about two miles from Sebastia, last operational in the final years of the Ottoman Empire, has also been announced. “The archeological excavations are designed to expose the antiquities of the site and make the ancient city accessible throughout all its periods: from the beginning of the settlement in the 8th century BCE during the ancient Kingdom of Israel, through the Hellenistic city, the magnificent Roman city built by King Herod [called “Sebastos” after Emperor Augustus], to the Byzantine period when a church was built at the site,” said the office of Israeli Minister of Heritage Eliyahu. Ghazzal said Sebastia’s ruins exhibit a “distinct local culture” in a geographic region which has “always been known as Palestine”. She said the remains emphasise the religious and cultural importance of the town to conquering empires, and its multifaith inhabitants’ peaceful coexistence for centuries. In the Palestinian submission to UNESCO, it is noted that the present town of Sebastia still preserves “the ancient name [and] is located on the eastern part of the Roman city, indicating a strong element of cultural continuity”. But for those focused on the planned Israeli national park, it’s only Jewish history that matters. Responding to a query from Al Jazeera, Eliyahu’s office said that Sebastia was “first and foremost a Jewish heritage site, where archaeological remains from the Kingdom of Israel period were found”. “It is important to emphasise that even if we were to dig at the site to the depth of the Earth’s core, not even a grain of historical evidence of ancient Palestinian settlement would be found at the site,” Eliyahu’s office added. Yossi Dagan, who lives in neighbouring Shavei Shomron, has long advocated for the takeover of Sebastia and emphasises its prominence in Biblical history. He told Israeli media at the archaeological site: “When you dig here, you touch the Bible with your own hands.” But Ghazzal said that the Israeli government’s treatment of the Biblical stories in the Old Testament as historical reality is designed to relegate the claims of Palestinians to have lived on the land for thousands of years, and ignores the Palestinian people’s ancient ties to their land. “You can’t base your claim to the land on religion – civilisations are about the people who develop their identity, their works and monuments – even their language,” Ghazzal said. “Israel wants to kill the stories from our past and replace them with poison; it is a crime against our history,” Ghazzal added. “When they demolish our monuments, remove families who keep the history alive, who will speak after that – and carry our story for the next generation?” Ahmad Kayed, a 59-year-old Sebastia villager and leading activist, told Al Jazeera the ruins will not be “taken without a fight”, and demonstrations are being instigated. He said Israel is “planning something big” in Sebastia and referenced new iron blockades being erected on roads encircling the town. It is already extremely unsafe for Sebastia residents to visit the archaeological park because of settler attacks and near-daily military invasions, he said. But once a military barracks is established, it will be permanently off limits. “They are working step by step to get their hands on Sebastia and keep us suffering all the time so people will leave,” Kayed said, referring to the at least 40 families that have left the town since October 7, 2023. “We are in the second Nakba and Sebastia is under siege,” he added. “But Sebastia is strong, we know how to face them because we have done it before.” He pointed out that residents rose up to thwart Israel’s plans to take Sebastia in the late 1970s, and they did so again to halt settlers pumping sewage onto agricultural land in 2013. Two years later, residents’ protests and sit-ins blocked the construction of a new access road for settlers, which Eliyahu’s office justified as necessary for the “hundreds of thousands of Israelis who will want to come, learn, and experience the Jewish heritage” of Sebastia. But Kayed admits times have changed, and violence from the military today is unlike anything he has experienced in his decades of activism. “When we decide what to do, we will be smart, and we will demonstrate in new ways, and everyone in Sebastia will follow us,” he added. He was also gravely concerned that if excavations took place, Israelis would desecrate archaeological findings that contradicted their claim to the land, with so much still to be uncovered if Palestinian-led digs were not blocked. The municipality still hopes UNESCO will provide the village protection and add the ruins to its World Heritage list. The mayor also hopes the archaeological park will join 56 other locations on UNESCO’s register of significant sites considered to be “in danger”. Businesses near the archaeological site say they have lost more than three-quarters of their custom since October 7. Samer Sha’er, owner of a coffee shop directly next to the park and Sebastia’s imposing Roman columns, said a military outpost would be devastating for businesses. “There will be daily confrontations, constant military presence, and no sense of security,” he said. “No one will want to come and sit here while the army is stationed nearby – neither shop owners nor visitors will be able to stay.” Once holy land coveted by prophets and conquering emperors, Sebastia has been reduced to a ghost town – haunted by the glory of its history, which has also made it a target for annexation by the ultranationalist Israeli government. Kayed looked visibly moved as he described his youth playing on the hills of the archaeological park, and a lifetime spent trying to save his home. He was evidently aggrieved that the town had not acted more quickly to unify against the creeping threat of the military barracks or eventual annexation. But it seems all those concerned, including the town’s mayor, are not sure what is coming next – or when. “This land means everything to me,” Kayed added. “I have spent all my childhood, all my life going to the park. “They will confiscate my land [to build the barracks]. I planted olive trees there with my mother, it is very painful to lose them, Kayed said. “The village will never give up on the ruins – this is our history, our life. We will fight until the end.”",

    "article_text": "The European Union has said it will defend its interests after United States President Donald Trump threatened to impose a50-percent tariff on all goodsfrom the 27-member bloc. The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, said in a post on X that he spoke on Friday with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on the issue. “The EU is fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” he said, adding that the EU Commission remains ready to work in good faith towards an agreement. “EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he is “recommending” a huge 50 percent duty on the EU starting on June 1 since talks with them “are going nowhere”. Speaking later in the Oval Office, the Republican president emphasised that he was not seeking a deal with the EU but might delay the tariffs if more European companies made major investments in the US. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50 percent.” European leaders warned the tariffs will hurt both sides. German economy minister Katherina Reiche said everything must be done “to ensure that the European Commission reaches a negotiated solution with the United States” while French foreign minister Laurent Saint-Martin said the bloc prefers de-escalation but is “ready to respond”. If implemented, the tariffs would mean that the EU will have higher import taxes on its hundreds of billions worth of exported goods compared with China, whichhad its tariffs cutearlier this month to allow more negotiations between Washington, DC, and Beijing. In early April, Trump announced a 20 percent tariff on most EU goods but brought it down to 10 percent until July 8 to allow time for more negotiations. Trump has complained that existing frameworks are “unfair” to US companies as the European bloc sells more goods to its ally than it buys from it. Trump on Friday also warned that the US tech giant Apple could also be hit with a 25 percent import tax on all iPhones not manufactured but sold in the US. His announcements online dealt another blow to stock markets both in the US and in the EU, with the S&P 500 down about 0.8 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 index falling about 1.2 percent.",

    "title": "Over 400 Rohingya feared drowned in two shipwrecks off Myanmar coast: UN",
    "article_text": "At least 427Rohingya, Myanmar’s Muslim minority, may have perished at sea in two shipwrecks on May 9 and 10, the United Nations said, in what would be another deadly incident for the persecuted group. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR) said in a statement on Friday that – if confirmed – the two incidents would be the “deadliest tragedy at sea” involving Rohingya refugees so far this year. “The UN refugee agency is gravely concerned about reports of two boat tragedies off the coast of Myanmar earlier this month,” UNHCR said in the statement, adding that it was still working to confirm the exact circumstances surrounding the shipwrecks. According to the agency, preliminary information indicated that a vessel carrying 267 people sank on May 9, with only 66 people surviving, and a second ship with 247 Rohingya on board capsized on May 10, with just 21 survivors. The Rohingya on board were either leaving Bangladesh’s huge Cox’s Bazar refugee camps or fleeing Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine, the statement said. Persecuted in Myanmar for decades, thousands of Rohingya risk their lives every year to flee repression and civil war in their country, often going to sea on board makeshift boats. In a post on X, UNHCR High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said news of the double tragedy was “a reminder of the desperate situation” of the Rohingya “and of the hardship faced by refugees in Bangladesh as humanitarian aid dwindles”. In 2017, more than a million Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine State following a brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s military. At least 180,000 of those who fled are now facing deportation back to Myanmar while those who stayed behind in Rakhine have endured dire conditions confined to refugee camps. In 2021,the military launched a coup in Myanmar, ousting the elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Since then, Rakhine has been the scene of fierce fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, an ethnic minority rebel group, for control of the state amid a widening civil war in the country. “The dire humanitarian situation, exacerbated by funding cuts, is having a devastating impact on the lives of Rohingya, with more and more resorting to dangerous journeys to seek safety, protection and a dignified life for themselves and their families,” said Hai Kyung Jun, who leads UNHCR’s regional bureau for Asia and the Pacific. In 2024, some 657 Rohingya died in the region’s waters, according to UNHCR. Humanitarian organisations have been hit hard byfunding cutsfrom major donors, led by the United States administration of President Donald Trump and other Western countries, as they prioritise defence spending prompted by growing fears of Russia and China. UNHCR is seeking financial support to stabilise the lives of Rohingya refugees in host countries, including Bangladesh, and those displaced inside Myanmar. Its request for $383m for support in 2025 is currently only 30 percent funded, the agency said.",

    "title": "‘Need answers’: Will Sri Lanka’s Tamils find war closure under Dissanayake?",
    "article_text": "Mullivaikkal, Sri Lanka –On a beach in northeastern Sri Lanka, Krishnan Anjan Jeevarani laid out some of her family’s favourite food items on a banana leaf. She placed a samosa, lollipops and a large bottle of Pepsi next to flowers and incense sticks in front of a framed photo. Jeevarani was one of thousands of Tamils who gathered on May 18 to mark 16 years since the end of Sri Lanka’s brutal civil war in Mullivaikkal, the site of the final battle between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist group that fought for a Tamil homeland. As on previous anniversaries, Tamils this year lit candles in remembrance of their loved ones and held a moment of silence. Dressed in black, people paid their respects before a memorial fire and ate kanji, the gruel consumed by civilians when they were trapped in Mullivaikkal amid acute food shortages. This year’s commemorations were the first to take place under the new government helmed by leftist Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected president in September and has prompted hopes of possible justice and answers for the Tamil community. The Tamil community alleges that a genocide of civilians took place during the war’s final stages, estimating that nearly 170,000 people were killed by government forces. UN estimates put the figure at 40,000. Dissanayake, the leader of the Marxist party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which itself led violent uprisings against the Sri Lankan government in the 1970s and 1980s, has emphasised “national unity” and its aim to wipe out racism. He made several promises to Tamil voters before the elections last year, including the withdrawal from military-occupied territory in Tamil heartlands and the release of political prisoners. But eight months after he was elected, those commitments are now being tested – and while it’s still early days for his administration, many in the Tamil community say what they’ve seen so far is mixed, with some progress, butalso disappointments. In March 2009, Jeevarani lost several members of her family, including her parents, her sister and three-year-old daughter when Sri Lankan forces shelled the tents in which they were sheltering, near Mullivaikkal. “We had just cooked and eaten and we were happy,” she said. “When the shell fell it was like we had woken up from a dream.” Jeevarani, now 36, buried all her family members in a bunker and left the area, her movements dictated by shelling until she reached Mullivaikkal. In May 2009, she and the surviving members of her family entered army-controlled territory. Now, 16 years later, as she and other Sri Lankan Tamils commemorated their lost family members, most said their memorials had gone largely unobstructed, although there were reports of police disrupting one event in the eastern part of the country. This was a contrast fromprevious yearsof state crackdowns on such commemorative events. “There isn’t that climate of fear which existed during the two Rajapaksa regimes,” said Ambika Satkunanathan, a human rights lawyer and former commissioner of the National Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, referring to former presidents Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brothers who between them ruled Sri Lanka for 13 out of 17 years between 2005 and 2022. It was under Mahinda Rajapaksa that the Sri Lankan army carried out the final, bloody assaults that ended the war in 2009, amid allegations of human rights abuses. “But has anything changed substantively [under Dissanayake]? Not yet,” said Satkunanathan. Satkunanathan cited the government’s continued use of Sri Lanka’s controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and a gazette issued on March 28 to seize land in Mullivaikkal as problematic examples of manifesto promises being overturned in an evident lack of transparency. Despite his pre-election promises, Dissnayake’s government earlier this month denounced Tamil claims of genocide as “a false narrative”. On May 19, one day after the Tamil commemorations, Dissanayake also attended a “War Heroes” celebration of the Sri Lankan armed forces as the chief guest, while the Ministry of Defence announced the promotion of a number of military and navy personnel. In his speech, Dissanayake stated that “grief knows no ethnicity”, suggesting a reconciliatory stance, while also paying tribute to the “fallen heroes” of the army who “we forever honour in our hearts.” Kathiravelu Sooriyakumari, a 60-year-old retired principal, said casualties in Mullivaikkal in 2009 were so extreme that “we even had to walk over dead bodies.” She said government forces had used white phosphorus during the civil war, a claim Sri Lankan authorities have repeatedly denied. Although not explicitly banned, many legal scholars interpret international law as prohibiting the use of white phosphorus – anincendiary chemicalthat can burn the skin down to the bone – in densely populated areas. Sooriyakumari’s husband, Rasenthiram, died during an attack near Mullivaikkal while trying to protect others. “He was sending everyone to the bunker. When he had sent everyone and was about to come himself, a shell hit a tree and then bounced off and hit him, and he died,” she said. Although his internal organs were coming out, “he raised his head and looked around at all of us, to see we were safe.” Her son was just seven months old. “He has never seen his father’s face,” she said. The war left many households like Sooriyakumari’s without breadwinners. They have experienced even more acute food shortage following Sri Lanka’s 2022economic crisisand the subsequent rise in the cost of living. “If we starve, will anyone come and check on us?” said 63-year-old Manoharan Kalimuthu, whose son died in Mullivaikkal after leaving a bunker to relieve himself and being hit by a shell. “If they [children who died in the final stages of the war] were here, they would’ve looked after us.” Kalimuthu said she did not think the new government would deliver justice to Tamils, saying, “We can believe it only when we see it.” Sooriyakumari also said she did not believe anything would change under the new administration. “There’s been a lot of talk but no action. No foundations have been laid, so how can we believe them?” she told Al Jazeera. “So many Sinhalese people these days have understood our pain and suffering and are supporting us … but the government is against us.” She also expressed suspicion of Dissanayake’s JVP party and its history of violence, saying she and the wider Tamil community “were scared of the JVP before”. The party had backed Rajapaksa’s government when the army crushed the Tamil separatist movement. Satkunanathan said the JVP’s track record showed “they supported the Rajapaksas, they were pro-war, they were anti-devolution, anti-international community, were all anti-UN, all of which they viewed as conspiring against Sri Lanka.” She conceded that the party was seeking to show that it had “evolved to a more progressive position but their action is falling short of rhetoric”. Although Dissanayake’s government has announced plans to establish a truth and reconciliation commission, it has rejected a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution on accountability for war crimes, much like previous governments. Before the presidential elections, Dissanayake said he would not seek to prosecute those responsible for war crimes. “On accountability for wartime violations, they have not moved at all,” Satkunanathan told Al Jazeera, citing the government’s refusal to engage with the UN-initiated Sri Lanka Accountability Project (SLAP), which was set up to collect evidence of potential war crimes. “I would love them to prove me wrong.” The government has also repeatedly changed its stance on the Thirteenth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which promises devolved powers to Tamil-majority areas in the north and east. Before the presidential election, Dissanayake said he supported its implementation in meetings with Tamil parties, but the government has not outlined a clear plan for this, with the JVP’s general secretary dismissing it as unnecessary shortly after the presidential election. “Six months since coming into office, there’s no indication of the new government’s plan or intention to address the most urgent grievances of the Tamils affected by the war,” Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, South Asia researcher at Amnesty International, said. “And the truth about the forcibly disappeared features high on the agenda of those in the North and the East.” Still, some, like 48-year-old Krishnapillai Sothilakshmi, remain hopeful. Sothilakshmi’s husband Senthivel was forcibly disappeared in 2008. She said she believed the new government would give her answers. A 2017 report by Amnesty International [PDF] estimated that between 60,000 and 100,000 people have disappeared in Sri Lanka since the late 1980s. Although Sri Lanka established an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) in 2017, there has been no clear progress since. “We need answers. Are they alive or not? We want to know,” Sothilakshmi said. But for Jeevarani, weeping on the beach as she looked at a photograph of her three-year-old daughter Nila, it’s too late for any hope. Palm trees are growing over her family’s grave, and she is no longer even able to pinpoint the exact spot where they were buried. “If someone is sick, this government or that government can say they’ll cure them,” she said. “But no government can bring back the dead, can they?”",

The Switch 2 displays a message that says a mouse has been connected, and he continues to play with both a mouse and his left Joy-Con 2, switching between them seamlessly, the same way you’ll be able to go back and forth between gyro and mouse controlinMetroid Prime 4: Beyond. AsVideoGamesChroniclenotes, the original Switch had mouse and keyboard support, though only some games took advantage, like theNightdive-developedTurokport. (If you own that game and never noticed the “Mouse” option in its input settings, go plug in a USB mouse and keyboard and try it out — you won’t want to go back.) This time around, Nintendo is embracing mouse support more. For instance, the company published a video to its Nintendo Today app earlier this month, showing that when you put a Joy-Con 2 on its edge for mouse mode, an onscreen pointer appears for navigating the system’s menu. So does theNobunaga’s Ambitionvideo, mean a standard mouse works interchangeably with a Joy-Con 2 controller anywhere where mouse control is supported? I sure hope so, but we don’t know that yet. And Nintendo didn’t immediately respond toThe Verge’s email asking if that was the case.

If you’ve been holding off on an upgrade, maybe it’s finally time. byWes Davis It’s finally time to upgrade for many owners of the earliest Amazon Fire TV devices, as Netflix is ending support for them next month,reports German outletHeise. The cutoff for US users is June 3rd,according toZDNet, which writes that the company has been emailing those who would be affected by the change. Netflix is specifically ending support for the 1st-generation Fire TV streaming box and Fire TV Stick, as well as the 2016 Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote,ZDNetwrites. If you didn’t get the email but want to be certain whether your Fire TV device is one of those reportedly losing Netflix, the outlet writes that you can check the “About” section under Settings > My Fire TV. According toHeise, Amazon is offering discounts on new Fire TV Sticks to those affected by the change. Amazon didn’t immediately respond whenThe Vergereached out to ask whether that’s true for US users, as well. In a FAQ added to aNetflix help pagesometime in the last couple of months (March 15th is when itfirst showed upon The Internet Archive), the company says it may end support for devices that “can no longer get necessary updates from its manufacturer or support new features.” The company also added new references to error codes R4, R12, and R25-1.

After reports of unresponsive trackers, some users say Whoop is preemptively replacing even working MGs. byWes Davis Users of Whoop’s fitness trackers have been reporting that their Whoop MG fitness trackers are turning unresponsive, in some cases within under an hour of setting them up. Now, the company is apparently replacing the trackers, in some cases before the users even ask,TechIssuesTodayreports. Launched alongside the Whoop 5.0 earlier this month, the Whoop MG (which stands for “Medical Grade”) comes with EKG capabilities and blood pressure insights and requires a premium Whoop Life subscription that’s $359 per year. Users started reporting issues with the tracker almost immediately. On May 11th, auser reportedin the Whoop community forum that their MG “stopped working overnight after working for 8 hours. No green light, no bluelight nothing. It won’t now pair with the app.” Others replied to say the tracker failed even sooner for them, with one person reporting that it went inert afterjust half an hour of use. Some also report that their 5.0 has failed. Whooprecommends a few troubleshooting steps— the usual things like making sure your device is charged or trying to reset it — but users in the community thread say it didn’t work. The company appears to be trying to rectify the situation by sending out replacement units, sometimes without users even asking for one, as the Reddit user who posted the screenshot abovewrote further down in the thread. The same goes for a user whoposted two days agoto say they got the same notification despite having not noticed any problems with their MG.Some in that thread even writethat the company replaced their MGs withoutever telling themit would be doing so. It’s already been a troubled launch for Whoop. Earlier this month, someusers were outragedwhen Whoop said they would need to add another 12 months onto their memberships to avoid the upgrade fee for the Whoop 5.0. Previously, users only needed to have 6 months left on their subscription to get a Whoop 4.0. The company soon walked its new terms back,posting on Redditthat those who had at least 12 months left would be eligible for an upgrade.

Memorial Day marks the unofficial start of summer, and if you somehow managed to skip your spring cleaning earlier this year, the turning of the season offers a fresh chance to declutter your space. Thankfully, theTwelve South HiRise 3 Deluxeoffers a stylish way to organize your desk or bedside table, and it’s currently available for a new low of $79.99 ($20 off) fromAmazonandTwelve South. Twelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch. The charger includes a power supply (with travel adapters) to deliver enough juice over its five-foot / 1.5m USB cable. Twelve South’s sturdy HiRise 3 Deluxe is a great 3-in-1 charging stand for a number of reasons. Not only can it deliver up to 15W of power to MagSafe-compatible iPhones, but it’s also capable of fast-charging an Apple Watch Series 7 and newer models. It includes a 7.5W wireless charging pad as well, which you can use to top off a pair of AirPods or any other Qi-compatible device you might have on hand, including a second phone, a Samsung Galaxy Watch, or other electronics. What truly sets it apart from a lot of other 3-in-1 chargers, though, is its design; instead of placing the charging pads side-by-side, Twelve South has arranged them in a front-to-back layout to reduce desk clutter. Plus, thanks to the charger’s support forStandBy mode— an ultra-handy feature Apple first introduced in iOS 17 — you can also use your phone as a mini smart display when you place it horizontally on the adjustable charging pad, allowing you to quickly check the time, view your daily schedule, and take advantage of useful widgets with ease.

    "title": "Last Defense Academy makes confusion part of the fun",
    "article_text": "Despite similar art styles and narrative elements, this ain’t ya mama’s Danganronpa. byAsh Parrish Despite similar art styles and narrative elements, this ain’t ya mama’s Danganronpa. byAsh Parrish The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academystarts off by asking a simple question: what happens when you pluck a handful of colorful teenagers from their homes, plop them in a state-of-the-art school filled with every convenience, then force them to fight for their lives? Your guide as you navigate this question is an unsettling and creepy-cute mascot that knows more than it’s let on, and there’s an overarching mystery to the world that you can’t quite put your finger on. If you, like I, answered “Danganronpa!” — as this premise sounds very much like the plot of the quirky and irreverent murder-mystery series from Spike Chunsoft — then congratulations! We’re both totally wrong! And after 45 in-game days withLDA,I still have no idea what’s going on, and I love it. I’m going to be gentle with myself and you for thinkingLDAis another entry in the genre of high school-themed killing games. After all, it was developed by Kazutaka Kodaka, creator and writer of theDanganronpafranchise, in collaboration with Kotaro Uchikoshi, known for his work on the adventure-puzzle game seriesZero Escape. And thoughLDAoozes with the DNA from both series, it stands so completely apart mechanically and narratively that while I can get a grasp on the former, I’m lost with the latter. The premise is simple enough. You play as Takumi Sumino, who gets whisked away to the Last Defense Academy, where he and a group of others use their newly awakened powers to defend the school from monster attacks for 100 days. Should they fail, the invaders will destroy the school and thereby… because of plot… all of humanity. Usually past a certain point, I can figure out a game’s core gameplay loop and rough narrative thrust. When the first body dropped inDanganronpa, I immediately understood that I’d be spending the rest of the game solving my classmates’ murders. But I haven’t been able to figure outLDA. LDAfills the gaping holeFire Emblem Engagecreated and theAdvance Warsremakescould not fix I understand the gameplay loop easily enough: it’s a tactical RPG with visual novel-like relationship-building elements. Combat takes place on a gridded battlefield with each combatant able to attack in a different configuration, similar to chess. One of Takumi’s abilities attacks enemies in a straight line. My ally, Gaku, attacks in a rectangular pattern. Each of my allies’ attacks contributes to a voltage meter that allows us to use our special abilities when full. And if one of my allies should fall, they’ll be revived before the next wave of enemies. I like how the tactical combat isn’t likeFire EmblemorTriangle Strategy.LDAis unique, as you’re not trying to manage the complex rock-paper-scissors formula of what weapons are strong or weak against each other. Instead, life is the engine that drives combat. Actions you take are determined by how many action points, or AP, you have, and killing certain enemies grants you more AP. On the flip side, allies who are near death can unleash big special attacks that can clear entire battlefields at the cost of losing them for the rest of the wave. Combat then becomes a function of playing with life totals — my enemies and mine. I’ll arrange my attacks in such a way that every time I act, I kill an enemy and gain more AP so I can just keep going, denying my enemies the chance to fight back. Then, when I’m out of AP, I can unleash a killing blow that ends the round. My allies get revived the next round, and I can start the process all over again. I’ve been left so unsatisfied by the crop of tactical RPGs lately, andLDAfills the gaping holeFire Emblem Engagecreated and theAdvance Warsremakescould not fix. But while I’ve got a handle on the combat, I still haven’t the faintest clue of the story it’s trying to tell. My confusion is so thorough that as I go through each new day, my experiences start sounding like wartime letters from the front lines. It’s day 33. Our self-proclaimed leader, Hiruko, is still missing. We’re starting to suspect she’ll never return. Meanwhile, the enemy keeps hurling themselves at our defenses. So far, we’ve been able to hold them off. Gaku recently developed his power, revealing himself to be a peerless ranged fighter. But our forces are nowhere near full strength, since Ima, Kako, and Shouma refuse to fight. And alas! Our foodstores have burnt up and I fear we’ll starve soon. War is grim, but I fight knowing the closer I get to the 100th day is a day I am closer to returning home… or so I hope. LDA’s narrative is so unlike anything I’ve ever experienced that not knowing what’s happening next is part of the fun. I like getting dragged along for the ride, discovering new developments alongside the characters, who are themselves a delight.As other outlets have pointed out, Darumi Amemiya is the physical manifestation of the irony-poisoned and terminally online dirtbag edgel(ady), and I adore her even if her characterization gets uncomfortably familiar sometimes. I also really enjoy how the characters are over-the-top caricatures themselves — Darumi’s the creepy murder-obsessed emo girl, Takemaru’s the typical fighting-obsessed delinquent — but make decisions like normal people. I often struggle to get into “transported to another world” stories because none of the decisions made in them have ever made sense to me, a woman who can’t turn off her overly logical and reason-obsessed brain in order to just go with the flow. So it’s incredibly refreshing to see these characters push back on the circumstances they’ve been dropped in. Instead of just accepting that they’ve been taken from everything they’ve ever known and forced to fightand die(even if that death is temporary), some of my allies maintain a healthy level of skepticism, question everything, and refuse to fight. I know I would! And even better, other characters in the game understand and acknowledge that as a reasonable position. There’s no rah-rah speech of “You must fight!” that convinces them to take up arms. The reluctant characters are given the space to come around on their own time and for their own reasons. That may sound boring. After all, in an isekai-like narrative, the characters are usually forced to get on board quickly otherwise there wouldn’t be a plot. So seeing a game take its time with the reluctant characters, letting them work through their hangups in a natural and unforced way, was pleasing to my brain. In the almost 50 days I’ve spent withLDA, I do have some working theories as to where the overall story will go. How it gets there, though, I have no clue, but I’m excited to see what twists the game will take along the way. The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academyis out now on Switch and PC.

    "title": "Google’s Veo 3 AI video generator is a slop monger’s dream",
    "article_text": "Cursed AI-generated videos come with very convincing audio now. Cursed AI-generated videos come with very convincing audio now. byAllison Johnson Even at first glance, there’s something off about the body on the street. The white sheet it’s under is a little too clean, and the officers’ movements are totally devoid of purpose. “We need to clear the street,” one of them says with a firm hand gesture, though her lips don’t move. It’s AI, alright. But here’s the kicker: my prompt didn’t include any dialogue. Veo 3, Google’s new AI video generation model, added that line all on its own. Over the past 24 hours I’ve created a dozen clips depicting news reports, disasters, and goofy cartoon cats with convincing audio — some of which the model invented all on its own. It’s more than a little creepy and way more sophisticated than I had imagined. And while I don’t think it’s going to propel us to a misinformation doomsday just yet, Veo 3 strikes me as an absolute AI slop machine. Googleintroduced Veo 3at I/O this week, highlighting its most important new capability: generating sound to go with your AI video. “We’re entering a new era of creation,” Google’s VP of Gemini, Josh Woodward, explained in the keynote, calling it “incredibly realistic.” I wasn’t completely sold, but then, a few days later, I had Veo 3 generate a video of a news anchor announcing a fire at the Space Needle. All it took was a basic text prompt, a few minutes, and an expensive subscription toGoogle’s AI Ultra plan. And you know what? Woodward wasn’t exaggerating. It’s realistic as hell. I tried the news anchor prompt after seeing what Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic, was able to produce.One of her clipsfeatures a news anchor announcing the death of US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. He is not dead, but the clip is incredibly convincing. A post including a string of videos withAI-generated characters protesting the prompts used to create themhas 50,000 upvotes on Reddit. The scenes include disasters, a woman in a hospital bed using a breathing tube, and a character being threatened at gunpoint — all with spoken dialogue and realistic background sounds. Real lighthearted stuff! Maybe I’m being naive, but after playing around with Veo 3 I’m notquiteas concerned as I was at first. For starters, the obvious guardrails are in place. You can’t prompt it to create a video of Biden tripping and falling. You can’t have a news anchor announce the assassination of the president, or even generate a video of a T-shirt-and-chain-wearing tech company CEO laughing while dollar bills rain down around him. That’s a start. That said, you can generate some troubling shit. Without any clever workarounds I prompted Veo 3 to create a video of the Space Needle on fire. Starting with my own photo of Mount Rainier, I generated a video of it erupting with smoke and lava. Coupled with a clip of a news anchor announcing said disaster, I can see how you could seed some mischief real easily with this tool. Here’s the better news: it doesn’t seem like a ready-made deepfake machine. I gave it a couple of photos of myself and asked it to generate a video with specific dialogue and it wouldn’t comply. I also asked it to bring a pair of giant boots in a photo to life and have them walk out of the scene; it managed one boot stomping across the sidewalk with some comical crunching noises in the background. I had an easier time generating videos when my prompts were less specific, which is how I confirmed somethingmy colleague Andrew Marino pointed out: Veo 3 is excellent at creating the kind of lowest-common-denominator YouTube content aimed at kids. If you’ve never been subjected to the endless pit of garbage on YouTube Kids, let me enlighten you. Imagine watching the worst 3D rendering of a monster truck driving down a ramp, landing in a vat of colored paint. Next to it, another monster truck drives down another ramp into another vat of paint — this time, a different color. Now watch that again. And again. And again. There are hours of this stuff on YouTube designed to mesmerize toddlers. These videos are usually harmless, just empty calories designed to rack up views that make Cocomelon look likeCitizen Kane. In about 10 minutes with Veo 3, I threw together a clip following the same basic formula — complete with jaunty background music. But the clip that’s even more troubling to me is the two cartoon cats on a pier. I thought it would be funny to have the cats complain to each other that the fish aren’t biting. In just a couple of minutes, I had a clip complete with two cats and some AI-generated dialogue that I never wrote. If it’s this easy to make a 10-second clip, stretching it out to a seven-minute YouTube video would be trivial. In its current form, clips revert to Veo 2 when you try to extend them into longer scenes, which removes the audio. But the way that Google has been pushing these tools forward relentlessly, I can’t imagine it’ll be long before you can edit a full feature-length video with Veo 3. Honestly, I wonder if this sort of use for AI-generated video is a feature and not a bug. Google showed us some fancy AI-generated video from real filmmakers,including Eliza McNitt, who is working with Darren Aronofsky on a new film with some AI-generated elements. And sure, AI video could be an interesting tool in the right hands. But I think what we’re most likely to see is a proliferation of the kind ofbland imagery that AI is so good at generating— this time, in stereo.

    "article_text": "A luxurious battery-powered shower for you, the dog, and those dirty dishes. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byThomas Ricker If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Hot water is like internet connectivity for mostVergereaders: you just expect it to be there. But that’s unlikely to be the case this summer when tent camping at a music festival or road-tripping into the great unknown. That’s where BougeRV’s battery-powered shower comes in. The$310 “Portable Propane Outdoor Camping Water Heater” from BougeRVis not only optimized for search engine discovery, it also delivers a luxurious spray of hot steaming water to the unwashed, be they human, canine, or stubborn pots and pans. Charge up the battery, attach a propane canister, drop the pump into a jug of water, and you’re ready to get sudsing. It’s so useful and flexible that I’ve ditched my plans to install a permanent shower cabin and expensive hot water system inside my adventure van, even if I don’t completely trust it. 8 Verge Score Battery-powered portabilityTemperature controlAdjustable flow to save waterLots of safety features Lots of hoses and cables to snagWeak shower head holderNo bag to carry all the accessoriesLongevity concerns My current portable showerconsists of an 11-liter water bag, a manual foot pump, and a spray nozzle. To make it hot, I have to heat water on the stove or hang the bag in the sun for several hours, yet it still costs over $150. For $310, the BougeRV heated shower seems like a bargain. The BougeRV system can produce a maximum heat output of 20,500 BTUs — about half of a typical residential gas water heater. It measures 15.75 x 6.7 x 14.57 inches (40 x 17 x 31cm) and weighs 13.2 pounds (6.21kg), making it compact and fairly lightweight with two big handles for easy carry. The hoses and cabling make it a little unwieldy — capable of chaos inside a small space unless handled with care. Assembly starts with screwing in an easy to find one pound (454g) propane canister that attaches at the rear of the unit. That’s the size BougeRV recommends, but you wouldn’t be the first to instead run a hose from your RV’s existing propane tank to the pressure regulator on the water heater. Two quick-connect water hoses — labeled blue and red for idiot-proof attachment — route the water from your chosen receptacle, through that gas furnace, and out through the showerhead. The long 2.5m (8.2 feet) shower hose allows for flexible placement of the heater. The small water pump measures just 2.24 inches (5.7cm) across, so it easily fits through the opening of standard jerry cans. The pump is electrically powered by the BougeRV unit, which is powered by its rechargeable battery, an AC wall jack, or 12V adapter that plugs into the cigarette jack of your vehicle orsolargenerator. The 2500mAh / 12V (30Wh) integrated Lithium-ion battery takes about three hours to charge from the included charger. A full battery and one-pound (454g) canister of liquid propane gas can pump out about an hour’s worth of hot water before both run dry. The shower’s gas consumption rate is 20MJ/h. Alternatively, you can save gas with a long press on the pump button to put the shower into cold water mode — ideal for rinsing off your mountain bike, hiking shoes, or wet suit, for example. The dial on the front of the heater controls the size of the flame. I did a handful of tests, starting with water measuring between 13 and 16 degrees Celsius (55–61 degrees Fahrenheit) according to the display on the BougeRV water heater. With the dial turned all the way to the left, the water pouring from the shower head rose to 23–25C (73–77F) after just a few seconds. Turned all the way to the right, the temperature maxed out at a steamy 34–41C (93–105F) in about 30 seconds. Recycling the water can make it even hotter, if you dare Recycling the water can make it even hotter, if you dare. After two or three cycles on max, the heater boosted the temperature above 51C (124F) before the unit shut down with an error, by design. It’s not meant to exceed an average water temperature above 50C (122F). A simple on/off reset the E6 error. Water flow is between 2.2 and 3 liters per minute — well below what you can expect from a 9 to 12 L/min flow of a modern home shower. That’s still acceptable, in my opinion, and far superior tonothing,which is the typical alternative when camping away from home. The shower head has a rocker switch to toggle between hardish, mixed, and soft water flow rates as well as an on/off limiter button to help conserve water between lathers. It’s surprisingly quiet even with the pump turned on. There’s some rapid clicking to ignite the gas (followed by awhooshof flame) whenever the flow of water returns, and the pump produces a low-level hum that’s quickly drowned out by the sound of spraying water. The water heater is also protected from tilts, bumps, and an empty water source. When I leaned my review unit over about 30 degrees, the unit shut off. It also shut off automatically after two minutes of trying to pump from an empty bucket. A master override on/off switch on the button prevents the unit from turning on accidentally if the on/off button on the front is bumped during transport or storage. I’m impressed by BougeRV’s water heater, but I’m a little concerned about its durability over time. After using it on the beach on a windy day, I ran into trouble once I returned inside: the heater didn’t heat and the water was reduced to a trickle out of the showerhead. It’s possible that some sediment trapped in the lines reduced the flow rate below the 1.2L/min required for ignition. Nevertheless, the issue was resolved after a few minutes of fiddling with the hoses and filters, and turning the unit on and off again. BougeRV offers a two-year warranty and says the water heater is rated at IPX4. So while it’s resistant to splashing water, there’s no assurance offered against dust and blowing sand. I do have a few other gripes. Those hoses can be a tripping and snagging hazard, and the plastic clip meant to hold the showerhead to one of the lifting handles is too weak to keep it from rotating and spraying your surroundings. I also wish BougeRV bundled the heater with an accessory bag to carry all the power adapters and hoses. And when putting the device away, you have to tip it forward to drain all the collected water from the inlet and outlet — there’s no automatic expulsion mechanism. But really, these are trivial issues for what the unit does at this price. Prior to this review, I had been in the late planning stages of having a shower cabin, water pump, gas heater, extra-large water tank, and all necessary plumbing installed in my Sprinter van. Total cost: about $4,000. I’m now convinced that a portable system like what BougeRV offers is a better option. Why pay so much for something so permanent that’s only used a few minutes each week, for maybe half the year? Instead, BougeRV’s $310 portable water heater can function as an outdoor shower during the summer months or be moved inside (with ventilation) when coupled with aportable shower curtainand basin, all for less than $600. That sounds like a better use of my money, and probably yours if you’re an aspiring vanlifer. And when the van is parked, I can bring those hot (or cold) jets of water anywhere my adventures might take me: to clean up after mountain biking in the muddy forest or kitesurfing in the salty sea, to wash the dogoutsideafter rolling in shit again, or to take a refreshing shower during a sweaty four-day music festival. A near-identical water heater is sold under theRanienandCampluxbrands, but those have larger 4000mAh (48Wh) batteries and list for between $349 and $399. So it might pay to shop around.

We’ve assembled a collection of 30-odd gifts to help your grad celebrate and gear up for what comes next. bySheena VasaniandBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Graduation is one of those unique milestones in life that’s both exciting and nerve-wracking. It’s worth celebrating, but it also marks a new chapter that can feel overwhelming. That’s why your grad will surely appreciate a little support as they step into the next phase of their life, whether that be college or their first job. Lucky for you, we’ve put together a list of gifts that are designed to make the transition into post-grad life a little smoother. Our picks cover essentials they might need for their first apartment or dorm — fromkitchenwaretotools— along with a few gifts toremindthemof home. We’ve also sprinkled in a ton of gadgets to set them up for success, includinge-readersandportable chargers. And because they’ve certainly earned some downtime, we’ve included a selection of other ideas to help them unwind and celebrate a job well done. A proper collection deserves a proper showcase, which is where Nanoleaf’s smart LED cases come in. Each reactive, stackable box can display tunable white lighting and up to 16 million hues, allowing you to bathe your shoes, figurines, and other items in whatever colors you see fit. And because it’s Nanoleaf, you’ll even be able to access the same smart features as the company’s bulbs. Who needs a Ruggable or a pricey Tibetan rug when you can get one emblazoned with Sora, Sonic, or a dual-wielding Master Chief? RugsRat’s circular rugs are soft, durable, and pay homage to video game series new and old. That includes classics likeHalo 2andGrand Theft Auto: Vice City, as well as newer releases such asElden RingandCyberpunk 2077. Hell, you can even design your own. Whether they’re outfitting their dorm room or an apartment, Ikea’s Skådis Pegboard Combination offers grads a sleek, space-saving way to stay organized. The spacious board comes with a set of containers, hooks, clips, and a shelf, all of which are perfect for neatly displaying everything from keys and sticky notes to cables, pens, and other accessories. Now that the school year is officially over, your giftee likely has a lot more time to binge. For that, we recommend the Google TV Streamer 4K, which boasts onboard Google Assistant, easy-to-use smart home controls, and the best interface of any streaming device available. The set-top box even features a handy button for pinging the remote, giving it an edge over your couch. With its spacious 11-inch display, Apple’s latest iPad makes it easy to dive into studying or unwind with your favorite TV shows. It delivers snappy performance courtesy of Apple’s A16 chip, letting you off emails, take notes, or binge-watch to your heart’s content. Plus, it has a solid front-facing camera this time, ensuring you can video call and stay in touch with loved ones back home with ease. Portable and powerful, the latest Beats Pill offers good sound and IP67 dust and water resistance, making it ideal for beach days or study sessions. It’s also packed with features geared toward grads on the go, including a speakerphone for hands-free calls and a USB-C port for charging other devices. It even supports Find My / Find My Device support on both iOS and Android, so they won’t have to worry about losing it. If they’re feeling homesick, the 6-inch Looking Glass Go can bring photos of family and friends to life like no ordinary picture frame can. Just upload an image from any iOS or Android device, and the app will transform it into a high-resolution hologram with the help of AI. You can even share your 3D pictures with loved ones, making it a meaningful way to stay connected from afar. A personalized hometown puzzle is the kind of gift that hits the sweet spot in terms of nostalgia. The 400-piece jigsaw puzzles encapsulate a 6 x 4-mile coverage area with a given address at the center, and because they’re based on USGS mapping, each shows roads, waterways, vegetation, transit, and other geographical tidbits your giftee should be all too familiar with. Whether you intend to use it for work trips or weekend getaways with friends, the Carry-On is a sleek, durable suitcase that makes travel easier. It’s packed with thoughtful touches — including a TSA-approved lock, 360-degree wheels, and a separate laundry bag — and it’s small enough to fit in most overhead bins yet spacious enough that you should have no trouble stowing everything you need for a three-day jaunt. A cluttered desk can make it hard to concentrate, which is why Anker’s 7-in-1 charging station is a great gift for grads. The 100W hub features a pair of USB-C and USB-A ports on the front and three AC outlets on the back, making it easy to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro, table lamp, phone, and other gadgets while keeping a tidy workspace. Hoto’s electric screwdrivers are a mainstay atThe Verge, and the company’s Hand Tool Set is just as eye-catching. All of the included components, from the needlenose pliers and claw hammer to the textured carrying case, showcase a handsome minimalist design that’s far more attractive than the usual white-label fare. It makes for an attractive starter kit, if nothing else. Classic team-based games like Codenames offer a good opportunity to break the ice with new schoolmates, whether you’re living with them or just linking up on the quad. The collaborative game charges two so-called “spymasters” with connecting a series of seemingly unrelated cards via a one-word clue, which their teammates must then uncover before the opposing team. It’s simple to learn but tough to master. Many high school grads don’t have the budget for a new laptop, which is why gifting them one of the best is something they’ll appreciate. Apple’s M4 MacBook Air deftly balances performance and battery life, culminating in a 13-inch machine that’s as suitable for streaming as it is banging out that first-year composition paper. Cuisinart’s cordless, 1,500W electric kettle lets you dial in the right temperature for whatever you’re drinking, be it coffee, a nice oolong, or a dorm room staple like instant ramen (no judgment here). The speedy stainless-steel kettle is loaded with six preset temps and an auto-shutoff timer, too, rendering it ideal for busy grads who always have to jet. The Last Lecturecaptures the moving wisdom that Randy Pausch, a professor and former computer scientist, shared with his students following his cancer diagnosis cancer in ’06. His inspiring words encourage readers to reflect on what truly matters and the kind of legacy they hope to leave behind, making it a thoughtful guide for any graduate trying to figure out their next steps in life. The Anker Laptop Power Bank is a lifesaver for anyone who works or studies on the go. With an impressive 25,000mAh capacity and 165W total output, it can quickly charge a beefy MacBook Pro to 50 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. Plus, with three USB-C ports and a USB-A port, you can power multiple devices at once, including phones, tablets, and handheld consoles. Whether they’re planning to take a well-earned vacation or just prone to losing things, an AirTag is a smart, stress-saving gift for any grad. The UWB Bluetooth trackers tap into Apple’s vast Find My network, letting you keep an eye out and quickly recover lost luggage, keys, passports, and other items using little more than a quick glance at your iPhone. Pantone’s vibrant, color-coded ceramic bowls provide a simple way to brighten up any kitchen cabinet… or bowl of Cap’n Crunch. The six sturdy, 5.75-inch bowls are also dishwasher-safe, making them suitable for everything from soup to messy study snacks. The Kalita Wave 185 Dripper might be the only thing that gets your college-bound grad through linguistics or ochem. It brews a rich, full cup of pour-over coffee using wave filters and a flat-bottom, three-hold design, which makes it the perfect companion for pulling all-nighters when the nearest cafe is closed. The Kobo Elipsa 2E isn’t just an e-reader — it’s the ideal study companion for grads heading to college or grad school. Its sizable 10.3-inch screen and included stylus makes annotating a breeze, while its ability to convert handwritten notes into typed text and solve math equations renders it an even more valuable tool for studying. The Switch 2 could make for a stellar gift for any grad — that is, if you can manage to preorder one ahead of the console’s arrival on June 5th. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor but welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula. If you want to gift your grad a less traditional bouquet, Lovepop’s latest Black-Eyed Susan Bouquet could be a great alternative. The vibrant laser-cut flowers can add a pop of color to any new space and come packaged with a tuck-away card, which you can either fill out at home or personalize at checkout. The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are basically a pair of Bose earbuds in disguise, which isn’t a bad thing. They offer well-balanced sound, great features, and a comfortable fit that effectively blocks out unwanted noise, much more so than previous Skullcandy offerings. I guess that’s what you get when you license technology and audio tuning from Bose. Everyone could use a good pan to cook their meals. With a Lodge skillet, your graduate can sear, sauté, bake, broil, braise, and fry all kinds of foods for years to come. Not only does the hardy 12-inch pan offer terrific heat distribution and retention, but it’s also safe to use in the oven or over an open fire. The included silicone handle is just an added plus that lets you ditch the oven mitts. Cotopaxi’s Nido Accessory Bag pairs wonderfully with work trips, road trips, and trips to a shared bathroom (hello, dorm life). The durable Dopp kit is great for holding both toiletries and tech accessories thanks to its zippered pocket and a bevy of small storage compartments, all of which let you store your essentials neatly in place. Circa’s leather notebook offers a level of customization few journals can match. Given the pages are secured via a series of discs along the spine, your grad can easily add or remove sheets and organize sections in a way that fits their unique lifestyle and needs. That means they can reorient their thoughts for class, their next job interview, and a variety of other situations. F*cking Planner Stickers can provide any grad who is trying to keep their life together (or at least look like they are) with a much-needed dose of humor. Bold, irreverent, and hilariously honest, they turn even the most mundane adulting tasks — from scheduling meetings to paying bills — into something a little less boring and a lot more fun. High-end robovacs with auto-empty docks and AI obstacle avoidance are great and all, but sometimes a classic handheld is all you need. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster is a great option for picking up fur, dirt, and other debris, especially since it offers a surprising amount of suction and an extra-long crevice tool for hitting those hard-to-reach areas. The Songmics Bamboo Bed Desk is great for sick days, late-night study sessions, and a formidable breakfast in bed. It’s equipped with an adjustable top and legs, along with a small side drawer for storing pens, snacks, and everything needed to stay productive — or unwind — without leaving bed. The Instax Mini 99 is the perfect instant camera for budding photogs who crave a little more control over their shots. It quickly prints credit card-sized photos and features dual shutter buttons, along with a multitude of brightness settings and color effects. It even offers a Sports Mode, allowing you to effortlessly capture shots of subjects who refuse to sit still. If they plan on celebrating graduation on the road, RTIC’s rugged cooler can keep the La Croix flowing. The cooler’s insulated, waterproof design can keep drinks and other contents cold for up to two days, while a comfortable shoulder strap and end handles help ensure it’s never too difficult to lug from one hang to the next. If your grad is about to move in with a roommate or partner, Glocusent’s LED Neck Reading Light is a particularly useful gift. With adjustable brightness and warmth settings, the wearable neck lamp can help them comfortably pore over textbooks late into the night. It’s also not insanely bright, or at least not enough that it’ll keep their roommate awake. Update, May 23rd:Adjusted pricing / availability and added several new gift suggestions, including Apple’s latest MacBook Pro 13 and Lovepop’s colorful Black-Eyed Susan Bouquet. 8 Verge Score ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Gaza doctor's 9 children killed in latest string of Israeli strikes, hospital says",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 24, 2025 / 7:38 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Nearly 80 people have been killed in the latest round of Israeli strikes inGaza– a death toll that doesn't include hospitals in the battered north that the Hamas-run Health Ministry said are now inaccessible. The dead over the past 24 hours included nine of a doctor's 10 children, horrified colleagues and the health ministry said. Alaa Najjar, a pediatrician at Nasser Hospital, was on duty at the time and ran home to find her family's house on fire, Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital's pediatric department, told The Associated Press. Najjar's husband was severely wounded and their only surviving child, an 11-year-old son, was in critical condition after Friday's strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, Farra said. The dead children ranged in age from seven months to 12 years old. Khalil Al-Dokran, a spokesperson for Gaza's Health Ministry, told the AP that two of the children remained under the rubble. Israel's military said in a statement that it struck suspects operating from a structure next to its forces and described the area of Khan Younis as a \"dangerous war zone.\" It said it had evacuated civilians from the area, and \"the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.\" Earlier Saturday, a statement said Israel's air force struck over 100 targets throughout Gaza over the past day. Gaza health officials, who don't differentiate between civilians and combatants, said the new deaths raise the war's toll to 53,901 since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the 19 months of fighting. The ministry said more than 3,700 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed the war in March to pressure Hamas to accept different ceasefire terms and release the remaining hostages. The renewed military action against Hamas has also included a blockade of Gaza and its more than 2 million residents since early March. This week,the first small number of aid trucksentered the territory and began reaching Palestinians. But they were far fewer than the about 600 trucks a day that had been entering during the ceasefire. President Benjamin Netanyahu's government has sought a new aid delivery and distribution system by a newly established U.S.-backed group, but the United Nations and partners have rejected it, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon and violates humanitarian principles. Israel has accused Hamas of siphoning off aid but the U.N. and aid groups deny there is significant diversion. Seven Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers have also accused Israel's military of using human shields in Gaza, allegedly sending people into buildings and tunnels to check for bombs and gunmen, the AP is reporting. They said the practice, which is prohibited by international law, has become ubiquitous over 19 months of war. In March,CBS News reported similar allegations, including from an Israeli soldier whose account of the tactics used in Gaza raised some serious questions. \"We've burned down buildings for no reasons, which is violating the international law, of course,\" he told CBS News. \"…And we used human shields as protection.\" Ayman Abu Hamadan told the AP he was held for 2 ½ weeks last summer by the Israeli military in northern Gaza, and the only time he wasn't bound or blindfolded was when he was forced into houses to make sure they were clear of bombs and gunmen. \"They beat me and told me: 'You have no other option; do this or we'll kill you,\" the 36-year-old told the AP, adding that when one unit was finished with him, he was passed to the next. In response to the most recent allegations, Israel's military says it strictly prohibits using civilians as shields — a practice it has long accused Hamas of using in Gaza. Israeli officials blame Hamas for thecivilian death toll in its offensive that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. In a statement to the AP, the military said it also bans otherwise coercing civilians to participate in operations, and \"all such orders are routinely emphasized to the forces.\" The military said it's investigating several cases alleging that Palestinians were involved in missions but wouldn't provide details. It didn't answer questions about the reach of the practice or any orders from commanding officers. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Power outage disrupts last day of Cannes; police investigating possible arson",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 24, 2025 / 7:32 PM EDT/ CBS/AP French authorities believe arson may have played a role in a power outage Saturday in southeast France that threatened to jeopardize theCannes Film Festival'sclosing celebrations, including the much-anticipated Palme d'Or ceremony. Power was restored hours before the ceremony, around 3 p.m. local time, as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers. The end of the blackout was greeted with loud cheers from locals. Authorities were investigating the likelihood of arson in a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes that weakened the grid overnight, a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie said. The power outage happened hours later, after a high-voltage line fell at another location. Authorities were investigating what caused that line to collapse. About 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area lost electricity. In a statement, Laurent Hottiaux, the prefect for the area, condemned \"serious acts of damage to electrical infrastructures.\" \"All resources are mobilized to identify, track down, arrest and bring to justice the perpetrators of these acts,\" said Hottiaux. Cannes Film Festivalorganizers confirmed the outage affected the early activities of Saturday and said the Palais des Festivals — the Croisette's main venue — had switched to an independent power supply. The lineup wasunveiled last month for Cannes. \"All scheduled events and screenings, including the Closing Ceremony, will proceed as planned and under normal conditions,\" the statement said. \"At this stage, the cause of the outage has not yet been identified. Restoration efforts are underway.\" Traffic lights in parts of Cannes and the surrounding city of Antibes stopped working after 10 a.m. local time, leading to traffic jams and confusion in city centers. Most shops along the Croisette remained closed, and local food kiosks were only accepting cash. Train service in Cannes was also disrupted. Screenings at the Cineum, one of the festival's satellite venues, were briefly suspended, the festival added. The Palme d'Orwas later awarded Saturday night, with Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller \"It Was Just an Accident\" taking home the festival's most prestigious prize. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Trump praises West Point cadets, takes credit for U.S. military might",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 24, 2025 / 7:26 PM EDT/ CBS News West Point, N.Y.– President Trump used his first military commencement address since returning to office to congratulate the cadets at West Point for their achievements and take credit for the United States' military power. \"You will become officers in the greatest and most powerful Army the world has ever known,\" Mr. President said, \"And I know because I rebuilt the Army and I rebuilt the military, and we rebuilt it like nobody had ever rebuilt it before.\" Wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, the Republican president also detailed the shift in U.S. foreign policy and military intervention, something he previously addressed during his trip to the Middle East earlier this month. \"For at least two decades, political leaders from both parties have dragged our military into missions,\" Mr. Trump said, accusing leaders in the past of sending soldiers into \"nation-building crusades to nations that wanted to do nothing with us.\" \"It was never meant to be. It wasn't meant to be.\" The last time the president gave a speech at the U.S. Military Academy came amid nationwide reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. In that address, Mr. Trump focused his speech on thanking the National Guard for \"ensuring peace, safety and the constitutional rule of law on our streets.\" He urged the class to never forget the soldiers who fought to \"extinguish the evil of slavery.\" Nine graduates in 2020 wrote a letter to administrators asking for anti-racism training to be part of the curriculum at West Point, saying the institution was failing to produce leaders equipped to lead diverse organizations. Five years later, West Point is complying with the second Trump administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs in the military. In February, the U.S. military academy disbanded a dozen cadet clubs formed around race and gender, including the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the National Society of Black Engineers Club, and the Society of Women Engineers Club. The order bans race or sex-based preference in any part of the U.S. military and directs Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to conduct internal reviews of DEI initiatives. The President vowed during the campaign to get rid of \"woke\" military generals and re-establish a merit-based system. On Saturday, Mr. Trump touted that critical race theory would no longer be taught at military academies. \"We're getting rid of the distractions, and we're focusing our military on its core mission, crushing America's adversaries, killing America's enemies, and defending our great American flag like it has never been defended before,\" he said. Mr. Trump also said that his administration achieved a new record in peacetime recruiting record. \"Today, morale in the Armed Forces is soaring to the highest levels in many decades after years of recruiting shortfalls, and we had years and years of recruiting shortfalls. And just last year was the worst of all, the last year of the Biden administration,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now, just less than a year later, we just set a brand new peacetime recruiting record.\" CBS Newshas found that military records show enlistments began rebounding from apandemic slumplong before Election Day. While numbers have continued to rise under Mr. Trump, experts say the so-called \"Trump Bump\" — a termused byHegseth — is more likely the result of recruitment reforms introduced during former President Joe Biden's term. Mr. Trump's address comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, a Marine veteran, spoke at the U.S. Naval Academy and emphasized the administration's shift in foreign policy against forever wars and open-ended conflicts. No longer would the U.S. send the military on missions unless there was a \"specific set of goals in mind,\" he told the graduates. Ahead of Memorial Day, Vance also reflected on the sacrifice of service members. He shared the story of Major Megan McClung, 34, who served alongside him in Iraq and was killed by a roadside bomb. \"She was an officer I served with who was bright, tough and incredibly dedicated to her job,\" Vance said. He acknowledged that while not all the graduates shared his politics, he was still rooting for them. Of the 1,002 cadets graduating from the U.S. Military Academy, 14 are international cadets coming from across the globe, including Kosovo, Qatar, and Poland. Former President Joe Biden gave the commencement speech at West Point last year, during which he focused on foreign policy challenges that are still facing the U.S. He pledged continuous U.S. support for Ukraine, called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and reminded graduates that their oath is to the U.S. Constitution, not a particular party. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Miami-Dade Fire Rescuereceived a call at 8:51 a.m. local time reporting an explosion at a strip mall near the 900 block of West Palm Drive. First responders arrived at Palm Bakery, located at 941 West Palm Drive, and found a partially collapsed roof and multiple injured victims. Two people were classified as trauma alerts and rushed to a nearby trauma center, while six others were transported with less severe injuries requiring basic life support, fire officials said. Two more victims self-transported to a nearby hospital prior to responders' arrival, authorities said. More than two dozen rescue units responded to the scene, including canine search teams deployed to ensure no one remained trapped under the debris. As of Saturday afternoon, no additional victims had been found. The cause of the explosion is under investigation. Officials with Miami-Dade's Unsafe Structures unit were notified due to the damage to the building. The extent of the structural impact has not yet been determined.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 24, 2025 / 5:19 PM EDT/ CBS News The Georgia police officer whose traffic arrest of a 19-year-old undocumented college student led to herdetention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has resigned from the department, a spokesperson for the city of Dalton confirmed to CBS News on Saturday. City of Dalton spokesperson Bruce Frazier wrote in an email that the Dalton Police Department had \"no statement\" on the officer's \"resignation,\" and added that \"I also don't have info on his reason for resigning.\" Frazier's statement did not name the officer. The resignation comes after Dalton police said the officer had mistakenly pulled overXimena Arias Cristobalon May 5. He cited Arias-Cristobal for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton, where she was picked up by ICE officers. After officials reviewed dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop, they found the vehicle that actually made the improper turn was similar to the truck Arias Cristobal was driving, and on May 12,dismissed traffic charges against her. \"You ever been to jail?,\" the officer can heard asking Arias Cristobal in the dashcam footage. \"No, sir,\" she responded. \"Well, you're going,\" the officer said. \"I cannot go to jail. I have my finals next week. My family depends on this,\" Arias Cristobal said. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico when she was 4,had been in ICE custody since early Mayafter the agency took custody of her from the Dalton county jail and transferred her to an ICE detention facility in Lumpkin. ICE released her from detention on May 22 when an immigration judge granted her bond. Her father — who was detained by ICE in April, also after a traffic stop — was being held in Lumpkin as well, but he was granted bond and released last week. Both will continue to face deportation to Mexico, the Department of Homeland Security previously said. ICE started a deportation case against Arias Cristobal   in immigration court. DHS said Arias Cristobal and her father should face \"consequences\" for being in the U.S. illegally. Kiki Intarasuwan is a news editor for CBS News & Stations.

    "title": "WWI sub captured in never-before-seen images off San Diego coast",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 24, 2025 / 4:55 PM EDT/ CBS News On Dec. 17, 1917, the U.S. submarine USS F-1 was lost at sea during a training accident off the coast of California, killing 19 crew members on board. Now, just days before Memorial Day, scientists have announced they have captured unprecedented images of the final resting place of the World War I-era sub more than 1,300 feet below the ocean's surface. The high-definition pictures of the USS F-1 were released after a group of interagency teams used cutting-edge deep-sea imaging technology during an expedition earlier this year, according tonews releasefrom the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. USS F-1 collided with its sister ship, USS F-3, during exercises on the oean's surface off San Diego eight days before Christmas in 1917, according to theSubmarine Force Library and Museum Association. USS F-1 sank in just 10 seconds, and only five of the sub's 24 crewmen were rescued. The sub was lost for nearly 60 years until it  was located by a Navy deep submersible vehicle that was out looking for a jet fighter that crashed in 1972, the association said. \"It looked like a big ax had hit her,\" said Lt. Dave Magyar, the pilot of the submersible that spotted the USS F-1, according to a newspaperstory from 1976. But a close-up survey was not possible given the depth of the submarine. Until now. With assistance from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) and the National Science Foundation, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution team dispatched a human-piloted submersible named Alvin as well as a remote underwater vehicle named Sentry to capture the close-up images. Using sonar systems on Sentry and the research vessel Atlantis, the team was able to successfully conduct meticulous surveys of the submarine. \"Once we identified the wreck and determined it was safe to dive, we were able to capture never-before-seen perspectives of the sub,\" said WHOI's Bruce Strickrott, the senior pilot who helped lead the expedition. \"As a U.S. Navy veteran, it was a profound honor to visit the wreck of the F-1 with our ONR and NHHC colleagues aboard Alvin.\" During the expedition, the team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950. Scientists released video and images of the aircraft, showing a severely damaged tail and a bent front propeller. The team conducted seven total dives and the advanced sonar systems were able to produce detailed maps of the submarine wreck site and surrounding seafloor. Scientists also used high-resolution cameras to capture close-up video of the wreck. Specialists then used all the data to stitch together \"photogrammetric models capable of providing precise measurements of the sub and the animals that have colonized its wreckage over the years.\"  That allowed experts to reconstruct the F-1 submarine and produce stunning 3-D models of the wreck. After the dives, the team held a remembrance ceremony on board Atlantis, ringing  a bell 19 times — one for each crew member lost at sea. \"History and archaeology are all about people and we felt it was important to read their names aloud,\" said underwater archaeologist Brad Krueger, who participated in the dives. \"The Navy has a solemn responsibility to ensure the legacies of its lost Sailors are remembered.\" Stephen Smith is a managing editor for CBSNews.com based in New York.

    "title": "Guatemalan man deported to Mexico should be returned to U.S., judge orders",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 24, 2025 / 3:14 PM EDT/ CBS/AP A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man it deported to Mexico in spite of his fears of being harmed there. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \"lacked any semblance of due process.\" Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding determined that the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S. Court documents stated the Guatemalan man said he was only told about his deportation to Mexico, essentially as it was happening and that he begged to speak to his attorney but was denied. \"No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,\" Murphy wrote. \"In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\" O.C.G. entered the U.S. in March 2024, without prior authorization, according to court documents. The man said he had asked for asylum, was denied an interview and was deported shortly thereafter to Guatemala. In April 2024, O.C.G. decided to try again and crossed Mexico where, he said, he was raped and held hostage until a family member paid ransom. In May 2024, he arrived in the U.S. and was referred to an asylum officer after expressing fear of return to Guatemala. The officer determined he had had a credible fear of persecution or torture and initiated withholding-only proceedings. Two days later, he was sent to Mexico, court documents show. A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Murphy's order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from anotorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke thestate secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court - or even to the judge in private – about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security. In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb \"facilitate\" in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated. \"The Court notes that 'facilitate' in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,\" he wrote. \"O.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government's objectives.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Planned Parenthood affiliate to close 4 Minnesota clinics, 4 in Iowa",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 24, 2025 / 2:06 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Four Planned Parenthood clinics in Minnesota and four of the six in Iowa will shut down in a year, the Midwestern affiliate operating them said Friday, blaming a freeze in federal funds, budget cuts proposed in Congress andstate restrictions on abortion. Two of the Minnesota clinics closing are in the Twin Cities area, in Apple Valley and Richfield. The others are in Alexandria and Bemidji. According to Planned Parenthood North Central States, the four closing in Iowa include the only Planned Parenthood facility in the state that provides abortion procedures, in Ames, home to Iowa State University. The others are in Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale. ThePlanned Parenthoodaffiliate said it would lay off 66 employees and ask 37 additional employees to move to different clinics. The organization also said it plans to keep investing in telemedicine services and sees 20,000 patients a year virtually. The affiliate serves five states — Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. \"We have been fighting to hold together an unsustainable infrastructure as the landscape shifts around us and an onslaught of attacks continues,\" Ruth Richardson, the affiliate's president and CEO, said in a statement. Of the remaining 15 clinics operated by Planned Parenthood North Central States, six will provide abortion procedures — five of them in Minnesota. The other clinic is in Omaha, Nebraska. The affiliate said that in April, the Trump administration froze $2.8 million in federal funds for Minnesota to provide birth control and other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. While federal funds can't be used for most abortions, abortion opponents have long argued that Planned Parenthood affiliates should not receive any taxpayer dollars, saying the money still indirectly underwrites abortion services. Planned Parenthood North Central States also cited proposed cuts inMedicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income Americans, as well as a Trump administration proposal to eliminate funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programs. In addition, Republican-led Iowa last yearbanned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, causing the number performed there to drop 60% in the first six months the law was in effect and dramatically increasing the number of patients traveling to Minnesota and Nebraska. After the closings, Planned Parenthood North Central States will operate 10 brick-and-mortar clinics in Minnesota, two in Iowa, two in Nebraska, and one in South Dakota. It operates none in North Dakota, though its Moorhead, Minnesota, clinic is across the Red River from Fargo, North Dakota. The Associated  Presscontributed to this report. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Police officer facing wrongful death lawsuit was given 'valor' awards for fatal shooting",
    "article_text": "A former Kansas police officer whom prosecutors declined to charge inthe 2022 shooting death of a manwith a known history of mental health crises was twice presented top “valor” awards by law enforcement groups for his actions during the fatal encounter. The ceremonies stand in sharp contrast to the federal wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Brandon Lynch, 27, a year ago. One of the commendations, a “Gold Award for Uncommon Valor” presented by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police on May 1, 2024, was handed out two days before the family filed its suit against the officer, Conner Thompson, and the city of Olathe. In the complaint filed in the District of Kansas, Lynch’s family claims Thompson “unnecessarily escalated the situation” and applied an “unreasonable use of excessive force” that failed to consider proper crisis intervention training. Details of the awards — the first of which was given to Thompson by the Kansas City Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association in November 2023 — have not been previously reported. A detailed review of the awards shows that Thompson and his then-partner were honored for what police say occurred on the night Lynch was fatally shot, New Year’s Eve in 2022. Specifically, the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association said the officers “responded to a disturbance” at a home where a woman called to say her brother had assaulted her. Once at the home, the officers told the woman to wait outside while they entered and were confronted by the man, who was armed with a knife and Taser, the group’s narrative of events said. When the man “continued to be aggressive” and did not obey orders, Thompson’s partner attempted to use his department-issued Taser on him, but it was “ineffective,” the narrative said. “The suspect defied Thompson’s commands and advanced towards both officers,” the narrative said. “Recognizing the suspect was in close proximity of the officers, Thompson fired his handgun at the suspect, striking him.” “During a tense situation, Thompson had the wherewithal to conduct life-saving measures,” the narrative added. The version of events offered by the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police was similar. Neither narrative mentioned Lynch by name nor explained that a dispatcher had relayed to officers that Lynch was exhibiting a mental health crisis, as his sister had explained when she called 911. Nor did the narratives note that officers had had prior encounters with him at the home, including one time in which Thompson was in a “physical altercation” with Lynch, according to the Johnson County prosecutors who investigated the shooting and determined “the officer properly used deadly force in this incident.” A review of the “valor” awards given to other officers by the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association that year show they were for actions such as saving suicidal people, helping a gunshot victim and assisting an infant who stopped breathing because of a respiratory virus. The law firm for Lynch’s family, Cannezzaro Marvel LLC in Kansas City, Missouri, declined to comment about the suit or the officer being awarded for his actions on the night Lynch died. The president of the Metropolitan Area Chiefs and Sheriffs Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dennis Shaw, the executive director of the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police, said in an email that “the officer was cleared by the District Attorney,” and the narrative the association shared “was presented to us for consideration.” While the honor given to Thompson stood out in the awards ceremony, it’s not unheard of for officers to receive commendations related to fatal shooting incidents. Narene Stokes, whoseson, Ryan, was fatally shotby Kansas City, Missouri, police in 2013, recalled feeling “baffled, angry and confused” when she learned the officers involved in his death were recognized with awards by a local police board for their actions. The award, however, waslater rescinded. “The officers want to say they feared for their life — and that’s why they get an award?” Stokes said. In Lynch’s case, police bodycam video was made public when Johnson County District Attorney Steve Howe announced that his office would not be charging the officer. “Lynch took the actions that caused his death,” he said in May 2023, and “the officers reacted to the aggressiveness of Lynch throughout that episode.”",

    "title": "Texas moves forward with expansive social media ban for minors, reigniting debate",
    "article_text": "Texas is poised to become the second state to enact an across-the-board ban on social media for minors before its state legislative session ends in a little over a week. Advocates on both sides of the issue have said the bill would be the strictest state-level regulation yet on social media platforms if enacted. And it comes as other states across the country are considering similar restrictions amid fierce debates over free speech and whether these sorts of policies are the most effective way to achieve supporters' primary goal: improving young Americans' mental health. If enacted,Texas' billwould put in place vast new restrictions that explicitly bar every Texas resident under 18 years old from signing up for and using “a social media platform.” The legislation would require all social media platforms to verify the age of all people setting up an account. It would allow parents to request that the platforms delete their child’s social media account — and require the companies to do so as well within 10 days. Violations are defined in the bill as “deceptive trade practices,” meaning that they would be both punishable with fines from the state’s attorney general and subject to lawsuits for financial damages. The Texas House has passed the bill and the state Senate is expected to as well. Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Gov. Gregg Abbott, a Republican, said that “safety and online privacy for Texas children remain a priority” for Abbott and that he would “thoughtfully review any legislation sent to his desk that seeks to accomplish these goals.” Such laws have run into major legal challenges by groups contending that such restrictions amount to free speech violations. And even manyhigh-profile supportersof social media restrictions for minors say that bans for young people may not be the ideal policy solution. “Something needs to be done,” said Dr. Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology strategy and integration for the American Psychological Association (APA). “These are things that we know don’t fit with the adolescent brain — things like endless scroll and ‘like counts.’” “But an age ban — that’s like delaying the age of driving but not having any driver's ed,” Prinstein added. “Why just delay the age and then send kids out for slaughter later?” The APA hasrepeatedly urgedlegislators to be more aggressive in trying to protect adolescents’ mental health, but have advocated for policies more tailored than age restrictions. A variety of states have recently plowed forward with social media bills centered around age. And all of them — including Texas' — have garnered bipartisan support. Most prominently, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, last yearsigned a bill prohibitingchildren younger than 14 from joining social media platforms, becoming the first state to enact such a ban. The law also required that teenagers who are 14 or 15 years old have a parent’s consent before they join a platform. Florida's banwas allowed to stand after a federal judgein March ruled against requests to block the law, though thelegal fight against itcontinues. The law reignited a battle among First Amendment and civil liberties advocates over whether such bans amount to restrictions on free speech. “We see this as a First Amendment issue, and, as these bills have generally been written, a serious First Amendment problem, because they essentially cut off an entire universe of information, of conversation from [young] people,” said Vera Eidelman, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. Over the past two years, at least nine other states have enacted significant restrictions on the use of social media, including requiring parental consent or age verification. More broadly, lawmakers in 27 states have attempted this year to advance bills that in some way seek to address or regulate minors’ use of social media, according to theNational Conference of State Legislatures. For example, the Nebraska Legislatureapproveda bill last week that would require parental consent for anyone under 18 to open a social media account. State House lawmakers in Connecticut last weeknarrowly approved a bill that would require the same. Minnesota lawmakers have debated several measures this year,including a tax oncompanies that mine data on the state's residents andproposed mental health warning labelsfor social media platforms. And last year, lawmakers in Georgia, Tennessee and Louisiana passed bills requiring parental consent for anyone under 16 to open a social media account. Many of these proposals have faced serious legal hurdles. And similar bills in previous years — including in states likeOhio,Arkansasand California — faced major legal challenges, with federal judges striking them down on the grounds of free speech violations. In addition, a social media curfew in Utah that banned the use of platforms for minors between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. enacted in 2023was scaled down and replacedwith more lenient restrictions last year after the original law faced a barrage of lawsuits. NetChoice, a tech trade group whose members include Meta, Google and X that is staunchly opposed to most social media regulations, has been involved in litigationin those three states and many otherswhere lawmakers have passed legislation seeking to curb social media access to minors. And the group signaled it was poised to do so again with Texas’ bill if it passes. Chris Marchese, NetChoice's director of litigation, called proposals like the one in Texas “censorship regimes masquerading as online safety laws” Each bill, Marchese said in an email, “puts the First Amendment rights of all Americans at risk, online and offline.” Social media companies have said they’ve made several changes to their platforms that help protect minors. Since 2023, Meta (the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp)started showingteens a notification when they spend 20 minutes on Facebook; added parental supervision tools allowing parents to schedule breaks from their teens from Facebook; launched a new teen-centric product on Instagram allowing parents to help limit the content their kids see on the platform; began hiding more results in Instagram’s search tool related to suicide, self-harm and eating disorders; and launched nighttime “nudges” that encourage teens to close the app when it’s late. TikTok, over the last five years, has instituted a variety of age-restricted features for users under 18, including limits on direct messaging and livestreams — as well as by-default private account settings for users between 13 and 15. The platform also instituted in2023a 60-minute daily screen time limit for users under 18, and, two years earlier,restrictednighttime notifications for some teenagers. In addition, the platform offers parents certain controls over their kids’ usage,includingscreen time management and what kind of content they are able to see. Spokespeople for Meta and TikTok declined to comment on bills limiting the use of social media platforms for young people. A spokesperson for X didn’t respond to questions. The broader issue has also grabbed the attention of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii,introducedearlier this year the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would ban social media platforms from allowing kids under 13 to create or maintain accounts. The bill, which would also require social media companies to delete the existing accounts of kids 13 and under,has seen little movement since being introduced in February. Meanwhile, federal lawmakers, following the lead of state legislatures, have also turned their attention in recent months to the growing movement to restrict the use of cellphones by kids and teenagers in schools. Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Tim Kaine, D-Va.,introduced a bill that would deliverfunding for school districts to explore putting in place such restrictions. That effort comes as anincreasing number of states have enacted laws or considered billsto ban cellphones in schools.",

    "title": "Road trips rev up as summer travelers hunt for cheaper vacations",
    "article_text": "Consumers aren’t ready to ditch their travel plans despite growing economic gloom. But they arehunting for bargains— and hoping to find them on the open road. Some 53% of U.S. consumers are planning vacations this season, up from 48% a year ago,Deloitte researchers reportedTuesday. There’s especially strong interest in brief but more frequent trips closer to home, including by car, as travelers take a “more frugal approach” this year, the analysts said. Chris Narvaez, 45, had planned to visit London and Rome this summer.Airfares to Europe are down 8%, according to travel booking platform Hopper, but the New York City-based human resources director said he’s “hitting the pause button” on overseas travel. “Between new requirements for visas, the current administration, challenges with air traffic control andnear misses at local airports, I don’t feel as comfortable as I would getting on a plane,” he said, referring toupdated IDandentry rulesalong withincreased customs stops. Instead, he’ll stick to the East Coast — with jaunts to Woodstock, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts — piling into the car with friends and his 15-year-old shepherd mix, Eli. Alexisa Humphrey, owner of Sugar and Spice Travels in Lebanon, Tennessee, said her customers are still venturing out. But like Narvaez, “they are doing shorter, more budget-friendly trips,” she said, citing some of the same travel concerns. “I have had clients cancel flights and drive or book a train instead.” I have had clients cancel flights and drive or book a train instead. Alexisa Humphrey, owner of Sugar and Spice Travels, Lebanon, TN. Highway drivingremains far more dangerousthan commercial air travel or passenger rail, federal data shows. But recentair traffic control issuesat Newark Liberty International Airport have spooked many travelers, Humphrey said. Travel volumes at the busy New Jersey airport aredown 20% from this time last year, NBC News reported Tuesday. Cost is also a factor. While round-trip domestic flights arehitting three-year lows, according to Hopper, driving typically remains much more affordable. Gas isabout 40 cents cheaperheading into Memorial Day than a year ago, according to AAA, whichexpects a record 45.1 million peopleto travel at least 50 miles from home over the long holiday weekend. That would mark a more than 3% jump since 2024 to hit the highest level in 20 years. U.S. consumers have been trimming their vacation budgets asprice-hike headlines proliferateandeconomic sentiment tumblesto historic lows. Travelers told Deloitte in March that they were planning to spend an average of $3,987 on their main summertime trips, about 13% more than a year earlier. Just two weeks later, though — asfrenzied tariff news rattled stock markets— that estimate shrunk to $3,471, less than 1% more than in 2024. Latisha Hunt, a real estate agent and Air Force veteran in Biloxi, Mississippi, is one of Humphrey’s clients who recently adjusted her summer plans. She shortened a trip to Panama in early July from seven days to three and will drive 5½ hours to Atlanta’s airport rather than fly out of a smaller one closer to home. “It’s more affordable and allows me to better manage my overall experience,” said Hunt, 39, who’s also planning car trips in coming months to Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan. “I’ll be staying with family and friends along the way, which helps keep costs low and adds a more personal, meaningful touch to each visit.” Hunt will have plenty of company on the roads. Among drivers surveyed at the pump by gas station video network GSTV this winter,56% said they planned to drive moreon their summer vacations than they did last year; 54% reported choosing driving over flying to save money. Many summer road trippers are on tighter budgets. Bank of America researchers found driving to bethe top mode of transportfor lower- and middle-income vacationers this summer — preferred by at least 64% of each group, compared with less than 55% of high-earners. The good news is thatrental car costswere down about 2.1% in April from the year before, according to federal data, and Hopper expects them to stay roughly flat with 2024 levels throughout the summer. But as major rental car operators have adjusted to slower demand, some — includingAvis Budget GroupandHertz— are slashing their fleets, which could reduce vehicle selection. Car travelers may also need to budget extra for parking at airports and hotels, many of which tack on fees that can range from just a few dollars to$80 a day. Driver-friendly hotels along major highways and outside of urban areas frequently offer free daily parking, but overnight ratescan still top $100 per nightat high-demand lots. In fact, road trippers are a fast-growing slice of accommodation operators’ business. Hotel parking revenues surged 18% between 2019 and 2024, according to real estate and investment firm CBRE. Hotel revenue overall grew less than 7% over the same period. “This should not be interpreted as more people driving to hotels,” said Robert Mandelbaum, hotel research director at CBRE. “It is a combination of hotels charging more for parking and more hotels charging for parking that did not before Covid.”",

Prosecutors spent much of the fifth week of thewidely publicized retriallaying out the physical evidence that they say shows that Read drunkenly drove into Boston police officer John O’Keefe, 46, and left him for dead outside the home of a law enforcement colleague on Jan. 29, 2022. Lead prosecutor Hank Brennan and Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally called a series of forensic specialists to bolster that theory. The defense, which has rejected those allegations, focused much of its attention on a single expert who examined a key piece of evidence — vehicle data — and subjected that expert to hours of interrogation-like questioning as attorney Robert Alessi sought to dismantle the analyst’s contributions to the prosecution’s case. “I’m trying to understand your statement,” an exasperated-sounding Alessi said at one point during cross-examination. “Isn’t it either you have a bachelor of science degree or you don’t?” Read, who is charged with second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a collision causing death, has remained chatty with reporters throughout the proceedings and said after court Wednesday that she feels “great” about the case so far. She has maintained her innocence throughout her legal battle. Her first trial ended with a hung jury last summer. Her defense team has said that she was framed by former and current law enforcement officers and others who were at the home where O’Keefe was found unresponsive early Jan. 29. The defense has also said that the state trooper who led the investigation into O’Keefe’s death was biased and manipulated evidence. The trooper, who acknowledged sending unprofessional messages about Read but testified that his conduct did not affect the integrity of the investigation, was fired after an internal investigation found he violated agency rules. In court earlier this week, experts offered a flurry of technical, sometimes highly complex details about the physical evidence linked to Read’s SUV: a strand of O’Keefe’s hair found on the Lexus’ rear quarter panel; bits of red plastic discovered on O’Keefe’s clothes that could have been from the SUV’s broken taillight. The vehicle data examined by Shanon Burgess, a digital forensic analyst, is central to the prosecution’s case. Brennan has accused Read of reversing her Lexus into O’Keefe in a hit that left him dead, and Burgess’ analysis found that the SUV recorded a “backing event” outside the home where he was found unresponsive shortly after 6 a.m. The defense spent hours grilling Burgess on everything from errors the expert acknowledged making in his analysis to the accuracy of his resume. At one point, the grueling back-and-forth prompted a startling admission from Burgess. Even though his curriculum vitae and LinkedIn profile state that he has a bachelor’s degree in science from the University of Alabama, he has no more than an associate’s degree, Burgess testified. He began pursuing a bachelor’s in 2008, he said, but never completed the coursework. When Alessi pressed Burgess to explain the misstatements, he attributed them to “errors” and “misinterpretations.” “But you would agree those errors or misinterpretations have been in existence for some time?” the defense attorney responded. “Yes,” Burgess said. “I’m being made aware of them now.” At another point, Alessi pressed Burgess on what the defense lawyer described as a series of errors the expert made while analyzing three chips from Read’s SUV. In a document Burgess provided to the prosecution in October, Alessi said, the expert asserted that a previous analysis used in the case was incomplete because it did not capture all of the data from the chips. In fact, Alessi said, it was Burgess who erred by making mistakes in his data conversion method. He confused megabits for megabytes, Alessi said, and gigabits for gigabytes. (Eight of the former equals one of the latter.) “The entire foundation of your proposal was based on a fundamental misinterpretation of the difference between a computer bit and a computer byte, correct?” the defense lawyer said. “No, not the entire thing,” Burgess responded. “Well certainly a part of it was, correct?” Alessi said. “Correct,” Burgess said. “Since you wrote that, have you learned the difference between a bit and a byte?” the lawyer asked. “I’ve always known the difference between a bit and a byte,” Burgess said. Later, Alessi questioned Burgess about what he described as discrepancies between two reports he wrote in the case. The first, submitted in January of this year, sought to reconstruct the events of Jan. 29, 2022, using vehicle data. The second, submitted earlier this month — after Read’s retrial had already begun — was a supplemental report that sought to “clarify” parts of the initial document, Burgess said. On the stand, Alessi asked him to explain one of those discrepancies in the supplemental report. On direct examination, Alessi said, Burgess told the prosecutor that he’d submitted the document on his own initiative in an effort to respond to a “misleading” claim that he later said came from a defense expert. But the report itself stated the opposite, Alessi pointed out. In the document’s first line, which Alessi read in court, Burgess said he was submitting the additional analysis at the prosecutor’s request. “Which is it?” Alessi asked. “This is a holdover, so a copy and paste from my original report,” Burgess responded. “Do you cut and paste important information from one report to the other without checking it for accuracy?” Alessi asked. “I copy and paste certain portions,” Burgess said. “You didn’t review it this time, though, did you?” Alessi said. “No,” Burgess responded. “I didn’t think it was significant.”",

    "title": "Dermatologists say Marines' tightened shaving waiver could hurt Black members' careers",
    "article_text": "Air Force veteran Ed Anderson can’t recall any time past puberty when he didn’t get razor bumps after shaving his face. His coarse facial hair would often cause painful inflammation and itchy bumps as it grew back. Anderson, now 70, remembers requesting a shaving waiver when he entered the service in 1975, allowing him to bypass the military’s requirements for men to be clean-shaven. For him and other Black airmen, the waivers became a symbol of unity. “It was seen as an identifier of solidarity with other Black GIs having that shaving waiver,”  Anderson said. The military as a wholebegan issuing these waiversin the 1970s, with the Navy taking the strongest approach in 1970 to allow the elective wearing of beards to address medical conditions. But the policies of the different branches have changed multiple times since then. Now, a new U.S. Marine Corps grooming policy that affects people with curly or coarse hair is drawing ire from critics who say it targets Black men. The guidance, issued in March, states that a diagnosis of pseudofolliculitis barbae, or PFB, a skin condition more commonly known as razor bumps or ingrown hairs, could lead to a service member’s expulsion from the branch if the issue persists. The U.S. Air Force alsoupdated its guidanceon PFB earlier this year, saying shaving waivers will expire 90 days after an airman’s next annual health assessment. But the requirements for those who may still qualify for a waiver remain unclear. Thecondition affectsup to 60% of Black men, according to the American Osteopathic College of Dermatology, a far higher rate than for any other group. Anderson said he sees the move as yet another example of “ongoing attacks” on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the federal government. “It’s mostly soldiers of color who are impacted by this,” he said. “I don’t see this as a productive and effective means of retaining and recruiting troops.” The latest policy change under Brig. Gen. David R. Everly marks areversal from a 2022 policythat barred Marines from being kicked out of the service solely for the skin condition. In the last three years, service members were able to obtain temporary or permanent shaving waivers, or “no shave chits,” once it was determined that their PFB couldn’t be treated by topical medications. Dermatologists around the country who treat people with the condition say the latest policy change seems to be unnecessary. “This is so targeted and intentional,” said Chris Adigun, a board-certified dermatologist based in North Carolina. PFB “can affect only the way hair follicles appear,” said Adigun, “and does not affect the body systemically in any way.” Under the new guidance, which the message says will best position Marines for “warfighting capability,” service members with PFB are now required to undergo a medical evaluation within 90 days. If their condition does not improve within a year under a four-part treatment plan, they could be separated from the branch at the discretion of their commanding officer. Critics, however, call it an outdated policy rooted in discrimination. An active military dermatologist, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said the move has “nothing to do with readiness.” “On its face it’s a racist policy, because this is a condition that impacts African Americans and other people of color predominantly just by the nature of hair growth on the face,” they said, adding that it also “creates a huge administrative burden on a patient.” It remains unclear how many Marines would be affected by the policy as the branch said it does not track how many members have shaving exemptions for PFB. Black service members make up 18% of all active-duty Marines,according to datafrom the Marine Corps Gazette, a professional journal by members of the service. The branch itself does not keep racial demographic data on its members, a Marines spokesperson said. Military leaders say the change returns service members to grooming standards that ensure “maximum war readiness,” according to the mandate. “Our priority is to ensure the health and resilience of our Marines while maintaining our warfighting capability,” said Maj. Jacoby Getty, a spokesman for the Corps’ Manpower & Reserve Affairs, an office tasked with acquiring and retaining talent. “These updates ensure consistency in the management of medical conditions while reinforcing our commitment to returning Marines to full compliance whenever possible.” Adigun noted the policy’s history as a point of contention dating back to the 1970s, which led to social uproar among Black service members who had long argued against its efficacy. U.S. military leaders have long maintained that service members need to be clean-shaven, both to maintain a professional appearance and to ensure the proper fit of airtight gas masks, despite little evidence that links PFB or facial hair to poor gas mask fit. Astudy publishedin the Journal of Military Medicine in 2021 found little evidence that short beards interfered with the seal of a gas mask. A study in 2018found that pilotswith beards more than a foot long were able to maintain an airtight seal on their masks in a simulated cabin depressurization test. Medical experts say PFB is improved by not shaving at all or shaving with clippers that don’t give a close shave, which allows the hair to remain above the skin surface after it is cut. Another option is laser hair removal. But for many Marines, the military dermatologist said, this permanent option for what many see as a temporary job is not a viable choice. Ananalysis publishedin the journal Military Medicine also found a link between shaving waivers and delays in promotion that disproportionately affects Black service members. This latest Marine policy change comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in March ordered amilitarywide reviewof physical fitness and grooming standards. “We must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world’s most lethal and effective fighting force,” Hegseth said when announcing the order. The Department of Defense declined a request to comment on the latest guidelines. But, according to South Carolina-based dermatologist Lauren Ploch, standards that require clean-shaven faces are “rooted in institutional racism” because they single out PFB for strict treatment. She questions why there are not similar rules for other skin conditions like cystic acne or dissecting cellulitis, which affects the scalp. There are regulations fortreating these issues, but no specific policies that could lead to a service member’s expulsion. “If one of these conditions is not a disqualifier, then PFB shouldn’t be either,” Ploch said. Dara Spearman, a board-certified dermatologist based in Indiana, said the potential for dismissal under the policy is “dramatic.” “Given the historic interactions between Black Americans and organizations with regard to grooming habits and requirements,” Spearman said, “it seems there may be other factors at play than whether a gas mask fits.” Anderson, citing his years of service, said he believes he’s well within his rights to challenge things he disagrees with. “I’ve always been a patriot,” Anderson said, “but being a patriot also makes one qualified to question what’s going on — not just to blindly accept and go along with everything.”",

    "title": "Cannes awards Palme d'Or to Iranian revenge drama 'It Was Just an Accident'",
    "article_text": "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at theCannes Film Festivalon Saturday for his revenge thriller \"It Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years. Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car. The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 at the festival held up Panahi's name to honor the director then under house arrest. On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country. \"Let us join forces,\" said Panahi. \"No one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\" \"Let's continue to hope,\" he concluded. The win for \"It Was Just an Accident\" extend one of the most unprecedented streaks in movies: The indie distributor Neon has backed the last six Palme d'or winners. Neon, which acquired \"It Was Just an Accident\" for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \"Parasite,\" \"Titane,\" \"Triangle of Sadness,\" \"Anatomy of a Fall\" and \"Anora.\" All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \"Parasite\" and \"Anora,\" won best picture. Last year, filmmakerMohammad Rasouloffled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes, and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday. \"It Was Just an Accident\" was inspired by Panahi's experience in jail. In it, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him. \"The film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\" Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \"Art will always win. What is human will always win.\" The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes. The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama \"Sentimental Value,\" his lauded follow-up to \"The Worst Person in the World.\" Some had expected \"Sentimental Value\" to win the Palme, but Trier — whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve — still took a major prize. \"We live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\" Kleber Mendonça Filho's Brazilian political thriller \"The Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \"The Secret Agent\" showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \"That was our wish.\" The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \"I'm Still Here\" in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the awards \"show that our country's cinema is second to none.\" The jury prize was split between two films: Óliver Laxe's desert road trip \"Sirât \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \"Sound of Falling.\" Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \"The Little Sister,\" Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama. The Belgian brothers Jean-Luc and Pierre Dardennes, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \"Young Mothers.\" Cannes' award for best first film went to Hasan Hadi, for \"The President's Cake,\" making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival. Saturday's ceremony brings to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \"Can you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn't ship that way,\" said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \"The Phoenician Scheme\" at the festival. That was one of the top American films in Cannes, along with Spike Lee's \"Highest 2 Lowest,\" the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \"Mission: Impossible — Final Reckoning\" and Ari Aster's \"Eddington.\"",

    "title": "Lando Norris qualifies on pole for Monaco GP in record time",
    "article_text": "MONACO — Lando Norris beat theMonacotrack record, his main Formula 1 rival and a local hero to take pole position on Saturday. Perhaps most importantly, Norris made a breakthrough in his own struggles withF1qualifying, which have hampered his championship chances against McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri. “It’s been a long time coming,” said Norris, who hadn’t been on pole since the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. “I don’t think I’ve ever doubted what I can do. Of course, I’ve got frustrated, I’ve been unhappy, because that’s normal,” Norris added. “If you don’t win, if you don’t get pole, you’re not going to be happy, especially when it’s where you should be, it’s what the objective is.” Norris and Monaco local Charles Leclerc swapped the fastest times before Norris upped the pace again to take first by .109 of a second. Piastri was third. Norris’ time of 1 minute, 9.954 seconds replaced a record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019. It comes as Norris tries to cut into Piastri’s 13-point standings lead and follows weeks of frustration in qualifying — sometimes from small mistakes, but also adramatic crashin Saudi Arabia last month. Leclerc, who won the Monaco GP last year, was denied a fourth career pole at his home race. Leclerc said Monaco’s slow and twisty layout allowed Ferrari to dodge some of the “compromises” it’s had to make with its setup at more varied tracks. Defending champion Max Verstappen, thewinner of the Emilia-Romagna GPlast week, was fifth for Red Bull after predicting Monaco’s low-speed nature wouldn’t suit his car, but starts fourth because of a penalty for Lewis Hamilton. Qualifying has typically been more important at Monaco than anywhere else on the F1 calendar. It’s almost impossible to overtake on the narrow streets so grid position is vital. It could be a little different this time because drivers will be required tochange tires at least twiceduring the race. “I don’t think anyone really knows what to expect,” Piastri said. That rule change follows a dull race last year when an early red flag allowed all drivers to make their mandatory pit stop. The race finished with the top 10 all in the same order that they started the race. A radio mix-up cost seven-time world champion Hamilton, as he was dropped from fourth to seventh on the grid for getting in Verstappen’s way. In the first part of qualifying, Hamilton was told by the Ferrari team that Verstappen was on a slower lap, when the Dutch driver was actually trying to set a competitive time. Hamilton was obliged to make way for the faster car, but the miscommunication meant the British driver was in Verstappen’s way on the racing line, landing him a three-place grid penalty for impeding. Until then, Hamilton’s fourth place seemed a strong recovery following a crash in practice which required a major rebuild of his Ferrari. It was a session to forget for Mercedes as its cars caused two red flags. George Russell is set to start 14th after his car broke down in the tunnel with a suspected electrical problem, causing a lengthy stoppage while it was pushed out of the way by a track marshal crew. His 18-year-old teammate Kimi Antonelli hit the wall and was 15th. Haas rookie Oliver Bearman qualified 17th but dropped to the back of the grid because of a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under red flags when practice was stopped.",

    "article_text": "Mexican singer Julión Álvarez announced the postponement of his Saturday concert at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, saying his work visa had been revoked. Álvarez, show promoter CMN and management company Copar Music said the show had been canceled “due to unforeseen circumstances” and that Álvarez was “unable to enter the United States in time for the event.” The 42-year-old musician further explained the postponement to his fans onInstagram Friday, saying in a video that they were formally notified on May 23 that the work visas for Álvarez and his bandmates were canceled ahead of the May 24 concert. “Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot comment on individual cases,” a State Department spokesperson told NBC News when asked for comment. Nearly 50,000 tickets were sold for Saturday’s show, according to the artist’s statement. Promoters and Álvarez’s team said they are actively working to reschedule the performance and all previously purchased tickets will be eligible for the new date. If patrons cannot attend the new date, details will be provided for requesting a refund, the statement said. Saturday’s performance would have been Álvarez’s fourth U.S. show on the “4218 Tour USA 2025,” following three shows in April at SoFi Stadium in California. The regional Mexican music performer reportedly had run ins with the U.S. government before due to accusations ofmoney laundering in 2017in connection with Mexican drug kingpin Raul Flores Hernandez. Álvarez, known as “The King of the Box Office,” was blacklisted by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that year but laterremovedin May 2022. Álvarez’s team did not immediately respond to an NBC News request for comment.  Álvarez has previously categorically denied having any ties to Hernandez.",

    "article_text": "Former President Joe Biden on Friday attended his grandson's high school graduation, marking his first public appearance since he announced last weekend that he wasdiagnosed with prostate cancer. In photos posted on Instagram by former first lady Jill Biden and the former president’s daughter Ashley Biden, Joe Biden appeared alongside other family members to celebrate the high school graduation of Robert Hunter Biden II from the Salisbury School in Salisbury, Connecticut. One of the photosposted by Jill Biden included the caption, “Proud Nana and Pop! Congratulations Hunter — we are so proud of you.” In photos Ashley Biden posted later Friday, it appeared that the former president was also spotted at the airport, though it is unclear which airport that was. Joe Biden announced on Sunday that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, with his personal office saying in a statement, “Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. On Friday he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.” On Tuesday, his office released a second statement, adding that he had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to last week. The statement also clarified that the former president had not been tested for prostate cancerin over a decade. Biden’s cancer diagnosis reignited debate among Democrats over the former president’s age and health, particularly as his diagnosis was announced close to the release of a new book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson that examined Biden’s health and cognitive abilities during the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and his family have repeatedly defended the former president from allegations that his cognitive or physical health was deteriorating while he was in office. His granddaughter Naomi Bidenwrotein a post on X this week that the book was “a bunch of unoriginal, uninspired lies written by irresponsible self promoting journalists out to make a quick buck.” The book “relies on unnamed, anonymous sources pushing a self-serving false narrative that absolves them of any responsibility for our current national nightmare,” she added. “All of this at the expense of a man so completely good and honest that it is impossible for these people to ever understand the why or how of it all. There are real stories to be told and one day they will be. I suspect history will reward the truth.”",

    "article_text": "Severe weather may put a damper on Memorial Day weekend travel plans for millions across the South, Plains and Mississippi Valley. Around 13 million people from Texas to Alabama on Saturday are in the risk area, including Memphis, Tennessee; Denver and Colorado Springs, Colorado; Birmingham, Alabama; and Oklahoma City and Tulsa in Oklahoma. Very large hail and damaging wind are the primary expectation this weekend, though a tornado or two cannot be ruled out. On Saturday, a cluster of thunderstorms was impacting parts of southeast Oklahoma, northeast Texas and Arkansas, where a Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains until 4 p.m. E.T. Storms in this region will be capable of producing 70 mph winds and up to 2-inch hail. In Missouri, 1 to 3 inches of rainfall was reported as of 2 p.m., with some areas receiving over 5 inches. Conditions have become more favorable for a few tornadoes Saturday afternoon, especially over central Oklahoma. Storms will linger into the overnight hours. By Sunday, 15 million in the same vicinity are under the risk for severe weather. Memphis, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Birmingham are included in that risk for very large hail, damaging wind gusts and a few tornadoes. The strongest storms are expected to target parts of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. A Slight Risk for severe weather will remain over parts of Texas for Memorial Day, impacting nine million in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, and bringing the same risks as the preceding days. This setup will also bring the risk for flash flooding to the region, with four million in parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas under Flood Alerts through Monday. Total rainfall accumulation will range from 4 to 6 inches with localized amounts ranging from 8 to 10 inches. Rainy weather will impact the heart of the country for the holiday on Monday, with spotty showers stretching from the Dakotas to the Gulf and Southeast. A severe storm or two is anticipated over parts of the Lone Star State. As a result of the cloudy and wet weather, temperatures across the Plains and Mid-Atlantic on Monday will range from the 50s to 70s, about 10 to 20 degrees below average. A mix of sun and clouds will impact the Northeast, while the West stays sunny and mild. A spike in travel was recorded by the Transportation Security Administration this weekend, with over three million travelers screened on Friday. Friday was the third busiest travel day of all time, according to the TSA. Around three million people are expected to travel over this weekend, with airport authorities and airlines encouraging passengers to arrive to airports at least two hours in advance.",

    "title": "Indianapolis celebrates an epic sports weekend with Pacers, Fever and the Indy 500",
    "article_text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Drive through the neighborhoods surrounding Indianapolis Motor Speedway and it looks like Christmas in May. Checkered flags and \"Welcome race fans\" signs on every block. Neatly trimmed lawns decorated with cutout Indy cars, a mock Borg-Warner Trophy, even an inflatable version of the track's familiar golden, winged logo. Yet the \"Racing Capital of the World\" is eagerly and happily sharing the Memorial Day weekend stage with theIndiana Pacersand the Indiana Fever, two teams straight from the Hoosier State's lifeblood of basketball. The Pacers flags and Caitlin Clark jerseysare easy to see all over town, including Gasoline Alley a few steps from the speedway's famous Brickyard. Pacers & Racers weekend is in high gear. \"This is an epic weekend, an incredible opportunity to put Indianapolis on the minds of virtually every major sports fan on the planet,\" said Chris Gahl, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Visit Indy. \"Our initial research shows no other city in the U.S. has hosted this diverse level of major sporting events in such a short amount of time.\" It may be an anomaly nationally, but Indianapolis is built to thrive in this sort of spotlight. The city has hosted the Super Bowl, two NBA All-Star Games, multiple international and national championships and, of course, now the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500. And through every virtually twist — even an NCAA men's basketball tournament held entirely in and around Indy — the reviews have come back with races. On Saturday afternoon, Clark and the Fever host the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in front of a sellout crowd early in a season with title hopes for a team boasting perhaps the biggest star in the league. An estimated 350,000 race fans are expected for Sunday's midday Indy 500 race, including the first sold-out grandstands since 2016. The weekend will be capped Sunday night when the Pacers host the New York Knicks for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals. It's the fourth time an NBA game has converged with race day, and the Pacers lost each of the first three — to the Knicks in 1999, to the Pistons in 2004 and to the Heat in 2013. They went on to lose all three series, too. The off-court, off-track stories such as the Team Penske cheating scandal, theWNBA investigation into alleged racial comments directed at Angel Reeseafter a Fever game and the call for international peace from Israeli-born, Russian-raised pole winner Robert Schwarzman have played into the buildup. Even the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles came to town Friday. In a state where the greatest athletic feats often have been defined by auto racing or basketball, this weekend seems like a fitting marriage even to locals. Just ask IndyCar team owner-driver Ed Carpenter, a longtime Pacers fan and the stepson of former speedway president and CEO Tony George. \"I think it celebrates the city, the people that live here and the fans that make the pilgrimage to the race,\" he said. \"(Having the other events) just makes it that much more special.\" Carpenter hopes to attend Sunday night's game — even if he wins the 500 — and now finds himself surrounded in Gasoline Alley by a growing legion of crossover fans Six-time IndyCar Series champion Scott Dixon and three-time 500 winner Dario Franchitti attended Game 3 of the Indiana-Cleveland series. Former IndyCar driver and broadcaster James Hinchcliffe was there for Game 2 and the triumvirate of Kyle Kirkwood, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson went to Game 2 of the Indiana-Milwaukee series. Scott McLaughlin, a Knicks fans, has a wager on the series with Carpenter and may attend Sunday's game if he's not drinking the milk in victory lane. \"How'd that go?\" fellow driver Alexander Rossi asked after the Pacers' thrilling Game 1 victory on Wednesday. \"Real bad, we lost the unloseable,\" McLaughlin said. \"We had a good wager. I have to buy the equivalent -- if the Pacers win in six games -- if they win in seven, the bet is off, or I win -- I have to buy the equivalent up to 2500 bucks of his (coffee/java).\" The red carpet isn't just being rolled out for the Pacers and the racers. Film director Spike Lee is expected to be in his familiar spot inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse while his old foil, Reggie Miller, calls the game for TNT. It's unclear how many big wigs from the race will make the 15-minute drive (in good traffic) to the arena for the game. Two tickets to each event would cost you nearly $4,000. Kyle Larson, who is making his second attempt at a different kind of race day double — completing 500 miles at Indianapolis and 600 more in Charlotte's NASCAR nightcap — already has made that trip. He went to the Fever game Tuesday night. \"Outside the car, it's been crazier this year logistics-wise,\" Larson said. \"Going to New York and having a full day of media there and then flying back here. Going to the Fever game was fun.\" The interest and intrigue goes the other way, too. Three years ago, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made his IndyCar debut in a two-seater with Mario Andretti. Last weekend, Fever coach Stephanie White, an Indiana native, returned to the track while Fever center Aliyah Boston, the 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year, got her first glimpse at the historic and vast 2.5-mile oval. \"Being on the track and kind of seeing how fast all the cars go, and to meet Colton was pretty dope,\" Boston said. \"The track is huge. Colton told us how many things could fit in the track and that's insane. You don't understand how big it is till you're there.\" Gahl said hotels are virtually sold out in Central Indiana and everywhere from Lafayette to Bloomington, roughly one-hour drives from Indy; downtown, the average cost is about $550 per night with a three-night minimum and restaurant reservations are scarce. Local merchandisers are capitalizing, too, selling blue-and-gold shirts that read \"Zoom Baby,\" a play off the late Bob \"Slick\" Leonard's radio calls of \"Boom Baby\" for Pacers' 3-pointers. In the midst of so much going on in a 36-hour window, the Pacers, racers and the Fever are all following the same playbook: Ignore the distractions and celebrate this incredible weekend. \"You've got to enjoy the moment, let the excitement and pressure go, focus on the task at hand right in front of you,\" Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said. \"It should be exciting and fun.\"",

    "article_text": "Weeks after the city of Chicago andJussie Smollettannounceda settlementto resolve their yearslong legal battle over the actor's 2019 claim that he was the victim of a hate crime, Smollett took to social media to disclose the terms of the agreement. Smollett said Friday he would donate $50,000 to the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts charity as part of a deal to secure the case’s dismissal. Smollett said would be making an additional $10,000 donation to the Chicago Torture Justice Center. NBC News reached out to Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts and the city of Chicago to confirm Smollett’s donations and details of the settlement, but did not immediately receive a response to a request for comment. Chicago Torture Justice Center confirmed Smollett's donation in anInstagram postFriday. The actor said his decision to settle the civil suit was “not the most difficult” to make and allowed him to support the communities “too often neglected by those in power.” Smollett, who is Black and gay,first reporteda hate crime committed against him in January 2019, alleging that two men confronted him with racial and homophobic slurs, wrapped a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. However, police and city officials later said he orchestrated thehoax hate crime against himself. The city’s suit accused Smollett of submitting a false police report on Jan. 29, 2019, saying he knew his attackers and planned the attack, and it sought $130,000 in expenses spent on the police investigation. Smollett countersued, denying that he orchestrated the attack. BrothersOlabingo and Abimbola Osundairo,who worked on the “Empire” set, said they were paid by Smollett to stage the hate crime and testified against the actor during his trial. Smollett wasfound guilty on five countsof felony disorderly conduct in December 2021, andsentenced to 150 days in jailand 30 months’ probation in March 2022, but the Illinois Supreme Courtoverturned the convictionin November 2024 over prosecutorial issues. The state high court ruled that Smollett should have never been charged in the first place after entering a nonprosecution agreement with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. Smollett has maintained his innocence over the years. He ended his post thanking his supporters.",

    "title": "Ex-Minneapolis police chief recalls 'absolutely gut-wrenching' moment of seeing George Floyd video",
    "article_text": "MINNEAPOLIS — Former Minneapolis Police ChiefMedaria Arradondovividly remembers receiving a call around midnight from a community activist. The caller told him to watch a video spreading on social media of a white officer pinning a Black man to the ground, despite his fading pleas of \"I can't breathe.\" The dying man wasGeorge Floyd. The officer wasDerek Chauvin. And Arradondo was the city's first Black police chief. \"It was absolutely gut-wrenching,\" Arradondo, 58, recalled in an interview ahead of the fifth anniversary of Floyd's murder. What he saw conflicted with what his own people had told him about the deadly encounter, and he knew immediately it would mean changes for his department and city. But he acknowledged he didn't immediately foresee how deeply Floyd's death would reverberate in the U.S. and around the world. \"I served for 32 years,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt May 25th, 2020, is a defining moment for me in my public service career.\" The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, pinning him to the pavement outside a convenience store where Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. Chauvin maintained the pressure for 9 1/2 minutes despite pleas from onlookers to stop, even after an off-duty firefighter tried to intervene and another officer said he couldn't find a pulse. Arradondo sat for the interview in a public library that was heavily damaged in the unrest that followed Floyd's death. It's on Lake Street, a major artery that saw some of the worst destruction, a street that he says still bears \"remnants of the pain and anger of what occurred five years ago.\" Just down the block, there's the empty shell of a police station that was torched during the riots. And within sight is a Target store and a Cub Foods supermarket that were looted. Storefronts remain boarded up. While some businesses were rebuilt, empty lots sit where others did not. Arradondo still stands by his and Mayor Jacob Frey's decision to abandon the Third Precinct and let it burn. Protesters breached the building, and police — who were spread thin — didn't have the resources to hold it. So he ordered his officers to evacuate. \"During the most significant crisis we've ever experienced, arguably in the state, when it's life or death, I've got to go on the side of keeping people alive and safe,\" he said. Arradondo subsequently helped launch an overhaul of policing in the city despite aresistant police cultureand a powerful officers union. He testified against Chauvin in his 2021 murder trial, a rare breach of the \"blue wall\" that traditionally protects officers from being held accountable for wrongdoing. Five years on, Arradondo,who retired in 2022, said he believes law enforcement agencies nationwide have made progress on police accountability — albeit incremental progress — and that police chiefs and sheriffs now move faster to hold officers responsible for egregious misconduct. Arradondo was promoted to chief in 2017, and his elevation was greeted with hope among local African Americans who affectionately called him \"Rondo.\" But his department had a reputation for being too quick to use force and many were angry about police killing young Black men in Minnesota and beyond. Arradondo said he wishes he had made more changes to the police department before Floyd was killed. \"I would have pushed harder and sooner at trying to dismantle some of the toxic culture that allowed that indifference to exist that evening, on May 25th, 2020,\" he said. \"I certainly would have invested more time elevating the voices in our community that had been pleading with police departments for decades to listen to us and change.\" Arradondo just published a book, \"Chief Rondo: Securing Justice for the Murder of George Floyd,\" that explores leadership, justice and race, the broader impacts of policing, and the challenges of working within a flawed system. He closes it with a letter dedicated to Floyd's daughter, Gianna. \"I never had an opportunity to meet Gianna, but I wanted her to know that, even though I was not out there that evening, at that intersection when her father was pleading for help, that I heard him, and I was going to do everything I could to bring him justice,\" he said. He wanted to say the words that she has not heard from the four former officers who were convicted for their roles in George Floyd's death: \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your father being taken from you.\"",

    "title": "A Planned Parenthood affiliate plans to close several clinics in Iowa and in Minnesota",
    "article_text": "Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa and four in Minnesota will shut down in a year, the Midwestern affiliate operating them said Friday,blaming a freeze in federal funds, budget cuts proposed in Congress and state restrictions on abortion. The clinics closing in Iowa include the only Planned Parenthood facility in the state that providesabortion procedures, in Ames, home to Iowa State University. The others are in Cedar Rapids, Sioux City and the Des Moines suburb of Urbandale. Two of the clinics being shut down by Planned Parenthood North Central States are in the Minneapolis area, in Apple Valley and Richfield. The others are incentral Minnesotain Alexandria and Bemidji. Of the four, the Richfield clinic provides abortion procedures. The Planned Parenthood affiliate said it would lay off 66 employees and ask 37 additional employees to move to different clinics. The organization also said it plans to keep investing in telemedicine services and sees 20,000 patients a year virtually. The affiliate serves five states — Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. \"We have been fighting to hold together an unsustainable infrastructure as the landscape shifts around us and an onslaught of attacks continues,\" Ruth Richardson, the affiliate's president and CEO, said in a statement. Of the remaining 15 clinics operated by Planned Parenthood North Central States, six will provide abortion procedures — five of them in Minnesota, including three in the Minneapolis area. The other clinic is in Omaha, Nebraska. The affiliate said that in April, President Donald Trump's administration froze $2.8 million in federal funds for Minnesota to provide birth control and other services, such as cervical cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. While federal funds can't be used for most abortions, abortion opponents have long argued that Planned Parenthood affiliates should not receive any taxpayer dollars, saying the money still indirectly underwrites abortion services. Planned Parenthood North Central States also cited proposed cuts in Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income Americans, as well as a Trump administration proposal to eliminate funding for teenage pregnancy prevention programs. In addition, Republican-led Iowa last year banned most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, causing the number performed there to drop 60% in the first six months the law was in effect and dramatically increasing the number of patients traveling to Minnesota and Nebraska. After the closings, Planned Parenthood North Central States will operate 10 brick-and-mortar clinics in Minnesota, two in Iowa, two in Nebraska, and one in South Dakota. It operates none in North Dakota, though its Moorhead, Minnesota, clinic is across the Red River from Fargo, North Dakota.",

    "article_text": "A Louisiana inmate whomauthorities began searching for after receiving a public tipwas recaptured on Friday, according to the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office. Tra’Von Johnson, 22, was found on Bennett Road in Amite City, just a few miles away from the Tangipahoa Parish Jail, which he escaped from on Thursday afternoon, the sheriff's office said in an update Friday evening. This was his second escape from the jail, according to the sheriff's office, which said he broke out of the facility \"a year ago this month.\" \"TPSO wants to thank, first and foremost, the community for standing with us in this effort,\" the sheriff's office said, adding that Louisiana State Police made the arrest. The sheriff's office shared a video of Johnson being taken back into custody and placed into a Louisiana State Police helicopter. Prior to his escape, Johnson was awaiting trial in Tangipahoa Parish Jail for his alleged role in a 2022 Hammond-area home invasion where a man was killed and his child was injured, according to the sheriff’s office. He has since been charged with simple escape. Johnson has been taken to Angola, Louisiana, since he was recaptured, where he will await trial, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office did not clarify whether Johnson will be held at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. Johnson and another inmate, Trevon Wallace, were able to escape the jail after an inmate in their dorm flooded a shower at around 4:15 p.m. \"During the clean-up, while several sections of exterior doors were open to push water out, an interior door was inadvertently opened less than a minute before the error was realized and it was closed again,\" the sheriff's office said. \"In those few seconds, Johnson and Wallace ran out of all of the doors to the yard.\" The sheriff's office released surveillance video of Wallace and Johnson running out to the yard before Wallace gives Johnson a boost over a perimeter fence. Wallace ran back to the jail building afterward, where he was intercepted by deputies who took him back to his cell. The deputies did not report the incident with the door, or Wallace's interception, to superiors, and failed to do a proper head count after finding him, the sheriff's office said. Just before 10 p.m., the sheriff’s office received a call from a member of the public who asked if Johnson was still in custody. The person did not identify themselves, Sheriff Gerald Sticker said at a news briefing Friday afternoon. The realization of Johnson's escape prompted a lockdown at the jail and a search that lasted until around 3 a.m. Friday morning, according to Sticker. Johnson was eventually found Friday evening. \"At this time, it is not believed this was a planned escape, but rather, an opportunistic one that was compounded by a failure of jail staff to follow protocols put in place as preventative measures for escapes,\" the sheriff's office said. \"However, the current investigation into this incident does include looking into the person who called the jail and the inmate who caused the flooding to begin with.\" Wallace has since been charged with simple escape and principal to help someone escape, according to Sticker. Four members of the jail’s staff were placed on administrative leave, he said. According to the sheriff's office, the jail \"is only able to staff one individual tasked with monitoring 60 cameras all at once while also opening doors as requested by deputies in and around the pods and dorms.\" Sticker said the sheriff’s office has been working to address deficiencies at the jail, but it is “still a work in progress.”",

    "article_text": "CANNES, France — A major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday morning, disrupting traffic and briefly halting events at theCannes Film Festivalas the prestigious event prepared tohand out its top prize. Power was restored around 3 p.m., as music began blasting again from beachfront speakers. The end of the blackout was greeted with loud cheers from locals. Earlier, about 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes department lost electricity after a high-voltage line fell Saturday morning, electricity network operator RTE said on X. The outage came hours after a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes overnight had already weakened the grid. Police have opened an investigation into possible arson. “We are looking into the likelihood of a fire being started deliberately,” said a spokesperson for the French national gendarmerie. Cannes Film Festivalorganizers confirmed the outage affected the early activities of Saturday and said the Palais des Festivals — the Croisette’s main venue — had switched to an independent power supply. “All scheduled events andscreenings, including the Closing Ceremony, will proceed as planned and under normal conditions,” the statement said. “At this stage, the cause of the outage has not yet been identified. Restoration efforts are underway.” Traffic lights in parts of Cannes and the surrounding city of Antibes stopped working after 10 a.m., leading to traffic jams and confusion in city centers. Most shops along the Croisette remained closed, and local food kiosks were only accepting cash. Train service in Cannes was also disrupted. Screenings at the Cineum, one of the festival’s satellite venues, were briefly suspended, the festival added.",

    "title": "No scenery was chewed: Icelandic sheepdog wins 'Palm Dog' in Cannes",
    "article_text": "It was a paws-itively magnificent performance. Less Brad Pitt, more Brad Pit Bull, the 25th annualPalm Dog awards in Cannesrolled out the red carpet Friday for the four-legged stars to get their flowers alongside their human colleagues, who were in town for this year’s iteration of the film festival held in the French beach town. Under the Plage du Festival tent, humans sipped their wine while their furry co-stars soaked up the attention at the award ceremony, a pun on Cannes’famous Palme d’Or,awarded to the director of the year’s best feature film. This year’s top dog was Panda,an Icelandic sheepdogwho stole the show in “The Love That Remains,” by director Hlynur Palmason. Panda is Palmason’s dog in real life, but the victorious hound could hardly be accused of nepaw-tism after her central performance in the drama that explores a year in the life of a family following parental separation. With Panda unable to attend in person, she was granted perhaps the ultimate privilege of stardom — a double named Lola, who received the award on the winner’s behalf and was pictured alongside children. Palm Dog jury member Wendy Mitchell said Panda was chosen for the grand prize because of how central she is to the family’s life in the film, joining them on hikes, on car rides and at themother’s art studio. “There are so many great competitors this year, but this dog is at the heart of the film,” Mitchell told Reuters. While the vagaries of beinga film-famous caninemeant that Panda couldn’t be there to accept her award in person, she had her people send in a recorded video of her “accepting” the prize — a shiny red bandana stitched with the words “Palm Dog 2025” in golden thread. “The Love That Remains” producer Anton Mani Svansson explained Panda “doesn’t really know” about the prize, saying of the dog’s bandana that “I guess she will feel good when she has gotten this around her neck.” Past winners of the prestigious prize include Messi, the border collie from Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall,” which in 2023 became the only movie to claim a Palm d’Or and Palm Dog double. In 2019, a pit bull named Brandy owned by Brad Pitt’s character in “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” secured the gong. But the Palm Dog wasn’t the only prize on offer to furry thespians. Pipa, a Jack Russell, and the Podenco mix Lupita earned the Grand Jury Prize for their sandy adventures in “Sirat,” a movie that follows a father’s search for his missing daughterin the Moroccan desert. Director Oliver Laxe picked up the prize in person on behalf of the dogs. Meanwhile, dachshund Hippo received a special “Mutt Moment” prize for his memorable scene in the movie “Pillion,” starring Alexander Skarsgard. Palm Dog founder Toby Rose told Reuters that the dogs truly deserved the recognition alongside the regular stars. “When the camera’s on them and they do whatever their role is, they stand out,” he said.",

    "article_text": "By Sydney Lupkin Musician Billy Joel is seen during his 100th lifetime performance at Madison Square Garden in 2018, in New York.Evan Agostini/Invision/APhide caption Billy Joel canceled the rest of his summer concerts and announced that he has a brain condition called normal pressure hydrocephalus. \"I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding,\" Joel, 76, told fans in a postto social mediaon Friday. The condition has caused problems with Joel's \"hearing, vision and balance,\" according to the statement, and his doctors advised him against performing because it has exacerbated those symptoms. Joel is undergoing physical therapy and says he hopes to return to the stage one day. The condition is treatable, but underdiagnosed, doctors tell NPR. By going public with his diagnosis, the musician could help others, says Dr. Charles Matouk, vice chair of clinical affairs at the department of neurosurgery at Yale School of Medicine. \"Billy Joel is incredibly brave,\" Matouk says. \"More people are going to be alerted to this problem and maybe get the help they need sooner.\" Here are three things to know about normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). In healthy people, the body makes about half a liter of cerebrospinal fluid a day, saysDr. Gayatri Devi, director of Park Avenue Neurology in Manhattan. The fluid has several functions, including cushioning the brain against the hard, bony skull, transporting nutrients and removing waste. Normally, the fluid gets reabsorbed through large veins in the head, but it doesn't always happen that way in people who have normal pressure hydrocephalus. \"What can sometimes happen is there are some narrow bottleneck parts of the system,\" Devi says. \"And sometimes in those areas, you can have some build up over time, as we get older, of proteins and other substances and that causes the fluid to back up.\" This \"sludge\" that causes the buildup isn't well understood, but it isn't part of normal aging, says Matouk of Yale. \"Because your skull is a closed box, the water needs a way out or else pressure's going to build up,\" he says. Despite increased pressure on the brain, it's callednormalpressure hydrocephalus because it happens so slowly that it stays within the normal range, according tothe Cleveland Clinic. The telltale signs of normal pressure hydrocephalus are problems with walking, cognitive symptoms and urinary incontinence. But since patients who have it are usually over 60, they can look like normal signs of aging. \"We all have grandmas and grandpas that have trouble walking because they have bad hips and knees and their back hurts,\" Matouk says. \"Both men and women, as you get older, are going to start having trouble controlling their bladder. … You're going to have trouble with your memory.\" But when all three happen at the same time and progressively get worse, that should be a sign that something is not normal. That said, it doesn't always happen that way. \"What makes things even more complicated is people don't have to have all three,\" Devi says. \"They could just have the urinary problem. They could just have the gait problem. They could just have the memory problem.\" What's more, sometimes the movement problems are misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and the cognitive problems are misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's. (Though Matouk cautions that Alzheimer's dementia is different from the kind of dementia that arises from untreated normal pressure hydrocephalus over time.) Once normal pressure hydrocephalus is suspected, diagnosing it usually involves a CT scan or a brain MRI. Doctors who spoke with NPR said they haven't had difficulty getting insurance to pay for the testing. However, because some radiologists don't know how to spot it, it can be hard to get a diagnosis, says Dr. Ryan Lee, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"It does take some persistence on the part of the person who ordered the test or the family and the patient\" to make sure the images are evaluated by a specialist, he says. The next test is usually a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, in which doctors insert a needle into the spinal canal to collect some spinal fluid. Then they ask the patient and their family members if any symptoms have changed. \"We also have the physical therapist evaluate before and after,\" Lee says, to avoid any kind of placebo effect. To relieve pressure on the brain, doctors perform a surgery that involves drilling a hole into the skull and inserting a shunt into the brain to drain the excess fluid to be absorbed by another part of the body — usually the abdomen. \"Because the fluid is getting made continuously, you need something that continuously drains the fluid,\" says Devi of Park Avenue Neurology. Surgery isn't for everyone and carries risks, like infection, but patients can usually go home the next day, she says. The earlier normal pressure hydrocephalus is caught and treated, the better. The surgery isn't a cure, but \"the response can be really remarkable,\" says Lee of Vanderbilt. \"Patients can go from being in a wheelchair and not able to walk and not able to think very clearly or remember much to being able to walk almost normally and having an improvement in their cognition and quality of life significantly,\" he says. Matouk cautioned that cognitive symptoms tend to improve less dramatically than the other symptoms. Still, Matouk, who is studying anew, less invasive procedurefor these patients, hopes awareness of this condition will help patients advocate for themselves. \"There's very few things in medicine where we can reverse symptoms or improve symptoms, and this is a disease where that's possible,\" he says. \"So, it's a shame if it's missed — and it often is, for months or years, until the correct diagnosis is arrived at.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Departments of motor vehicles across the country are warning of a new batch of scam text messages that seek out recipients' personal information.Mario Tama/Getty Imageshide caption DMVs across the country are warning drivers of a new batch of fake, phishing text messages, designed to scam respondents out of their personal and financial information. The latest round of scam texts have been reported by departments of motor vehicles in at least three states:New York,FloridaandCalifornia. The messageswarn drivers of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threaten steep penalties, including additional fines and suspension of driving privileges if the reader does not comply. But these texts aren't from any official body. They are part of a growing trend of scammers using fear tactics under the guise of an official domain to get people's personal information. These phishing scams by text, otherwise known as \"smishing,\" or SMS phishing, have been on the rise in recent months. Previous rounds of this type of textinvaded users' inboxesearlier this year, with scammers warning of unpaid toll fines and demanding personal information to sort out the nonexistent issue. The proliferation of these smishing messages was such that both theFBIandFederal Trade Commissionintervened, alerting recipients of the con attempts. In April alone, Americans received 19.2 billion automated spam texts — or nearly 63 spam texts for every single person in the country — according to spam-blocking companyRobokiller. And these types of messages go beyond being a mere nuisance. According to the FTC's annualData Book, in 2024, Americans reported losing over $12 billion to fraud — an increase of over $2 billion from the previous year. In order to protect yourself from digital thieves, experts say you should register your phone number to theNational Do Not Call Registry, avoid clicking links from phone numbers you don't recognize, and remain skeptical, especially when personal information is requested.

    "article_text": "Jaclyn Diaz A person holds a Harvard College folder during a tour at Harvard University on April 17 in Cambridge, Mass.Sophie Park/Getty Imageshide caption \"Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\" That's what the nation's oldest and wealthiest private university in the U.S. said in its lawsuit against the Trump administration, which sought to prevent the elite institution from enrolling thousands of international students. A judgequickly blockedthe Trump administration's effort on Friday, and issued a temporary restraining order. The ruling comes as the number of international students at U.S. colleges and universities reached a record high. Here's a look at the impact of international students, by the numbers: In November,Open Doors®2024 Reporton International Educational Exchangeannouncedthat the total number of international students at U.S. colleges and universities reached an all-time high of more than 1.1 million students for the 2023 and 2024 year. This represented a 7% increase from the previous academic year. \"The experience of studying in the United States not only shapes the lives of individuals, but the future of our interconnected world,\" said Scott Weinhold, with the Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in a statement announcing the Open Door findings. \"The ties formed between U.S. and international students today are the basis of relationships for future business and trade, science and innovation, and government relations.\" India sent the most international students to the U.S. for higher education with more than 331,000 students enrolled, according to the 2023-2024 data from Open Doors. China followed as the second leading country of origin with more than 277,000 students, including nearly 123,000 graduate students, studying in the U.S. It's the leading nation for sending undergraduates and non-degree students to the U.S. Combined, India and China account for more than half of all international students in the country. International students contribute not only academic and athletic talent to their campuses but also billions of dollars in economic activity across the nation. According to NAFSA: Association of International Educators,these1.1 million international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs. \"International students' contributions to the U.S. are significant and multi-faceted, and this year's record-breaking economic total is the latest proof of that,\" Fanta Aw, NAFSA executive director and CEO,said in a statement.\"Yet we cannot be complacent. Meanwhile, competition for the world's best and brightest is increasing.\" Aw urged the U.S. government to adopt politics that help attract and retain talent from overseas. \"We cannot afford to lose international students' meaningful positive impact on American students' global competence, our economies, and our communities, particularly in the areas of STEM-related research and innovation,\" Aw said.

    "title": "Justice Department cuts to public safety grants leave police and nonprofits scrambling",
    "article_text": "Martin Kaste Attorney General Pam Bondi listens during a news conference at the Department of Justice on May 7, 2025 in Washington. In late April, the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs cancelled hundreds of public safety grants to local police and nonprofits, leaving many scrambling.Alex Brandon/APhide caption The Justice Department has drastically scaled back its support for anti-crime initiatives across the country, leaving law enforcement agencies and private groups scrambling to try to replace the money. The cuts were announced in late April, and theCouncil on Criminal Justice estimates373 grants were terminated, totaling about $500 million. The sweeping nature of the cuts took many public safety groups by surprise. \"We knew that there were federal cuts coming,\" says Kelsie McDaniel, the district attorney in Union County, Oregon. \"But we didn't think that it would include things that were within the program goals and agency priorities that the DOJ had previously talked about.\" Her office used a federal grant to pay for an investigator to do more in-depth crime investigations, such as building a case against fentanyl dealers whose product had led to fatal overdoses. \"We wouldn't be able to do that without him,\" McDaniel says. \"We thought, well, where other programs might be getting cut, we thought we might actually see an increase in funding.\" Instead, that grant was one of the ones cancelled. Most of the money had already been spent, but she worries that the cancellation means Union County won't be able to get this kind of federal funding again in the future. \"Federal grants allow agencies to really do things that they wouldn't ordinarily otherwise be able to do,\" says Jim Burch, president of the National Policing Institute, which helped distribute many of thegrants to rural law enforcement. He says the sudden cuts, many of them mid-stream, \"could result in layoffs of things like crime analysts and IT professionals. And it could mean that the agency has fewer staff for patrol services.\" Many grant recipients suspect there wasn't much research behind the cuts. \"They don't know what they're doing. They're just pulling things apart,\" says Aqeela Sherrills, co-founder and executive director of theCommunity Based Public Safety Collective, which provides training and assistance to community violence intervention groups — the \"violence interrupter\" model that started in the 1990s. \"Many of these organizations are mostly volunteer, like, kind of small mom and pop agencies,\" Sherrills says. \"But the Biden administration turbocharged community violence intervention as a strategy,\" with the 2022 passage of theBipartisan Safer Communities Act, which dedicated $250 million over five years to this approach. Now the Trump administration is turning off that tap. \"We received a letter on April 22nd basically saying, 'Stop all services,' and 'We are terminating your contract effective immediately,'\" Sherrills says. He says the letter said his organization's grant did not \"align\" with the administration's priorities -- the same explanation in other termination letters. He says his organization is able to keep functioning for now, and its pivoted to showing local community violence intervention groups how to appeal the loss of their grants. \"We're not taking the decision from the Trump administration laying down,\" he says. In response to NPR's request for comment, the Justice Department sent a written statement: \"This Department of Justice is focused on prosecuting criminals, getting illegal drugs off the streets, and protecting all Americans from violent crime. Discretionary funds that are not aligned with the administration's priorities are subject to review and reallocation.\" The statement added that the Department was committed to \"working with\" organizations and to hear appeals to restore funding, \"as appropriate.\" In some cities, self-appointed fiscal watchdogs have complained about a lack of accountability in the way federal grants are spent. In Minneapolis, for instance, attorney Dean Thomson sued the city a couple of years ago to force local violence intervention groups to be more transparent. \"Taxpayers don't know how their funds are being spent because the city didn't know how their funds were being spent,\" Thomson says. \"And who knows whether the funds actually went to violence interruption or not?\" Thomson saysthe city settled with him, promising to require better bookkeeping by violence intervention groups that receive the grants. He says his concern about accountability does not mean he endorses the Trump administration's sweeping cuts. \"I think drastically cutting any program without investigating whether or not it's working is the wrong approach,\" Thomson says. As it happens, that kind of information is increasingly available, according to Thomas Abt, founding director of theViolence Reduction Center, at the University of Maryland, which studies strategies for reducing violent crime. It's preparing to release a major study of the track records of different kinds of programs. \"To do that work, we rely on a vast body of research -- much of which has been funded by the federal government,\" Abt says. It's the kind of information that could have informed decisions about which grants to keep and which to pull, but Abt says he's seen no sign that the administration sought out that information. \"You would think that making a policy change this dramatic and this abruptly, that there would be some consultation before doing so. But in fact, there wasn't,\" he says. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

I first met him at The Second City in Chicago, where he was already being typecast in bits as paunchy cops and roly-poly city council members. But he was best known from the TV showCheers, about a bar where everybody knew his character's name: \"Norm!\" \"What would you say to a beer, Normie?\" asks Sam the bartender. \"Daddy wuvs you,\" Norm replies. George Wendt appeared on every episode ofCheers, over eleven seasons, and was nominated for six consecutive Emmys for his work on the show.

    "title": "Trump's debunked 'burial site' video reopens 'wounds,' says victim's son",
    "article_text": "By Kate Bartlett US President Donald Trump, right, and Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, second right, as a video plays during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, May 21, 2025.Bloomberg/Getty imageshide caption JOHANNESBURG — President Trump claims a \"genocide\" of white people, particularly Afrikaner farmers, is taking place in South Africa. When he met the country's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in theOval Office on Wednesday, Trump played him a video — previously shared at least twice on social media byhis advisor Elon Musk— that he said was evidence of this. \"Now this is very bad, those are burial sites right there. Burial sites. Over a thousand. Of white farmers,\"Trump said,  \"I've never seen anything like it.\" The video showed a road lined on either side with scores of white crosses and a procession of cars carrying mourners paying their respects. A startled Ramaphosa asked Trump where the location was, saying he'd never seen the video before. South Africa, replied Trump. It was indeed a video taken in South Africa, in KwaZulu-Natal province. But, it was not a burial site. \"My parents Glen and Vida Rafferty weremurdered, or gunned down, by six men on their farm in 2020, so those crosses were erected as a memorial on the day of their funeral,\" Nathan Rafferty told NPR. Rafferty, a white South African who now lives in Brisbane, Australia, explained the \"local community used it as a means of protest and to pay tribute.\" Contrary to Trump's claims, no bodies were ever buried along that road and the white crosses don't mark graves. Asked on Thursday if the president got it wrong, White House press secretary Karoline Leavittgave this explanation. \"What's unsubstantiated about the video? The video shows crosses that represent the dead bodies of people who were racially persecuted by their government,\" she said. The crosses didn't represent a specific number of farm murder victims, they were a symbolic tribute to the murdered couple. During the meeting, Trump also held up a printout of a blog post showing a photo taken byReuters, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mistakenly claiming it was taken in South Africa. Rafferty said he was shocked when he saw the video shown in the Oval Office meeting. \"The last thing you expect to see are some of the most traumatic parts of your life shown on international TV. So it was totally unexpected,\" he said. \"It obviously opened several new wounds.\" The assailants had been planning to rob his parents, according to news reports at the time. Though they had aimed to get into the safe, in the end, they only stole a car and a few items of little value. While many murders in South Africa remain unsolved, three of the Rafferty's murderers were tried and two of them were sentenced to life imprisonment. NPR asked Rafferty what he thought about the white \"genocide\" suggestion from the Trump administration. \"Do I think that there's a targeted genocide program of some sort?\" he said. \"No I don't.\" However, Rafferty said he thinks much more needs to be done to prevent and condemn what are sometimes brutal attacks. \"I never went farming because I was fearful of the tinderbox that it is, despite having four generations of farmers in my family,\" he added. South Africa's government doesn't deny the country suffers some of thehighest crime ratesin the world. Members of Ramaphosa's delegation to Washington were frank about this being a huge problem. On Friday, South Africa released itsquarterly crime statistics.These are not usually broken down by race, but given Trump's attacks, police said they were making an exception. From January to March 2025, six people were killed on farms in South Africa, police said. Out of those six, one was white. \"The history of farm murders in the country has always been distorted and reported in an unbalanced way; the truth is that farm murders have always included African people in more numbers,\" said Police Minister Senzo Mchunu, referring to Black Africans. Mchunu also spoke about the Rafferty case, during which the couple \"were sadly murdered by criminals in their home.\" \"The incident sparked a very strong protest by the farming community in the area. The crosses symbolized killings on farms over years, they are not graves,\" Mchunu said. \"And it was unfortunate that those facts got twisted to fit a false narrative about crime in South Africa.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "200 mph for 500 miles: How IndyCar drivers prepare for the big race",
    "article_text": "Andretti Global's Kyle Kirkwood and Marcus Ericsson talk to us about the Indy 500. This coming weekend is a special one for most motorsport fans. There are Formula 1 races in Monaco and NASCAR races in Charlotte. And arguably towering over them both is the Indianapolis 500, being held this year for the 109th time. America's oldest race is also one of its toughest: The track may have just four turns, but the cars negotiate them going three times faster than you drive on the highway, inches from the wall. For hours. At least at Le Mans, you have more than one driver per car. This year's race promises to be an exciting one. The track is sold out for the first timesince the centenary race in 2016. A rookie driver and a team new to the series took pole position. Two very fast cars arestarting at the backthanks toanother conflict-of-interestscandal involving Team Penske, the second in two years for a team whose owner also owns the track and the series. And the cars are trickier to drive than they have been for many years, thanks to a new supercapacitor-based hybrid system that has added more than 100 lbs to the rear of the car, shifting the weight distribution further back. Ahead of Sunday's race, I spoke with a couple of IndyCar drivers and some engineers to get a better sense of how they prepare and what to expect. It all comes \"from months of preparation,\" said Marcus Ericsson, winner of the race in 2022 and one of Andretti Global's drivers in this year's event. \"When we get here to the month of May, it's just such a busy month. So you've got to be prepared mentally—and basically before you get to the month of May because if you start doing it now, it's too late,\" he told me. The drivers spend all month at the track, with a race on the road course earlier this month. Then there's testing on the historic oval, followed by qualifying last weekend and the race this coming Sunday. \"So all those hours you put in in the winter, really, and leading up here to the month of May—it's what pays off now,\" Ericsson said. That work involved multiple sessions of physical training each week, and Ericsson says he also does weekly mental coaching sessions. \"This is a mental challenge,\" Ericsson told me. \"Doing those speeds with our cars, you can't really afford to have a split second of loss of concentration because then you might be in the wall and your day is over and you might hurt yourself.\" When drivers get tired or their focus slips, that's when mistakes happen, and a mistake at Indy often has consequences. Being mentally and physically prepared is part of it. It also helps if you can roll the race car off the transporter and onto the track with a setup that works rather than spending the month chasing the right combination of dampers, springs, wing angles, and so on. And these days, that means a lot of simulation testing. Themulti-axis driver in the loop simulatorsmight look like just a very expensive video game, but these multimillion-dollar setups aren't about having fun. \"Everything that you are feeling or changing in the sim is ultimately going to reflect directly to what happens on track,\" explained Kyle Kirkwood, teammate to Ericsson at Andretti Global and one of only two drivers to have won an Indycar race in 2025. Andretti, like the other teams using Honda engines, uses thenew HRC simulator in Indiana. \"And yes, it's a very expensive asset, but it's also likely cheaper than going to the track and doing the real thing,\" Kirkwood said. \"And it's a much more controlled environment than being at the track because temperature changes or track conditions or wind direction play a huge factor with our car.\" A high degree of correlation between the simulation and the track is what makes it a powerful tool. \"We run through a sim, and you only get so many opportunities, especially at a place like Indianapolis, where you go from one day to the next and the temperature swings, or the wind conditions, or whatever might change drastically,\" Kirkwood said. \"You have to be able to sim it and be confident with the sim that you're running to go out there and have a similar balance or a similar performance.\" \"So you have to make adjustments, whether it's a spring rate, whether it's keel ballast or just overall, maybe center of pressure, something like that,\" Kirkwood said. \"You have to be able to adjust to it. And that's where the sim tool comes in play. You move the weight balance back, and you're like, OK, now what happens with the balance? How do I tune that back in? And you run that all through the sim, and for us, it's been mirror-perfect going to the track when we do that.\" More impressively, a lot of that work was done months ago. \"I would say most of it, we got through it before the start of this season,\" Kirkwood said. \"Once we get into the season, we only get a select few days because every Honda team has to run on the same simulator. Of course, it's different with the engineering sim; those are running nonstop.\" An IndyCar team is more than just its drivers—\"the spacer between the seat and the wheel,\" according to Kirkwood—and the engineers rely heavily on sim work now that real-world testing is so highly restricted. And they use a lot more than just driver-in-the-loop (DiL). \"Digital simulation probably goes to a higher level,\" explained Scott Graves, engineering manager at Andretti Global. \"A lot of the models we develop work in the DiL as well as our other digital tools. We try to develop universal models, whether that's tire models, engine models, or transmission models.\" \"Once you get into to a fully digital model, then I think your optimization process starts kicking in,\" Graves said. \"You're not just changing the setting and running a pretend lap with a driver holding a wheel. You're able to run through numerous settings and optimization routines and step through a massive number of permutations on a car. Obviously, you're looking for better lap times, but you're also looking for fuel efficiency and a lot of other parameters that go into crossing the finish line first.\" As an example, Graves points to the dampers. \"The shock absorber is a perfect example where that's a highly sophisticated piece of equipment on the car and it's very open for team development. So our cars have fully customized designs there that are optimized for how we run the car, and they may not be good on another team's car because we're so honed in on what we're doing with the car,\" he said. \"The more accurate a digital twin is, the more we are able to use that digital twin to predict the performance of the car,\" said David Taylor, VP of industry strategy at Siemens DISW, which has partnered with Andretti for some years now. \"It will never be as complete and accurate as we want it to be. So it's a continuous pursuit, and we keep adding technology to our portfolio and acquiring companies to try to provide more and more tools to people like Scott so they can more accurately predict that performance.\" Kirkwood was bullish about his chances despite starting relatively deep in the field, qualifying in 23rd place. \"We've been phenomenal in race trim and qualifying,\" he said. \"We had a bit of a head-scratcher if I'm being honest—I thought we would definitely be a top-six contender, if not a front row contender, and it just didn't pan out that way on Saturday qualifying.\" \"But we rolled back out on Monday—the car was phenomenal. Once again, we feel very, very racy in traffic, which is a completely different animal than running qualifying,\" Kirkwood said. \"So I'm happy with it. I think our chances are good. We're starting deep in the field, but so are a lot of other drivers. So you can expect a handful of us to move forward.\" The more nervous hybrid IndyCars with their more rearward weight bias will probably result in more cautions, according to Ericsson, who will line up sixth for the start of the race on Sunday. \"Whereas in previous years you could have a bit of a moment and it would scare you, you usually get away with it,\" he said. \"This year, if you have a moment, it usually ends up with you being in the fence. I think that's why we've seen so many crashes this year—because a pendulum effect from the rear of the car that when you start losing it, this is very, very difficult or almost impossible to catch.\" \"I think it's going to mean that the race is going to be quite a few incidents with people making mistakes,\" Ericsson said. \"In practice, if your car is not behaving well, you bring it to the pit lane, right? You can do adjustments, whereas in the race, you have to just tough it out until the next pit stop and then make some small adjustments. So if you have a bad car at the start a race, it's going to be a tough one. So I think it's going to be a very dramatic and entertaining race.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Penguin poop may help preserve Antarctic climate",
    "article_text": "Ammonia aerosols from penguin guano likely play a part in the formation of heat-shielding clouds. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. New research shows that penguin guano in Antarctica is an important source of ammonia aerosol particles that help drive the formation and persistence of low clouds, which cool the climate by reflecting some incoming sunlight back to space. The findings reinforce the growing awareness that Earth’s intricate web of life plays a significant role in shaping the planetary climate. Even at the small levels measured, the ammonia particles from the guano interact with sulfur-based aerosols from ocean algae to start a chemical chain reaction that forms billions of tiny particles that serve as nuclei for water vapor droplets. The low marine clouds that often cover big tracts of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica are a wild card in the climate system because scientists don’t fully understand how they will react to human-caused heating of the atmosphere and oceans. One recent study suggested that the big increase in the annual global temperature during 2023 and 2024 that has continued into this year wascaused in part by a reduction of that cloud cover. “I’m constantly surprised at the depth of how one small change affects everything else,” said Matthew Boyer, a coauthor of the new study and an atmospheric scientist at the University of Helsinki’s Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research. “This really does show that there is a deep connection between ecosystem processes and the climate. And really, it’s the synergy between what’s coming from the oceans, from the sulfur-producing species, and then the ammonia coming from the penguins.” Aquatic penguins evolved from flying birds about 60 million years ago, shortly after the age of dinosaurs, and have persisted through multiple, slow, natural cycles of ice ages and warmer interglacial eras, surviving climate extremes by migrating to and from pockets of suitable habitat, called climate refugia, saidRose Foster-Dyer,a marine and polar ecologist with the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. A 2018studythat analyzed the remains of an ancient “super colony” of the birds suggests there may have been a “penguin optimum” climate window between about 4,000 and 2,000 years ago, at least for some species in some parts of Antarctica, she said. Various penguin species have adapted to different habitat niches and this will face different impacts caused by human-caused warming, she said. Foster-Dyer has recently done penguin research around the Ross Sea, and said that climate change could open more areas for land-breeding Adélie penguins, which don’t breed on ice like some other species. “There’s evidence that this whole area used to have many more colonies … which could possibly be repopulated in the future,” she said. She is also more optimistic than some scientists about the future for emperor penguins, the largest species of the group, she added. “They breed on fast ice, and there’s a lot of publications coming out about how the populations might be declining and their habitat is hugely threatened,” she said. “But they’ve lived through so many different cycles of the climate, so I think they’re more adaptable than people currently give them credit for.” In total, about 20 million breeding pairs of penguins nest in vast colonies all around the frozen continent. Some of the largest colonies, with up to 1 million breeding pairs, can cover several square miles.There aren’t any solid estimates for the total amount of guano produced by the flightless birds annually, but some studies have found that individual colonies can produce several hundred tons. Several new penguin colonies were discovered recently when their droppings were spotted in detailed satellite images. A few penguin colonies have grown recently while others appear to be shrinking, but in general, their habitat is considered threatened by warming and changing ice conditions, which affects their food supplies. The speed of human-caused warming, for which there is no precedent in paleoclimate records, may exacerbate the threat to penguins, which evolve slowly compared to many other species, Foster-Dyer said. “Everything’s changing at such a fast rate, it’s really hard to say much about anything,” she said. Recent research has shown how other types of marine life are alsoimportant to the global climate system. Nutrients from bird droppings helpfertilize blooms of oxygen-producing plankton, and huge swarms of fish that live in the middle layers of the oceancycle carbon vertically through the water, ultimately depositing it in a generally stable sediment layer on the seafloor. Boyer said the new research started as a follow-up project to other studies of atmospheric chemistry in the same area, near the Argentine Marambio Base on an island along the Antarctic Peninsula. Observations by other teams suggested it could be worth specifically trying to look at ammonia, he said. Boyer and the other scientists set up specialized equipment to measure the concentration of ammonia in the air from January to March 2023. They found that, when the wind blew from the direction of a colony of about 60,000 Adélie penguins about 5 miles away, the ammonia concentration increased to as high as 13.5 parts per billion—more than 1,000 times higher than the background reading. Even after the penguins migrated from the area toward the end of February, the ammonia concentration was still more than 100 times as high as the background level. “We have one instrument that we use in the study to give us the chemistry of gases as they’re actually clustering together,” he said. “In general, ammonia in the atmosphere is not well-measured because it’s really difficult to measure, especially if you want to measure at a very high sensitivity, if you have low concentrations like in Antarctica,” he said. The goal was to determine where the ammonia is coming from, including testing a previous hypothesis that the ocean surface could be the source, he said. But the size of the penguin colonies made them the most likely source. “It’s well known that sea birds give off ammonia. You can smell them. The birds stink,” he said. “But we didn’t know how much there was. So what we did with this study was to quantify ammonia and to quantify its impact on the cloud formation process.” The scientists had to wait until the wind blew from the penguin colony toward the research station. “If we’re lucky, the wind blows from that direction and not from the direction of the power generator,” he said. “And we were lucky enough that we had one specific event where the winds from the penguin colony persisted long enough that we were actually able to track the growth of the particles. You could be there for a year, and it might not happen.” The ammonia from the guano does not form the particles but supercharges the process that does, Boyer said. “It’s really the dimethyl sulfide from phytoplankton that gives off the sulfur,” he said. “The ammonia enhances the formation rate of particles. Without ammonia, sulfuric acid can form new particles, but with ammonia, it’s 1,000 times faster, and sometimes even more, so we’re talking up to four orders of magnitude faster because of the guano.” This is important in Antarctica specifically because there are not many other sources of particles, such as pollution or emissions from trees, he added. “So the strength of the source matters in terms of its climate effect over time,” he said. “And if the source changes, it’s going to change the climate effect.” It will take more research to determine if penguin guano has a net cooling effect on the climate. But in general, he said, if the particles transport out to sea and contribute to cloud formation, they will have a cooling effect. “What’s also interesting,” he said, “is if the clouds are over ice surfaces, it could actually lead to warming because the clouds are less reflective than the ice beneath.” In that case, the clouds could actually reduce the amount of heat that brighter ice would otherwise reflect away from the planet. The study did not try to measure that effect, but it could be an important subject for future research, he added. The guano effect lingers even after the birds leave the breeding areas. A month after they were gone, Boyer said ammonia levels in the air were still 1,000 times higher than the baseline. “The emission of ammonia is a temperature-dependent process, so it’s likely that once wintertime comes, the ammonia gets frozen in,” he said. “But even before the penguins come back, I would hypothesize that as the temperature warms, the guano starts to emit ammonia again. And the penguins move all around the coast, so it’s possible they’re just fertilizing an entire coast with ammonia.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

The definitive, “Master Crafted Edition” of the third-person shooter comes of port developer SneakyBox. Producer Vaidas Mikelskas described the update as a “thoughtful restoration […] a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players.” Along with graphical updates and a modern UI and control scheme, this newSpace Marineprovides a visual update to the Orks to make them more in line with their current visual identity in the franchise canon, and “over 100” new voice lines. Originally developed by Relic Entertainment, the firstÂSpace MarineÂreleased in 2011 to generally positive reviews. It had two planned sequels, but those fell apart when the game’s publisher THQ closed down. Sega subsequently gained its publishing rights upon acquiring Relic two years later, and re-released the game on PC back in 2021. Later that year, Saber Interactive revealed it would develop the sequel for publisher Focus Entertainment, which released to pretty strong reviews in 2024 and has its own followup in the works.

    "article_text": "Earlier this year, we gotFrank Castleback on our TVs, and now it’s time for the Punisher to make a return to comics, too. Marvel’s gun-toting antihero is coming back to the page inPunisher: Red Band,Âa five-issue miniseries fromBen Percy(Wolverine)Â and Julius Ohta (Iron Man).ÂThe last time we saw Frank was back in 2023 when hetook control of the Handninja cult, learned his wife wasalive and wanted a divorce, and was later sent to Weirdworld. This new comic sees Frank back in New York without any memories of his past life, but still good at taking lives, so that’s what he’s gonna do. Much like his TV counterpart, this Frank is gonna get up to some bloody stuff, and his miniseries comes with a “Red Band” label to signify it’s got more explicit content than usual. “Frank Castle is one of my all-time favorite characters, andPunisheris a series Iâve been gunning to write for a long, long time,” wrotePercy. “Iâm going to lean in fully and push the very limits of my favorite genre: hairy psychopaths. This is going to be as gritty and bloody as it gets. Street-level mayhem awaits you.” Marvel has often seemed uncertain about what to do with Frank. Some of that was owed to his Netflix series and the timing of a heavily armed vigilante in a show airing weeks or months aftermass shootings; other times, it was because of how police hadco-opted his symboland used it to decorate their vehicles.Daredevil: Born AgainÂconfronted that latter point during its first season by having Frank kill a bunch of Punisher cops and telling them they suck.

    "title": "Govee’s Pixel Lights Make My Dumb Gamer Brain a Little Too Happy",
    "article_text": "The bare walls of my bedroomâbedecked as they are with sporadic small prints but devoid of lightsâdemand I add some flair to my usually nerdy living space. The Govee Gaming Pixel Light seemed to fit the bill a little too well when Isaw it back at CES 2025. The specialized display doesn’t support enough colors to show all my favorite 8- or 16-bit artwork at their best quality, and it won’t produce strong enough audio for anything more complicated than classic chiptunes. If the digital art and speaker for my desk didnât sport cringey decals and a frame that would make visitors assume I chugged Mountain Dew Game Fuel for breakfast, it would be the perfect antidote to my dull apartment. Govee sent me a pair of pre-release Gaming Pixel Lights long before the company finally made them available on May 19. It sat on my desk for ages, showing me a 32-pixel version of Samus fromSuper Metroid.Her staunch, visored visage helped me get through the hectic days. Both the$120 32×32and $14052×32 pixel framesdonât take much effort to set up, though the digital wall or desk art lacks a battery and needs to be plugged into an outlet. Once it’s connected through the Govee Home app, youâll have a wide variety of default and user-made effects to add to the screen. Yes, you can stick a static image on the screen, but the real fun comes from displaying GIFs of scenes from your favorite 8-, 16-, or perhaps a few 32-bit retro games. Govee Gaming Pixel Light It does what it needs to do, but limited colors limits what it can show. Pros Cons Depending on how complicated your image is, the pixel light may have a harder time displaying every pixel with perfect color accuracy. The smaller device contains 1,024 lights, while the 52×32 version sports 1,664. The $155Divoom Pixoo-64âa competing pixel light with a 64×64 pixel fieldâsupports 4,096. Considering the limited lights, a 32×32 pixel image of ET might look great on the smaller Pixel Light, but a fan-made 8-bit portrait of Arielle fromThe Little Mermaidthat appears fine on my phone lacked the color definition necessary to show fine features on her nose or hair. The more stark the colors, the better each image or GIF will appear. The screen is bright enough on its highest settings, but you can set it to dim or turn off on a timer if you want to sleep without a rainbow of pixelated light shining at you. Images look marginally better on the larger display thanks to its wider range of colors, but youâll still need to try out various images until you find one that fits your style. You can also upload your own artwork to the Govee app, though any of your photos you take from your phone will turn out splotchy and incoherent on the Pixel Light. You may find that uploading your own pixel art could produce mixed results. I had to try several different versions of Samus before I found a Metroid image that didnât look half bad. The GIFs play at 30 fps, which made a GIF of Sonicâs classic spinning leg running animation look extra smooth. Divoom’s similar offering runs at 24 fps. The device includes a rear 3W DSP speaker made for pairing your favorite chiptunes with this artwork. The built-in speakers arenât enough to fill a room with sound, but even without much bass, it’s just enough to offer a retro feel, as if I was listening to a game on the age-old mono Game Boy speaker. The device itself has a single button for controlling volume and no physical mute button, which means youâre forced to load into the app just to adjust your sound. All this meant I was more likely to eschew music entirely. After all, if youâre planning to use your Govee Pixel Light to spruce up your gaming room, youâll end up listening to the game youâre playing anyway. If youâre the type to pick up a brush, you could create your own art and animated GIFs with the sketch mode. Itâs certainly easier to use with a stylus, but I donât have the time, patience, or ability to sketch something that will look any nicer than the artists who do pixel art for a living. The device has almost too many modes, from a clock feature to a stock ticker. Thereâs even a counter to tell you the current price of bitcoin, as if you really need to pay attention to crypto prices on your fun, cute pixel monitor. The Pixel Light seems to think gamers want a very specific aesthetic, one full of cyberpunk-esque hard-edged contours with decals reading âloadingâ and âgame.â A black frame is all I really need. The art is the reason you buy Goveeâs first real gamer product. But damn me if I enjoy it blaring the Magmar Caverns theme from my desktop, as if my bedroom had any more need for even more Metroid artwork.

    "article_text": "AfterAndor,people wantStar WarsÂto take morecreativeor thematic swings. And according to Ryan Reynolds, a real big swing for the series would be a foray into R-rated material. In a recent episode ofTheBox Officepodcast, the star of Marvel’sDeadpoolmovies revealed he had pitched such a thing to Disney not too long ago, saying, “Why donât we do an R-ratedStar Warsproperty?” The way he describes it, this was more of a soft pitch for anything rather than a specific idea, but he suggested it wouldn’t need “A+ characters” or that it be “vulgar. [I mean] R-rated as a Trojan horse for emotion. I always wonder why studios donât want to just gamble on something like that.” Most importantly, this isn’t something he’s suggesting himself to star in. He doesn’t think he’s a good fit for the franchise, but he’d be open to producing or writing such a project. To Reynolds’ point,ÂStar WarsÂhas generally existed in a family-friendly capacity its whole life, to the point its first PG-13 movie wasRevenge of the SithÂback in 2005. Across the franchise, violence has been censored after a certain point on screen, and its approach to sex has been all the place implicitly, but only recently got into moreexplicit territorywithÂAndorandThe Acolyte. It’s not a question of if the franchise should dip its toes into more adult territory, but whether Disney will let it, and how the wider world will react if it does. Whatever form any R-rated material takes, itwillÂbe talked about, for better and worse. [viaThe Hollywood Reporter] Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Rising Seas Could Displace Millions, Triggering Global Migration Crisis, Study Warns",
    "article_text": "Sea level rise will force millions of people to flee coastal regions, even at just 1.5 degrees Celsius of global heating, according to a new study. The authors of the study warn that even current warming levels could lead to multiple feet of sea level rise by the end of the century, posing dire consequences for coast-dwellers. The study, published in the journalCommunications Earth and Environment, suggests that even at 1.2 degrees C above the pre-industrial averageâour current average level of warmingâcould lead to catastrophic sea level rise and mass migration. If current trends persist, âYouâre going to see massive land migration on scales that weâve never witnessed since modern civilization,â Jonathan Bamber, study co-author and glaciologist at the University of Bristol, toldCNN. Seas will rise due to the rapid loss of ice sheets from Greenland and Antarctica, which has quadrupled since the 1990s and is now the biggest source of sea level rise. In the study, a team of scientists from the U.K. and the U.S. used evidence from warm periods up to 3 million years ago, recent trends in ice loss, and climate models to predict future ice sheet change under several climate scenarios. Looking back, they found that about 15,000 years ago, at the end of the last Ice Age, the rate of sea level rise was 10-fold greater than it is today. The last time carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were as high as today, about 3 million years ago, the sea level was 33 to 66 feet (10 to 20 meters) above where it is now. Multiple meters of sea level rise are in our future even if we rapidly and drastically cut back on fossil fuels to hit the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial average, the authors found. That target, which was thought to be the best way to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, has almost slipped away. Alarmingly, the new study finds that 1.2 degrees C would generate several meters of sea level rise. The safe limit, the authors found, is likely below 1 degree C. The researchers said that more research is needed to determine the actual tipping point. Weâre currently on track for up to 2.9 degrees Celsius of global heating, at which point itâs pretty much a certainty that ice sheets in Greenland and west Antarctica will completely collapse. The melting of those ice sheets would cause 40 feet (12 meters) of sea level rise. Currently, one billion people live within 32 feet of sea level and around 230 million people live within 3 feet of sea level. âPeople need to be aware that sea level rise is likely to accelerate to rates that are very difficult to adapt toârates of one centimeter per year are not out of the question within the lifetime of our young people,” Chris Stokes, a climate scientist at Durham University and lead author of the study, said in astatement. The average global temperature hit 1.5 degrees C for the first time last year, although it hasnât quite hit the 1.5 degrees C average yet. Thereâs still time to do something about all of this, though. The authors urge immediate, urgent climate action to slow the worst impacts of sea level riseâevery inch counts. âWe are not necessarily saying that all is lost at 1.5 degrees C, but we are saying that every fraction of a degree really matters for the ice sheetsâand the sooner we can halt the warming the better, because this makes it far easier to return to safer levels further down the line,â Stokes said in astatement. rising sea level Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Back in my day, the phrase used to be “there’s an app for that,” and that’s still the case, though with one major amendment: now, it’s “there’s anAIÂapp for that.” In fact, there’s even an AI app for making appsâbuckle up, kiddos, things are about to get meta. Let me explain:Rork, which I stumbled acrosswhile scrolling X, isâif we are to drink the Kool-Aidâthe app to end all apps. The font from which all other apps may flow. The cold fusion of coding. Alright, I’m exaggerating, but it’s exactly what I alluded to: an app that makes apps, which is like a hat on a hat if the first hat actually made the second hat. To make things even more meta, Rork used an AI ad withGoogle’s new Veo 3 video generatorto promote its tool. Is your head spinning yet? Mine kind of is. When I say Rork makes apps, I mean it really makes the damn thing (at least I think it does since I wouldn’t know a functional piece of code if it sat on my chest and suffocated me like a sleep paralysis demon). But on the surface, it does the whole thing. I went to the web version of Rork to try it out (there’s no mobile app that I’m aware of), and it seemingly took my text prompt, “I want to make an app that matches me with similar-sized people in my area to fight. Like Tinder but for fisticuffs,” and ran with it. Introducing Rork 1.0 Make any mobile app you want, save it to your phone or share it with the world â in minutes. Powered by Claude 4.

And I mean everythingâcolors, features, parameters, basically every aspect of an app that you might need to launch. And the conjuring doesn’t stop there. Once everything is devised, Rork’s interface splits everything off into packages if you want to look at the code (that is, if you’re capable of reading it, unlike me), and then it does my favorite partâit generates a usable preview that you can test on your phone or another device. After the AI had coded everything, I was able to scan a QR code and generate a preview using ExpoGo, a tool that lets you deploy code in a preview mode. So, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: FightMatch, Tinder for kicking ass. It’s worth noting that I tried to make this even more meta by prompting Rork to make an app that uses generative AI to make images or videoâan AI app that generates AIâbut it ran into some issues that I wasn’t able to fully wrap my head around. Per Rork, they were “critical errors,” and even when I clicked the “fix” button, it wouldn’t budge. No AI app inception today, folks, sorry. On one hand, as someone with no coding experience, I’m impressed. Rork, as promised, was able to take my very simple text prompt (Tinder for fighting) and write up all the code to make it happen in about a minute or so. Again, a coder I am not, but that feels pretty extraordinary from a sheer idea to preview perspective. I’m fairly certain whatever Rork and Claude generated wouldn’t be enough to push to an app store right away, both from a technical and aesthetic perspective, but as a first draft, it’s at least serviceable, if very far from perfect. Also, if I’m being honest, I was looking for more of a Fight Club-type app over MMA, but I suppose Claude played this one safe. There’s obviously vast potential here to expedite app creation, but just like with every generative tool like this, there’s also potential for something less excitingâslop. Like I wrote earlier this week, tools like Google’s Veo 3 andFloware impressive technical feats, but they also feel primed to further bloat an already overwhelming bucket of AI slop. There’s always that question: do we needmoreÂapps or do we needÂbetterÂapps? I’m a proponent of the latter philosophy, but if there’s one thing I’ve come to expect in the tech world, it’smore.ÂBut hey, if I get rich quick with FightMatch, I can’t really complain, can I? And if you disagree, swipe right, and let’s settle this the old-fashioned way. AIapps Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Ive and fellow iPhone vets will have a say on ChatGPT development, though they still wonât tell us what the hell theyâre making. Google says its video generation tools, Flow and Veo 3, are enough to turn you, a lowly human, into a filmmaker, but that's more than debatable. The company's annual Build conference was disrupted by a series of protests denouncing Microsoft's ties with Israel. Is it good when a defense contractor talks about the \"cleansing function\" of war? 10 of the 15 books on the list are completely fake. After Holocaust denial and claims of white genocide, I don't think Grok is the AI model you want to associate with right now.

    "title": "Researchers Claim Ancient Chinese Star Catalog Is the Oldest of Its Kind—But Not Everyone’s Convinced",
    "article_text": "Humans have been stargazing for thousandsâpossibly hundreds of thousands of years. Ancient people around the globe looked to the heavens for physical and spiritual guidance. Dozens and dozens of generations later, their descendants are now arguing over which civilization created the oldest known visual star catalog in the world. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ National Astronomical Observatories claim that Shiâs Star Catalog, the oldest known star catalog in China, is actually the earliest known star catalog, period. They reached this conclusion using a technique that accounts for potential human errors made thousands of years ago. If their results prove to be true, it would mean that Shiâs Star Catalog is centuries older than the other first place contenderâtheonecreated by Greek astronomer Hipparchus. But not everyone in the scientific community is convinced. “In comparison to the observation epochs of other ancient star catalogs worldwide, the Shiâs Star Catalog predates even the oldest Western star catalogs, affirming its status as the oldest star catalog in the world,” the researchers wrote in astudyposted to the preprint server arXiv in April. Because Earth’s axis wobbles, the location of stars in the night sky changes over the centuries in a phenomenon calledprecession. Researchers can use Earth’s precession to date ancient visual star catalogs by calculating the difference between historical records of the night sky and what our stars look like now. Shiâs Star Catalog, however, has been infamously difficult to date, not least because this one catalog depicts star positions that seem to span multiple centuries. In the preprint study, the researchers outline a number of previously suggested dates: around 360 BCE; around 360 BCE with an update around 200 CE; around 440 BCE with an update around 160 CE; sometime between 100 BCE and 70 BCE; and during the seventh century CE. “A multitude of perspectives exist regarding the observational timeframe of the Shiâs Star Catalog, with no definitive consensus reached,” the researchers admitted. As such, they decided to analyze the catalog’s 120 stars with the Generalized Hough Transform methodâan algorithmic imaging technique that “statistically accommodates errors in ancient coordinates and discrepancies between ancient and modern stars, addressing limitations in prior methods,” they explained. This approach seems to confirm that Shi’s Star Catalog was first drafted around 355 BCE and then updated around 125 CE. “In comparison, the Western traditionâs oldest known catalog, the Ptolemaic Star Catalog (2nd century CE), likely derives from the Hipparchus Star Catalog (2nd century BCE). Thus, Shiâs Star Catalog is identified as the worldâs oldest known star catalog,” they added. Some scientists, however, have a different theory: The instrument used to record Shiâs Star Catalog was off by one degree. Previous studies adjusting for this assumption date Shiâs Star Catalog around or after 103 BCE, as reported byScience. Certain historians look favorably on this later date because it aligns the catalog’s use of spherical coordinates more closely with the Chinese invention of thearmillary sphere(a spherical mathematical instrument used to track the movement of celestial bodies around Earth) and their adoption of a spherical cosmological model, both of which took place in the first century BCE, according to Science. Suggesting that people used spherical coordinates hundreds of years before the invention of the armillary sphere, as the researchers do in the recent study, would be like finding “a receipt from a gas station and somebody wants to say itâs from 1700,” Daniel Patrick Morgan, a historian at Franceâs Center for Research on East Asian Civilizations who was not involved with the study, told Science. Future research may provide more answers. Whether or not the recent study proves to be true, it’s worth noting that the Western world’s Eurocentric approach has historically undervalued achievements made elsewhere, including those in ancient China. Plus, the ancient Babylonian seventh century BCE AstronomicalDiariesblow both European and Asian astronomical artifacts out of the water, even though the tablets list astronomical observations via text, not visuals. ancient ChinaAstronomystars Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. New weekend, new F1 race. If you’re a fan, you’re looking for a free channel that streams the Formula 1 Monaco GP. Rightfully so â overpriced subscriptions aren’t ideal if you want to save money and keep up with F1 races simultaneously. The good news is that you can watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free with a bit of effort. There’s a handyfree channel that broadcasts it in Full HD. This guide will explain how to access it worldwide and stream the event. We won’t keep you waiting. The channel you’re looking for is calledSRF. SRF is a Swiss-based TV channel known for broadcasting a vibrant palette of sports events. It’s also aplace where you can watch MotoGP races for free. This weekend, it’ll broadcast the F1 Monaco GP live, as well. Since it’s a Swiss TV channel, it has a few issues. For example, it’s accessible only in Switzerland and doesn’t come with English commentary. On the other hand,it’s accessible without an account, so that’s great. As you can see above, the free live stream of the F1 Monaco GP will be onSRF Zwei(link:https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/live/srf-zwei?tvLiveId=c49c1d64-9f60-0001-1c36-43c288c01a10). This is the GP race, however, SRF also displays the qualifying if you’re interested. Stream the Monaco GP for free with NordVPN Okay, so SRF is exclusive to Switzerland â is there a workaround? Yes. Swiss residents abroad oftenswap their IP addresses for Swiss ones. With a Swiss IP, SRF detects that the user is located in Switzerland. This results in effortless access regardless of the user’s actual location. According to F1 fans worldwide,NordVPN fits the bill. It’s a famous VPN service with thousands of global servers, many of which are in Switzerland. Moreover, the VPN supplies applications for all devices. This eases the process of watching the F1 Monaco GP on a free channel, or any other Grand Prix for that matter. The user can install NordVPN,connect to a server in Switzerland, and use SRF even in Europe, the USA, Asia, etc. NordVPN is a paid VPN, but that’s no issue. It comes with anon-conditional 30-day money-back guaranteeto set things straight. This is, in a way, aNordVPN free trialthat you can use it for this purpose, cancel it, and obtain a refund if you don’t need it anymore. The same principle applies tounblocking other restricted content. With unlimited bandwidth and market-leading speeds, users have reported nothing but pure enjoyment in streaming, gaming, and other online activities. Yes, it’ll be on F1 TV Pro as well, but as you likely know, it’s a subscription service. This means it’s a paid channel, too, and unfortunately, it does cost a lot.F1 TV Pro is also unavailable in some countriesâ keep that in mind. Generally speaking, all subscription services, especially those sports-related, tend to be pricey. While SRF’s lack of English commentary is evident, it’s still the best option to watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free. Not sure when to tune in? Don’t think we’ve forgotten to include a full schedule for your convenience. The event kicks off onMay 23rdand ends onMay 25th. As always, the race will be on Sunday. Try NordVPN risk-free now If that’s your only goal, tune in on the 25th of May and feast your eyes.

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you’re not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive. The Samsung 990 Pro SSD heavily discounted at the moment over at Amazon: The savings range from$60 to $163 offdepending on the exact version you get, be it 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. For instance, the 1TB model is available for$99 on Amazon, which is a almost a 40% discount from its regular price of $159, while the4TB version has dropped to $309 from $464. The 2TB model is also on salefor $169, down 34% from its $249 original price. See 1TB internal SSD at Amazon See 4TB internal SSD at Amazon Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 990 Pro Gen 4 SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. It has readspeeds of up to 7,450 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6,900 MB/s. This generation 4 SSD from Samsung will help you achieve this high performance while using less power overall. Compared to the 980 Pro, the 990 Pro is capable of up to 50% improved performance per watt. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing or working with large datasets.

Youâre going to want the heatsink option to prevent overheating. The heatsink also has futuristic RGB LED lights because of course it does. Right now, you can get the 1TB version of the 990 Pro with a heatsink for $108. The 2TB version goes for $180 while the 4TB version goes for $324. Thatâs just for the console players though.

    "title": "Elon’s DOGE Is Reportedly Using Grok AI With Government Data",
    "article_text": "Reutersreports thatElon Musk’s annoying chatbot, Grok, is now being used by the U.S. government. While the extent and nature of that usage is unclear, sources interviewed by the news outlet have expressed alarm at the implications of the chatbot’s access to government data. Grok was launched by xAI, an AI company founded by Musk in 2023,Â  and has since become integrated into Musk’s social media platform, X. The chatbot is known to summarize information in the most cringe-inducing manner possible, and was originally fashioned as an “anti-woke” antidote to ChatGPT and other more politically correct applications (though it’s turned out to betoo woke for conservativesanyway). Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team is now using a customized version of Grok, with the apparent goal of sorting and analyzing tranches of data. The team may also be using the chatbot to prepare reports, sources told the outlet. Aside from the very obvious data privacy concerns raised by Grok’s integration with government data, it appears that, once again, Musk is at the center of a conflict-of-interest violation. In fact, Reuters characterizes the promotion of Grok as a potentially criminal transgression of federal regulations. The outlet writes: If Musk was directly involved in decisions to use Grok, it could violate a criminal conflict-of-interest statute which bars officials — including special government employees — from participating in matters that could benefit them financially, said Richard Painter, ethics counsel to former Republican President George W. Bush and a University of Minnesota professor. âThis gives the appearance that DOGE is pressuring agencies to use software to enrich Musk and xAI, and not to the benefit of the American people,â said Painter. The statute is rarely prosecuted but can result in fines or jail time. Yes, but how many times have we heard that one before? Elon has conflicts of interest up the wazoo. He is a walking conflict of interest, at this point.

Ever since Musk helped Trump get re-elected withhundreds of millionsfrom his own piggybank, he’s has been treating the U.S. government like his personal plaything to destroy. Everywhere you look, the billionaire appears to be benefiting from his work with the government, whether it’s the White House bullying tariffed countries to adopt services from the billionaireâs satellite internet company, Starlink, or anew reportthat shows the billionaireâs companies may have saved nearly $2.37 billion from federal fines and penalties that were active under Biden but have since been âneutralizedâ in the Trump era. As far as DOGE’s mandate goes, the organization has been an unmitigated failure. It has barely saved a fraction of the money that Musk initially claimed that it would and, in the long term, the cuts are likely to cost Americans money, since many of them have been to important agencies that dispense key services to Americans.

    "title": "Image Reveals the Most Distant Galaxy Ever Seen, From Just 280 Million Years After the Big Bang",
    "article_text": "The James Webb Space Telescope’s latest find is yet another record-breaker: the most distant galaxy ever detected, shining just 280 million years after the Big Bang. Named MoM-z14 (cue the “your mama’s so old” jokes), the galaxy was spotted by JWST as part of the Mirage (or Miracle) survey, a program designed to confirm the identities of early galaxies. MoM-z14 clocks in at a redshift of z = 14.4, meaning its light has been stretched by the expansion of the universe by more than 14 times, and offering a clue to its age. The team of researchers, led by MIT’s Rohan Naidu,postedits findings to the preprint server arXiv and has submitted them to the Open Journal of Astrophysics. This galaxy isnât just some dim smudge, eitherâitâs unexpectedly luminous, echoing a growing theme in JWSTâs discoveries. MoM-z14 now joins a strange new class of young galaxies that shine far more brightly than anyone expected. JADES-GS-z14-0,discoveredin a separate deep field survey, similarly stunned astronomers with its size and brilliance, spanning 1,600 light-years and harboring hundreds of millions of solar masses in stars. Like JADES-GS-z14-0, MoM-z14 doesnât appear to be powered by a supermassive black hole, but rather by dense populations of young, luminous stars. The brightness of these objects challenges existing models of how quickly the universe could form stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. JWST’s piercing infrared gaze exceeds the abilities of the Hubble and Spitzer telescopes to peer so far back in time. The leap in capability is making it possible for Webb scientists not just to detect early galaxies, but to discern their structure and composition in surprising detail. For example, EGS23205âa barred spiral galaxy seen by both Hubble and JWSTâappeared faint and featureless in the telescope’s earlier images. ButJWST revealeda clear stellar bar at its center, upending assumptions that spiral galaxiesâand their intricate structuresâtook billions of years to evolve. Gravitational lensingis also helping JWST peer even deeper. In the case of the ancient galaxies found near the Abell 2744 cluster (nicknamed âPandoraâs Clusterâ), light from early galaxiesâsome just 350 million years post-Big Bangâis bent and magnified by intervening mass, allowing astronomers to glimpse primordial cosmic objects that would otherwise be invisible. These faint light sources, magnified by the clusterâs immense gravity, offer an intimate view of the early universe and have become essential to deep-field astronomy. MoM-z14âs chemical signature adds another wrinkle to the universe’s story: it’s rich in nitrogen relative to carbonâa trait shared by ancient globular clusters around the Milky Way that may have once hosted supermassive stars, according to the research. That resemblance hints at a continuity in star-forming environments stretching across more than 13 billion years. It may also reflect a broader trendâthe paper notes a split among early galaxies between compact, nitrogen-rich sources like MoM-z14, and more disparate, nitrogen-poor ones. The former may define a new class ofLittle Red Dots, as Universe Todayreports, blazing with clues about the universeâs first bursts of star formation. While future observatories like the Roman Space Telescope may reveal even more of these early cosmic oddities, JWST has already rewritten the timeline of galaxy formation. Based on its current pace, the telescope will almost certainly break its own record again soon.

    "title": "Great moments in PC gaming: Getting so badly stuck on an adventure game puzzle I called the developer for a hint",
    "article_text": "Need help? Pick up the phone. Just 95 cents per minute. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Great moments in PC gamingare bite-sized celebrations of some of our favorite gaming memories. I try to never be one of those people who talk about how much better things were back in the day… and that's really easy because everythingsuckedback in the day. Things are terrible these days, sure, but they were even worse \"back in the day.\" Any time anyone tries to tell you things were better in the past: they're full of it. That includes almost everything about videogames. I occasionally see people going off about how much better gaming used to be, but that seems like a weird stance to take. There are so many games now, so many varieties, so many options, and so many ways to play. It's not perfect, not by far, but gaming is better than ever. And before anyone brings up the current discourse about $70 or $80 price tags on games, I can testify that games were crazy expensive back in the day, too. I recently looked up how much FMV game Phantasmagoria cost when I bought it back in 1995, and guess what? It was $70. At some retailers it cost $100! See, game prices always sucked. But I'm not here to grouse about the price of early adventure games, I'm here to talk about what happened when I got stuck in early adventure games. I devoured point-and-click adventures in the late '80s and early '90s, and most of them had one thing in common: at least a few truly terrible puzzles in every one. Horrible logic, nonsensical design, just pure rotten puzzles that would bar your progress like a brick wall. When I got stuck back then, there weren't any online walkthroughs to Google. There wasn't even a Google. To be clear: I am not speaking wistfully of the time before Google and online walkthroughs. Not being able to Google puzzle hints for terrible adventure game puzzlessucked. The internet is the worst, definitely, but not having the internet wasmorethe worst. It was a dark, dark time. We did have one option, and that was to call a hint line. Sierra On-Line, LucasArts, and Infocom had 1-900 numbers players could call to get hints for specific puzzles—though those calls cost around a dollar per minute. Think times were better before microtransactions? There have always been microtransactions because phones sucked back in the day, too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I will pause here to allow Infocom fans to mention that before hint lines you had to send a letter to Infocom to get hints by mail. Bymail. That wasn't even a microtransaction: Infocom's hintbooks cost like eight bucks, plus shipping. So how, exactly, was this a great moment in PC gaming? Firstly, I was a young adult and wasn't paying my own phone bill (thanks, Dad), so calling a hint line didn't actually cost me anything (sorry, Dad). It was also just a cool concept. Calling LucasArts? On the phone? It was downright exciting for someone who loved Sam & Max, Star Wars, and the Monkey Island games. Who knew, maybe George Lucas himself would pick up the phone! He didn't. No one picked up the phone. There was just a menu that would give you hints for certain puzzles. Then you could hang up and rush back to the computer and progress a bit further before getting stuck again. I didn't call hint lines often—I was pretty stubborn and usually willing to bruteforce puzzles using the tried and true method of trying every single inventory item on every single other item, and character, and situation, until I finally broke through. But I did call a few times, and I might not have gotten through a couple of games without the help those hint lines provided. Eventually, society got around to inventing the internet specifically so we could get help with videogame puzzles, and hint lines were no more. Ironically, the only way to use one now is to play one of those old adventure games. In Monkey Island 2, there's a scene where Guybrush can call LucasArts for help while wandering around lost in his own game.

    "title": "Indie Fallout wiki joins forces with the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, ensuring a bright future for looking up RPG lore uninterrupted by half-page video ads",
    "article_text": "UESP, the Independent Fallout Wiki, and their like are a real breath of fresh air on the 2020s internet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Independent Fallout Wiki and theUnofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP)have announced a new partnership joining the two endeavors. Both sites' curation, expansiveness, and, crucially, user experiences with minimal/unobtrusive ads make themcherished resources on the internet of 2025. \"We're now proud to be the host of the Independent Fallout Wiki,\" UESP wrote on Bluesky. \"We don't want to become one of those wikifarms that tries to trap sites, so we've also set things up to allow for them to freely change hosts in the future if they ever wish, without us leaving a zombie site behind.\" That last bit was a fairly direct jab at Fandom, formerly known as Wikia, the hosting service behind the majority of well-trafficked pop culture wikis on the internet. Fextralife is another prominent wiki host gamers will be familiar with, with a specific focus on RPGs and Soulslikes. There's a long, complicated history behind the hosting of wikis, but as a reader, it's impossible not to notice the way their user experiences have degraded in the past ten years. Fandom wikis tend to be saddled with enough ads that they become slow to load, particularly on mobile, with autoplay videos taking up half the screen—and that's when they load in after a delay, partially resetting the page. Fextralife, meanwhile, has more user-friendly pages but a serious curation/manpower issue: I've found incorrect information, links to missing pages, and placeholder text on its wikis years after games launch. Wikis for Pillars of Eternity, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, and even explosively popular games likeElden Ringand Divinity: Original Sin 2 all have frustrating gaps in information. These detriments allowed the more well-maintainedBG3.wikito supersede Fextralife's pre-existing Baldur's Gate 3 wiki, which was started at the time of early access, after the game's 1.0 launch. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Both Fextralife and Fandom tend to dominate the search engine optimization (SEO) of properties in their portfolios (Google search: [Insert Game] Wiki), making it difficult for competitors to become visible. There's also a legitimate question of long-term maintenance. Many wikis turned to Fandom hosting in the first place for the stability and continuity of a large organization. For more niche games and topics, a wiki farm is insurance that a site will not be entirely abandoned if interest in the subject wanes. There's also the question of upkeep costs for hosting such large websites. Even still, many wikis have chosen to migrate away from Fandom in recent years, a process outlined in aMedium editorial from 2023by Wikipedia enthusiast Linden Clayton. A previous great migration from Fandom to the hosting service Gamepedia had an awkward ending, however, when a portion of parent company Curse was bought by Fandom in 2018, bringing the schismatic wikis back into the fold. We come full-circle back to Fallout, whose Fandom wikis seem to have had aparticularly long and complicated history. UESP, meanwhile, has been independent since 1995, and has recently expanded its offerings to include podcasts, a fan Discord, and Elder Scrolls merch drops whileaccepting reader support through Patreon. UESP's retro, no-frills interface looks much as it did when I first went there around the releases of Skyrim and Oblivion, a stalwart old friend who has survived the years unchanged. The Independent Fallout Wiki looks to be in good hands. PCG weekend editor Jody Macgregor shouted outBulbapediaand theTeam Fortress 2 Wikias notable independents in his recentlove letter to UESP, and I'd also like to praise theBaldur's Gate 3 Wikione more time: It really is an amazing resource. I'll also always carry a torch for theSouls series Wikidot wikis, even though Chrome flags them as a security risk⁠—I still haven't gotten a virus there yet!

As part of a new\"FPS Fridays\" series on Twitch, legendary shooter designer John Romero streamedNew Blood's 2018 hit, Dusk, one of the first and most influential indie \"boomer shooters\" in the genre's recent revitalization. The short of it? Romero seems to have had a blast. The Doom dev easily slipped into the rhythms of strafing, juking, and hunting for secrets. Though he insisted he wasn't shooting for 100% completion, his clear rate put my average on a first run to shame⁠—I need to bone up on my secret-hunting. Romero had special praise for Szymanski's sound design, as well as the foreboding soundtrack by composer Andrew Hulshult. Romero was also enamored with the attention to detail and many cheeky physics objects in Dusk, shoving anything that would fit into the first level's universal garbage disposal of a toilet, and carrying the game's lethal joke soap for long stretches of gameplay. At the end of the stream, Romero gave a glowing review of Dusk, which owes so much to his own work: \"This game was super-cool, love it,\" said Romero. \"The ambience is amazing, the design is super-fun, lots of secrets, tons of classic design in here, really nice. If you don't have Dusk, you should get it. \"New Blood, son, you did a good job. I approve of your vocation. You chose well.\" The folks at New Blood were understandably pretty chuffed, with composer Hulshult and lead designer Szymanskisharing clipsof the stream, studio head Dave Oshry highlighting Romero's use of the \"BIG FUCKIN SOAP,\" and the official New Blood account replying to a clip of Romero's praise with an enthusiastic \"THANKS DAD.\" Romero's FPS Fridays will continue onhis Twitch channel, with his choice of game depending on viewer votes. Previously, he revisited the killer Doom WAD MyHouse after firstchecking it out in 2023.

    "article_text": "Hammer, timed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I've always been a fan ofThe Finals' destructible environments, although I've sometimes felt itsdesire to be a proper, grown-up multiplayer shooterobstructed the simple pleasure of ripping a building apart Red Faction: Guerilla style. But that looks set to change, at least temporarily, with the game's newly added limited-time mode. This is a straight-up 5v5 slugfest that mostly involves hitting everyone with hammers, and it's perhaps the closest The Finals has got to pure destructive chaos yet. Described by Embark Studios as a \"platform fighter\" mode, Heavy Hitters takes place in a floating arena that resembles a construction yard. Loadouts in Heavy Hitters are fixed, with players all assuming the role of Heavy builds, wielding weighty melee weapons, as well as jump pads, anti-gravity cubes and goo grenades. The goal of Heavy Hitters is to eject your opponents from the arena, and there's an interesting mechanical twist here. Players can't be killed by running out of health. Instead, as your health drops, gravity has less of an effect on your character. Consequently, the more you get walloped, the farther you fly, until you're eventually launched so far from the arena you have no hope of getting back. There's also some silly nonsense about earning rewards by completing contracts sponsored by The Finals' fictional energy drink Ospuze, which falls neatly in line with the game having utterly dismal worldbuilding. But I don't care about that, because Heavy Hitters looks like enormous fun, the kind of mode you could cobble together from Unreal Tournament mutators back in the day. And the fact everyone's running around a small arena wielding sledgehammers means it gets properlywrecked, in a way that's much easier to track than in the stricter, more intensive vanilla game modes. Outside of Heavy Hitters, update 6.9 adds a bunch of tiger-themed cosmetics, including a tail and stripey fingernails. It also makes numerous balance changes to weapons, particularly to the KS-23, which gets a significant boost to accuracy in all situations. Finally, there's the usual raft of bug-fixes, mainly directed toward animations and cosmetics in this case. Heavy Hitters is available to play now. There's no word on how long exactly the mode will run for, but since Season 7 of the Finals debuts in June, it seems logical that it'll be available until then. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

If it wasn't already clear, we've formally arrived in the age of the meme movie. The Minecraft Movie wasbasically a sequence of memes strung together, andMichael Bay is making a Skibidi Toilet film. Now, omnipresent creepypasta The Backrooms is also getting an adaptation for the silver screen. The film, which isbased specifically on the viral YouTube series created by Kane Parsons(as opposed to the more general Backrooms concept, which originated on 4chan) has been in the works at least since 2023. butaccording to Deadlinethe project now has actual actors attached to it. Those are Chiwetel Ejiofor, best known for his leading role in 2013's 12 Years a Slave, and Cristin Milioti. Seen in TV shows like How I Met Your Mother, Fargo, and Black Mirror, Milioti most recently played Sofia Falcone in HBO's Batman spinoff The Penguin. So far, both actors are merely \"in talks\" to star in the film, with no word on what roles they would be playing. The film is to be directed by Parsons himself, with a script penned by Roberto Patino, best known forwriting the screenplay for the 2014 film Cut Bank. The history of the Backrooms more broadly stretches back to 2019. It's a crowdsourced Internet worldbuilding venture about a spooky liminal space that you arrive in by essentially noclipping out of reality,a bit like the SCP Foundation, but more organic and improvisational (and alotmore viral). It all originates from a single photo posted on 4chan of a sequence of rooms with yellow carpets and walls. Despite its massive impact, the location in the photo was only pinned down last year,revealed to be part of a Hobbytown store in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Personally, I know the Backrooms mainly from the preposterous number of games based on it that have appeared on Steam over the last few years. There are dozens that directly reference The Backrooms in their title, and plenty more that are based on the creepypasta without mentioning it directly.

    "article_text": "Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is a dark vision of future past. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Give it some credit: it's not every game that lets you edit the text in its installation wizard while you wait for setup to conclude. But Big Rigs dares to be so bold. It is also so bold as to allow you to accelerate to literally infinite speeds by holding reverse, to have absolutely zero collision, and to splatter a .bmp of a three-handled trophy on the screen whenever you reach the end of a track, underlined by royalty-free WordArt reading \"YOU'RE WINNER.\" Big Rigs is a game out of legend. After its release in 2003, it made headlines for justhow muchit sucked. This was a pre-digital distribution era: someone had to go out and print this thing onto actual discs. It felt like a baffling relic from another dimension and the reviewers were quick to point it out—some even builttheir own legendsoff the back of the game's rotten one. So when it hit Steam last month, I couldn't resist trying it for myself. Could itreallybe that bad? Brain-breakingly bad? Soul-crushingly bad? So bad it sucks the life out of you? Well, yes. But also no. But also yes. Here's the thing: in 2003, Big Rigs was absolutely as bad as the stricken reviewers made out. The entire thing was broken and, even if it hadn't been, the absolute peak that this thing could ever have been was a 4/10 forgettable turn-of-the-century racer. The kind of game you might have been able to buy at a gas station while out of your mind on trucker speed. It's technologically and philosophically bankrupt, then and now. It's a blight on the Earth and you shouldn't buy it. But, in 2025, what isn't? The thing about our modern era is we get a hundred Big Rigses every day releasing on Steam—broken, bankrupt, or just plain scams. 22 years ago Big Rigs wasauratic: its badness was a source of mystery, almost allure. If they made it today it would barely raise an eyebrow. Also you'd be able to have sex with the trucks. Big Rigs has 350 reviews on Steam, sitting comfortably at a Mostly Positive review rating. Does this mean the game is secretly a beautiful hidden gem? That it contains untold treasures for the player dedicated enough to uncover them? I think it might just means the Steam user review process is so in thrall to irony, spam, and a general sense of inertia as to be functionally useless. Maybe I'm wrong, though. Maybe Big Rigs is great. It does maintainsomething, though. Age has granted its awfulness an entirely new aura—it's no longer unique for being bad, it's unique for being an elder statesman of badness. Looking at it is like seeing through time, glimpsing the dark present of videogame asset-flips and shovelware through its shoddy prism. That's the reason Margarite Entertainment—whatever the hell that is—brought it back in the first place: it's the Old Testament to our modern-day New Testament (Furry Shakespeare*), a prefiguring and predictive influence: the Lumiere Brothers of total garbage.

No. You can get everything you need from Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing by watching 30 seconds of it on YouTube. But it is a strange and interesting artefact to consider in the era of shovelware and AI slop. It's at once their ancestor and a relic of a more innocent time, when it was truly possible for a game to be noteworthy just for being bad. It's hard to believe we ever lived in an era so free of sin. *I'll be honest, this game might be great.

    "title": "Mech farming sim Lightyear Frontier is getting a complete overhaul, adding a bigger map, massive tornados, and an interplanetary delivery cannon: 'It's been clear that we were not living up to the fantasy'",
    "article_text": "\"Many of you quickly explored the entire map and were left wanting more.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lightyear Frontierseemed well likedwhen it launched into Steam early access last March, garnering a Very Positive rating from players for its ingenious synthesis of first-person mech piloting and farming simulation. But it seems there's been some discontent bubbling beneath that big blue thumbs up. Inannouncing its imminent Shifting Gears update, Frame Break opens with something of a mea culpa, explaining why it hasn't provided more information about the game's progress in the last six months. \"Since we started, we've had the privilege of watching our game grow together with our amazing community,\" the studio writes. \"As we've listened closely to your feedback, it's been clear that we were not living up to the fantasy that Lightyear Frontier promised.\" It isn't the introduction to the update I expected, but the underlying issue is the size of the map. Players apparently complained that it was far too small, limiting the scope and creativity of farming. \"Many of you quickly explored the entire map and were left wanting more. We also saw that you enjoyed making huge farms, but the world didn't support that, and there was no reason to farm a lot of crops.\" Hence, the first goal of the Shifting Gears update is to address this, adding a \"huge\" new map that both provides more options for where and how you build your farm, while also letting your farm sprawl over much more territory. This larger scale also comes with an array of new tools to help you manage it, such as a bigger plough for churning up large fields more efficiently, plus a more powerful irrigation hose. But the Shifting Gears update isn't just wide, it's also deep, reworking the progression system to give players greater impetus to build big farms. As Frame Break points out \"the new system involves sending large deliveries of crops to other planets, which will reward you for your contribution\". To facilitate this, Frame Break has added the enticingly named \"delivery cannon\" which blasts crop consignments to nearby colonies, unlocking new buildings and mech upgrades in the process. So it's kinda like Satisfactory's space elevator, but more projectile-based. Other new additions include environmental hazards to make farming more challenging. Foremost among these are some impressive tornados that can tear up crops and damage farm equipment. There's also a new mod chip system for upgrading your mech's abilities, while you can make irrigating crops easier with automated drones. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All told, it sounds less like an update and more like a complete overhaul. But I wonder whether these changes will alleviate or exacerbate the main complaint Elie had when theyplayed Lightyear Frontier last year, namely that the game was sluggish to get going. \"The start of Lightyear Frontier is slow. It's not like other cosy farming sims likeStardew ValleyorSlime Rancher 2, where you can dive headfirst into the world and start doing whatever you want,\" Elie wrote. \"Lightyear Frontier introduces you to skills with the guardrails on, holding your hand every step of the way.\" The Shifting Gears update hasn't spooled up yet, but eager farmers won't have much longer to wait, as it arrives in less than a fortnight, on June 4.

    "title": "Microsoft's take on Civilization is getting an expansion that lets you play through the Bronze Age collapse, the Mongol invasion, and something inexplicably called 'Spider World'",
    "article_text": "Untold Scenarios DLC launches for Ara: History Untold next month. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's a case to be made that the Bronze Age collapse has the coolest name of any historical period. Sure, the Dark Ages might be moody and mysterious, while the Renaissance has flair on its side. But the Bronze Age collapse is pure drama. If your era of existence has the word \"collapse\" in it, you know shit went down. This ends my lecture on ancient Mediterranean history. Anyway, when I learned thatAra: History Untold's upcoming expansion will let you play through the societal disintegration of the eastern Mediterranean in the 12thcentury BC, I was immediately curious. Titled Untold Scenarios, theDLC will let you play through several historical and hypothetical challengeswithin Oxide Games' turn-based strategy. Currently, the Bronze Age Collapse scenario is the only one we have specific details for. A screenshot of the scenario summary shows it places you in the sandals of Alexander the Great, squaring off against rulers like Nefertiti of Egypt and the Persian King Xerxes as you scramble to survive economic decline and offshore raids. It's worth noting that, in reality, Alexander and Xerxes were around somewhat later than the collapse, but I guess Oxide is working with what it already has in the faction leader department. Other named historical scenarios include Mongol Invasion, Europe at the Crossroads, and Clash of Hemispheres. Oxide Games doesn't offer much info about these, but Europe at the Crossroads will see players involved in a \"pivotal moment of diplomacy, warfare, and cultural evolution,\" while Clash of Hemispheres pits \"continents against each other in a dramatic encounter\". No details are provided for the Mongol Invasion, but I can hazard a pretty good guess at how it will play out. These historical scenarios will be accompanied by several \"what-if\" challenges. Again, there aren't any specifics here. But the screenshot of the Bronze Age Collapse summary also shows a scenario titled \"Spider World\". Ireallyhope this is as literal as that title suggests, replacing all human civilisations with giant sentient spiders. All the above scenarios will apparently feature \"custom-built maps, unique nation configurations, and distinctive events\".The DLC will release on Steamcome June 18 (so slightly less than a month) and will cost $10 on launch. I rather liked this grand strategy game when I played it last year, although, as Robert Zak noted in hisAra: History Untold review, its strategic simulation was a little threadbare in certain areas like diplomacy. But it's been updated quite a bit since it launched last September, so it may be worth a look if you bounced off the changes Firaxis made forCivilization 7.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Whether you need a little or a lot ofWordlehelp this weekend, we've got exactly what you need ready to go. Keep it simple with a quick glance at our general tips, go a little deeper with a clue written especially for today's game, or run straight for the May 24 (1435) answer. We just want to make sure you win.Every guess after the first row felt like a cruel tease today. I was so sure I'd definitely got the answer this time. No? OK then,thistime. Maybe this time, please? I could see I was slowly inching my way towards today's winning word because new green and yellow letters kept popping up, but it didn't feel like I was getting anywhere. At least by the time I hit the bottom of the board there was only one valid word left to try—panic over. A wide variety of clothes and shoes can be made out of this soft and fuzzy type of leather. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Enjoy a weekend win. The answer to the May 24 (1435) Wordle isSUEDE. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "The drive is built for professionals handling sensitive information When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a tech landscape whereexternal drivesoften blur into a sea of similar features and designs, TeamGroup’s newportable SSDtakes a sharp detour into espionage territory. The T-Create Expert P35S Destroyed Portable SSD introduces something previously unheard of in the mainstream consumer market: a one-click data destruction mechanism. While the concept may sound like something pulled straight from a spy thriller, TeamGroup says the device is intended for professionals who handle sensitive or classified information. This external SSD stands out thanks to its patented “physical chip destruction circuit.” Unlike standard data wipes, this feature claims to electrically destroy the data stored on the drive, making it completely irretrievable. Triggered by a two-step process TeamGroup calls an “anti-mistouch” system, users must both click and slide to activate the wipe. It’s not exactly a big red button, but the dramatic undertone is part of the appeal. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The P35S, which weighs just 42 grams and measures 90 x 40 x 18 mm, offers 1,000MB/s transfer speeds via a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port. This led to the bold “transfer 10GB in just 10 seconds - ready for anything” slogan on TeamGroup’s display at Computex 2025. While it won’t top charts for thebest SSDin terms of performance alone, it offers enough throughput for on-the-go file handling. What’s most notable is the P35S’s target audience. TeamGroup references users such as journalists, corporate executives, and government officials, people who might need to dispose of confidential data instantly. “Designed for end-users who carry highly confidential documents, the SSD prevents data breaches and ensures that personal and confidential information remains protected under all circumstances,” the company says. There’s even a nod toward “defense use,” which, depending on your level of cynicism, could either suggest genuine intent or feel like a PR stretch, especially in light of recent high-profile data mishandling cases. The SSD’s compact size and data wipe feature make it easy to picture in the hands of an undercover agent or whistleblower. But in practical terms, it may also raise concerns about accidental erasure, especially for users prone to fidgeting. That’s one reason I’d love to test this device myself. This isn't likely to be a top choice for gamers or media creators, but for users who prioritize security over speed, it may offer real value.

    "article_text": "Sandisk's first Gen5 SSD makes bold claims but doesn’t dethrone Optane When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. SanDisk’s new WD Black SN8100 PCIe Gen5 SSD is fast, efficient, and engineered to meet the demands of gamers and power users alike. The drive uses a PCIe Gen5 x4 interface and is available in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. Built around SanDisk's in-house 8-channel controller and BiCS 3D TLC NAND, it supports read speeds of up to 14.5 GB/s and write speeds up to 12.7 GB/s, placing it among the fastest Gen5 drives currently available. However, despite the SN8100’s cutting-edge design and impressive benchmarks,Intel’s now-defunct, four-year-old Optane P5800X still holds the crown as thefastest SSDin real-world use. In synthetic benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, the SN8100 breaks lab records for sequential throughput and random reads, reaching up to 2.3 million IOPS. According toTweakTown, “this SSD is like none other; it’s at least 20% more powerful than any flash-based SSD we’ve ever encountered.” It also demonstrates notable efficiency, consuming just 7 watts under load and requiring no active cooling, making it a serious contender forbest SSDor thebest portable SSDfor enthusiast builds. Still, synthetic benchmarks don’t always reflect real-world performance. In practical transfer tests, the SN8100 ranked ninth overall, indicating that while it's extremely fast, it's not without limitations, and it doesn't dethrone the Intel Optane P5800X. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Launched in 2021, the P5800X remains unmatched in real-world responsiveness and latency. While its sequential read speeds top out at 7.2 GB/s - slower than the SN8100 - its random read/write IOPS exceed 4.5 million, and latency frequently drops below 10 microseconds. That’s where it truly shines. Flash-based SSDs like the SN8100 still rely on garbage collection and page-level management, leading to occasional latency spikes during small, random workloads. In contrast, the P5800X maintains consistent performance under heavy load, with no significant dips, a key reason why it’s still regarded as the fastest SSD ever made. That said, the SN8100 is an impressive drive in its own right. It's a customized version of Silicon Motion’s SM2508 controller, enhanced with proprietary technologies like nCache 4.0 and WD Black Gaming Mode. It also fits into theSonyPlayStation 5’s expansion slot, achieving read speeds of 6,550 MB/s in that setup, well above the console’s minimum requirement. However, with a price tag of $280 for the 2TB model, it clearly belongs in the premium tier.

    "title": "Ignore the haters – I'm a big fan of the iPhone 16 Pro's Dynamic Island",
    "article_text": "Blissful Island living When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What do you think of the iPhone’sDynamic Island?Apple’s pill-shaped cutout seems to be rather contentious, but I’m here to throw my hat into the ring firmly on the side of Team Island. Becauseunlike my colleague Lance Ulanoff, I absolutely love the Dynamic Island. As I wrote recently, I’ve not been entirely convinced by Apple’sAction buttonin the six months that I’ve had myiPhone 16 Pro. But the Dynamic Island is a feature that I really can’t help but admire for both its functionality and its aesthetics. Yet start browsing social media and you’ll quickly get the feeling that it has received a lot of negative feedback since it arrived with theiPhone 14 Pro. Even the opinions that aren’t negative seem to be closer to an apathetic shrug. Perhaps part of that is driven by reviewers and enthusiasts who get new iPhones every year. For them, the novelty has probably worn off. But for someone like me who stepped up from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 16 Pro, the Dynamic Island has been brilliant. Ultimately, my appreciation for the Dynamic Island comes down to a few factors. For one thing, it lets me tweak timers and fiddle with podcast playback without having to open the apps themselves. Before, I was constantly switching back and forth between apps when I only needed to make the slightest adjustment. That quickly grew old, but with the Dynamic Island, there are far fewer breaks in my workflow. As well as that, it handlesAirDroprequests without needing to open another window. It gives extra controls, likeadjusting my iPhone’s flashlight strengthand beam dimensions. There are even mini games from third-party developers, like Pixel Pals from the creator ofApollo(previously one of my favorite iOS apps before it was shut down). Add to that the fact that the Dynamic Island is animated beautifully with smooth transitions and effects that just look sumptuous. That means that when I have to use it, I enjoy it. All this is far better than the ugly notch on my old iPhone 12 Pro. That was purely functional and simply existed to hide the front-facing cameras andFace IDsensor array. The Dynamic Island still does that job, but it actually makes your iPhone’s cutout useful. Instead of taking away from your phone, it adds to it. Apple didn’t just throw its hands up and admit it couldn’t hide these cameras and sensors – the company thought up a truly elegant solution, and I’m really glad that it did. That’s not to say that the Dynamic Island is a flawless masterpiece – it’s absolutely not, and there are plenty of criticisms to be made of it. The big one is that it can obscure things on your screen, including both movies and games. That’s obviously far from ideal, and because Apple hasn’t yet managed to secrete the front-facing cameras and sensors under the display, there’s no way around it. And what about if you have more than one item in the Dynamic Island? In that case, the items can get shrunk down – or simply not appear at all. Apple’s cutout can hold two apps at a time (one large and one small), and while you canswipe acrossto expand or minimize its contents, you can’t have any more than that. Anything else simply isn’t shown. While I can understand these frustrations, they’re not enough to put me off the Dynamic Island. For one thing, I don’t watch movies on my phone very often, so the obstruction isn’t particularly noticeable day to day. For another, I know that the Dynamic Island is necessary right now. Apple hasn’t been able to hide things like the Face ID sensor array under the display – while itsupposedly will soon, the feature is evidently not ready for prime time yet. Some of thebest Android phoneshave tiny cutouts, sure, but their facial recognition tech is either inferior to Apple’s or missing altogether. I’d rather have Face ID and a Dynamic Island than no facial recognition and a less secure device. In the future, it looks like Apple is going to eliminate the Dynamic Island to provide a smoother, less obstructed display. I’m sure this will look amazing, going on what Android manufacturers have managed so far at least. When that happens, it will be fascinating to see what happens to the Dynamic Island’s functionality. I’m sure Apple will think up something intriguing, just as it did with the Dynamic Island itself. PerhapsTim Cookand friends will give us a device that works as an all-screen phone most of the time, but that adds a Dynamic Island-like pill to store active app features such as timers. But as long as the Dynamic Island remains on my iPhone, I’m super happy with it. It’s a halfway measure, sure, but a functional and beautiful one nonetheless.

    "title": "The Wheel of Time has spun its last thread as Amazon cancels Prime Video fantasy show after three seasons",
    "article_text": "The wheel weaves as the wheel wills When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Wheel of Timehas spun its last narrative thread following its cancellation byAmazonafter three seasons. PerDeadline, Amazon pulled the plug on the high fantasy series yesterday (May 23) after it determined it would cost too much money to produce more seasons, particularly in light of the show's declining viewership. Prime Video's top brass reportedly deliberated hard over this decision because executives enjoyed what the programoffered. However, a significant drop-off in its viewership duringThe Wheel of Timeseason 3's run and its production costs were cited as the primary reasons for scrapping the entire series. The official confirmation comes over a month after one of thebest Prime Video shows' third season drew to a close. Before it did, stars Josha Stradowski and Daniel Henney, who play Rand and Lan, exclusively told me thatthey were \"confident\" about a season 4 renewal. Unfortunately, the pair, alongside the rest of the show's cast and crew, won't be back for more outings. The Wheel of Time's demise is even tougher to take in light of its most recent eight-part installment being considered its best entry yet. In myreview ofThe Wheel of Timeseason 3, I called it a \"spellbinding return to form for Prime Video's high fantasy TV show underdog\" and handed it a four out of five stars rating. Many critics agreed with me, too. Over on popular review aggregation websiteRotten Tomatoes, season 3 is far and away the show's highest-rated chapter – its 97% critical rating outscoring season 2 (86%) and season 1 (81%) by some distance. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I can’t believe they decided to cancel the show I really had big hopes for another season but I guess we won’t get another one. Truly one of the best shows out there, with such an amazing fandom but I guess that does not matter. #TheWheelOfTime #savetwot pic.twitter.com/vK72LSXYQsMay 23, 2025 Nevertheless, the writing has seemingly been on the wall for the Amazon TV Original for some time. As the weeks ticked by following its latest season's finale, fans became increasingly concerned over the lack of updates about the show's future. Some grew so worried, in fact, that they banded togetherand formed a fan campaign calling on Amazon to finishThe Wheel of Time's story. When Prime Video's Upfront 2025 presentation in mid-May passed without a single mention, it was a case of when, not if, Amazon planned to bring the ax down on its second biggest high fantasy show. The biggest, of course, isThe Rings of Powerand, following its fantasy sibling's axing, Amazon'sLord of the Ringsprequel series will single-handedly bear the weight of the fantasy genre on one of the world'sbest streaming services. There'll be some fans who'll be glad to see the back of Amazon's live-action adaptation of Robert Jordan's book series namesake. Indeed, some have expressed frustration over what they considered to be unnecessary diversions from the source material – changesshowrunner Rafe Judkins defended ahead ofThe Wheel of Timeseason 3's launch. Still, this is a sad day for all associated withThe Wheel of Time. I didn't expect myseason 3 ending explainerto be one of the last major articles I'd write on it, but I suppose all good things must come to an end.

    "article_text": "This is a problem When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It seems as though there's a serious problem with thenew Whoop MG (Medical Grade) fitness bandsthat were launched just a couple of weeks ago, with many users reporting that their devices have crashed and stopped working. As reported byTech Issues Today, there are complaints all over forum boards and social media. The issue is the same: the device sensors stop working just hours after the Whoop MG is set up, with no warning signs. The tracker stops displaying any LED lights, won't sync with the mobile app, and isn't responsive even when it's fully charged. All the user complaints say the Whoop MG stopped responding within the first day of use. This appears to be a widespread problem too: you don't have to look for long onReddit,X, orWhoop's official community forumsto find frustrated users. These Whoop MG owners report that they're following standard troubleshooting steps, to no avail. @WHOOP wow guys I was so excited to get my new MG sensor from you. After only 5 days it failed. The worst part is the absolute runaround I’ve been getting the last 24 hours trying to deal with I can only imagine is AI customer support. Way to make a bad experience WAY worse!May 21, 2025 An official responsefrom the Whoop team recommends fully charging the battery and then forcing a reset by rapidly tapping the top of the sensor multiple times until the side LED pulses blue. You might then find you can pair it again in the app. These steps don't seem to be enough for some users, however. Affected Whoop MG owners are also being asked to contact Whoop support directly, and it seems some people arebeing sent replacementswithout asking for them, as bugs have been detected remotely. If you have been affected, try the reset process linked above, and thenget in touch with Whoop– you should be sent a free replacement if your Whoop MG has suddenly stopped working and can't be recovered.

    "article_text": "From 8MB to 8TB: SD card's insane 1,000,000x growth no one saw coming When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When the first SD memory card hit the market in 2000, it offered a modest 8MB of storage. At the time, this was a practical solution for the relatively small demands of digital cameras and early portable media devices. Twenty-five years later, SD and microSD cards have evolved into high-performance storage mediums, with capacities reaching up to 8TB following the launch of theSanDisk Extreme Proin 2024. According to the SD Association (SDA), a consortium of nearly 800 technology companies, this represents a capacity increase of over one million times. MicroSD, which marks its 20th anniversary in 2025, has been particularly credited with shaping mobile device capabilities. “Selfies, mobile phone photography, enjoying music and videos on a mobile phone all became possible because of innovation driven by the SDA,” the association noted. Today, thebest microSD cardsandSD cardsremain widely used in smartphones, cameras, drones, gaming consoles, and IoT devices. Even with the rise ofUSB-C flash drivesand cloud syncing services, SD technology continues to hold its place. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! “SD memory cards continue delivering portability and convenience, letting people upgrade the storage in their devices at any time thanks to the dedication and vision of our nearly 800 SDA members,” said Yosi Pinto, Chairman of the SDA. The SDA reports that more than 12 billion SD and microSD cards have been sold globally. While volumes increase, performance is also improving. In 2000, card speeds were around 12.5MB per second. Modern cards using the SD Express standard can reach nearly 4GB per second, a speed improvement of more than 300 times. With these gains, SD technology is approaching SSD-level performance, a development especially important as gaming, VR, and AI workloads drive demand for faster, high-capacity storage. That said, internal storage is becoming more affordable, and reliance on the cloud continues to grow. This raises the question of whether external cards will remain essential or shift into niche roles. However, the SDA remains confident. “We expect SD memory cards to remain a critical, cost-effective storage option across a variety of applications and devices in the future, since 394 zettabytes of data is expected to be created by 2028,” said Hiroyuki Sakamoto, President of the SDA.

Before my final pair of groups I’d made a mistake in thinking that there was a group containing curled things, so I had SNAIL, HELIX and CONCH and added LOBE as I was thinking about the shape of ears. Fortunately I abandoned this blind alley and went for the far more obvious PLAYING CARDS and DOPPELGÄNGER. According to German folklore, all humans have a spirit double which is invisible but identical to them. It’s an odd thought. Somewhere in the world there is someone who looks exactly like us playing Connections. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

With every newHuluschedule comes a list of movies and shows that will be subsequently removed from the platform, and like always, Hulu's June 2025 calendar is a rather short list.

    "title": "This new robot vacuum can hold two months' worth of dust without the need for a bulky dock",
    "article_text": "The 3i G10+ looks like the perfect robovac for small homes When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If your home is on the smaller side but you still want a robot vacuum, typically you need to make a choice: opt for a bulky dock with a big dust cup that the robovac can automatically empty into, or take a compact, charge-only dock and commit to manually emptying the bot's small onboard bin on a regular basis. 3i has come up with a third option. Its newly announced G10+ robot vacuum has built-in dust compression, and aims to be thebest robot vacuumfor those with small homes. Inside, you'll find a mechanical paddle that physically squishes the contents of the onboard dustbin as the bot goes about its cleaning, to maximise how much dirt it can carry. The onboard bin itself is also large at 950ml – bigger than that found on mostcordless vacuums. All that means that even though there's nowhere for the robot to dump its dirt in the dock, it still shouldn't need emptying too often. In fact, 3i suggests it can hold up to eight weeks' worth of dust and debris… although that will vary by how much there is in your home that needs sucking up. (Pet owners should expect to have to empty it more regularly, for instance.) If you're worried about debris being stored for so long, 3i has added a built-in UV light to sterilize the bin's contents. There are further benefits to this setup. The dust squishing happens in real time as the robot cleans, and it's silent. You'll never have to listen to the (sometimes noisy) sound of your robot vacuum auto-emptying every time it parks up. And there are no dock dust bags to dispose of, or to remember to buy. 3i isn't quite the first robovac brand to explore the idea of dust compression, but it does look like the best current option for those with limited space. TheNarwal Freo X Plushas onboard compression, but that model still comes with a bulky dock; one that has water tanks but no dust bag. The apparently-upcoming iRobot Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo offers dust compression and a charge-only dock, but I'm not convinced that one will actually make it on sale, given the company's recent troubles. Elsewhere, the 3i G10+ features an extendable side brush and mop for effective edge cleaning (the latter via a mop pad with an unusual protrusion), and a very-decent 18,000 Pa of suction. There's automatic carpet detection and intelligent suction and water flow adjustment based on the type of dirt the bot encounters, and the same LiDAR navigation system and AI-powered obstacle avoidance as 3i’s flagship model (the S10 Ultra). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It's also relatively affordable – the list price is $499, but it's launching with a discount that takes it down to $399 (usually an indicator that it won't generally be sold at list price). One of the things that often bumps up the price of today's flagship robot vacuums is a fancy dock that offers things like mop pad cleaning; if you don't necessarily want those things but are still keen on an advanced robot vacuum, this could potentially be a great solution. The 3i G10+ robot vacuum goes on sale atAmazonUS on 29 May. We're in the process of testing it, and will have a review live for you to read as soon as possible.

    "title": "I compared mid-range mini-LED and OLED TVs, and while it’s closer than you might think, OLED wins in one vital area",
    "article_text": "The battle of the TV technologies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OLEDand mini-LED are the two leading display technologies, with both offering improved picture quality over standard LED TVs. Most of thebest TVsuse these two technologies, but deciding which one is more suitable for you can depend on several factors. Previously, OLED was the go-to option for better black levels and contrast, while Mini-LED was better for brightness. While this remains partially the case, the differences between what each panel tech can offer have changed somewhat. Some of thebest OLED TVs, such as theLG G5, are now hitting over 2,000 nits peak brightness, which is enough to compete with mini-LED TVs. And some of thebest mini-LED TVsnow have significantly improved local dimming, allowing for deeper and more OLED-like blacks. I’ve been testing theTCLC7K mini-LED TV, the mid-range model inTCL’s 2025 UK TV lineup, and decided to put it up against our referencePanasonic MZ1500 OLED TV(from 2023) to see how much the gap between the two technologies has been closed. A quick note: these two TVs are only available in the UK, but for our US readers, the closest equivalents would be theTCL QM7Kmini-LED and either thePanasonic Z85AOLED from 2024 or theLG C5OLED from 2025. Both OLED and mini-LED have their advantages when it comes to color. With Mini-LED TVs, colors tend to be brighter and punchier, while colors on OLED TVs tend to look more saturated and have greater depth due to OLED tech’s inherently high contrast. However, this wasn’t completely the case with the C7K and MZ1500. Watching a4KBlu-ray ofWickedwith both TVs in their Dolby Vision Dark picture mode, the TCL C7K’s colors had a surprising amount of depth while still showcasing the punch mini-LED TVs get from their high peak brightness. The pink flowers around Elphaba during the 'Wizard & I' scene looked vibrant on both TVs, but I couldn’t help but be more drawn to the C7K. The MZ1500 still showed the advantages of OLED’s self-emitting pixels vs the C7K’s local dimming backlight, with Elphaba’s green skin and the blue details in a design on the wall revealing better contrast, but the C7K was no slouch here. It was also no slouch when viewing demo footage in HDR10 format on theSpears & Munsil UHD Benchmark4K Blu-ray. With both TVs set to Filmmaker Mode, the yellows and greens in a butterfly’s wings were brighter and seemed more natural as compared to the MZ1500’s bolder, deeper display. One area where the C7K impressed in my comparison was black levels. ThroughoutAlien: Romulus, in any scene in a dark hallway or tunnel, the C7K’s black levels looked deeper and richer than I’d anticipated. Yes, the MZ1500 was better here, but it was still an excellent demonstration of the C7K’s local dimming prowess. The same was true when watchingThe Batman. Shadow detail on both TVs was excellent in the opening crime scene sequence, and the C7K showed vastly improved black levels compared to some mini-LEDs I’d tested in the past. Contrast was another area where competition was closer than expected. The C7K displayed a great balance between light and dark tones in the bright lights punctuating gloomy surroundings in bothAlien: RomulusandThe Batman, holding itself up well against the MZ1500. As with color, the MZ1500 OLED gave textures greater perceived depth and detail, creating a more 3D-like quality. But the same textures, such as skin and facial features, were displayed with a lifelike quality on the C7K as well. The C7K had impressed me during my comparison so far, but there’s one area where thePanasonicOLED triumphed: screen uniformity. Screen uniformity refers to a TV's ability to evenly display large areas of the same color, such as black. OLED panels use self-emitting pixels instead of a backlight and, as a result, they can deliver uniform tones across all areas of the screen. But as mini-LED TVs use backlights to produce light, insufficient control of backlight local dimming zones can create uniformity issues. Watching black and white scenes fromOppenheimer, the C7K did a great job of accurately displaying black and white tones, along with a good range of grays, but I also noticed streaks of brown underneath the black letterbox bars in these widescreen scenes – a sign of sub-par screen uniformity. This wasn’t an issue on the MZ1500 OLED. Ultimately, the MZ1500 OLED had the superior picture in my comparison, thanks to its self-emitting pixels. But, there’s a key thing to remember here: price. For a 65-inch C7K at launch, you’d be paying £1,399 ($1,499 for the QM7K in the US, and roughly AU$2,326) whereas the MZ1500 65-inch at launch in 2023 was £2,900 (roughly $3,700 / AU$5,400). Panasonic’s OLEDs are notoriously pricey, but even a new mid-range OLED such as theLGC5 costs $2,699.99 / £2,699.99 / AU$4,299. That is one heck of a price gap. So yes, while the MZ1500 does come out on top, the C7K (and the QM7K, which earned four and a half out of five stars in our review) demonstrates the solid level of performance you can now expect from a mini-LED TV, along with its comparatively high value when pitted against an OLED TV.

    "article_text": "Spotted during an ad shoot When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's no real secret that theGoogle Pixel 10is going to be unveiled around August time, and we just got a sneak preview of the upcoming flagship in one of the more unusual phone leaks we've come across recently. As spotted by@MarksGonePublic(via9to5Google), the handset was out on the streets of Vancouver, Canada, during what seems to have been filming for a Pixel 10 advert. The real giveaway? The multiple mentions of the \"Pixel 10\" on the storyboards. Based on the flash and thermometer circles to the right of the cameras, this appears to be a Pixel 10 Pro or a Pixel 10 Pro XL, and it doesn't look like much is going to change design-wise from what we saw with theGoogle Pixel 9series. There's also a glimpse of a tagline that tells us to \"ask more of your phone\". It seems that photography and AI will again be front and center when Google is promoting the Pixel 10 and all the features it comes with. 🎬 Just out for a walk…stumbled onto a full-on commercial shoot for the Google Pixel 10 📱They had a macro probe lens, a Panavision rig, and 20+ crew members…to film someone holding a phone 😂If the Pixel camera’s so good, why not just use it? 👀 #BTS #Vancouver pic.twitter.com/muDluZfK75May 23, 2025 So far, Pixel 10 rumors and leaks have been pretty thin on the ground – perhaps a sign that this isn't going to be a huge upgrade for the series, though we would expect the processor to get a speed bump, as is the norm for a new Pixel. There might even be downgrades in certain areas: the standard Google Pixel 10has been rumoredto be getting a third camera around the back, but the other two sensors will be reduced in their capabilities, perhaps to keep costs down. Speaking of costs,a separate leakpoints to similar pricing for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro as we saw last year with the Pixel 9 equivalents, while the Pixel 10 Pro XL could cost more and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might even be reduced in price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. As ourGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold reviewwill tell you, that foldable started at $1,799 / £1,799 / AU $2,699, so a price reduction for its successor would be most welcome.

    "article_text": "Folding hinges that open up to 315° improve collaboration When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Acer’s new line ofportable monitorsintroduces some unexpected features, especially in models like the PD163QT and PD243Y E. While portable displays typically focus on minimalism and basic connectivity, these Full HD (1920x1080) panels go a step further with wide viewing angles, aiming for more versatile use in multitasking. These monitors can fold up to 315°, a feature designed to improve collaboration and presentations. The PD163QT also adds touch functionality, a rare feature in this category. Although marketed as supporting dual-screen setups, each monitor contains only one display panel. The reference to “two Full HD displays” pertains to using the PD163QT and PD243Y E together, rather than a single device offering two screens. The PD243Y E features a 100Hz refresh rate and flicker-free technology, though the practical benefits over a standard 60Hz screen for typical office tasks are unclear. At best, it may slightly reduce eye strain during prolonged use. Acer also includes its VisionCare technology for eye comfort, signaling an expectation of extended usage. ForAppleusers, none of these models appears to be optimized for macOS. While they function as general-purpose external screens, they may not be thebest monitors for MacBook Prousers who prioritize native aspect ratios and accurate color reproduction. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The PM191Q E is another portable model featuring an ultra-thin profile and adjustable kickstand. It supports Full HD resolution and a refresh rate up to 100Hz. All of these monitors are portable, flexible, and VESA wall-mountable, but none exceed 1080p resolution, a common limitation in this segment. In parallel, Acer has launched its ProCreator Series, aimed at creative professionals. The series includes4Kand 6K monitors that support Delta E<1 color accuracy and a wide color gamut. These high-end models also include touch functionality, split-screen tools, and integrated webcams. Models like the PE320QXT and PE270XT offer specifications suited to the premiumbusiness monitorcategory. The new lineup is priced between $180 and $1,999, with prices varying by model and region.

    "title": "I review motorbikes for a living – here's why I'm excited about GoPro's new smart motorcycle helmet",
    "article_text": "Collaborating with AGV helmets adds a big name to the project When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Since GoPro purchased the Australian smart motorcycle helmet company Forcite last year, the two-wheeled world has been waiting to see what the action camera giant can do if it applied its technology to rider safety equipment. Now,GoProhas announced that it will work with Italian helmet manufacturer AGV on its debut line of action camera-enabled lids, which are tipped to feature its built -in sensor and lens technology that will allow riders to capture POV footage without the need to mount an additional camera and other accessories. Forcite’s original goal was to provide a built-in dash cam experience for motorcycle riders, using a basic sensor fromSony, but is understood that GoPro’s influence will likely see the introduction of more advanced sensor, lens and processor tech that could allow for cinematic, high-definition footage to be captured and edited using the US company’s user-friendly software. Currently, riders wishing to capture POV footage either have to rely on handlebar or chest mounts, as well as accessories that clip to the chin of a motorcycle helmet or mount to the very top of it. But there have been questions raised about the potential impact on helmet safety in the unfortunate even of an accident. Designing a built-in solution would allow both GoPro and AGV to start from the ground up and create an aerodynamic, motorcycle-specific system that doesn’t compromise on safety, but can also deliver fantastic quality footage, alongside accident-detecting dash-cam functionality. AGV is a solid partner for GoPro, as it has been, manufacturing helmets for racing, the road and beyond since 1947. In fact, its Giacomo Agostini livery is one of the most recognizable in the motorcycle racing world and it kept MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi’s head safe throughout his career. Currently, its range-topping Pista GP carbon fibre lids can cost in the region of $1,924/ £1,370 / AU$$2,200, although it does offer much more affordable options in its more wallet-friendly K1 S range. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There is no hint at what the GoPro tie-up helmet could eventually cost, but we would expect it to be expensive given the technology involved. Thanks to the advent of social media, many riders are increasingly looking for ways to document their two-wheeled escapades – or merely to record footage that could come in very handy should an insurance claim eventually arise. GoPro and AGV’s partnership is undeniably exciting for those that want technology seamlessly integrated with a high quality helmet, but whatever way you cut it, it is going to be expensive. What’s more, camera technology moves at such a rate that the GoPro sensors, lenses and processing chips integrated into the upcoming lid could well be second-rate or obsolete after a couple of years. When riders invest a large sum of money in a new helmet, they typically expect that piece of safety equipment to last a number of years, if not decades, so long as it isn’t dropped or damaged. It would be a crying shame if GoPro’s solution isn’t upgradeable, as it could end up being a bulky, heavy helmet that is only capable of capturing second rate footage. Or worse, is eventually not supported by GoPro at all. That said, AGV is a good partner for GoPro as it makes some of the nicest motorbike helmets around, and a built-in camera is still a better solution that helmet-mounted cams, which can be dangerous – so I'm looking forward to see what the partnership delivers.

    "title": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could be the end of the Galaxy S25 Plus – and to be honest I’m fine with that",
    "article_text": "Could Samsung subtract the Plus? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In February,Samsungreleased theSamsung Galaxy S25series, bringing the baseline Galaxy S25, super-premiumGalaxy S25 Ultra, and intermediateGalaxy S25 Plusto the world. This lineup, comprising a standard, enlarged, and premium model, was nothing new, but the reveal of theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeat a recentGalaxy Unpackedevent had me thinking a little harder than usual about this year’s Samsung smartphones. At the time, I wondered where the Galaxy S25 Edge would fit in Samsung’s smartphone lineup – would it lean towards the Galaxy S25 Plus or start a new branch of premium phones alongside the Galaxy S25 Ultra? Now that the Galaxy S25 Edge is almost here, we know that the answer is a bit of both – and while the Galaxy S25 Edge has joined the existing lineup without replacing any of the existing models, I do think it could signal the beginning of the end for the Plus. The truth is, the Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus don’t have that much reason to coexist. Firstly, lets look at the sales figures. According toWCCFTech, in the first month of global sales the Galaxy S25 Ultra sold 2.55 million units, the Galaxy S25 sold 1.17 million units, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus sold just 840,000 units. Next, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Edge are unusually close together on the Galaxy pricing ladder. UnlikeAppleand others, Samsung’s flagship phones each have a pretty wide price gap between them – the baseline Galaxy S25 starts at $799 / £799 / AU$1,399, the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,699, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,249 / £1,249 / AU$2,149. The Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the model with 256GB of storage; that certainly feels like it’s encroaching on the Galaxy S25 Plus’ turf. And speaking of Apple, the latest rumors suggest that Cupertino could axe its larger base-model flagship as soon as this year – supposedly leaked images suggest that the rumorediPhone 17 Aircould take the iPhone 17 Plus’ spot. And where Apple goes, the industry tends to follow. To me, the most damning part of the story is simply that the Galaxy S25 Edge embodies everything I like about the Galaxy S25 Plus – let me explain. I’ve had my hands on a Galaxy S25 Plus for a few months now, using it to test outOne UI 7and get first-hand experience with new features. I’m honestly a big fan – I love the phone’s minimalist design. While One UI isn’t my favorite Android wrapper, I do find its quirky look and straight-laced UI animations very charming. It also helps that the phone runs at a sprint and boasts a lovely display. However, the thing I like most about the Galaxy S25 is that it gives me a large screen in a thinner and lighter frame than either the Galaxy S25 Ultra or most comparable top-end phones. A large screen, light weight, and thin build – sounds an awful lot like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.Having spent some time with the Edge myself, I can confidently say that it beats the Galaxy S25 Plus when it comes to ergonomics, and there are no compromises made with its excellent display. And while the Galaxy S25 Plus wins against the Edge with its telephoto-equipped triple camera system and, most notably, battery capacity, I’m not actually convinced that people buy the former for its performance. Looking again at those first month sales figures, we can see that for every Galaxy S25 Plus sold, three Galaxy S25 Ultras were sold – I reckon that power users were going straight for the performance champ Galaxy S25 Ultra, with those who chose the Galaxy S25 Plus doing so for its large screen and light weight. For these people, the Galaxy S25 Edge is sure to look tempting – I suppose we’ll find out for certain when the phone releases globally on May 30.

    "title": "German defense minister teases possible conscription in 2026",
    "article_text": "Germany may be forced to revive compulsory conscription as early as next year if not enough people join the army voluntarily to meet Berlin’s NATO obligations amid growing tensions with Moscow, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said. Berlin abolished conscription in 2011 but has recently reconsidered bringing it back, citing“threats”from Russia. Moscow has consistently dismissed such speculation about any intent to attack NATO countries as“nonsense,”accusing the West of trying to scare EU populations and justify increased military budgets. Chancellor Friedrich Merz and his coalition partners have already reached an understanding on reintroducing the so-called“Swedish model,”which combines selective mandatory and voluntary service. They are now working to pass a new bill by the end of the year, Pistoriussaidin an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung on Saturday. “Our model is initially based on voluntary participation,”Pistorius stated.“If the time comes when we have more capacity available than voluntary registrations, then we may decide to make it mandatory. That is the roadmap.” The German chancellor proclaimed his intention to turn the Bundeswehr into the“strongest army”on the continent earlier this month, just days after the world marked the 80th anniversary of the crushing defeat of Nazi Wehrmacht in World War II. “The federal government will provide all the financial resources that the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe,”Merz said.“Our friends and partners expect this from us – and, in fact, they are demanding it.” NATO is urging Berlin to significantly expand its military forces, Die Welt reported last week, noting that officials believe the country – already burdened by high dropout rates – will struggle to meet the proposed targets. Pistorius said Germany must be capable of mobilizing a total force of 460,000 soldiers and reservists, including at least 200,000 active-duty troops. Since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, Berlin has become one of Kiev’s largest backers after the US and EU institutions, supplying it with heavy weapons, including Leopard 2 tanks, while denying direct involvement. Germany’s chief of defense staff, General Carsten Breuer, previously stated that the country was living in a“grey zone,”and must be war-ready to confront Russia by 2029. Berlin was the world’s fourth-largest military spender in 2024 – after the US, China, and Russia, and ahead of India – according to research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Overall, NATO members have boosted their combined military expenditure to $1.5 trillion, with roughly one-third contributed by the bloc’s European members. In March, the European Commission unveiled a plan to raise a further €800 billion ($896 billion) to“rearm”the EU and produce more weapons for Ukraine. Russian officials have condemned the steps being taken in Europe toward militarization, expressing concern that, rather than supporting US-led peace initiatives for the Ukraine conflict, the EU and UK are instead gearing up for war with Russia.",

    "title": "Slovakia party to demand Ukraine compensate aid",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers in Slovakia’s ruling coalition will push to demand compensation from Kiev for the military and financial aid Bratislava has provided it over the course of the Ukraine conflict, according to state news agency TASR. The Slovak National Party (SNS) leader Andrej Danko will call on Prime Minister Robert Fico to begin EU proceedings regarding the bloc’s stake in Ukrainian mineral production, following the example of the US, head of the lawmaker’s office, Zuzana Skopcova told TASR on Saturday. Washington, Kiev’s biggest military donor, inked a major minerals agreement with it last month, giving the US preferential access to Ukrainian mineral wealth. President Donald Trump has touted the deal as a way for the US to reclaim hundreds of billions of dollars in aid spent on supporting Ukraine. Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka has since described the preceding negotiations with the US as something from a“mafia movie.” “The European Union's aid is approaching the volume of US aid. If Ukraine hands over all its mineral wealth to the US, Ukraine will have nothing to repay the aid given by European states,”Danko’s office director Zuzana Skopcova told TASR on Saturday. It was illogical and unethical of the US to demand exclusive mining rights of Ukraine, Skopcova said, according to TASR. If Ukraine has already decided to pay for aid during the conflict with the Russian Federation, it is incomprehensible why it does not do so in relation to the EU. On Monday, Danko plans to ask Slovak Finance Minister Ladislav Kamenicky to tally up the sum of all financial and military assistance Bratislava provided Kiev during the Ukraine conflict, TASR wrote. The SNS wants more than €3 billion ($3.41 billion) in aid compensated in a similar manner as the US has sought, the news agency said. Under Fico, a long-time critic of EU policy regarding the Ukraine conflict, Bratislava has cut military assistance to Kiev. Last May, he survived an assassination attempt after being shot multiple times by a pro-Ukraine activist. The US has allocated some $135 billion to aid Ukraine since the escalation of the conflict in 2022, data from Germany’s Kiev Institute says. By comparison, the EU has dedicated around $158 billion in total military and financial aid to Kiev over the past three years, according to the European Commission. Brussels penned an agreement regarding raw materials with Ukraine in 2021. The European Parliament Think Tank has noted that the document gives the EU a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth, like the US.",

    "title": "US ‘learning’ from Ukraine conflict – Trump",
    "article_text": "Washington is actively following drone warfare developments in the Ukraine conflict, US President Donald Trump told West Point Military Academy graduates on Saturday. He said the US is“learning”from the tactics used by both Moscow and Kiev and that it was important to stay“at the top”amid the rapidly changing nature of warfare. “We are studying it. We are seeing different forms of warfare, we are seeing the drones that are coming down at angles, with speed, with precision. We have never seen anything like that. We are learning from it,”the president said, referring to their use in the current struggle. He then called on the cadets to“have the courage to take risks and do things differently”in a bid to stay up-to-date in the field of military tactics and strategy. His comments came as The Times reported that Russia was beating Ukraine in“the drone race”when it comes to both the production of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their use on the battlefield. It particularly pointed to the fiber optic drone types connected directly to their operators through a gossamer thin fiber optic thread that makes them difficult to detect or intercept. Such drones are“essentially a wire-guided, highly maneuverable killer drone, impervious to jamming, and difficult to track by radio-based drone detector units,”The Times reported, adding that the Russian UAVs were“altering the physical make-up of the front line, the tactics of the war and the psychology of the soldiers fighting it”and were“devasting”the Ukrainian military’s logistics in the process. Russian President Vladimir Putin highlighted the important role drones had been playing on the battlefield back in April. Speaking at a meeting of the Russian military-industrial committee, he called UAVs“one of the serious factors of battlefield success.”According to the president, some 4,000 first-person view (FPV) drones were sent to the troops daily throughout 2024. FPV UAVs have mostly been used as kamikaze drones by the Russian military to strike a wide array of targets, ranging from tanks and armored vehicles to other drones. Earlier this month, the Russian military published a video showcasing the successful deployment of low-cost FPV drones against more expensive Ukrainian reconnaissance UAVs.",

    "title": "Hack fest in Moscow sparks BRICS cyber ties",
    "article_text": "BRICS countries believe that Russian cybersecurity experts are the best in the field according to Positive Technologies Global Educational Director, Yulia Danchina. Positive Technologies (PT), the leading Russian information security company, organized the Positive Hack Days 2025 cybersecurity festival in Moscow, considered to be the largest event of its kind in the world. The festival is being held from May 22 to 24, with delegations from over 40 countries across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia in attendance. Danchina emphasized that the festival offers a chance to share the company’s educational and practical expertise with other countries, particularly BRICS members. The visiting international delegates feel confident that“Russian experts are the best in protecting the infrastructure of companies and organizations,”she said.“This is confirmed by the deals and the level of discussions that we are seeing here today.” Representatives of one BRICS country, Indonesia, have already signed a bilateral agreement on cybersecurity cooperation with PT at the event. Yudi Darma, senior official at Indonesia’s Higher Education, Science and Technology Ministry, said that his office was considering the modules, simulators, and teaching laboratories that PT has under development. “Positive Technology also has the capacity to produce a certification that can provide proof of the competence in cybersecurity,”Darma said. According to Baiq Hana Susanti, an expert on AI education at Sakuranesia Society Foundation Indonesia, working with the Russian information security company could provide valuable guidance, particularly as Indonesia begins integrating AI into its new educational curriculum. Brazil, another BRICS member, has also expressed interest in the cybersecurity firm’s expertise. Brazilian lawmaker Jose Jacovos told RT on Saturday that PT provides significantly more affordable cybersecurity solutions than other global leaders in the field. “The solutions presented here in Russia… are much more affordable for smaller cities with lower capacity for tax collection in Brazil,”he said. Russia is“very advanced, light-years ahead of many countries,”he added. The Russian and Brazilian energy and science ministries signed bilateral agreements to promote cooperation in their respective fields earlier this month. Brazil is one of the founders of BRICS, which it established alongside Russia, India, and China in 2009. The economic bloc was joined by South Africa two years later. Indonesia joined alongside Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the UAE last year. Last year, the bloc grew to account for 40% of the world’s economy in Purchasing Power Parity terms, according to IMF data. The 11 BRICS nations represent more than two-fifths of the global population.",

    "title": "AI hallucinations: a budding sentience or a global embarrassment?",
    "article_text": "In a farcical yet telling blunder, multiple major newspapers, including theChicago Sun-TimesandPhiladelphia Inquirer,recently published a summer-reading list riddled with nonexistent books that were“hallucinated”by ChatGPT, with many of them falsely attributed to real authors. The syndicated article, distributed by Hearst’s King Features, peddled fabricated titles based on woke themes, exposing both the media’s overreliance on cheap AI content and the incurable rot of legacy journalism. That this travesty slipped past editors at moribund outlets (the Sun-Times had just axed 20% of its staff) underscores a darker truth: when desperation and unprofessionalism meets unvetted algorithms, the frayed line between legacy media and nonsense simply vanishes. The trend seems ominous. AI is now overwhelmed by a smorgasbord of fake news, fake data, fake science and unmitigated mendacity that is churning established logic, facts and common sense into a putrid slush of cognitive rot. But what exactly is AI hallucination? AI hallucination occurs when a generative AI model (like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, or DALL·E) produces false, nonsensical, or fabricated information with high confidence. Unlike human errors, these mistakes stem from how AI models generate responses by predicting plausible patterns rather than synthesizing established facts. There are several reasons why AI generates wholly incorrect information. It has nothing to do with the ongoing fearmongering over AI attaining sentience or even acquiring a soul. Training on imperfect data:AI learns from vast datasets replete with biases, errors, and inconsistencies. Prolonged training on these materials may result in the generation of myths, outdated facts, or conflicting sources. Over-optimization for plausibility:Contrary to what some experts claim,AI is nowhere near attaining“sentience”and therefore cannot discern“truth.”GPTs in particular are giant planetary-wide neural encyclopedias that crunch data and synthesize the most salient information based on pre-existent patterns. When gaps exist, it fills them with statistically probable (but likely wrong) answers. This was however not the case with theSun-Timesfiasco. Lack of grounding in reality:Unlike humans, AI has no direct experience of the world. It cannot verify facts as it can only mimic language structures. For example, when asked“What’s the safest car in 2025?”it might invent a model that doesn’t exist because it is filling in the gap for anideal carwith desired features — as determined by the mass of“experts”— rather than a real one. Prompt ambiguity:Many GPT users are lazy and may not know how to present a proper prompt. Vague or conflicting prompts also increase hallucination risks. Ridiculous requests like“Summarize a study about cats and gender theory”may result in an AI-fabricated fake study which may appear very academic on the surface. Creative generation vs. factual recall:AI models like ChatGPT prioritize fluency over accuracy. When unsure, theyimproviserather than admit ignorance. Ever came across a GPT answer that goes like this:“Sorry. This is beyond the remit of my training?” Reinforcing fake news and patterns:GPTs can identify particular users based on logins (a no-brainer), IP addresses, semantic and syntactic peculiarities and personnel propensities. It then reinforces them. When someone constantly uses GPTs to peddle fake news or propaganda puff pieces, AI may recognize such patterns and proceed to generate content that is partially or wholly fictitious. This is a classic case of algorithmic supply and demand. Remember, GPTs not only train on vast datasets, it can also train onyour dataset. Reinforcing Big Tech biases and censorship:Virtually every Big Tech firm behind GPT rollouts is also engaged in industrial-scale censorship and algorithmic shadowbanning. This applies to individuals and alternative media platforms alike and constitutes a modern-day, digitally-curateddamnatio memoriae. Google’s search engine, in particular, has a propensity forup-rankingthe outputs of aserial plagiaristrather than theoriginal article. The perpetuation of this systemic fraud may explode into an outright global scandal one day. Imagine waking up one morning to read that your favorite quotes or works were the products of a carefully-calibrated campaign of algorithmic shunting at the expense of the original ideators or authors. This is the inevitable consequence of monetizing censorship while outsourcing“knowledge”to an AI hobbled by ideological parameters. Experiments on human gullibility:I recently raised the hypothetical possibility of AI being trained to study human gullibility, in a way conceptually similar to theMilgram Experiment, theAsch Conformity Experimentsand its iteration, theCrutchfield Situation. Humans are both gullible and timorous and the vast majority of them tend to conform to either the human mob or in the case of AI, the“data mob.” This will inevitably have real-world consequences, as AI is increasingly embedded in critical, time-sensitive operations – from pilots’ cockpits and nuclear plants to biowarfare labs and sprawling chemical facilities. Now imagine making a fateful decision in such high-stakes environments, based on flawed AI input. This is precisely why“future planners”must understand both thepercentageandpersonality typesof qualified professionals who are prone to trusting faulty machine-generated recommendations. When AI generates an article on one’s behalf, any journalist worth his salt should consider it as having been written by another party and therefore subject to fact-checking and improvisation. As long as the final product is fact-checked, and substantial value, content and revisions are added to the original draft, I don’t see any conflict of interest or breach of ethics involved in the process. GPTs can act as a catalyst, an editor or as a“devil’s advocate”to get the scribal ball rolling. What happened in this saga was that the writer,Marco Buscaglia, appeared to have wholly cut and pasted ChatGPT’s opus and passed it off as his own. (Since this embarrassing episode was exposed, his website has gone blank and private). The overload of woke-themed nonsense generated by ChatGPT should have raised red flags in the mind of Buscaglia but I am guessing that he might be prone to peddling this stuff himself. However all the opprobrium currently directed at Buscaglia should also be applied to the editors of King Features Syndicate and various news outlets who didn’t fact-check the content even as they posed as the bastions of the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Various levels of gatekeepers simply failed to do their jobs. This is a collective dereliction of duty from the media which casually pimps its services to the high and mighty while it pontificates ethics, integrity and values to lesser mortals. I guess we are used to such double-standards by now. But here is the terrifying part: I am certain that faulty data and flawed inputs are already flowing from AI systems into trading and financial platforms, aviation controls, nuclear reactors, biowarfare labs, and sensitive chemical plants – even as I write this. The gatekeepers just aren’t qualified for such complex tasks, except on paper, that is. These are the consequences of aworld“designed by clowns and supervised by monkeys.” I will end on a note highlighting the irony of ironies: All the affected editors in this saga could have used ChatGPT to subject Buscaglia’s article to a factual content check. It would have only taken 30 seconds!",

    "article_text": "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of detaining Telegram founder Pavel Durov for the purpose of interfering with the electoral processes in Romania. The accusation comes shortly after Durov claimed that French authorities had enquired with him regarding the issue. “It turns out that Macron had Durov arrested not even to address internal issues with the messenger using such barbaric methods, but to influence the elections in Romania, realizing that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship wouldn’t be able to win under any legal circumstances,”Zakharova wrote on Telegram. On Saturday, Durov said, citing Romanian journalist Marius Tuca, that Nicolas Lerner, the head of France’s foreign intelligence agency, the DGSE, had visited the country just two days before the vote. Earlier this month, Durov revealed that Lerner had asked him to censor conservative voices on the social media platform during the election campaign in Romania. The agency has publicly denied the allegation. Durov in turn accused French authorities of deflecting criticism by linking him to unrelated criminal investigations involving users of his platform. Durov was arrested in France last August and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users. The Russian-born entrepreneur, whose company is headquartered in Dubai, was ultimately released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail and allowed to leave the country in mid-March. Romania’s Constitutional Court promptly annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election carried out in November 2024, alleging that independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu had secured an unexpected lead with the help of Russian interference. Georgescu was disqualified from the re-run. Last Sunday, the conservative EU critic George Simion lost a run-off vote against pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion challenged the results on Tuesday, alleging“external interferences by state and non-state actors,”but the nation’s Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the petition. Following Simion’s petition, Durov offered to testify before the Romanian authorities about the interactions with French officials, saying he would do so“if it helps Romanian democracy.” Ahead of the second round of voting, Romania’s Foreign Ministry alleged that Moscow was attempting to influence the outcome. The Kremlin ridiculed the allegations, comparing the process with a mess and stating that it shouldn’t even count as a proper vote.",

    "title": "Trump ‘gutting the Deep State’ inside National Security Council – media",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has moved to drastically overhaul the National Security Council (NSC), reportedly placing more than 100 officials on administrative leave and slashing the powerful advisory and coordination body’s staff, as part of what one White House source described as an effort to“gut the Deep State.” Multiple reports on Friday confirmed that staff across nearly all NSC directorates – including those handling key global hotspots such as Ukraine, Iran and the Indo-Pacific – were dismissed with little notice. According to CNN and Reuters, employees received emails late Friday afternoon informing them they had just 30 minutes to clear their desks. An administration official described the reorganization to Axios as a strategic shift aimed at reducing bureaucratic interference and concentrating foreign policy decision-making at the highest levels of government, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who is also serving as acting national security adviser – playing a central role. “The NSC is the ultimate Deep State,”the official said.“It’s Marco vs. the Deep State. We’re gutting the Deep State.” Rubio, who has led efforts to downsize the State Department andUSAID, emphasized that the goal is to return the NSC to its“original purpose”as a coordinating body, not a policy-shaping institution. “The NSC will now be better positioned to collaborate with agencies,”he told Axios in a statement, without confirming the exact scope of the cuts. According to officials who spoke anonymously, the plan is to cut the NSC staff to around 50 people – down from more than 300 under the Biden administration, and even below the leaner structure Trump implemented during his first term. Entire directorates may be eliminated or consolidated, including those overseeing Africa policy and NATO coordination, multiple sources told Reuters. Senior administration officials reportedly cited Trump’s recent reversal of Syria sanctions as an example of the new top-down model.“The president gave the order. The cabinet followed. No need for endless layers of committees,”one official told Axios.“This is reverse workflow in action.” The dismissals came just weeks after Trump fired former national security adviser Mike Waltz and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, followingleaksinvolving sensitive military plans. Waltz had reportedly lost influence after inadvertently inviting a journalist into a private chat about Yemen airstrikes. The abrupt reorganization, carried out just ahead of Memorial Day weekend, marks one of the most sweeping institutional shake-ups of Trump’s second term to date. It reportedly affected both career officials and Trump’s own political appointees. The White House did not comment publicly on the staffing decisions, but Rubio is expected to continue leading the NSC indefinitely, with deputy national security advisers Andy Baker and Robert Gabriel assisting him under the new structure.",

    "title": "US moves to implement Trump’s ‘vision’ for Syria",
    "article_text": "The White House has initiated a significant shift in policy toward Damascus by easing longstanding sanctions and appointing a special envoy, following US President Donald Trump’s recent meeting with Syria’s interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Al-Sharaa, also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani, rose to prominence as the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group with ties to Al-Qaeda, which led a coalition of opposition groups that toppled longtime leader Bashar Assad last year. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,”Trump announced at an investment forum in Riyadh last week, where he met al-Sharaa and expressed hope that the new government would“succeed in stabilizing the country.” On Friday, the US Treasury Department issued General License 25 (GL25), authorizing previously prohibited transactions under the Syrian Sanctions Regulations (SSR). The measure effectively lifts restrictions on dealings with Syria’s central government, including the Central Bank of Syria, several state-owned banks, energy firms, telecommunications providers and national carriers such as Syrian Arab Airlines. Simultaneously, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a 180-day waiver of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, suspending some of the most punitive measures passed by Congress in 2019. The waiver covers financial services, engineering, and logistics support for projects involving water, electricity, sanitation, and public health. Rubio described the move as a“first step”in fulfilling Trump’s new“vision”for Syria. Earlier this week, Rubio warned US lawmakers that a civil war of“epic proportions”could erupt in Syria within weeks. Although the country’s new leadership“didn’t pass their background check with the FBI,”Rubio said the US must support them in order to prevent wider regional instability. He defended Trump’s approach, arguing that maintaining a pragmatic foreign policy means the US human rights agenda is“different in certain parts of the world”than in others. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in February that the sanctions were“harming the Syrian people”and should be lifted without preconditions. In order to oversee Washington’s growing ties with Damascus, Trump has appointed Tom Barrack, his ambassador to Turkey and longtime confidant, as US Special Envoy for Syria. Barrack said on Friday that the administration’s goal was to“integrate Syria into a peaceful, cooperative Middle East,”and hinted that reopening the US Embassy in Damascus was“on the table.” While sanctions relief is significant, most measures remain temporary, with GL25 expiring in six months unless renewed. Congress would need to pass legislation to permanently repealing the Caesar Act and related sanctions packages imposed since Syria was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979.",

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore A 61-year-old man was arrested for causing death by rash act and investigations are ongoing. General view of the junction of Lorong Chencharu. (Image: Google Street View) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A 29-year-old worker died at a Housing and Development Board (HDB) worksite at 71 Lorong Chencharu in Yishun on Friday (May 23) morning. In response to CNA queries, HDB said on Saturday evening that the Bangladeshi man was carrying out survey works when he was struck by a reversing tipper truck. The police said they were alerted to the incident at about 10am on Friday and the man was pronounced dead at the scene by a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) paramedic. A 61-year-old man was arrested for causing death by rash act and investigations are ongoing, they added. HDB said it takes a \"very serious view\" of the fatal worksite incident and all works on site have been suspended until further notice. \"Safety at our worksites is of utmost priority, and we are working with the contractor to assist the authorities with their investigations on this matter,\" it added. \"We will continue to work with our industry partners to strengthen workplace safety at all our worksites.\" HDB said that it would, along with the contractor - a joint venture between Yeng Tong Construction and Koh Kock Leong Enterprise - render all the support and assistance needed to the worker's family. \"We are saddened by the fatality and extend our heartfelt condolences to the deceased’s family,\" added HDB. A Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson said the worker had been supporting a site survey when he was run over by the reversing vehicle. The worker was an employee of Koh Kock Leong Construction. \"As a general safety measure, drivers must be guided by a banksman when reversing or operating in areas with limited visibility or where other workers are present. Clear communication must be maintained at all times,\" said MOM, adding that companies are encouraged to adopt vehicular safety technologies to enhance operational safety. MOM said that it is investigating the incident. Chencharu is anew housing area in Yishunthat will have a mixed-used integrated development comprising a new bus interchange, hawker centre and shops.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Former Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher of Germany looks on during the qualifying session for the Italian F1 Grand Prix race at the Monza racetrack in Monza, near Milan, in this Sep 13, 2008 file photo. (Photo: Reuters/Alessandro Bianchi) Michael Schumacher's Ferrari Formula One car that won the 2001 Monaco and Hungarian grand prix races was sold for US$18.17 million, according to RM Sotheby's. Selling ahead of qualifying in Monaco on Saturday (May 24), the F2001 car that the legendary German driver used en route to that year's world title became the most expensive F1 vehicle driven by Schumacher to be sold at auction. The US$18.17 million price tag topped the US$13.2 million a bidder paid for Schumacher's 2003 Ferrari F2003 in 2022. It also became the fourth-most expensive F1 car ever sold. The world record sits at US$52.52 million, which occurred earlier this year for a Mercedes W196 streamliner that was driven by Formula One legends Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss in the 1950s. Schumacher, now 56, drove the F2001 Ferrari in his fifth and final Monaco Grand Prix win, which he followed up with a victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix. The latter win clinched Schumacher's fourth F1 world title. Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss. Just one a day.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport Soccer Football - Serie A - AC Milan v Monza - San Siro, Milan, Italy - May 24, 2025 AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders reacts REUTERS/Daniele Mascolo AC Milan wrapped up their disappointing season with a 2-0 win over Monza on Saturday, but the game was overshadowed by fan protests against the club ownership and hierarchy both before and during the match. Milan's victory came thanks to second half goals from Matteo Gabbia and Joao Felix, moving them to seventh in the standings but not into the European qualification places, one point above Fiorentina who are at Udinese on Sunday. Thousands of Milan supporters gathered earlier on Saturday outside the club's Casa Milan headquarters, after a season of discontent culminated in a protest asking owner Gerry Cardinale to sell up and leave. RedBird Capital Partners bought the club in June 2022, with Milan having just secured their first league title in 11 years, but the only trophy won since then was this year's Italian Super Cup, far below fans' expectations.

    "title": "How to travel without a phone",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Leaving your device at home might seem daunting, but it can result in a deeper connection to a place and more authentic interactions with locals. (Illustration: Weston Wei/The New York Times) In today’s hyperconnected world, traveling without a phone seems impossible, or at the very least, pointless. But for those who’ve done it, the experience can be rewarding and rejuvenating. In January, Soraya Lemboumba, 40, a project manager in Switzerland, spent 10 days in Panama on a phone-free trip. “It was absolutely life-changing,” she said. She said she awoke to the sounds of nature rather than an alarm and didn’t spend her time composing captions for social media in her head or use her phone to fill the silence. “I spent days immersed in pure presence,” she said. Thinking of disconnecting for your next trip? Here are some steps to start. Before leaving for the airport, decide whether you’re bringing a laptop or tablet or nothing at all. A laptop performs all the functions of your smartphone, but you’re less likely to bring it to dinner table or the beach. Then, if you’re bringing a device, write down a list of rules to govern your tech use throughout your trip. For example: A physical list codifies a system and eliminates temptation during those bored, anxious moments that inevitably arise during travel, which prompt you to grab your device. You can modify the rules throughout your trip if you feel they’re not working. Downloading app blocker extensions likeFreedom,ScreenZenandOpalcan block apps or websites like YouTube, Instagram and X for preset periods of time. Temporarily deleting apps is another effective way to prevent mindless scrolling. Most anxiety from phoneless travel centres on logistics, like what will happen at the airport or train station, where there are schedules, and possible delays and cancellations. As a rule of thumb, allow ample time for transportation — at least an extra hour to buffer against scheduling mishaps or contingencies. Without a phone to display e-tickets, you’ll need to rely on paper boarding passes. Most airlines will print them out for you at the kiosks free of charge. But be careful, some charge a fee per person, per direction, to print boarding passes. Avoid this fee by printing them out beforehand. With no airline app, you’ll need to remember to keep an eye on those monitors throughout the airport for delays and gate changes, and don’t hesitate to ask the gate attendants and airline employees for help or directions. Catherine Price, the author of How to Break Up With Your Phone, reminds us that digitised travel isn’t always desirable. “People forget that you can rely on paper,” Price said, “and the feeling of freedom outweighs any minor inconvenience.” When you arrive at your lodging, introduce yourself to the front desk and concierge, addressing them by their first names —a scientifically proven wayto curry favour, which can be helpful if you need directions printed or taxis hailed throughout your trip. To orient yourself near your hotel or other lodging, walk in increasingly larger concentric circles outward. Use physical maps and expect mistakes. The beauty of phoneless travel comes in the hiccups, as wrong turns often lead to incredible memories. You’ll find that youlearn a city faster by relying on your wits and not GPS,which is a thrilling realisation. Write down the full address of your accommodations and keep it safely tucked into your wallet in case you get lost. Worst-case scenario, show it to a taxi driver or a local. In place of a translator app, pick up a phrase book to carry with you (Lonely Planet’s, in numerous languages, cost around US$12). If you adopt a conversationalist’s mind-set, your trip will blossom in special, unforeseen ways. If you’re confronted with a QR code for, say, museum entry, merely explain your situation to the person behind you and ask to tag along, giving them cash for the ticket. This is how you unexpectedly make friends and access the serendipity of travel. Purchase a disposable camera or a digital camera , and practice a philosophy of intention — take one picture of something you want to remember, then put your camera away. “Every time you take a picture on vacation, you take yourself out of the moment,” Price said. “You get too wrapped up in photos, especially if you’re taking them to post on social media for others. Don’t perform your vacation. Live it.” Writing in a journal at the end of the day can solidify the memories you’ve made. Instead of looking back through pictures on your phone, you can read your vacation and relive these cherished memories in a more illustrative way. Taking “mental snapshots” helped Lemboumba internalise memories by mindfully soaking in experiences as they happened. “The moments I didn’t photograph are, ironically, now the ones I remember the most vividly,” she said. The prospect of an emergency keeps many from attempting phoneless travel, butreal emergencies are rare. The emergencies you’re likely to face are practical ones, like missing a train. These may seem catastrophic in the moment, but with the right attitude they’re nothing more than speed bumps. Since you won’t have Apple Pay or similar services, in addition to a credit card, carry US$200 to US$300 in local currency in a secured travel bag that straps across your body. (Cash is handy for extricating yourself from sticky situations.) For female solo travellers who are anxious about phoneless travel, buy a prepaid burner phone  and stick it in the bottom of your backpack. You can always borrow a phone in a time of crisis, and always let loved ones know your itinerary ahead of time. If phoneless solo travel feels too daunting, consider joining a group. Grace Borges, a 35-year-old research analyst from Washington, attended a five-day phoneless trip to Cuba last year withFTLO Travel, which specialises in group travel for young professionals. The tour guide handled logistics, and because she was in a group, “sticking to the phoneless ethos was easier because everyone was in the same boat,” she said. Remember in moments of stress: Everyone travelled this way just a few decades ago.

    "title": "Amid Trump tariffs, ASEAN summit to prioritise new trade links with other powers: Analysts",
    "article_text": "Asia Asia The 46th ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur this week could see steps towards greater cooperation with China and Gulf states, experts say. Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has urged ASEAN to engage “new partners” such as India, Pakistan, Russia and the European Union. Malaysia is set to host the 46th ASEAN Summit at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre. (Photo: CNA/Fadza Ishak) This audio is generated by an AI tool. KUALA LUMPUR: Diversification is likely to be the underlying theme at the upcoming 46th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, as the bloc seeks new partnerships and closer ties with other major powers to cushion the impact from United States President Donald Trump's tariffs and isolationist policies, analysts say. The US will not be present at the summits held at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre on Monday (May 26) and Tuesday, but Trump's shadow looms large as uncertainty lingers over what he might do after a90-day pause on steeper reciprocal tariffsslapped on most of the world ends in July. \"Malaysia, as the ASEAN chair, may push for ASEAN to diversify economic partnerships to minimise the impact of Trump's tariffs,\" said Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a research fellow in the Southeast Asia programme at the Lowy Institute think tank in Australia. \"Trump’s tariffs are an accelerator for ASEAN to expand its strategic partnerships.\" Subscribe to CNA’s Morning BriefAn automated curation of our top stories to start your day.This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U.

Gathering at the foot of the iconic Petronas Twin Towers, leaders of the 10 ASEAN member states could discuss a potential expansion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world’s largest free trade agreement (FTA) comprising 30 per cent of the world’s total gross domestic product and population, observers said. The ASEAN-driven RCEP comprises the 10 ASEAN countries as well as Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. The first-ever ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-China summit, a brainchild of Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, will also be held on Tuesday,with Chinese Premier Li Qiang attending. The GCC comprises six Arab states including major oil producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. The GCC's total commodity trade with China reached almost US$298 billion in 2023 while the bloc accounted for 36 per cent of China's total crude oil imports that year, according to United Nations figures. This trilateral summit could yield more infrastructure and digital cooperation under China’s Belt and Road framework, said Jamil Ghani, a doctoral candidate at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. But Jamil, who has done research on Malaysia’s foreign policy, said these moves do not mean ASEAN is choosing sides in times of economic uncertainty. \"These engagements reflect diversification, not realignment,” he told CNA. “ASEAN continues to value ties with the US, but recent frustrations – particularly over the limited progress under the US’ Indo-Pacific Economic Framework – have created room for China and the GCC to expand their influence.” At a briefing with local and foreign media on May 21, Anwar said ASEAN will discuss Timor-Leste’s potential membership,the Myanmar issue, improving intra-ASEAN trade, as well as economic collaboration amid the US tariffs. Anwar was asked if ASEAN would continue its policy of maintaining good relationships with both the US and China, and if this position could be abused by either power to their advantage. “As a trading nation, if we do not venture to new markets and build up that resilience nationally and also regionally, we will not win. So, that’s the most pragmatic decision we should make,” Anwar said, speaking for Malaysia. “Domestically, we have problems with all our neighbours as a maritime country. And people say, ‘Oh, you're being biased towards China, because you don't seem to say that there are problems.’ I said we have problems with all our neighbours.” While Anwar acknowledged Malaysia's dependence on the US for trade and investment, he said he cannot accept a “tendency to dictate”. Countries must be allowed to decide in their own interests and not be swayed by rivalries between major powers, he said, calling on ASEAN to engage “new partners” such as China, India, Pakistan, Russia and the European Union. “It's a call for assertiveness and independence,” Anwar added. According to a draft statement expected to be issued by ASEAN leaders after they meet on Monday, the blocwill express \"deep concern\" over Trump's tariff blitz, AFP reported on Friday. Trump's unilateral levies \"pose complex and multidimensional challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration\", the draft said. Anwar first invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to join the ASEAN-GCC summit during his official visit to Shanghai and Beijing in November last year. It was during that time that Trump emerged victorious in the US presidential election, with countries around the world already wary of how the US-China trade war might escalate regardless of who won. “The plan to invite China to the second ASEAN-GCC summit was conceived before the US elections, in which Donald Trump won a landslide victory,” noted a December 2024 article by ThinkChina, a Singapore-based online magazine focused on China. “The election results prompted these partners to expand their coordination. All three have varying degrees of uncertainty and concerns about future US policies.” The first ASEAN-GCC summit took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2023, where both regional blocs outlined their five-year agenda and decided to hold a biennial summit, alternating between the GCC and ASEAN regions. A joint statement from that summit agreed to “enhance trade and investment flows”, with a focus on areas like sustainable infrastructure, petrochemicals, agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, connectivity and digitalisation. Anwar said at the May 21 briefing that the GCC nations have good ties with both the US and China, and are “really focusing on ASEAN”. “So, we thought that we should use this occasion to try and build up probably some projects that involve a few countries – sub-regional, if not regional. There is probably a fund, so that we can work together,” he said, without elaborating on what type of fund this would be. Sharon Seah, senior fellow and coordinator of the ASEAN Studies Centre at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said the ASEAN-GCC-China summit is the first time that one of ASEAN’s inter-regional summits has been expanded to involve a dialogue partner. “The ASEAN-GCC summit itself, having only met once prior, has not found a comfortable pace and tempo to their discussions,” she told CNA. “The deviation from the usual bilateral format of engagement to a trilateral engagement makes it somewhat challenging in terms of agenda setting.” China has said it is prepared to collaborate with ASEAN and GCC member states to enhance mutually beneficial partnerships and safeguard the legitimate development rights of all parties, Bernama reported on May 9. China’s relative silence on the expected outcomes of this trilateral might be an indication that Beijing is unsure what it can derive from the summit, Seah said. “While we can understand PM Anwar’s strategic rationale behind convening a trilateral with China – promotion of greater South-South cooperation, diversifying ASEAN’s strategic options and forming new trade alliances in the face of the US’ tariff war – it is difficult to see how and what deliverables the summit can produce,” she said. “Nonetheless, it would be another useful occasion for China to repeat its call to uphold international rules-based order and oppose unilateralism.” Abdul Rahman said he does not expect an “immediate impact or outcome” from the ASEAN-GCC and ASEAN-GCC-China meetings, other than a general statement expressing concerns about Trump’s tariffs, or a statement of intent or memoranda of understanding to work closer together on the economic front. Despite that, Jamil said the GCC is becoming a more important partner for ASEAN in energy, food security, Islamic finance, and investment flows. This has certainly been the case at the bilateral level. For instance, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement on Jan 14 this year. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto went on a five-nation Middle East tour in April and announced that Qatar is set to invest US$2 billion in his country’s new sovereign wealth fund Danantara. Premier Li Qiang’s expected presence reaffirms China’s strategic interest in Southeast Asia, Jamil said. “ASEAN, however, will likely calibrate its messaging to avoid the impression of strategic alignment with Beijing,\" he added. Beyond China and the Gulf states, Seah said Malaysia as ASEAN chair could discuss an expansion of RCEP membership to include more of ASEAN’s major trading partners, such as the United Kingdom and European Union. ASEAN could also explore other ways to diversify trade outside of the region, including with Latin American countries, she said. “Trade has always been the lifeline of ASEAN so I expect that the ASEAN Geoeconomics Task Force will give a preliminary update to the leaders on its progress and plans going forward,” she said. Besides RCEP, Seah said it could be worth “thinking outside the box” about how other trade agreements like the CPTPP might benefit from the admission of others looking to join, referring to China, Taiwan, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Ecuador. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA abandoned by the first Trump administration, comprises 12 economies. They are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Minister Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz said ASEAN is seeking to expand its membership in RCEP and CPTPP, the Vietnam News Agency reported on May 20. The minister said the matter was discussed when he chaired the ASEAN Caucus Meeting held in Jeju, South Korea. He noted that only four ASEAN members were part of the CPTPP. The US tariffs have had a significant impact on intra-ASEAN trade dynamics as well as that with trading partners, particularly in sectors entrenched in the global supply chains, Tengku Zafrul added. ASEAN could think of spearheading a supply-chain resilience network with its most important trading partners like China, Japan, South Korea and the European Union, Seah said. Ninety per cent of ASEAN’s enterprise landscape comprises small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME), and Southeast Asian SMEs form a “significant part” of the global supply chain, she said. “SMEs are the first casualties of any disruption given their size and lack of capacity to deal with volatile changes,” she added. “ASEAN countries might think of setting up a dedicated SME subgroup under the Geoeconomics Task Force to help ASEAN SMEs survive the trade war.” Within ASEAN, Malaysia is expected to call on members to speed up regional economic integration, roll back protectionist behaviour, and commit to “aggressively remove” non-tariff barriers among members, Seah said. Malaysia is also expected to push for supply chain diversification, acceleration of RCEP implementation, and theDigital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) as a digital economic counterweight, Jamil said. ASEAN members are hoping to conclude discussions on its DEFA, touted as the first regional digital trade pact of its kind, by the end of 2025. It aims to transform ASEAN into a leading digital economy, through greater digital integration as well as inclusive growth and development. “While the formal agenda will avoid controversy, digital sovereignty–including concerns over data governance, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure–may quietly emerge in sideline discussions, given increasing strategic competition in this space,” Jamil said. ASEAN is unlikely to issue a collective response to new US tariffs, given its non-binding, consensus-based structure, Jamil said. However, he expects ASEAN to “adopt language around ‘inclusive, rules-based trade’ - signalling concern over global protectionism without naming the US”. Jamil said Russia’s “growing presence” in Southeast Asia–particularly through defence and energy diplomacy–might also be “acknowledged quietly at the summit’s margins”. During his four-day visit to Russia earlier in May, Anwar had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend the East Asia Summit in October, one of several meetings involving ASEAN dialogue partners.The May trip was Anwar’s second visit to Russia in less than a year, coming as Malaysia pushes for full membership in theBRICS grouping of emerging economies. The group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among other countries, and in January this year Indonesia became the first ASEAN member to formally join. Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are partner countries. Indonesia’s Prabowo had also visited Russia as president-elect in July last year, and he will make his first official visit to the country in June, with the signing of a Eurasian bloc trade deal reportedly high on the agenda. BRICS has been “surprisingly low on activity” in the face of Trump’s tariff war, Seah said. The group, like ASEAN, could only go as far as issuing a statement on a collective position as members pursue their own bilateral negotiations with the US, she reckoned. “I do not foresee more ASEAN members expressing an active interest in BRICS apart from those who are already partner members,” she added. “If any other ASEAN countries were interested, it would be useful to take a wait-and-see approach during this time while waiting for the trade volatility to come down a little and to see what obligations Indonesia needs to fulfil as a member of BRICS.” ASEAN member states’ interest in partnering BRICS countries does not mean the Southeast Asian bloc is “shifting towards China or Russia”, Abdul Rahman said. \"Traditionally, ASEAN has always been non-aligned and neutral,” he said. In the longer term, Abdul Rahman pointed to a likely shift for ASEAN states: Relying less on the US in economy and trade, and expanding economic cooperation with other partners to “soften the blow of an unpredictable US”. “Establishing more partnerships with China and Russia, or any other blocs such as the GCC, means that ASEAN does not want to be overly reliant on one power, but wants to broaden its engagements with as many partners as possible,” he added.

    "title": "Commentary: The DIY guide to checking how well you’re ageing",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Ageing is like a jigsaw puzzle. Physical health, mental agility, emotional balance, social connection – they all matter and they all interact, say these lecturers. Ageing well is about knowing yourself – your body, your mind and your values – and making small, meaningful changes that help you feel more you. (Photo: iStock/hxyume) ABERYSTWYTH, Wales:A few years ago, a social media trend challenged people to see if they could stand up from the floor without using their hands. Now, it’s all about how long you can balance on one leg while brushing your teeth. These quirky “tests” promise to tell us how well we’re ageing – but do they really? When we talk about“ageing well”, we’re usually referring to both physical and psychological well-being. That includes feeling good (hedonic well-being) and finding meaning and purpose (eudaimonic well-being). Engaging in activities and monitoring ourselves plays a role in both. But ageing isn’t just about how strong your grip is or how fast you can walk. It’s a complex mix of physical, cognitive, emotional and social changes – and no single test capturesthe whole picture. Physically, one simple measure that gets a lot of attention is walking speed. According to one famous study, people who walk faster than 1.32m per second were less likely to die in the next three years – jokingly framed as “too fast for the Grim Reaper to catch”. On the flip side, a slower walking speed – below 0.8m per second – can be a sign of sarcopenia, a condition involving reduced muscle mass, muscle strength and physical function. These are all important indicators of age-related decline. But while these markers are useful, they’re not easy to measure at home. Most research relies on specialist equipment and your local GP probably doesn’t have a grip-strength dynamometer sitting in a drawer. But they could time how long it takes you to stand up and sit down five times from a chair. So, what can you realistically do to track your own ageing? To truly understand how you’re ageing, it helps to think beyond physical health. Mental sharpness, emotional resilience andsocial connectionmatter just as much. One helpful idea is to assess your cognitive fitness, which includes skills like attention, memory and flexibility. Here are some cognitive tests you can try at home: Trail making test:Connect numbers and letters in sequence (1, A, 2, B, etc) and time how long it takes. This measures your ability to switch between tasks. Stroop task:Challenges your ability to ignore competing information. Try saying the colour of a word, not the word itself – like saying “red” when you see the word “blue” printed in red ink. It’s harder than it sounds! Dual-task challenge:Walk at your normal speed while counting backwards from 100 in threes. If your walking speed changes significantly, it could indicate cognitive strain. These kinds of tasks test how well your brain handles competing demands – a key ability that becomes even more important as we age. This skill is known as cognitive flexibility and it helps you adapt to changing situations, switch between tasks and manage distractions. Trying out these tests is great, but how do you know if you’re improving? After all, when you have spent time trying to improve your walking speed, or Stroop ability – or even rubbing your head, patting your belly while saying the Finnish alphabet out loud – it’s important to know if you are seeing benefits. Some measures, like single-leg stance, can vary wildly from day to day – or even hour to hour. You might get better just from repeating it, which doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ageing better, just that you’ve practised. Others, like grip strength, change very slowly even with regular strength training. And some improvements are task-specific: getting better at the trail making test doesn’t necessarily make you sharper at doingWordle. That’s why it helps to complete the test a few times at the start, then retest yourself once a month or so – again, doing it a couple of times – to track any improvements. Cognitive changes may be slower to notice than physical ones, so regular checks can help reveal progress over time. There’s no single test or score that can capture how well you’re ageing. Think of it more like a jigsaw puzzle. Physical health, mental agility, emotional balance, social connection – they all matter and they all interact. And, of course, even if you perform well now, some changes in the future may be beyond your control. No test can fully predict what lies ahead. At the end of the day, maybe the best sign of ageing well isn’t how fast you walk or how long you can stand on one leg – it’s how you feel about your life. Are you feeling engaged, content, connected? Tools like the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience can help you take stock of your emotional well-being. This short, 12-question survey asks about your everyday feelings – from joy and calm to sadness and frustration – offering insight into both the pleasurable (hedonic) and meaningful (eudaimonic) sides of well-being. Ageing well isn’t about beating a stopwatch or acing a memory test. It’s about knowing yourself – your body, your mind and your values – and making small, meaningful changes that help you feel more you. So, go ahead, stand on one leg if you like. But don’t forget to check in with your brain, body, emotions and your sense of purpose too.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport PARIS :Holders Paris St Germain cruised to a 3-0 victory over Stade de Reims in the Coupe de France final on Saturday, claiming a third domestic trophy for the second successive season, and preparing for next week's Champions League final in style. Luis Enrique's Ligue 1 champions and French Super Cup winners had little trouble seeing off relegation-battling Reims, with all the goals in the opening half at the Stade de France as PSG strolled to a record-extending 16th French Cup win. PSG went on the attack from the off, and while Reims managed the first shot on target - Amadou Kone's long-range effort never troubling goalkeeper Matvey Safonov - they offered little opposition over the 90 minutes. Russian Safonov was chosen ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma but otherwise Luis Enrique selected his strongest side, although Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, named in the initial starting 11, was replaced by Desire Doue before kickoff.

Goals from Nick Woltemade, Millot and Deniz Undav put Stuttgart 3-0 up at the break before Millot scored again to make it 4-0 after 66 minutes and effectively end the contest. Bielefeld did pull a goal back through substitute Julian Kania eight minutes from time before Stuttgart's Josha Vagnoman netted an own goal in the 85th but it was too little, too late. The win was Stuttgart's fourth German Cup success and earned a place in the Europa League's league phase. They finished the Bundesliga campaign ninth, two points off the European spots.

    "title": "Rescuers say 9 children of Gaza doctor couple killed in Israeli strike",
    "article_text": "World World People take part in a protest demanding the end of the war and immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, May 24, 2025. (Photo: AP/Leo Correa) GAZA CITY: Gaza's civil defence agency said Saturday (May 24) that an Israeli strike in the southern city of Khan Younis killed nine children of a pair of married doctors, with the Israeli army saying it was reviewing the reports. Israel has stepped up its campaign in Gaza in recent days, drawing international criticism as well as calls to allow in more supplies after it partially eased a total blockade on aid imposed on Mar 2. Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the agency had retrieved \"the bodies of nine child martyrs, some of them charred, from the home of Dr Hamdi al-Najjar and his wife, Dr Alaa al-Najjar, all of whom were their children\". He added that Hamdi al-Najjar and another son, Adam, were also seriously wounded in the strike on Friday. A medical source at Nasser Hospital, where Alaa al-Najjar works, gave Adam's age as 10 years old. Footage of the aftermath released by the civil defence agency showed rescuers recovering badly burned remains from the damaged home. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military said it had \"struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure\" near its troops. \"The Khan Yunis area is a dangerous warzone,\" it added. \"The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.\" The army had issued an evacuation warning for the city on Monday. The children's funeral took place at Nasser Hospital, AFP footage showed. Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said on X that the strike happened shortly after Hamdi Al-Najjar returned home from driving his wife to work. \"This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain,\" he said, accusing Israel of \"wiping out entire families\". Bassal told AFP that Israeli strikes killed at least 15 people on Saturday across Gaza. He said the dead included a couple who were killed with their two young children in a pre-dawn strike on a house in the Amal quarter of Khan Yunis. To the west of the city, at least five people were killed by a drone strike on a crowd of people that had gathered to wait for aid trucks, he added. At Nasser Hospital, tearful mourners gathered Saturday around white-shrouded bodies outside. \"Suddenly, a missile from an F-16 destroyed the entire house, and all of them were civilians - my sister, her husband and their children,\" said Wissam Al-Madhoun. \"What did this child do to (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu?\" In a statement, the military said that over the past day the air force had struck more than 100 targets across the territory. Israel resumed operations in Gaza on Mar 18,ending a two-month ceasefire. Gaza's health ministry said Saturday that at least 3,747 people had been killed in the territory since then, taking the war's overall toll to 53,901, mostly civilians. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday that Palestinians were enduring \"the cruellest phase\" of the war in Gaza, where Israel's lengthy blockade has led to widespread shortages of food and medicine. Limited aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip restarted on Monday for the first time since Mar 2. The Gaza City municipality, meanwhile, warned Saturday of \"a potential large-scale water crisis\" due to a lack of supplies needed to repair damaged infrastructure. Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Militants also took 251 hostages, 57 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military said are dead. Demonstrators gathered yet again in Tel Aviv on Saturday night for their regular protest calling for the captives' freedom, carrying a giant banner that read \"Save the hostages, end the war\". \"We want the war to end now because we see ... that the war will not lead to the release of the hostages, and that it will bring more death, more misery on both sides,\" demonstrator Jonathan Adereth told AFP. Early Saturday morning, Israel's National Cyber Directorate said it had received \"numerous inquiries\" regarding citizens \"receiving phone calls in which recordings are played featuring the voice of a hostage, sounds of explosions and screams\". Israeli media said the calls featured audio apparently taken from a video of hostage Yosef Haim Ohana published by Hamas earlier this month. \"This is an attempt to sow panic and confusion among the public,\" the directorate said of the calls, adding \"the matter is under investigation\".

    "title": "The Best Clint Eastwood Movies (Including A Few You've Probably Never Seen)",
    "article_text": "Clint Eastwood just can’t quit the movies. Technically, he’s been making them for seven full decades; 1955’sRevenge of the Creature, in which he made his (uncredited) screen debut, recently celebrated its 70th anniversary (or anyway, it could have). He might now be retired from acting, but on the other hand, who knows? He’s been credibly preparing farewell pictures for a solid 30-plus years;Unforgivenwould be a capstone achievement of so many careers, but its Oscar win wound up inspiring more of the westerns it darkly eulogized, and launchedEastwood’s career into at least its third act, if not its fourth or fifth. The best Clint Eastwood movies are not all of a somber mood, though. Those multiple potential goodbyes over the years have felt earned, not just because he’s made himself more scarce as an on-screen presence over the last couple of decades, but because he’s logged so much time in traditional star vehicles. Eastwood first came into prominence as a star of the TV Western seriesRawhide, and made plenty more big-screen Westerns after that; he’s also done a lot of cop movies, war pictures, crime pictures…thrillers, mostly, that sometimes turn out to be more like dramas about the effects of violence, or explorations of American myths. (Sadly,Revenge of the Creatureis, to date, his only monster movie.) There’s a lot to sort through, and many of his movies are thoroughly watchable by virtue of him holding the screen with that squinty, steely presence that still somehow holds a little surprise in the moments where it gives way to moments of warmth and humor. Still: Not all Clint Eastwood movies are created equal, and the goal here is to choose some of his best and, in some cases, less appreciated films for streaming. Selecting a dozen movies from a filmography of over 60 films requires both some degree of arbitrary preferences and some enforcement of limitations. First: These are classical Clint Eastwood movies in the sense that they starClint Eastwood. Since the 2000s, the majority of his films have been directing-only projects, and between those and the many self-directed vehicles he made before that period, the Eastwood directorial filmography is a whole other thing. Eastwood behind the camera doesn’t disqualify a movie from this list (if it did, there wouldn’t be much beyond the 1970s), but this group is intended as a sampling of his best work as amovie star, not as an accomplished filmmaker. Second: A number of canonized titles have been eliminated automatically. Does anyone need to be told to check outThe Good, the Bad, and the Uglyor the rest of theMan with No Nametrilogy? Those movies, along with the fiveDirty Harrypictures (more of a catch-’em-on-cable type of deal after the first one, anyway), are not represented here, nor are Eastwood’s two Best Picture winners,UnforgivenandMillion Dollar Baby. Those films feature two of his best performances and deservedly won him a pair of Best DirectorOscars, too. They also grossed $100 million apiece in North America so maybe you’ve already seen them. You definitely should if not. Same goes for the aforementioned Leone trilogy. But if those are the only Eastwood pictures you’ve seen and you’re interested in going beyond the obvious classics, you should check out these movies, too—a selection spanning half a century of cinema, presented here in chronological order. It’s tempting to start withCoogan’s Bluff, a prototypical cop-action movie (beloved byQuentin Tarantino) that bridged Eastwood’s transition from Western hero to cop-movie mainstay and marked the beginning of his long collaboration with director and mentor Don Siegel. That would also give us a token ‘60s movie for this list, further emphasizing Eastwood’s incredible multi-decade reach. But the fact is, Siegel and Eastwood’s third filmThe Beguiledis just plain better, even accounting for the fact thatSofia Coppola’s 2017 remake is better still. A Western-ish premise that gets led into a melodrama hothouse, Eastwood plays a Union soldier who recovers from his injuries at a small all-girls school in Mississippi and essentially drives a variety of ladies mad with desire. No surprise that Coppola’s version does a better job of fleshing out the female characters in this story, but Siegel’sThe Beguiledhas a sweaty power all its own, and has a richer, bleaker psychology than the other 1971 Eastwood movie where his raw sexuality spurs unexpected violence,Play Misty For Me. That one’s an interesting proto-stalker movie, but at this stage in Clint’s career, he’s still in better hands with Siegel. The fact that Eastwood continued to make a lot of westerns in the 1970s as some of his contemporaries were ensconced in the New Hollywood movement is an example of his canny instincts as both a movie star and, eventually, a filmmaker. Though Westerns weren’t at the low ebb they’d reach in the ‘80s, that’s partially because Eastwood was able to apply his star power to both pulpy genre exercises and more modern-feeling revisionism.Joe Kiddisn’t one of his better-known of either group; it leans more toward pulp, but it has some 1970s notes to it, both in its politics (Mexican peasants are victimized by an American land baron) and its casting (the land baron is played byRobert Duvall!). Eastwood plays the titular Kidd, an out-for-himself bounty hunter reluctantly roped into the hunt for a Mexican revolutionary; John Sturges, who made the excellentBad Day at Black Rockas well as meat-and-potatoes classics likeThe Magnificent SevenandThe Great Escape, directed, and Western aficionado Elmore Leonard scripted, and the whole thing is 88 minutes long. Eventually, Leonard’s distinctive dialogue gives way to an action climax, but it’s a pretty damn good one—Eastwood drives a train into a saloon!—and you can hear Leonard’s rhythms pretty clearly before then, even if it’s not quite as instantly recognizable as his crime stories. Eastwood looks appropriately disoriented to find himself playing opposite a live-wireJeff Bridgesin director Michael Cimino’s rambling road movie, which isn’t precisely the buddy-comedy version ofBadlands, but isn’t way off from that, either. Disguised bank robber “The Thunderbolt” (Eastwood) happens upon a getaway ride from Lightfoot (Bridges), and they elude Thunderbolt’s old criminal gang (including a blustery George Kennedy!) until reversing course and planning a heist with them. It’s a ramshackle crime comedy, more suffused with oddball attitude than outright gags or funny dialogue, but Cimino (making his first feature, and his only one with Eastwood) has an eye for scenic America that makes the landscape feel as distinctive as any number of Eastwood westerns. Eastwood’s persona often resists blatant oddities, even when they’re actively happening around him on screen, soThunderbolt and Lightfootis especially notable for how well it positions its star within a genuinely strange movie. The final Siegel/Eastwood joint involves breaking out from the ultimate joint, and there’s a nonzero chance thatEscape from Alcatrazlooms large in the mind of our imbecilic president as he fantasizes about reopening the famous, long-decommissioned island prison. Don’t hold that against this film, which for anyone paying attention is very much about how the inherent inhumanity of a high-security prison inspires an elaborate escape as a vastly preferable option if you can swing it—perhaps less obviously political than Eastwood’s later movies that include a healthy distrust of authority, yet still of a piece with them in a more popcorn mode. Siegel, returning to the territory of his earlyRiot in Cell Block 11, doesn’t miss a step in his taut, no-fuss, yet graphically striking direction. The combination of location shooting and embellished real-life origins (there really was an Alcatraz break-out shortly before the prison’s closing in 1963—just before Eastwood became a movie star!) also make the movie a compelling sorta-historical document. The connection between the American West and the American Circus is rich territory not often mined by the American Cinema, maybe because some filmmakers would prefer not to align themselves with the carny-barking side of the performance arts. Robert Altman, tellingly, had no trouble with this idea when he madeBuffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson, though the movie was a big post-Nashville flop and seems like the kind of thing that would inspire a trademark squint of disgust from our man Clint. Yet whether in a fit of reaction, inspiration, or just plain coincidence, Eastwood made his own foray into the Wild West Circus territory a few years later withBronco Billy, a low-key little dramedy where he leads a ramshackle group of cowboy-themed performers (largely, as it turns out, ex-cons) in a traveling show. There’s some silly business where a haughty rich woman (Eastwood’s longtime partner Sonda Locke) joins up after accidentally faking her own murder and falls in love with Bronco Billy (that’s what everyone calls Eastwood’s character, like awestruck kids). The movie isn’t often laugh-out-loud funny, but Eastwood wholeheartedly embraces the notion of misfits deciding to play at being cowboys, even if their backgrounds more closely resemble, well, Eastwood’s real-life origins as a suburban kid and odd-job troublemaker. Naturally, a diverse crowd of performers and audience members winds up gathering under a big tent stitched together from American flags, a sweetly optimistic image in the midst of Eastwood’s American ambivalence. As mentioned, there are particular genres Eastwood obviously favors, especially as a star, and he’s never really ventured into horror. But a few of his thrillers have a tangential relationship to that genre, like the stalker moviePlay Misty For Me, and this variation on the cop/serial killer duel, which came at a time when slasher-movie aesthetics were merging with neo-noir to create seedy new alleyways in the crime genre. It may be his most overtly ‘80s-style thriller, written and nominally directed by Richard Tuggle (Eastwood is said to have taken over much of the production; reading behind-the-scenes info on his semiregular clashes with other directors, even some of his favorites, it’s no wonder that he directed more and more of his own films as the years passed). Eastwood’s Wes Block, a cop investigating a serial killer and rapist, has sexual kinks of his own in a way that the actor rarely explores on screen, raising some uneasy feelings about whether he might turn out to be the guilty party (especially when juxtaposed with the sweet scenes of Eastwood as a single father to his two daughters, one played by his real-life kid Alison). Total potboiler stuff, notable less for Eastwood elevating the material than submitting to its sleazy but sometimes oddly thought-provoking. Considering how Eastwood’s own directorial career aided him sidestepping ever working with the major ‘70s movie brats (no Spielberg,Scorsese,Coppola, etc.), this is probably the closest thing to him doing a Brian De Palma movie, even released the same year as the (much better, admittedly)Body Double. In addition to the famous “Dollars” trilogy for Sergio Leone, Eastwood has another, even less formally connected group of three self-directed westerns that I think of as his Dead Cowboy trilogy:HIgh Plains Drifter, where his unnamed character seems to be the ghost of a lawman;The Outlaw Josey Wales, where his character lives, but is said to be shot down, giving him a chance at a fresh start; andPale Rider, where Eastwood is once again a ghostly figure, though even more ambiguously so. All three are worthwhile and favorites will vary, but there’s something particularly stark and effective aboutPale Rider, and it especially stands out for its release in 1985, which would be one of the most Western-less dead zones in the genre’s Hollywood history if not for this movie andSilveradomounting a surprise (and relatively short-lived) comeback. There’s a satisfying ironic contrast between Eastwood’s totemic stature on screen and having him play a man who takes on a ghostly air (even when carrying on an affair with an earthly woman)—fully present, yet spiritually removed on some unseeable level. Starting with 1992’sUnforgiven, Eastwood made semi-regularly farewell pictures. Interestingly, one that stuck was this not particularly elegiac summer action thriller, perhaps because it was bidding farewell to something highly specific: This would prove to be Eastwood’s final big-budget thriller made with someone else at the helm, in this case Wolfgang Petersen. (Depending on how you define “big-budget thriller,” it’s almost his final one of those, full stop, butAbsolute PowerandTrue Crimeprobably count.) He’s had several hits since, butIn the Line of Fire, released in a glorious Summer of Middle Age that also saw later-career hits fromHarrison Fordand Sean Connery, still feels like his last traditional blockbuster, where the Eastwood persona is secondary (if only just barely) to the hoary thriller business at hand. He plays Frank Horrigan, a veteran Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy, on the trail of a new potential assassin played by an Oscar-nominatedJohn Malkovich. This is simply a terrific popcorn picture, which Eastwood anchors with flinty charm; yes, Rene Russo had chemistry with every actor she shared the screen with during the ‘90s, but they still give off some old-fashioned sparks here. Several of Eastwood’s finest films as a director won Oscars for their trouble, canonizing them and eliminating them from the need to discuss them here.A Perfect World, on the other hand, underperformed at the box office and received zero Oscar nominations. But is nonetheless one of his best, making 1993 a contender for the best of his career. In what was advertised as a titanic team-up,Kevin Costnerplays an escaped convict who abducts a young boy, while Eastwood plays the lawman on his trail. But the movie defies expectations of a taut thriller, and instead is a meditation on how abuse and violence echo through generations, a problem with a solution both blindingly simple at the outset and impossibly complicated once set into motion. Costner delivers one of his finest performances, and Eastwood gives him the space to do so, as both actor and director. It almost feels like a lost ‘70s classic, moreso than many of the more commercial films Eastwood actually made during that decade. Robert James Waller’s schmaltzterpiece of a novel, which may have spontaneously willed the USA Today bestseller list into existence, was a hot property back in the mid-90s, and lots of fans blanched at the idea of Eastwood both directing the film, and starring as the sensitive photographer Robert Kincaid, who has a brief but powerful affair with Italy-to-Iowa housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) over the course of a few days in 1965. Eastwood does indeed have to play a solid decade younger as Kincaid, but his age increases the tension of his character, an older man living a sort of proto-hippie lifestyle. (In other words, he resists any temptation to turn him into a pure cowboy.) Streep and Eastwood both do heartbreakingly lovely work in this restrained adaptation; as a director, Eastwood can falter when his actors could benefit from a lot of takes, but these two (and they are the only two in so many of their scenes), ah, quite evidently do not. The vulnerability and sadness Eastwood shows in that shot of him standing in the rain is one of the most powerful of his career, in front of the camera and behind it. You’d never know this was some ‘90s-fad shlock from watching the movie now. There have been a lot of 21st century movies where a quartet of old guys or old gals, usually played by an all-star roster of cinema icons, gets together to show the world that they’re not licked yet, dammit. Eastwood didn’t invent this subgenre withSpace Cowboys; old people have always yearned to show them young’ns. He did, however, establish a clear template with vastly more dignity than theLast Vegases that followed, sending himself, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and James Garner into space on a mission that becomes a race to stop the accidental launch of nuclear missiles. Though the old guys do triumph over younger, computer-savvy astronauts with their old-fashioned know-how, this isn’t just a revenge of the old; there’s real poignancy in characters who began as aspiring astronauts in the Air Force before NASA took over the program circling back and getting another shot at the wonder of space travel, and continues the Eastwoodian tradition of exploring the cultural reverberations of the 1960s from a less boomer-centric vantage. A few years after this movie (and the slightly underrated if far sillierBlood Work), Eastwood more or less retired from popcorn movies and turned his attention to more self-consciously serious directorial work, often chronicling various events, incidents, and curios from 20th century American history. It’s interesting stuff, yet there’s also value in the fully fictional and blithely entertaining ways thatSpace Cowboysgoes about a similar task. “Let’s jump forward 21 years” is not something we can productively, casually say about many of our big-screen icons. Look: Of the multiple Eastwood movies that function as an elegiac goodbye to his actorly persona and/or favorite genre,Cry Machois not the finest. It might actually be the weakest, on normal-movie terms? (Well, at least outside ofTrouble with the Curve, a baseball-centric trifle Eastwood tossed to his longtime producer that’s watchable mainly for Clint and Amy Adams.)Cry Machoisn’t as mournful or tough or beautifully made asUnforgiven, or as moving asMillion Dollar Baby. It’s not as consistently fun asGran Torino. And it’s not as WTF in its old-man hang-ups asThe Mule. On the other hand, it’s a 2021 movie whose star has been famous since the 1960s. It’s a movie made when its leading man, not an indie novelty act or character actor, but a bona fide movie star, was 90 years old. Given how many Hollywood legends have retired well before 75 and how many human beings expire well before 90, there’s something gently miraculous about a low-key little movie where Eastwood plays a former rodeo star who accompanies a kid to Mexico to reunite with his family. The recentJuror No. 2, which Eastwood directed but didn’t star in, was more a reclamation of his fastball, but it’s also fine for a ninetysomething to take a break from fastballs;Cry Machoshows the value of a slow curve, one that gives its star little trouble.",

    "title": "Did a Watch Brand Just Reveal the Next James Bond?",
    "article_text": "Of all the Swiss watch brands,Omegais perhaps most adept at strategic leaks. (See: Daniel Craig showing off a new, unreleasedSeamasterandSpeedmaster.) So our antennas were raised when it was announced that actorAaron Taylor-Johnson—one of the leading candidates to succeed Craig as 007—is now officially an Omega brand ambassador. It could merely be a huge coincidence or a sign of things to come… Of course, such a signing isn’t a sure thing reJames Bond. Taylor-Johnson is a big deal in his own right and few brands are as aggressive as Omega when it comes to snapping up talent. The brand could very well have added him to its staple by simple virtue of his significant talent as a thespian. But given the Swiss watchmaker’s proclivity for teasing significant news via its brand ambassadors, we’re inclined to think otherwise. Taylor-Johnson has beenrumored to take over as 007 for years now. His name has been throw around with such frequency that evenPierce Brosnangave him a co-sign. Plus, Taylor-Johnson checks all the boxes: tall, British, handsome… and now he’s even got the right watches. Then again, the Bond role is perhaps the most important lead of any film franchise on the planet, and those leading the franchise, which isnow under Amazon’s control, has a habit of picking what initially seem less than sure things. (It turned out beautifully with Craig, much to the chagrin of many who derided his…blondness.) Our only horological hint that ATJ is perhaps not the next fictional MI6 agent with a license to kill is the watch he wore to Omega’s manufacturer. The actorwore a Speedmaster First OMEGA in Space ona brown leather strap (ref. 310.32.40.50.06.002). The FOiS is a modern take on the ref. CK 2998, the first Speedmaster worn outside the Earth’s atmosphere back in 1962. It predates the “twisted-lug” case that debuted with the ref. 105.012 in 1964 and still graces nearly every Speedmaster through the modern era. (Withnotable exceptions, of course.) While this is an excellent, vintage-inspiredSpeedywith serious horological cred, Bond (the character) is an ex-Royal Navy man and a loyalSeamasterwearer. Perhaps outfitting Taylor-Johnson in adive watchbefore any news is confirmed would’ve been too on the nose? With Amazon now in control of the Bond franchise, we’ll have to wait for official confirmation from Bezos & Co. as to Taylor-Johnson’s future as 007. In the meantime, however, watch this space—at the very least, we should expect some cool new watches teased on his wrist in the coming years. Spotted at the NYC premier of his new film, the Guy Ritchie-directedFountain of Youth,John Krasinskirocked the newIWC Ingenieur Automatic 40in 18K 5N gold. Having tried this thing on during its debutWatches and Wonders 2025, we can attest to the fact that it absolutely rocks. Measuring 40 mm in diameter and paired to a matching gold bracelet, it features a black dial with the collection’s signature “grid” pattern, a 3 o’clock date window, and the automatic IWC cal. 32111 movement with 120 hours of power reserve. Based roughly upon the original Ingenieur SL designed byGérald Gentain the ‘70s, it marries tool watch bona fides with nearly $50K worth of gold. (Hey, if you’re gonna go looking for the Fountain of Youth, you may as well do it in style, no?) Steph Curry’s injury during round two of the NBA playoffs had one small silver lining. Freed from shooting preposterous threes, the all-time guard was able to prove his horological bona fides on the bench. Exhibit A: his IWC Big Pilot’s Watch Perpetual Calendar TOP GUN Lake Tahoe Curry. This positively enormous, 46.5mm ceramic timepiece pairs theIWC pilot’s watchcase shape and heritage with the sophistication of a perpetual calendar module accurate until the year 2100. Colored ceramics have become an increasinglyhuge deal in the watch industryin recent years and this all-white case remains one of the most stunning executions out there. This Lake Tahoe colorway celebrates the white uniforms of U.S. naval aviation personnel. Since becoming a Breitling ambassador, Austin Butler keeps pushing things smaller. He started his tenure with the brandby introducing the Top Time B31, one of the smallest men’s pieces in the brand’s lineup. This week, at Cannes to celebrate the premiere of his new filmEddington, Butler wore the Chronomat 32, a small, quartz-powered version of a watch that the brand originally designed for the Italian Frecce Tricolori Jet team in the 1980s. Available in a wide variety of case sizes, metals, configurations, colors, and more, theChronomatis notable for the four “rider tabs” that appear on its bezel, which serve to protect the crystal when handling the watch and make bezel manipulation easier with gloved hands. Butler’s Chronomat 32, in particular, features steel construction, a cream-colored dial, and a “Rouleaux” bracelet with a butterfly clasp. And while not necessarily a dress watch, it looked killer with his tux. It’s official:ASAP Rocky won Cannesby virtue of his timepiece, a Bvlgari Monete Catene High Jewellery Secret Watch. What’s so cool about it, you ask? Made of gold and absolutely frosted with diamonds, it hides its mother-of-pearl dial behind a nearly 2,000-year-old denarius of Caracalla, a Roman emperor from the second/third centuries AD. Furthermore, this is a mechanical piece powered by the brand’s Picolissimo hand-wound mechanicalmanufacturemicro-movement. It’s jewelry; it's historical; it's beautiful; it's horologically compelling. It’sdope as hell. Hopefully we can expect more “secret” watches on the red carpet after this sartorial gauntlet drop!",

    "title": "Mahmoud Khalil Was Finally Allowed To Hold His Newborn Son—Despite The Trump Administration Trying To Stop Him",
    "article_text": "Mahmoud Khalil,a pro-Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student arrested by U.S. immigration agents in March,was able to hold his month-old sonthis week after a federal judge intervened to thwart efforts by PresidentDonald Trump’s administration to keep the father and newborn separated by a plexiglass barrier. Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States and Columbia University student, has become asymbolfor the Trump administration’s crackdown on those who participated in pro-Palestinian, anti-war protests on college campuses. Federal authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but theState Department revoked his green cardunder a little-used provision of US immigration law allowing the deportation of any non-citizen whose presence in the country is deemed adverse to US foreign policy interests —aclaimthat his lawyers, friends, family, and several people connected to Columbia have held is false. Khalil, 30, a Palestinian who was born and raised in a refugee camp in Syria, entered the US on a student visa in 2022,according to Reuters, and became a lawful permanent resident in 2024 through his wife, Dr.Noor Abdalla, an American citizen. Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil (C) talks to the press during a briefing organized by Pro-Palestinian protesters who set up a new encampment at Columbia University's Morningside Heights campus in New York City on June 01, 2024. The in-person visit with his wife and their sonDeenis the first time he hasmethis child, as Khalil has been detained in a Louisiana facility since plainclothes officerstook himfrom his apartment building as his pregnant wife recorded in early March. His request to attend his son’s birth on April 21 was denied by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On Wednesday, ICEstepped in to preventan in-person visit between Khalil and his family. “Granting Khalil this relief of family visitation would effectively grant him a privilege that no other detainee receives,” Justice Department officials wrote in a court filing on Wednesday. “Allowing Dr. Abdalla and a newborn to attend a legal meeting would turn a legal visitation into a family one.” They were going to permit a “no-contact” visit through plexiglass. Khalil’s attorneys held that the government’s refusal to grant the visit was “further evidence of the retaliatory motive behind Mr. Khalil’s arrest and faraway detention” from the family’s residence in New York City. Late Wednesday,Michael Farbiarz, a federal judge in New Jersey, intervened to allow the family to meet sans plexiglass between them. Abdalla had traveled nearly 1,500 miles to the remote detention center. “This is not just heartless,” Abdalla said of the government trying to stop her from having contact with her husband. “It is deliberate violence, the calculated cruelty of a government that tears families apart without remorse. And I cannot ignore the echoes of this pain in the stories of Palestinian families, torn apart by Israeli military prisons and bombs, denied dignity, denied life.” On Thursday, after the family gathered in person, Khalil’s lawyers argued his case for over 10 hours, calling on experts to convince the judge to grant him asylum,accordingto NPR. Khalil and his lawyers have said it is unsafe to send him to Syria, where he was born and raised in a camp for Palestinian refugees, or to Algeria, which gave him a passport because of his mother's ancestry. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. JudgeJamee Comans, who last month sided with the Trump administration and ruled that Khalil could be deported under Secretary of StateMarco Rubio's orders, is now considering whether the Palestinian activist will be granted asylum. Khalil said during his testimony that Trump, Rubio, and other government officials \"mislabeled me a terrorist, a terrorist sympathizer or a Hamas supporter, which couldn't be further from the truth. I advocate for human rights. I never engaged in antisemitic activities.\" Their attention on him, Khalil said, makes him a target. \"I became, not by choice, a celebrity—someone who has a target on his back by these mislabels. This means wherever I go in the world, I will have that target.\" Around two weeks ago, Khalilpenneda letter to his son, published inThe Guardian. “In the early hours of 21 April, I waited on the other end of a phone as your mother labored to bring you into this world. I listened to her pained breaths and tried to speak comforting words into her ear over the crackling line,” he wrote. “During your first moments, I buried my face in my arms and kept my voice low so that the 70 other men sleeping in this concrete room would not see my cloudy eyes or hear my voice catch. I feel suffocated by my rage and the cruelty of a system that deprived your mother and me of sharing this experience.” “Why,” Khalil continued, “do faceless politicians have the power to strip human beings of their divine moments?” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Khalil, still in detention, was not able to attend Columbia’s graduation. His absence wasnoted, loudly, as a crescendo of boos and shouts of “Free Mahmoud” drowned out Columbia’s acting president,Claire Shipman. His wife accepted a diploma on Khalil's behalf during an alternative graduation ceremony on May 18 held in New York City by the People's University for Palestine. “Every day since Deen was born, I understand more and more why the struggle matters,”Abdallasaid. “I hope he grows up to be as brave as his father and as brave as every single student here who has risked so much—your education, your safety, even your futures—to speak up for Palestine.” Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.

    "title": "Billy Joel Cancels All Concerts Following Brain Disorder Diagnosis",
    "article_text": "Billy Joel, the best-selling singer and songwriter behind chart-toppers like “Uptown Girl\" and “Piano Man,” announced Friday that he is canceling an upcoming large-scale concert tour after a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a disorder in which an accumulation of fluid near the brain causes issues with movement and cognition. The condition was aggravated by his performance schedule, a statement from Joel says, so he's pausing all public appearances for now while he works to recover. The 76-year-old Long Island resident, whose career began in the early 1970s, wrapped up a record-breaking residency at Madison Square Garden in 2024, where he'd played around once a monthsince 2013. Billy Joel's 150th show in the run—to which, it appears, he would commutevia the Long Island Railroad—went down last July, after which Joel began plans for a two-year, multi-country tour where he would have beenjoined by superstarssuch asStevie Nicks,Sting, andRod Stewart. Billy Joel and Rod Stewart perform at Huntington Bank Field on September 13, 2024 in Cleveland, Ohio. The tour was expected to kick off in April, but its opening show in Milwaukee, WI, along with seven subsequent dates, were postponed in March. According to a statementposted toJoel's social media accounts, “Billy Joel has announced that he will be cancelling all scheduled concerts following a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.” “Under his doctor’s instructions,\" the statement continues, \"Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health. He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage.\" (L-R) Billy Joel and Stevie Nicks perform onstage at SoFi Stadium on March 10, 2023 in Inglewood, California. “I’m sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for your understanding,\" the statement concluded. (A representative for Joel referredVanity Fairto the public statement, but did not provide additional comment.) AccordingJohn Hopkins Medical, NPH occurs when an excess of cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the ventricles of the brain, causing them to enlarge and cause pressure to nearby brain tissue. Symptoms include sudden struggles with balance and walking, mood changes and confusion, and difficulty answering questions. Surgical intervention is typically used to release the fluid, followed by therapies to help the patient regain mobility and cognition. When diagnosed swiftly, a full recovery is often possible.

    "article_text": "Environment minister Tse Chin-wan warns that mandatory measures could force more businesses to close as he unveils plans for phase two of plastics ban Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said on Saturday the government would carry out a trial run with the catering sector in the middle of this year to select suitable replacements before proceeding to the second phase. Phase two will ban the use of all throwaway plastics in restaurants, plastic food containers, six-pack yokes for canned drinks, plastic tablecloths, disposable gloves and plastic-stemmed dental floss. “Due to geopolitics and the transition of the economy, you can see some sectors have really been affected. This is the reality,” Tse said. “If you use mandatory measures to push environmental policies, some sectors, enterprises or companies, which have been facing difficulties, could close down because of the moves.” Tse said opting for voluntary measures would make it easier to implement environmental policies during periods of uncertainty, as people could contribute to the extent their situation permitted. Hong Kong has seen a string of business closures recently, with city leader John Lee Ka-chiu urging companies to reform amid what he called a “transitional period”. The city has also felt the effects of US-China tensions and the tariff war initiated by US President Donald Trump.",

    "title": "Hundreds of border agents to help ICE with arrests in U.S. interior",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 23, 2025 / 8:32 PM EDT/ CBS News The Trump administration is planning to dispatch hundreds of border agents to different parts of the country so they can help Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest unauthorized immigrants in the U.S interior, three sources familiar with the plan told CBS News. The plan would be the latest escalation in the Trump administration's aggressive efforts to muster the vast resources and personnel of agencies across the federal government to support ICE in its bid to carry out what the president has vowed will bethe largest deportation operationin U.S. history. The effort is expected to involve around 500 personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in charge of interdicting the illicit entry of migrants and drugs, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal governments plans that have not been announced. The sources said the CBP teams would also include members of the agency's Office of Field Operations, which oversees legal entry points into the U.S., and Air and Marine Operations, a specialized law enforcement unit with maritime and aerial assets. CBP agents and officers assigned to the effort are expected to assist their counterparts in ICE's 25 field offices by supporting immigration enforcement operations targeting immigrants in the country illegally, the sources added. The effort could start as early as next week, two of the sources said. As immigration officers, CBP personnel have the legal authority to arrest and process immigrants who are suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Historically, however, CBP's work has been mainly limited to the Mexican and Canadian borders, maritime sectors and international airports. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security and CBP did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The plan highlights the Trump administration's government-wide campaign to find the manpower necessary to scale up its crackdown on illegal immigration, while Congress debates giving ICE billions of dollars to add thousands of additional immigration agents and detention beds. The Trump administration has already tasked law enforcement personnel at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and other agencies like the Internal Revenue Service with helping ICE target and arrest unauthorized immigrants. Officials at DHS have also asked the Pentagon to allow20,000 National Guard troopsto provide support to interior immigration enforcement operations. The Department of Defense has already deployed thousands of additional active-duty troops to the southern border to help CBP deter illegal crossings. The effort also suggests interior enforcement operations are taking precedence over efforts at the U.S.-Mexico border amid a historic drop in illegal crossings there. In President Trump's first three full months in office, illegal crossings at the southern border have reached the lowest monthly tallies ever publicly reported by CBP. They are also likely the lowest levels since the late 1960s, according to historical government data. Officials have attributed the dramatic plunge in illegal border crossings to measures put in place by Mr. Trump immediately after he started his second term, including an unprecedented policy that has effectively closed the American asylum system on the premise the country is facing an \"invasion.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

    "title": "Slovak party to demand Ukraine compensate aid",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers in Slovakia’s ruling coalition will push to demand compensation from Ukraine for the military and financial aid Bratislava has provided to it over the course of the conflict with Russia, according to state news agency TASR. Slovak National Party (SNS) leader Andrej Danko will call on Prime Minister Robert Fico to begin EU proceedings regarding the bloc’s stake in Ukrainian mineral production, following the example of the US, the head of the lawmaker’s office, Zuzana Skopcova, told TASR on Saturday. Washington, Kiev’s biggest military donor, signed a minerals agreement with it last month, giving the US preferential access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth. US President Donald Trump touted the deal as a way for the US to reclaim the hundreds of billions of dollars in aid spent on supporting Ukraine. Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka has since described the preceding negotiations with the US as something from a“mafia movie.” “The European Union’s aid is approaching the volume of US aid. If Ukraine hands over all its mineral wealth to the US, Ukraine will have nothing to repay the aid given by European states,”Skopcova told TASR on Saturday. It was illogical and unethical of the US to demand exclusive mining rights, Skopcova said, according to TASR. If Ukraine has already decided to pay for aid during the conflict with the Russian Federation, it is incomprehensible why it does not do so in relation to the EU. On Monday, Danko plans to ask Slovak Finance Minister Ladislav Kamenicky to tally up the sum of all financial and military assistance Bratislava provided to Kiev during the Ukraine conflict, TASR wrote. The SNS wants more than €3 billion ($3.41 billion) in aid compensated in a similar manner as the US has sought, the news agency said. Under Fico, a critic of EU policy regarding the Ukraine conflict, Bratislava has cut military assistance to Kiev. Last May, he survived an assassination attempt after being shot multiple times by a pro-Ukraine activist. The US has allocated around $135 billion to aid Ukraine since the escalation of the conflict in 2022, data from Germany’s Kiev Institute indicates. By comparison, the EU has sent around $158 billion in total military and financial aid to Kiev over the past three years, according to the European Commission. Brussels signed an agreement regarding raw materials with Ukraine in 2021. The European Parliament Think Tank has said the document gives the EU a stake in Ukraine’s mineral wealth, like the US.",
