But Turner wasn't going to get this chance and make it easy on Harper. \"I messed with him a little bit in the dugout.

    "title": "Nick Carter sued for sexual assault, allegedly infecting woman with STDs",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here. Nick Carterwas accused of sexually assaulting a woman and allegedly infecting her with sexually transmitted diseases, which led to cervical cancer, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Laura Penly claimed in her lawsuit filed in Nevada that the Backstreet Boys singer sexually assaulted her multiple times, beginning in 2005 when she was 19. Penly claimed she had not yet had any other sexual partners prior to Carter and tested positive for HPV (human papillomavirus), chlamydia and gonorrhea after Carter's alleged assault. AARON CARTER BECAME ‘EVEN MORE VIOLENT’ AFTER FAMILY GOT RESTRAINING ORDER: DOCUMENTARY Nick Carter was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2005.(Alberto E. Rodriguez) Carter denied the allegations and claimed Penly's allegations were \"more of the same nonsense from the gang of conspirators\" in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"This is just more of the same nonsense from the gang of conspirators and their lawyers who continue to abuse the justice system to try to ruin Nick Carter,\" the statement said. \"It’s drawn from the same predictable playbook — lie in wait for decades until Mr. Carter is celebrating a professional milestone, then hide behind litigation privilege to make utterly false claims in an attempt to inflict maximum damage on Nick and his family.\" His representative added, \"Nick does not recall ever even meeting Laura Penly. He certainly never had any romantic or sexual relationship with her. Ever. The person making these claims has a documented history of financial and legal trouble, has filed for bankruptcy and has been sued for fraud. And whatever health challenges she may have faced have absolutely nothing to do with Nick. AARON CARTER’S TWIN SAYS DYSFUNCTIONAL CHILDHOOD CONTRIBUTED TO DEATHS OF 3 SIBLINGS \"Not only will we fight this, we will be seeking sanctions against her legal team for enabling this frivolous action.\" Penly alleged that she initially had a \"sexually intimate relationship\" with Carter and would see the singer \"every few weeks\" when she visited his apartment in Hollywood. She claimed to ask Carter to wear protection during their encounters, but he refused and led Penly to believe \"that he was clean of sexually transmittable diseases,\"according to documents. Carter is an original member of the Backstreet Boys.(Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for On Our Sleeves) After three instances of \"consensual sexual intercourse,\" Penly alleged, Carter dismissed her when she requested a \"movie and hangout\" instead of intercourse. He allegedly \"told her no because the only reason she was there was to have sex and that it is what she wants,\" documents state. \"Carter then picked plaintiff up off the ground and threw her onto his bed\" before allegedly \"forcefully\" assaulting Penly, despite saying \"no multiple times.\" He then allegedly instructed her to \"keep his sexual assault of her a secret and that nobody would believe her,\" documents add. Two months later, Penly claimed, Carter apologized and asked to see her again. Upon arriving at his apartment, she alleged two of his friends were present. Carter allegedly told his friends he would \"be right back\" and led Penly to his bedroom, where she told him that \"she did not want to have sexual intercourse.\" However, Carter allegedly sexually assaulted her again.

I'm fighting to make the music industry a safer place to work and perform.\" Pop star Melissa Schuman also sued Carter, alleging sexual assault.(Getty Images) Schuman and Carter first met while filming the TV movie \"The Hollow\" together. She first came forward in 2017, accusing Carter of rape. The \"He Loves U Not\" singer claimed Carter raped her in 2003 when she was 18 years old. He was 22 at the time, according to court documents. The lawsuit claims Carter used \"his role, status, and power as awell-known singerto gain access to, groom, manipulate, exploit, and sexually assault\" Schuman. Carter denied the allegation in 2017, saying, \"Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally.\" Carter was also sued by Shannon \"Shay\" Ruth and Ashley Repp for sexual assault.

    "title": "Biden returns to podium for first time to slam Trump's Social Security plans: 'Wreck it so they could rob it'",
    "article_text": "President Joe Biden joins the Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled conference in Chicago where he took aim at the Trump admin's Social Security policies. Former PresidentJoe Bidentook shots at the Trump administration's Social Security policies in his first major speech since leaving the White House on Tuesday evening. \"Seriously, people are now genuinely concerned for the first time in history, for the first and only time in history, that Social Security benefits may be delayed or interrupted,\" Biden said from the Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled (ACRD) conference in Chicago on Tuesday evening. \"In the 90 years since Franklin Roosevelt created the Social Security system, people have always gotten their Social Security checks. They've gotten them during wartime, during recessions, during the pandemic. No matter what, they got them. But now, for the first time ever, that might change. It would be a calamity for millions of families, millions of people,\" he added. The ACRD conference was billed as the 46th president's first public speechsince leaving the White House. Biden, however, has delivered other public remarks since Jan. 20, Fox Digital found, including speaking before the National High School Model United Nations in March, which received little media attention, as well as joining an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers event this month. ACRD is an advocacy organization that works to equip \"disability professionals with the tools, technology, and training to lead the industry forward,\" according to its website.

The quote is, ‘Move fast, break things.’ They're certainly breaking things. They're shooting first and aiming later.\" \"The result is a lot of needless pain and sleepless nights,\" Biden said. 'EMBARRASSINGLY WRONG': LIBERAL MEDIA FIGURES ADMIT BEING IN DENIAL ABOUT BIDEN'S MENTAL DECLINE The Trump administration has cut about 7,000 Social Security Administration staffers since taking office as part of its mission to cut government fat and bureaucracy and realign agencies with \"America First\" policies. Democrats have slammed President Donald Trump over the cuts, claiming he will cut Social Security benefits to seniors. The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that theTrump administrationwill cut such benefits, vowing to \"always protect\" Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden greet President-elect Donald Trump and Melania Trump at the White House on Jan. 20, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) Biden continued that the Trump administration is allegedly looking to \"wreck\" Social Security to \"rob it.\" \"My friend, [Maryland] Gov. [Martin] O'Malley, knows what they're really up to. He says, and I love his quote, ‘They want to wreck it so they could rob it.’ They want to wreck it so they could rob it. Why do they want to rob it? In order to deliver huge tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations and keep it going. They want to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations. That's going to cost $5 trillion. Where are they going to get $5 trillion to pay for when they continue to run the deficit up?\" \"What they always do … by running up the national debt, No. 1, then by taking the money from someplace else. What are the two big pots of money out there in raw numbers? Social Security and Medicaid. … Republicans, these guys are willing to hurt the middle class and the working class in order to deliver significant, greater wealth to their already very wealthy [friends]. Who in the hell do they think they are?\" he said. President Joe Biden is shown at the White House on Nov. 27, 2023.(Michael Reynolds/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Former Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and former Democrat Social Security Administrator and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley joined the event. O'Malley presented Biden with ACRD's \"beacon of hope award\" for his accomplishments as president, including his leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic and fighting for the \"dignity of every person.\" EX-BIDEN AIDE SAYS FORMER PRESIDENT WAS 'FATIGUED, BEFUDDLED, AND DISENGAGED' PRIOR TO JUNE DEBATE: BOOK Biden added that the nation is \"divided\" under Trump and can't continue on the same path. \"We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. I said, I've been doing this a long time, it's never been this divided. Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart,\" he continued. The Trump administration's official Social Security X account hit back after the speech that \"Biden is lying to Americans\" before providing a detailed list of \"facts,\" including that Trump has repeatedly pledged to protect benefits and that no field office has been closed since Jan. 20. \"SSA is taking commonsense steps to transform how we serve the public - last month, we spent $16.5 million to modernize telephone services nationwide. We’re developing cutting-edge, AI-powered tools to streamline simple tasks,\" the thread continued. \"SSA Inspector General report released while Joe Biden was President found $72 billion in improper payments from fiscal years 2015 through 2022.\" The event comes as political books investigating the 2024 campaign cycle hit the shelves, including \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History\" and \"FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.\" BIDEN'S TEAM HID TRUTH ABOUT HIS HEALTH ALL ALONG: WH PRESS SEC Excerpts from Chris Whipple's \"Uncharted\" reported that White House staffers allegedly kept Biden from socializing with others, including close allies and friends, out of fear the 46th president \"might say the wrong thing or might feed the mental acuity narrative.\" He also appeared \"absolutely exhausted\" ahead of his ill-fated debate against Trump in June, according to the book, which opened the floodgates to public concern over Biden's mental acuity as he tripped over his words and lost his train of thought during the debate.

Texas AG Ken Paxton also joined 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss and address the fight to protect women's sports. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum visited New Mexico on Tuesday to announce the U.S. Army will take control of nearly 110,000 acres of federal land along the U.S.-Mexico border, the latest attempt to curbillegal immigrationand trafficking. The 109,651 acres of federal land will be transferred tothe Armyfor three years, subject to valid existing rights, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior. The move comes after PresidentDonald Trumplast week signed a memorandum, \"Military Mission for Sealing the Southern Border of the United States and Repelling Invasions,\" directing the secretaries of Defense, Interior, Agriculture and Homeland Security to take control of federal lands \"reasonably necessary to enable military activities.\" The switch in jurisdiction will allow the government to protect sensitive natural and cultural resources in the region, while helping the Army supportU.S. Border Patroloperations in securing the border and preventing illegal immigration, according to the Department of the Interior.

Migrants at the southern border in Arizona.(U.S. Border Patrol) TRUMP ORDERS MILITARY TO TAKE CONTROL OF FEDERAL LAND AT SOUTHERN BORDER The Army requested the transfer on \"an emergency basis,\" so they could increase regular patrols by federal personnel.

The region also contains cultural sites that range from small artifact scatters to large multiroom pueblos, which could be harmed by repeated foot traffic, unregulated vehicle use and the creation of informal trails or camps, according to the statement.

    "title": "'Cancel vacations': Judge gives Trump admin two weeks to prove they aren't in contempt of court",
    "article_text": "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., says he’ll go to El Salvador \"to show solidarity\" if President Donald Trump doesn’t return an illegal immigrant that the administration had deported. A federal judge told Trump lawyers they must expeditiously comply with her requests in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador last month, as she weighs next steps in the politically charged case. U.S. Judge Paula Xinis told Trump administration lawyers Tuesday that they will have two weeks to comply with discovery requests in the case of Abrego Garcia, the Maryland resident deported to El Salvador last month in what Trump officials have acknowledged was an \"administrative error,\" demanding the government spend time detailing with what, if any, steps it is taking to facilitate his release and return to the U.S. \"Cancel vacations, cancel other appointments,\" Xinis told lawyers at the Tuesday evening hearing. She also said she would issue an order in writing directing the government to show her how they have complied with her order to facilitate the release of Abrego-Garcia from El Salvador. After the two-week period, she will weigh the discovery submissions and determine whether or not the government acted in good faith — or whether there is evidence that could preempt potential contempt proceedings. JUDGE BOASBERG POISED TO HOLD TRUMP ADMIN IN CONTEMPT, TAKES DOWN NAMES OF DHS OFFICIALS: 'PRETTY SKETCHY' Trump’s administration continues with its controversial and fast-paced deportation policy to El Salvador, as part of a partnership with President Bukele. The U.S. acknowledged mistakenly deporting a Maryland resident from El Salvador with protected status and is arguing against returning him. (Alex Peña/Getty Images) Xinis stressed at the outset of the hearing that, in her view, the Supreme Court had \"already spoken\" in ordering the U.S. to facilitate the release of Abrego Garcia and resume his immigration proceedings as if he were never removed. \"We're going to do it in a targeted way, but we're not going to spend a lot of time doing it,\" Xinis said of the discovery process, which she stressed will move fast. Lawyers for the Justice Department said in response that they objected to her view of the Supreme Court's ruling, and the expedited discovery — an objection she dryly quipped in response she would note for the record. \"Just so everyone knows what my current thinking is, Abrego Garcia already won his injunctive proceedings,\" Xinis told Trump lawyers at the outset of the hearing. \"We’re here today to talk about scope of the remedies.\" \"You made your jurisdictional arguments. You made your venue arguments,\" Xinis told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign. \"You made your arguments on the merits. You lost.\" Just minutes before the hearing, DHS acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara said in a court filing that, should he be returned to the U.S., DHS would take him into custody and remove him to another third country, citing his alleged MS-13 membership. The hearing comes after government lawyers failed to comply with multiple directives updating the court on his location and custodial status, as well as efforts taken to facilitate his return — a lack of compliance Xinis previously described as \"extremely troubling.\" FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING Justice Department attorneys on Friday said they are unaware of Maryland immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia's whereabouts after he was deported to a Salvadoran prison last month.(Fox News) Xinis planned to weigh these developments as the court considers next steps in the case, including whether to pursuecivil contempt proceedingsagainst the administration. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argued Tuesday that there is no evidence to show the Trump administration has taken any steps to date to facilitate his return to the U.S. as soon as possible, as ordered by Xinis and upheld by the Supreme Court last week. \"The Supreme Court order requires the government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s releasefrom custody in El Salvadorand to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\" his lawyers wrote. To date, they noted, the government’s updates \"do not indicate that any steps have been taken to comply\" with the federal and Supreme Court rulings. The administration’s apparent refusal to act — or even to clarify Abrego Garcia’s location — has pushed the case to a boiling point, raising the prospect that Xinis could move to hold the Trump administration in civil contempt. FEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING Trump's administration continues with its controversial and fast-paced deportation policy to El Salvador, as part of a partnership with President Bukele. The U.S. Government acknowledged mistakenly deporting a Maryland resident from El Salvador with protected status.(Alex Peña/Getty ) The hearing is the latest in a flurry of legal battles centered on Trump's ability to deport certain migrants from the U.S. to El Salvador. Most recently, two federal judges in Texas and New York agreed to temporarily block theTrump administration's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act law to immediately remove some migrants from U.S. soil, siding with plaintiffs' contention that allowing removals under the law would likely cause immediate and irreparable harm. In Brownsville, U.S. District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. cited a \"substantial likelihood\" that the individuals in question \"could not be returned to the United States\" if deported. In addition to filing incomplete status updates and refusing to answer questions about Abrego Garcia’s whereabouts or efforts to secure his return, Trump officials suggested at the White House on Monday that the U.S. lacks the authority to bring him back. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, said a Maryland man deported to his country by Trump's administration would not be returned to the U.S., even as the Supreme Court has called for Trump's administration to facilitate his release.(Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Asked Monday about progress in returning Abrego Garcia to U.S. soil, Trump officials said his return was \"up to El Salvador\" and that the U.S. would \"provide a plane\" — appearing to ignore a court order to facilitate his return. \"That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters. \"That's not up to us.\" This contention was backed by other Cabinet officials, including White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and by Salvadorian President Bukele himself. \"How can I return him to the United States? Like if I smuggle him into the United States?\" Bukele told reporters Monday during a sit-down with PresidentDonald Trumpand other senior administration officials. \"Of course I'm not going to do it. The question is preposterous,\" he said.

    "title": "Arkansas moves to ban 'junk food' from SNAP program: 'Definition of crazy'",
    "article_text": "Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said taxpayers have been ‘subsidizing poor health’ in the state of Arkansas, and she announced Tuesday that junk food is off the table for food stamp recipients. (Credit: Sarah Huckabee Sanders via Facebook) Arkansas Gov.Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced a plan to restrict the types of food that can be purchased with food stamps, becoming one of the first governors to seek federal permission to ban items like soda and candy from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). At a news conference at the Arkansas Capitol Tuesday, Sanders said her administration had submitted a waiver request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that would prohibit the use of SNAP benefits for soft drinks, artificially sweetened candy and snacks made with flour, while expanding eligible items to include hot rotisserie chicken, which is currently excluded. \"Right now you can use food stamps to buy a soft drink or a candy bar from a gas station, but you can't use them to buy an Arkansas-raised hot rotisserie chicken from a grocery store,\" Sanders said. \"That’s the definition of crazy.\" U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins praised Sanders' move in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Gov. Sanders is confronting childhood disease head on, and it starts with what families consume,\" Rollins said. \"Today’s waiver announcement is a welcome one, and I look forward to moving through the approval process swiftly. I encourage more states across the nation to follow the bold lead of states like Arkansas as we Make America Healthy Again.\"KENNEDY APPLAUDS 'VISIONARY' INDIANA GOVERNOR'S MAHA EXECUTIVE ORDERS United States Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, left, and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders speak outside the governor's mansion in Little Rock, Ark., Tuesday, April 15, 2025.(AP Images) The waiver request is part of the Trump administration’s\"Make America Healthy Again\" or MAHAagenda, which seeks to address chronic disease and healthcare costs by reforming federal nutrition programs. \"We finally have a president who, along with Secretary Rollins, has put a laser focus on solving America’s chronic disease epidemic,\" Sanders said. \"Reforming food stamps is a great place to start.\" Trump's policieson food and health are taking the spotlight in his second administration, with a shift toward state-driven solutions focused on prevention rather than treatment. The MAHA initiative is led in part by Rollins and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who also appeared Tuesday at a similar SNAP reform announcement in Indiana. Speaking in Arkansas, Rollins praised the state’s leadership. \"What we are doing here today is affirming the value of federalism in all aspects of governance,\" she said. \"No federal bureaucrat can understand the needs of Arkansas families better than their own governor.\" Rollins added that SNAP reform was a key issue for Trump. \"This is one of the things he campaigned on, and this is what the American people voted for,\" she said. Sanders said the program, originally designed to fight hunger, has been twisted by outdated regulations and perverse incentives. \"One third of our state has diabetes or is prediabetic,\" she said. \"We’re paying for it on the front end and the back end.\" The waiver would affect nearly 350,000 Arkansas residents enrolled in SNAP and is scheduled to take effect in July 2026 if approved.According to Sanders, 23% of SNAP spending, or $27 billion per year, is used on soft drinks, candy and desserts, while the state spends $300 million annually treating chronic illness through Medicaid.WHOLE MILK SHOULD BE BACK AT SCHOOLS, EXPERTS SAY: 'NUTRITION SCIENCE HAS EVOLVED' \"This is not about taking anything away,\" she said. \"It’s simply saying that taxpayers are no longer going to cover the cost of junk food like candy and soft drinks.\"Rollins praised Arkansas's SNAP reform plan as a bold step toward improving public health, calling Sanders \"courageous\" for addressing childhood diseasethrough nutrition. \"We are working to realign USDA and every taxpayer dollar around what is the best and most effective spend,\" Rollins said. Brooke Rollins attends a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing on her nomination for Secretary of Agriculture Jan. 23, 2025, in Washington.(Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Arkansas Department of Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam noted that the same state agency running SNAP also manages Medicaid. \"In one program, we’ve subsidized foods that we know make people less healthy. In the other, we’re devoting significant resources to treating the same conditions brought on by unhealthy food,\" she said. \"This makes no sense.\" Critics, including the Food Research and Action Center, have argued the restrictions are punitive and unsupported by data. Trade groups representing beverage and candy manufacturers have also criticized the move.As reported by The Associated Press, American Beverage accused officials of \"choosing to be the food police,\" while the National Confectioners Association called the plan \"misguided.\" Sanders addressed concerns about food costs, noting her administration’s work to eliminate the state grocery tax. \"I think you'd be hard-pressed to say that you're gonna be better off having purchased a pack of Skittles and that your hunger is gonna be satisfied after that purchase,\" she said. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appears on stage on the second day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee.(Getty Images) Rollins stressed that funding levels for SNAP would not change. \"It just opens up the opportunity to buy better and more healthy food moving forward,\" she said. The Arkansas waiver request was formally submitted Tuesday and includes a 30-day public comment period.

    "article_text": "Freed Argentinian-Israeli hostage Iair Horn on fighting for his brother's freedom from Hamas captivity and why he credits President Donald Trump for his own release. Hamas appears to have rejectedIsrael’s latest attemptto secure a ceasefire and the return of nearly a dozen hostages who have been held in the Gaza Strip for 556 days. The terrorist organization has yet to issue a formal response regarding its rejection of Israel’s ceasefire proposal, but according to remarks by Hamas leader Abu Zuhri to reporters on Tuesday, \"Handing over the resistance's weapons is a million red lines and is not subject to consideration, let alone discussion.\" Fox News Digital could not independently verify the extent of the terms involved in the deal, but sources said the conditions included a 45-day ceasefire and the return of humanitarian aid – which has been blocked since March 2 – in exchange for 11 hostages and the disarmament of Hamas.

But Hamas on Tuesday claimed it had lost contact with the soldiers said to be guarding Alexander and accused Israeli forces of targeting his location, though it did not provide evidence of any strike. Hamas on multiple occasions hasfalsely blamed Israeli attacksfor either the death of or the loss of communication with hostages held across the Gaza Strip. Fox News Digital could not immediately reach Israeli authorities nor Alexander’s family for confirmation of the Tuesday claims posted in a Telegram post by Abu Obeida, spokesperson for Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades. News of the proposal’s failure does not appear to have come as a surprise to mediators, who remain tight-lipped and have not responded to Fox New Digital’s questions. Some reporting suggested that mediators were not confident the Israeli ceasefire proposal would gain much traction despite Israel’s continued advances in Gaza because it did not propose any withdrawal terms and called on Hamas to relinquish its arms. FREED ISRAELI HOSTAGE CALLS ON TRUMP TO ACT AS 'MODERN MOSES' TO SAVE BROTHER FROM HAMAS 'LUNATICS' Edan Alexander, born in Tel Aviv and raised in New Jersey, is a hostage of Hamas in Gaza.(Hostage Family Forum) Israel frustrated mediators last month when it resumed military operations across the Gaza Strip following the end of the first ceasefire and the failure to secure asecond phase, which was intended to see the release of the remaining hostages. Israel over the weekendcaptured more territoryin the Gaza Strip after reports earlier this month indicated it had taken over half of the Palestinian territory as talks remain stalled over ceasefire negotiations. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Sunday the IDF had captured territory in the southern portion of the Gaza Strip from the Philadelphia Corridor, which runs along the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, and the Morag axis, a new corridor announced by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month, which cuts off the city of Rafah and southern Gaza off from Khan Younis – roughly a quarter of the way up the Strip from the Egyptian border.

A Russian general who criticized the nation's Ministry of Defense may soon be reinstated to the front lines of the war in Ukraine this week, according to a report from CNN. General Major Ivan Popov once commandedRussia's 58th Armybefore being sidelined, accused of fraud, and detained after blasting Russian military leadership in 2023. His lawyer and the Ministry of Defense called for him to be put in command of one of Russia's infamous detachments of ex-convicts, forces that have sustained massive casualties in the war against Ukraine. \"We, together with the Ministry of Defense, have a motion to suspend on the case… with the positive decision to send Ivan to [Ukraine],\" the lawyer, Sergei Buinovsky, said, according to Russian media.

The detachment he could soon lead likely numbers in the hundreds, however. Ukrainian soldiers stand near destroyed Russian tanks in Izium, Ukraine, on Sept. 20, 2022.(Reuters/Gleb Garanich) At the head of the 58th Army, Popov gained popularity with front-line troops by repelling a Ukrainian counter-attack that relied heavily on tanks provided byNATO countries.He then blasted Russia's top commanders for allowing Ukraine's initial breakthrough. \"The armed forces of Ukraine could not break through our army from the front, [but] our senior commander hit us from the rear, treacherously and vilely decapitating the army at the most difficult and tense moment,\" Popov said of Russian military chief-of-staff Valery Gerasimov at the time.

    "title": "Soaring Medicare prescription drug prices targeted in Trump's new executive order",
    "article_text": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is warning Americans could be \"devastated\" by cuts to Medicaid. PresidentDonald Trumpis seeking to combat soaring prescription drug prices in a new executive order he signed Tuesday. The order instructs Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'sDepartment of Health and Human Services(HHS) to standardize Medicare payments for prescription drugs, including those used for cancer patients, no matter where a patient receives treatment. This could lower prices for patients by as much as 60%, according to a White House fact sheet. Likewise, the order calls to match the Medicare payment for certain prescription drugs to the price that hospitals pay for those drugs, up to 35% lower than what the government pays to acquire those medications, the White House said. The order also takes steps to lower insulin prices. Specifically, the order calls for lowering insulin prices for low-income patients or those who are uninsured to as little as 3 cents and injectable epinephrine for treating allergic reactions to as low as $15, coupled with a \"small administrative fee,\" according to a White House fact sheet.

The order requires HHS to seek comment on the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which the Biden administration authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act and allows Medicare to directly engage in hashing out prescription prices with drug companies. \"The guidance shall improve the transparency of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, prioritize the selection of prescription drugs with high costs to the Medicare program, and minimize any negative impacts of the maximum fair price on pharmaceutical innovation within the United States,\" the order said. Drug prices have significantly ramped up in recent years. Between January 2022 and January 2023, prescription drug prices rose more than 15% and reached an average of $590 per drug product, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Of the 4,200 prescription drugs included on that list, 46% of the price increases exceeded the rate of inflation. Previous efforts under the first Trump administration to curb prescription drug prices included installing a cap on Medicaid prescription drug plans for insulin at $35.

Market research group Black Book Research found that 84% of experts predict that prices for medical treatments and drugs will rise due to the tariffs, according to a survey released in February. Trump signaled Monday that tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector were headed down the pipeline.

Tuesday's executive order comes days after HHS' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told states on Thursday that the federal government would cease assistance to states to fund nonmedical services geared toward things like nutrition for those enrolled in Medicaid.

Garber said in a Monday statement that the Trump administration tacked on additional requests that go beyond addressing antisemitism on campus, and the institution would not comply because the demands were unconstitutional. Specifically, Garber said the new requests \"direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard,\" including auditing viewpoints of student, faculty and staff members on campus, and eliminating all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, offices and initiatives at Harvard. \"It makes clear that the intention is not to work with us to address antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner,\" Garber wrote. \"We have informed the administration through our legal counsel that we will not accept their proposed agreement.\" The Trump administration’s Department of Justice unveiled the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism in February, which aims to eradicate bias on campuses that have experienced incidents targeting Jewish students since October 2023.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Nate Foy reports on a district judge dismissing the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams on ‘America’s Newsroom.’ Former New York Democratic GovernorAndrew Cuomowas denied nearly $3 million in publicly matched campaign funds by New York City's campaign finance regulators on Tuesday. The denial of $2.5 million in publicly matched campaign funds followed a frantic email the Cuomo campaign sent out Friday, calling on those who had donated to his campaign to fill out a form to ensure all requirements for the public money were necessarily met. But that effort failed. Public confirmation of the denial was made in a Tuesday press release from the New York City Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB), which indicated that at least 20% of Cuomo's required disclosures contained documentation errors for contributions. The press release also said that the Cuomo campaign failed to meet its required two-part threshold of total contributions, which must be at least 1,000 different individuals, and contributors, which must amount to at least $250,000, needed to obtain the publicly matched funds. CUOMO LANDS KEY ENDORSEMENT AS COMEBACK BID FOR NYC MAYOR HEATS UP A spokesperson for Cuomo said that the \"technical software error\" had been remedied and the adequate documentation was provided to the city's campaign finance board. However, the campaign won't be able to receive matching funds until the next allocation period beginning May 12.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) \"Our campaign officially announced on March 1, and within 13 days, proudly raised an unprecedented $1.5 million, including $330,000 in matchable funds, from more than 2,800 donors.  This surpassed the campaign finance board's threshold for qualifying for matching funds by the filing deadline of March 13. Since the last filing deadline on March 13, the campaign has amassed an additional $1 million, totaling over $2.5 million raised from over 4,100 individuals,\" Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said in a statement. \"Last Friday, the campaign was informed by the campaign finance board that, due to a technical software error, contributions collected on one of our vendor platforms, NGP, were missing one of the fields required by the Campaign Finance Board, and so while we met the thresholds necessary to receive matching funds, the campaign had to remedy this technical matter.\" Azzopardi noted that the \"technical software error\" had been remedied and the adequate documentation was provided to the city's campaign finance board. However, the campaign won't be able to receive matching funds until the next payment period beginning May 12. BILL MAHER SUGGESTS ANDREW CUOMO'S NURSING HOME SCANDAL MAY COST HIS NYC MAYORAL CAMPAIGN Nearly every other top mayoral candidate received payouts Tuesday, according to Politico. However, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams found himself denied $4.5 million in matching funds over the same reasons Cuomo did, in addition to other bookkeeping and compliance mistakes. Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is considering making a return to politics as Mayor Eric Adams faces calls to step down after being indicted.(Getty Images) Polling from Siena College found Cuomo as the front-runner among Democrats, but Adams was not included in the survey results as he will be running for reelection as an Independent. Adams was facing a federal corruption investigation until the Trump administration stepped in and got the case dismissed. As a result of the investigation, one of the NYCCFB's members, Richard Davis, has recused himself from voting on any matters related to Adams after writing an editorial earlier this year in which he slammed President Donald Trump's Justice Department for intervening in the Adams case, referring to the move as \"ludicrous.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Adams was also denied publicly matched funds during the NYCCFB's last round of payments announced on March 17.",

In the suit, the city council accuses Adams of engaging in an illegal \"quid pro quo\" with the Trump administration by allowing ICE into the city prison in exchange for having the federal corruption charges against him dropped.

The order states that the safety of New Yorkers has been jeopardized by violent transnational gangs like MS-13 andTren de Aragua– gangs designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration – and there is a critical need for federal law enforcement to share \"real-time\" intelligence with the city’s corrections department and police.

    "title": "GOP hits back after judges demand Trump allies be condemned for targeting judiciary",
    "article_text": "Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'America's Newsroom' to react to the Trump administration winning three Supreme Court cases. FIRST ON FOX:The GOP lawmaker leading a collective response to more than 100 judges and attorneys who demanded condemnation of Trump allies said Tuesday she and her delegation won't be \"pushed around\" amid ongoing attacks on left-wing judges. Wyoming’s congressional delegationresponded to dozens of Cowboy State jurists, including a former governor who issued an open condemnation of lawmakers’ failure to defend judges under fire from conservatives over sweeping nationwide injunctions hindering President Donald Trump’s foreign policy and homeland security actions. The response, led by Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., rejected the basis on which the jurists were calling for the state’s Republicans to vociferously intervene in support of what the White House describes as rogue judges, citing the Founding Fathers’ words. \"In Federalist [Paper] 78…  Alexander Hamilton wrote that \"the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous\" and that judges \"have neither force nor will,\" the letter states. WYOMING SHERIFF'S BOLD BILLBOARD RECRUITING DENVER OFFICERS OUT OF LIBERAL CITY CREATES STIR \"In recent years, we have become increasingly concerned with how our country has strayed from this Hamiltonian aspiration. We have seen judges across the political spectrum assume both \"force\" and \"will\" — Many Americans are worried judges are misusing their independence by imposing policy preferences on our country — all with no accountability.\" They also noted Georgetown Law professor Brad Snyder \"said it best\" – \"The Court does not have the last word on the Constitution.\" ‘TRAITOR’ LIZ CHENEY WALLOPED BY WYOMING VOTERS FOR HARRIS ENDORSEMENT, BREAK FROM GOP In comments to Fox News Digital, Lummis said Americans elected Trump and did not select \"liberal judges.\" \"I represent thepeople of Wyoming, and they have made it clear that they support President Trump’s agenda and want a government where their elected representatives make the laws,\" she said. \"Our delegation stands with President Trump and won’t be pushed around by far-left judicial activists who wish to further divide our country.\" The jurists objecting to the Republicans’ silence cited calls to reject disinformation after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and similarly recounted critiques from administration allies of judges,like James Boasberg,who have issued nationwide injunctions blocking Trump’s homeland security measures. In a missive entitled \"The Rule of Law Matters,\" they cited more virulent critiques of such judges, as well as a conservative op-ed decrying that \"if impeachment is the remedy for every adverse judicial ruling, we wouldn’t have a judiciary left.\" \"These attacks are part of a growing effort to discredit, not just judges, but seemingly the American Rule of Law as we know it,\" the original letter states. It was signed by about 100 jurists, including former Wyoming Democratic Gov. Michael Sullivan, former President Bill Clinton’s Irish ambassador. \"Recent executive orders targeting prominent national law firms disfavored by the administration with severe retribution… has, as night follows day, resulted in yet more incendiary social media postings attacking the judiciary and openly encouraging the executive branch to disobey court orders.\" In their response to the scores of jurists, Lummis, Sen. John Barrasso and Rep. Harriet Hageman condemned the fact the direct letter had also been distributed to the media and that the lawmakers would have collectively appreciated direct discussion. \"We are disappointed you failed to express your concerns with us directly before rushing to publish your letter,\" they wrote. \"A robust discussion about addressing the challenges and concerns facing our nation would be more beneficial than attempting to score political points through the press.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The complainants wrote that while there is populist sentiment for \"radical change,\" the \"growing reckless disdain for the independence and security of our judiciary must be resisted by anyone sworn to uphold our Constitution. \"That includes us, and it certainly includes you.\" The lawmakers stood firm, however, on the idea that they are acting responsibly and within their legislative role. They cited their co-sponsorshipof a bill thatwould ban most nationwide injunctions effecting change \"across the ideological spectrum,\" and not just those against Trump’s actions. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.(Getty) Legislation highlighted by the lawmakers cited both conservative and liberal Supreme Court justices issuing criticisms of such nationwide injunctions. \"The Supreme Court has consistently noted that political questions should be kept at arm’s length by the judiciary,\" they wrote, as a Senate Judiciary Committee statement on the Judicial Relief Clarification Act quoted reservations from both Justices Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan. Other jurists have, however, echoed Trump's criticisms, including George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who told Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" that judges must remember they've been \"appointed, not anointed.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Sean Hannity unpacks border security under the Trump administration on 'Hannity.' EXCLUSIVE:Although the REAL ID deadline has been pushed numerous times, theDepartment of Homeland Securitysays stopping illegal immigration is a major reason why it’s holding firm to the current May 7 deadline. In a memo exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, the department said part of the reason REAL ID will be enforced is to prevent those in the country illegally from flying – unless they are looking to self-deport on an international flight. \"Under Biden, illegal aliens used non-compliant IDs from sanctuary cities to board flights, but REAL ID’s higher security standards make it nearly impossible to forge legitimate documents, ensuring only verified travelers can fly,\" the memo states. BORDER CROSSINGS HIT RECORD LOW IN MARCH THANKS TO 'VIGILANT' WORK OF AGENTS: REPORT Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem listens during a tour along the border wall at the Mariposa Port of Entry, in Nogales, Arizona, March 15, 2025.(Alex Brandon/Pool via Reuters) \"This closes the gaping vulnerabilities Biden’s policies created, preventing criminals and potential terrorists from exploiting our aviation system, as seen during 9/11 when fraudulent IDs enabled attacks,\" the memo continues. The agency emphasized that the measure prevents people in the country illegally from traveling within the U.S. \"DHS and TSA are clear, the only place an illegal alien should be flying is home. Under Secretary Kristi Noem’s leadership, illegal aliens will be barred from domestic flights, with one exception: illegal aliens self-deporting on international flights will be allowed to board without a REAL ID, encouraging their exit from the U.S.,\" it states. DHS said that during the Biden administration, 1.4 million \"inadmissible aliens\" were allowed into the country because of programs like CBP One and the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans parole program, and over half a million flew into American airports as of August 2024, according to the memo.

Meanwhile, federal immigration authorities have cracked down on alleged criminals who are in the country illegally, including sending many to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, which has led to numerous ongoinglegal battles.

    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream unpacks the SCOTUS ruling on $2 billion in USAID payments on 'Special Report.' A newWhite Housememo highlighting the top 10 Supreme Court rulings federal agencies must follow has legal experts optimistic about reining in the administrative state, while some litigators remain skeptical the directive will be enforced. \"Any administration that really cares about making sure that they were following the law should be reviewing regulations,\" Carrie Severino, president of Judicial Crisis Network, told Fox News Digital. \"We want a government that isn't just taking every bit of power that it can get away with, but one that wants to make sure the constitutional limits are guarded as well, which is why this memorandum is refreshing and novel in a good way.\" The administration issued a memorandum on April 9 requiring agencies to rescind regulations not in line with 10 recentSupreme Courtopinions on proper administrative agency functions. SUPREME COURT CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SWOOPS IN TO SAVE TRUMP FIRING DECISION The memo, titled, \"President Donald J. Trump Directs Repeal of Regulations That Are Unlawful Under 10 Recent Supreme Court Decisions,\" says it is in line with a February executive order seeking to rein in the administrative state. The memo lists various Supreme Court cases aligned with Trump's deregulatory agenda as well as the administration's efforts to get rid of DEI initiatives. Among the cases listed are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, West Virginia vs. EPA, and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College. The memo, titled, \"President Donald J. Trump Directs Repeal of Regulations That Are Unlawful Under 10 Recent Supreme Court Decisions,\" says it is in line with a February executive order seeking to rein in the administrative state.(Pool) Both Loper Bright and West Virginia notably narrowed executive agencies' authority in issuing rules and regulations affecting the American public. Likewise, Students for Fair Admissions rejected the use of affirmative action inuniversity admissions. \"The President is right: agencies must repeal regulations that the Supreme Court has deemed unlawful. The President continues to deliver on his promises to roll back regulations and government overreach crippling American enterprise,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital in a statement. Several of the cases listed are not retroactive, meaning regulations issued prior to these decisions being handed down will not be disturbed as a result of the opinions. However, experts say agencies can re-evaluate previous rules and regulations under the new standards imposed by the Supreme Court opinions. LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS \"I think that that is good fodder, a good basis for a lot of agencies to go back and look, ‘Where have we created massive regulatory compliance burdens and structures that massively impact the economy or society on the basis of a very thin thread and where can we undo it?'\" Daniel Huff, senior legal fellow at the American Path Initiative, told Fox News Digital. \"And we can point to these elephants in mouse holes and when it's reviewed in the future, they will say ‘Yes, that is a good rationale’ and it will be upheld.\" Kara Rollins is a lawyer for the New Civil Liberties Alliance, the nonprofit organization that argued Relentless Inc. v. Dept. of Commerce in front of the high court – Loper’s companion case that sought to scale back the reach of the administrative state. Rollins told Fox News Digital the \"retrospective look\" these agencies will take toward previous regulations is not \"misplaced.\" \"The President is right: agencies must repeal regulations that the Supreme Court has deemed unlawful. The President continues to deliver on his promises to roll back regulations and government overreach crippling American enterprise,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital in a statement.(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) However, Rollins raised concerns about the administration's enforcement of the directive, noting that several related cases were already underway before the Supreme Court issued its rulings. \"What happens to these cases that are currently activewhere DOJor the agency is just taking the wrong position?\" Rollins said. \"Who's looking at that? Who's clearing out those cases and saying, in light of this memorandum, we've looked at our litigation position and we can no longer sustain it? And that's the real sort of open question, particularly for litigators right now.\" COURTROOM COMBAT: INSIDE THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY SYSTEM WHERE TRUMP'S AGENDA IS UNDER ASSAULT Rollins said that, as a litigator, her concern is agencies have yet to change positions when it comes to these Supreme Court opinions: \"That sort of signals that there is a problem between what the president is saying he wants to have happen and what's being effectuated on the ground.\" In the memo, Trump directs agencies to employ the Administrative Procedure Act’s \"good cause\" exception \"where appropriate,\" which allows agencies to do away with the usual notice-and-comment rulemaking process in the interest of the public. The usual process requires time for public input on the proposed rule. The memo lists various Supreme Court cases aligned with Trump's deregulatory agenda as well as the administration's efforts to get rid of DEI initiatives. Among the cases listed are Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, West Virginia vs. EPA, and Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College.(Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images) Huff said there is \"less of a need\" to impose the regular notice-and-comment rulemaking process given that agencies will likely be reviewing previous rules rather than passing new ones. \"They're not adding new burdens. This isn't new to people,\" Huff said. \"People already sort of know what's there and it was there before. And we're just turning back the clock. We're putting it back to the way it was. We're restoring the original status quo.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Severino said there could be litigation over the use of the exception despite the fact that the language is \"very broad.\" \"But I do think there are strong arguments for it because the laws must keep withthe constitutional limitson government, and, of course, be in the public interest.\" Haley Chi-Sing is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

For the first time in U.S. history, more women over the age of 40 are having kids compared to teen moms, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This reflects the trend of more Americans either opting not to have kids or postponing them until later. AMERICANS ARE HAVING FEWER BABIES AS BIRTH RATE HITS HISTORIC LOW, CDC REVEALS The totalnumber of U.S. birthsdeclined by 14% between 1990 and 2023, according to the March 2025 report.

BIOHACKING REVEALED: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE HIP HEALTH TREND EMBRACED BY BROOKE BURKE, TOM BRADY AND OTHERS \"Lasting effects of stress are now recognized as causing or contributing to alldiseases and disorders,\" he added. Engaging in a long-term meditation practice could significantly alleviate stress and slow down aging, suggests a new study.(iStock) The study included two groups of participants — one ranging from 20 to 30 years old and another ranging from 55 to 72. Half of the participants followed transcendental meditation and a control group did not. For each participant, the researchers analyzed the expression of genes linked toinflammation and aging, according to a press release from MIU. SECRETS OF LONGEVITY FROM THE WORLD'S 'BLUE ZONES' They found that people who practiced transcendental meditation had lower expression of the genes associated with inflammation and aging. \"The lower expression of age-related genes … extend the findings of short-term studies indicating that these practices lead tohealthy agingand more resilient adaptation to stress,\" Walton said in the release. \"Lasting effects of stress are now recognized as causing or contributing to all diseases and disorders.\" The researchers also analyzedcognitive functionvia EEG tests. Older practitioners of transcendental meditation were found to have faster processing speeds. That group also received higher scores on the Brain Integration Scale (BIS), which is a comprehensive measure ofcognitive performance. People who practiced transcendental meditation had lower expression of the genes associated with inflammation and aging.(iStock) \"The findings around cognitive function are particularly exciting,\" said co-author Frederick Travis, PhD, head of faculty at Maharishi International University, in the release. \"Both younger and older TM practitioners showed higher scores on the BIS compared to non-meditators, while the older meditators performed on par with young controls,\" he stated. COMMON SUPPLEMENT COULD HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, RESEARCH SUGGESTS The third area of focus was hair cortisol and cortisone, which are steroid hormones that serve as biomarkers for long-term stress exposure and other health conditions. The amount of active cortisol was higher for those who practiced transcendental meditation, the study found. The researchers analyzed cognitive function via EEG tests, finding that older practitioners of transcendental meditation had faster processing speeds.(iStock) \"Cortisol plays a critical role in the body’s response to stress, and chronically high cortisol levels are associated with a host of age-relatedhealth issues, in addition to cognitive decline,\" Walton said. \"The reduced cortisol-to-cortisone ratio in meditators suggests they have more adaptive reserve, more resilience, contributing to overall health and longevity.\" HEALTHY EATING IN MIDDLE AGE HAS THIS KEY LONGEVITY BENEFIT The main limitation in the years-long, cohort study was the lack of a placebo control group, according to Walton. \"These meditators practiced their techniques twice daily for many years, and the control subjects had no similar activity,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Also, most subjects spent their years in the same geographical location (Southeast Iowa in the U.S.).\" Biohacker Dave Asprey, author of the upcoming book \"Heavily Meditated: The Fast Path to Remove Your Triggers, Dissolve Stress, and Activate Inner Peace,\" has spent 25 yearsstudying meditationwith shamans and gurus, and researching neuroscience. He agrees that meditation helps to slow the aging process. \"It reduces stress — and the more stress you have that's not useful stress, likegoing to the gymor working hard, that shrinks your brain and makes you old,\" Asprey said during an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital. \"Meditation has been shown in multiple studies to undo those problems.\" \"Long-term meditators have brains that can make more electricity than someone who doesn't meditate — and their brains are more orderly,\" the expert said.(iStock) The biohacker also refers to meditation as \"weightlifting for the brain.\" \"Long-term meditators have brains that can make more electricity than someone who doesn't meditate — and their brains are more orderly.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meditation could potentially slow and perhaps prevent sometypes of dementia, according to Asprey. \"There arestudies showingthat people who meditate are better at excreting toxins,\" he added.

Also, Kyrie Irving, the dynamic point guard who worked alongside Doncic well on their way to the NBA Finals last season, suffered a torn ACL after the trade, creating a massive loss in the starting five. The Doncic deal surprised quite literally the entire basketball world, but Harrison was very secretive about dealing with the Lakers because he said, \"You can’t shop your best player.\" \"It’s not responsible because a trade might not work,\" Harrison said, perThe Athletic. \"And then they have to ultimately play under the scrutiny of being shopped.\" The deal wasn’t something fans wanted to see, and they’ve let it be known by having a \"funeral\" with a casket and all outside American Airlines Center in Dallas, the home of the Mavericks, while there have been consistent \"Fire Nico\" chants at home games with the team struggling.

MacMahon reportsthat the team is \"projected to lose dozens of millions\" in this season alone, as Mavs fans refuse to show up for games, while merchandise sales are down and even sponsors have split from the organization. \"Well, the beauty of Dallas is it is a passionate fan base,\" Harrison added. \"For us to reach out goals, we need that fan base. \"And to be honest with you, every trade I’ve ever made since I’ve been here has not been regarded as a good trade, and so sometimes it takes time.

The New York Yankees will remain committed to pushing diversity and inclusion within the organization, despite national rollbacks of DEI, including in MLB, an official said Tuesday. \"We are continually working with the members of our Diversity and Inclusion Committee and are actively engaged with our neighbors and community partners,\" senior vice president of corporate and community relations Brian Smith told theNew York Daily Newson Jackie Robinson Day. \"Our dedication towards these efforts remains unchanged, and our Diversity and Inclusion Committee continues to do its work.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM New logo on Yankees jersey(New York Yankees Twitter) The Yankees originally revealed the creation of a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee in February 2021. The announcement of that committee said the initiative was in response to \"recent, senseless tragedies in communities throughout our nation,\" less than a year after the death of George Floyd while in police custody. MLB removed \"diversity\" references from its careers page back in March. However, the careers page still includes a reference to inclusion and images of gay pride flags. President Donald Trump has made rolling back DEI in the public and private sector an early priority of his term. One of Trump'sday oneexecutive orders commanded the Office of Federal Contract Compliance to \"immediately cease\" promoting \"diversity\" and any encouragement of federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in affirmative action-like efforts that consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion or national origin when making hiring decisions. The General Services Administration (GSA)announced changes in Februaryto the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) meant to align with the president's executive order aimed at restoring meritocracy and ending discrimination in the public and private sectors. However, the Yankees believe their commitment to diversity and inclusion aligns with Trump's values on the issue. \"Our commitment remains consistent. We have been committed to driving access in our neighboring communities, and we remain committed to driving access in our neighboring communities,\" Smith said. \"We think President Trump would be pleased with our work because it creates the exact kind of opportunities that he focused on when he created an Opportunities Zone in the South Bronx in his first term.\" TRUMP TO PRESIDE OVER HISTORIC SPORTING EVENTS — WHICH TEAMS AND STARS COULD SKIP WHITE HOUSE VISITS?

It is true the Cowboys have more titles than the Eagles, who have two. But those two have come in the last seven years. The Eagles won their first in 2018 before defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in February. The Eaglesare primed to have another great season, assuming they shore up a couple holes on defense. Saquon Barkley, Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown lead a potent offense. COWBOYS' DAK PRESCOTT SAYS HE COULD ‘DEFINITELY’ PLAY ‘TODAY’ AS HE RECOVERS FROM HAMSTRING INJURY But Smith feels like three decades of not making it back to the NFC championship, let alone the Super Bowl, used to be unthinkable. \"That part bugs me,\" he said of Eagles fans taunting him about the Cowboys’ drought. \"It bugs me because in my heart I truly believe our organization should be contending for an NFC championship and even a Super Bowl at least once or twice every decade because every team recycles every decade. \"For us not to be there over the last 30 years is a crying shame.\" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones before a game against the Washington Commanders at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Jan. 5, 2025.(Kevin Jairaj/Imagn Images) The Cowboys looked like a team destined to make a playoff run during three straight 12-5 seasons from 2021-23. However, Dak Prescott & Co. lost two wild-card games in 2021 and 2023, and they fell in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers in 2022. The Cowboys have not made it past the divisional round since they won it all in 1996, a season in which Dallas went 12-4 and Smith rushed for 1,204 yards with 12 touchdowns. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been adamant in saying he'll do whatever he can to make the roster or coaching staff better. But he has been criticized this offseason for his hiring of Brian Schottenheimer as the team’s new head coach after letting Mike McCarthy go.

The hearing is scheduled for May 7. The announcement comes weeks after women's fencer Stephanie Turner waspunished for kneelingin protest of a trans competitor in a widely publicized incident. Turner has been invited to the hearing along with Damien Lehfeldt, board chair of USA Fencing, to testify. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Women’s sports are for women only. Radical leftists pushing to let biological men compete against women are destroying fair competition and putting female athletes in physical danger. Stephanie Turner had the courage to call out this insanity, and she’s a hero to women across America,\" Greene said in the announcement. \"USA Fencing must be held accountable for demeaning women and denying them of the chance to succeed in their own sport. It is out of compliance with President Trump’s executive order and it should not be recognized as the National Governing Body for fencing if it continues to defy the law.\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon announced Friday a newly formedTitle IX investigationsteam will be probing the incident involving Turner and trans competitor Redmond Sullivan. USA Fencing previously provided a statement to Fox News Digital saying it willcooperate with the investigation. Fencer Stephanie Turner kneels in front of a USA Fencing official.(Courtesy of ICONS) \"USA Fencing will respond and cooperate to any inquiry as required by law,\" the statement said. The incident involving Turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest Sullivan went viral. The footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against USA Fencing's gender eligibility policies. WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS Turner told Fox News Digital she decided to take a knee the night before the event when she checked the competition pools and saw she would be competing against Sullivan. \"I saw that I was going to be in a pool with Redmond, and from there I said, ‘OK, let’s do it. I'm going to take the knee,'\" Turner said. \"I knew what I had to do because USA Fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy].\" USA Fencingpreviously provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the incident. \"USA Fencing enacted our current transgender and nonbinary athlete policy in 2023. The policy was designed to expand access to the sport of fencing and create inclusive, safe spaces. The policy is based on the principle that everyone should have the ability to participate in sports and was based upon the research available of the day,\" the statement said. A USA Fencing spokesperson also told Fox News Digital Turner was not penalized for her stance against trans inclusion. She was penalized for refusing to compete. \"In the case of Stephanie Turner, her disqualification was not related to any personal statement but was merely the direct result of her decision to decline to fence an eligible opponent, which the FIE rules clearly prohibit,\" the spokesperson said. TRANSGENDER FENCER SCORES WORLD TITLE OVER 14-TIME WOMEN'S CHAMPION USA Fencing then addressed the controversy with a public statement Thursday, defending its trans-inclusion policies. \"USA Fencing remains committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful community for everyone in our sport.

Hate speech of any kind is not acceptable — online or in person. Let's keep the conversation respectful and the strip welcoming to all.\" The organization first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. In November 2022, it announceda policyto give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that \"harm members of LGBTQ communities\" and states that do not \"have laws undermining the reproductive health of women.\" That policy went into effect during the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released alist of statesthat it intended to \"avoid where possible\" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. In December, the nonprofit Fair Fencing Organization penned an open letter toUSA Fencingboard members, urging the reevaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however,board members voted againstseveral motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. Now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing finds itself with a global controversy after Turner's viral protest.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses a heated school board meeting in Maine over the fight to protect girls' sports and Kamala Harris' reported rejection from campaigning for a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate. A school district in Maine is moving to comply with the current federal definition of Title IX and ban biological male trans athletes from girls' sports, while thestate government fightsto enable trans inclusion. The MSAD #70 School Board voted unanimously on Monday night to comply withTitle IX, \"recognizing only two sexes - biological male and biological female and that all private spaces be separated by biological sex.\" MSAD #70 superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital that, due to this vote, he is now directed to amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls' sports. \"The motion directs me to rewrite our policies to adhere to the motion. It is my interpretation that the school board will be looking to approve policies that align biological sex to their specific athletic teams too i.e. biological males will be playing with only other biological males and same for biological females. These policies will need to be approved by the policy committee and the board once rewritten,\" Putnam said. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM MSAD #70 is based in Hodgdon in Aroostook County. It is the northernmost county in the state and voted for PresidentDonald Trumpby a margin of 18% in the November election. The county also voted for two Republican state senators and seven Republican state House representatives. Now, the county's school district will be siding with Trump and its Republican lawmakers in the ongoing battle over trans athlete inclusion in girls' sports. Putnam told Fox News Digital that the district has had no communication with state authorities, including the attorney general, the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) or the Maine Principal's Association (MPA) about the recent vote. \"We have not had communication over this specific motion. Our board, similar to many people in Maine, have been following the back and forth communication between the federal government and the state. We are hoping for both sides to work together to help support local school districts like ourselves,\" Putnam said. \"With the rising educational costs, this is a time we need to work with each other and not against. The board and our staff's No. 1 priority is to provide our students with an education that will positively impact their future in our great state and country. I am proud to work for and be from our small community in Hodgdon, Maine. My hope is that all of our students will benefit from the leadership decisions that are made at the local, state and national level.\" Maine state Rep. Tracy Quint, one of the Republicans who represents Aroostook County, praised MSAD #70 for its vote. \"I’m encouraged to see our local Maine community standing up for our students by upholding Title IX protections. Ensuring fairness, safety and privacy for every student should always come before politics. I urge other school districts across the state to follow this example and prioritize the well-being of all their students,\" Quint told Fox News Digital. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Maine Attorney General's Office and Gov. Janet Mills' office for comment. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER The state is currently facing immense federal pressure to comply with Trump's February executive order to ban trans athletes from girls' and women's sports, but has firmly defied the order under Mills' leadership. Maine has been referred to the Department of Justice twice over the last month, and faces a federal funding freeze by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Maine officialsfiled a lawsuit against the USDA last Monday in response to the agency’s decision to freeze funding. A federal judge ruled Friday that the USDA \"must immediately unfreeze and release to the state of Maine any federal funding that they have frozen or failed or refused to pay because of the state of Maine's alleged failure to comply with the requirements of Title IX.\" The state's divide on trans inclusion was then brought to light when Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby identified a trans athlete in a social media post who won a girls' pole vault competition for Greely High School in February. Libby was censured for her social media post on the premise she identified a minor by name and with a photo. However, Libby has since filed a lawsuit to have the censure overturned, arguing the trans athlete had already been identified by other media prior to her post. The lawsuit has gone to trial in a Rhode Island district court. In addition to the incident involving the pole vaulter at Greely High School, other instances have affected multiple girls across the state who have had to compete with and share locker rooms with biological males.

    "article_text": "WWE champion Cody Rhodes talks to Fox News Digital about the upcoming title match against John Cena at WrestleMania 41. The second night ofWrestleMania 41will certainly be one to remember with Cody Rhodes and John Cena headlining the main event that pro wrestling fans will be talking about the entire week, but it is far from the only match on the card on the second night of the biggest spectacle in sports. The second night will feature at least six matches with five champions defending their titles in either singles or tag-team competitions. There are two multi-person matches and a street fight set for the bright lights in the city of sin. Night 2 of WrestleMania 41 will take place at Allegiant Stadium at 7 p.m. ET inLas Vegas. It is the second WrestleMania to take place in the Las Vegas area and the first since WrestleMania IX in 1993. U.S. fans will be able to watch on Peacock and international fans on Netflix. Read below for a preview of the second night. -- Iyo Sky wins the SmackDown Women's Championship.(WWE) Iyo Sky lost the WWE Women’s World Championship at last year’s WrestleMania to Bayley, and it took her nearly a year to get back into the title picture. After Rhea Ripley cost Sky a chance at being in the women’s Elimination Chamber, she offered Sky a title shot weeks before WrestleMania. Ripley was distracted by the women’s chamber winnerBianca Belairsitting at ringside and lost her focus. Sky capitalized and stunned Ripley to win the championship. The WWE Universe thought it would be Sky and Belair at WrestleMania, but Ripely found a way into the match and instead it being one-on-one, it became a triple threat. Ripley was disqualified in her rematch against Sky but made herself a force to be reckoned with over the last few weeks to insert herself back into the title picture. Ripley will look to win her third consecutive WrestleMania match and fourth straight match involving a singles title. Belair has had success in title matches at WrestleMania – winning or retaining the women’s title three times. Logan Paul during the Men’s Royal Rumble match during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Feb. 1, 2025.(Joe Camporeale-Imagn Images) The match between Logan Paul andA.J. Styleshas been a recent addition to the WrestleMania card. Styles headlined the first premium live event after WrestleMania 40 with a title match against Rhodes at Backlash. However, he has only had a few televised matches since then, apart from an appearance in NOAH over the summer. Styles reappeared at the Royal Rumble but was ousted, and he defeated \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio on Raw back in February. Paul has been a thorn in Styles’ side since the Royal Rumble. Paul missed his own chance to get a marquee matchup at WrestleMania, losing out in the Royal Rumble and in the Elimination Chamber. \"The Maverick\" has been known to create viral WrestleMania moments and is poised to do it one more time. Liv Morgan during the Women’s Royal Rumble during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Feb. 1, 2025.(Joe Camporeale-Imagn Images) Liv Morgan’s 2024-25 has been eventful to say the least. She was able to hold the Women’s World Championship for months before she lost it to Rhea Ripley at the beginning of January. She and Raquel Rodriguez then entered the tag-team scene and won the titles from Belair and Naomi in February. Since then, Morgan and Rodriguez have been on top of the world. Morgan even scored a key win over Jade Cargill at the end of March on \"Fright Night SmackDown.\" At WrestleMania, the champs will have new challenges in Bayley and Lyra Valkyria. The newly formed tag team won a gauntlet match to become the No. 1 contenders for the title. It came after Bayley fell short of Valkyria for the Women’s Intercontinental Championship. Bron Breakker hoists Speed on Saturday, Feb. 1, 2025, during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.(IMAGN) Bron Breakkerhas been on an absolute tear since he was called up to the main roster this year. He won the Intercontinental Championship from Jey Uso in October and has not lost it since. However, WrestleMania 41 poses a formidable challenge since he does not have to be pinned to lose it. Penta, Mysterio and Finn Balor will all participate the fatal four-way match. Penta joined WWE in January and has become one of the most electrifying performers in recent memory. His lucha libre-style of wrestling has delighted the WWE Universe and has helped him become a contender for the title. Mysterio and Balor are the two leaders of a crumbling Judgment Day faction. Mysterio has drawn a ton of heat since he joined Judgment Day, but his on-screen partner Liv Morgan has helped Mysterio go through some changes since he dumped Ripley at SummerSlam. Balor was once a WWE world champion and could revive his standing on the roster with Breakker’s title. Balor has tons of experience when it comes to championship matches but has not won a match at WrestleMania since WrestleMania 35 in 2019. Damian Priest won the 2023 men's Money in the Bank ladder match.(WWE) The match between Damian Priest andDrew McIntyreappeared to be about a year in the making. McIntyre won the World Heavyweight Championship in an epic match with Seth Rollins at WrestleMania 40 last year. McIntyre celebrated in front of an injured CM Punk, who was on commentary as he was injured. However, his celebration did not last long. Punk proceeded to beatdown and embarrass McIntyre, leading to Priest cashing in his Money in the Bank contract and winning the title from McIntyre. Since then, McIntyre has been on a revenge tour. He had three hellacious matches against Punk in the summer. Priest moved from the Raw brand to SmackDown, and since then, the gloves have been off between the two competitors. Priest slammed McIntyre threw a car windshield, which appeared to legitimately injure McIntyre’s eye. The feud was at a fever pitch, and Nick Aldis announced the two would finish it off in Las Vegas at WrestleMania 41. On the penultimate SmackDown before WrestleMania, their match was announced as a Sin City Street Fight. McIntyre ripped off his eyepatch and vowed to leave Priest helpless. He nearly did that by giving him a Future Shock DDT on the steel steps. John Cena, right, in action against Cody Rhodes during WWE Elimination Chamber at Rogers Centre on March 1, 2025 in Toronto.(Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty Images) Rhodes andCena have turned a mutual admiration for each other into a bitter feud that started at the Elimination Chamber premium live event when Cena sided with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and beat Rhodes down with some help from rapper Travis Scott of all people. Since then, the two have traded plenty of barbs with each other over the last few weeks. It ended in London when Cena tried to go for a cheap shot on Rhodes. \"The America Nightmare\" turned it around on Cena and hit him with the Cross Rhodes. Rhodes told Fox News Digital that this matchup against Cena feels like it was the \"first-time ever\" for him. \"So, now, looking at the matchup, that’s why I say it feels like a first-time-ever for me, because early in my career, I hadn’t found my footing. I didn’t know who I was,\" he said. \"And now, especially judging from these past several interactions in the ring, I feel like we do know who each other are now. \"I couldn’t have put it in my wildest dreams that this would be a WrestleMania headline match and main event, especially under the circumstances it’s come under. But that’s the beautiful thing about pro wrestling; it’s too tough to call.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

She won the Money in the Bank ladder match and cashed in on her former partner Nia Jax to win the WWE Women’s Championship. But the upstart wrestler is poised to run into one of the biggest challenges of her young career – go after a legendary competitor in Charlotte Flair. Flair came back from a devastating knee injury to win the women’s Royal Rumble. She chose to challenge Stratton in pursuit of a 15th women’s championship. While Flair seemingly had the upper hand over her new rival at the start of the feud, Stratton came back at her with fiery words as the two got personal in one of their more interesting altercations yet. On the penultimate \"Friday Night SmackDown,\" Flair attacked Stratton in the parking lot as a revenge measure. Flair has the experience and the accolades going into the match but Stratton has been known to pick herself up by her bootstraps and overcome the odds. Intercontinental Championship match between Gunther and Sami Zayn during Wrestlemania XL at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, April 6, 2024.(Joe Camporeale-USA Today Sports) Jey Uso has emerged as one of the most popular superstars on the WWE roster since defeating his brother, Jimmy, in a grudge match at last year’s WrestleMania. Fans have gotten behind his \"yeet movement\" to help propel him to become the No. 1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. It all culminated in a surprise Royal Rumble win back in February. But Uso chose to go the more difficult route – trying to excise some demons and finally defeat Gunther for the title. Uso has not had much luck so far. Gunther defeated Uso at Saturday Night’s Main Event in January and on an episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" in May of last year. Gunther upped the ante when he delivered a bloody beatdown of Jimmy Uso in a match in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania. But Jey Uso made clear he’s no longer afraid of Gunther and is ready to bring the fight in Las Vegas. Jade Cargill in action against Naomi during WWE Elimination Chamber at Rogers Centre on March 1, 2025, in Toronto, Canada.(Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty Images) The match betweenJade Cargilland Naomi could potentially steal the show. There is an intensity between the two competitors that may only be matched by the five wrestlers who will be the marquee main events for WrestleMania 41. The feud started when Cargill was mysteriously attacked and tossed onto a car. For weeks, Naomi and Belair tried to find out who the attacker was. At the time, Belair and Cargill were women’s tag-team champions and Naomi was tapped to fill in for Cargill. SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis suggested Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez could be the ones to blame for the assault. As the women’s Elimination Chamber was set to take place, Cargill came out after all the contestants entered the ring. Cargill looked at Morgan and then attacked Naomi in front of her tag-team partner. Naomi has since copped to the assault and the match was made. Erik and Ivar have been on a tear since they returned to the ring following their significant injuries. In December, the team claimed tag-team gold when they defeated Finn Balor and JD McDonagh for the tiles. They have successfully defended their titles four times since then. Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods have talked the talk since their separation from Big E, forming the current New Day tag team fans see now. Kingston and Woods have not earned the respect of fans but could do so by the end of their WrestleMania match. The New Day will get a second crack at the War Raiders for the titles. Jacob Fatu yells in celebration, Feb. 1, 2025, during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.(IMAGN) LA Knightenters WrestleMania 41 as the United States champion but he faces a huge uphill battle with Jacob Fatu. Knight might have the game in his hand as one of the more popular champions on the SmackDown roster. Fatu has shown to be a different beast. He’s cut down almost every monster he’s come across since he came to WWE. He’s proven that he can go toe-to-toe with anyone who steps in the ring with him and bring a path of destruction. But between the two wrestlers, Knight is the one with WrestleMania experience. He defeated A.J. Styles in his first WrestleMania match last year. It propelled him on a course for the United States Championship. Fatu has yet to appear at a WrestleMania. It’ll be the first matchup between the two wrestlers. Rey Mysterio during the Men’s Royal Rumble match during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Feb. 1, 2025.(Joe Camporeale-Imagn Images) Rey Mysteriois one of the legends on the roster and over the last few months he’s been in feuds with his son, the Judgment Day, Santos Escobar and now El Grande Americano. El Grande Americano burst onto the scene after Chad Gable took time off in an angle to learn the ways of Lucha Libre. Soon after, El Grande Americano burst onto the scene. He’s been a rival of Dragon Lee in recent weeks but he used his loaded mask to headbutt Mysterio during one of the recent matches between the Latino World Order and American Made. Mysterio requested a match with El Grande Americano and Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Roman Reigns throws a punch at Jacob Fatu on Feb. 1, 2025, during the WWE Royal Rumble at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.(IMAGN) Bad blood and a long history between thesethree rivalswill be in the spotlight at WrestleMania 41. As mentioned before, the three competitors have a history dating back to the days Reigns and Rollins were in The Shield faction. Punk was dropping \"pipe bombs\" on WWE management at that time. A lot has changed since then. Punk returned at Survivor Series 2023 – much to the surprise of the pro wrestling world and the entire Chicago crown. Rollins was noticeably irate and he reignited his perceived hatred for Punk right then and there. The two verbally sparred for months as Punk needed to recover from a triceps injury during the 2024 Royal Rumble. Once he recovered, Punk started a feud with Drew McIntyre before returning to focus on Rollins. What upset Rollins even further was Punk helping Reigns during the WarGames match at the 2024 Survivor Series. Rollins’ anger toward Reigns grew it and it all came to a head at the Royal Rumble in February when the three competitors were eliminated one-by-one. Rollins gave a stomp to Reigns and Punk. Reigns returned in March to interfere in a cage match between Rollins and Punk. It kickstarted where the storyline is now. There is one added bonus. Reigns’ longtime wiseman, Paul Heyman, owed Punk a favor for helping Reigns defeat the rest of the Bloodline at Survivor Series. In return, Heyman told Reigns he would be in Punk’s corner for the triple threat match. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The final \"RAW\" before WrestleMania showed a massive confrontation between the competitors. Reigns pushed Heyman to the ground before he speared Punk. Rollins got his revenge with a massive chairshot on Reigns before he stomped Punk. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on Xand subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses a heated school board meeting in Maine over the fight to protect girls' sports and Kamala Harris' reported rejection from campaigning for a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate. MaineGov. Janet Mills downplayed the uproar over the state’s transgender-inclusion policies in girls’ and women’s sports on Monday and said she was \"appalled\" over the Trump administration’s lawsuits against her state amid a battle over federal funds. Mills appeared on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe\" to discuss her battle with several departments of the Trump administration, which started when the state refused to comply with PresidentDonald Trump’s\"No Men in Women’s Sports\" executive order which prohibited biological males in girls’ and women’s sports. The state did not comply with the order, which kick-started the issue. \"The chief executive is required by the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, not to make the laws, not to invent the laws or reinterpret the laws by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order. He’s not allowed to do that. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Maine Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump.(Getty Images) \"So, when he reinterpreted Title IX … I support Title IX. I have spent the better part of my career protecting the rights of women and girls in healthcare, in employment, housing credit and the like and I’m appalled. I was appalled at his interpretation that he can just reinvent the law.\" Mills recalled the letters she received from the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services. She described an April 2 letter from USDA Secretary Brooke Rollinsas \"rather appalling\"and said some described it as a \"ransom note.\" In the letter, the administration threatened to cut off funding for Maine because of the state’s continued allowance of biological males in girls’ and women’s sports. \"The very next day, because there are maybe at most two transgender athletes competing in Maine schools right now, they decided to shut off funding for our school nutrition program, the school lunch program, entirely, on which 172,000 Maine schoolchildren rely on for their school meals. That didn’t make any sense,\" Mills said. She added that the lawsuits against the state were \"not rational.\" A federal judge granted Maine a temporary restraining order and ruled the funding freeze must be lifted. Gov. Janet Mills attends an event, March 11, 2022, in Augusta, Maine.(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty, File) \"This temporary restraining order confirms the Trump Administration did not follow the rule of law when it cut program funds that go to feed school children and vulnerable adults,\" Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said in a statement. \"This order preserves Maine’s access to certain congressionally appropriated funds by prohibiting an unlawful freeze by the administration. \"No one in our constitutional republic is above the law and we will continue to fight to hold this administration to account.\" MAINE 'MAGA' PARENT SILENCED AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING DURING SPEECH OPPOSING TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS The USDA \"must immediately unfreeze and release to the state of Maine any federal funding that they have frozen or failed or refused to pay because of the state of Maine's alleged failure to comply with the requirements of Title IX,\" District Court Judge John Woodcock’sruling read. The administration was also \"barred from freezing, terminating, or otherwise interfering with the state of Maine's future federal funding for alleged violations of Title IX without complying with the legally required procedure.\" Maine has refused to comply with Trump’s executive order to ban biological males from girls’ and women’s sports. Trump initially vowed to cut federal funding to the state if it were to refuse to comply with the order during a Feb. 20 speech. Maine officials filed a lawsuit against the USDA last week following the agency’s decision to freeze funding to the state. President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Sunday, April 13, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) The state accused the USDA of \"withholding funding used to feed children in schools, childcare centers, and after-school programming as well as disabled adults in congregate settings,\" an argument the judge agreed with. The judge noted that the freeze was due to Title IX violations, but it restricted the ability to \"provid[e] meals to children and vulnerable adults.\" Meanwhile, Maine residents have made their opinions known when it came to transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s sports. A March poll showed that 64% of Maine residents believe transgender athletes \"definitely should not\" or \"probably should not\" participate in girls’ and women’s sports. Only 29% of Maine residents believed that transgender athletes \"probably should\" or \"definitely should\" compete against girls and women in sports. Thepoll also showedthat 56% of Maine Democrats believe that transgender athletes should be allowed to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. When it came to enacting policies to combat the issue of transgender participation in sports, the poll showed that 50% of Maine residents wanted it at the federal level, while 41% believe policy should be left up to the states.

    "article_text": "During a family trip near an archaeological site in Hod Hasharon, Israel, Dafna Filshteiner discovered an ancient amulet dating back approximately 3,500 years. Two metal detectorists recently came across millennia-old treasure in a small European village. The discovery was made this spring in the Romanian commune of Breaza, Mureș County, which is located in Transylvania. Transylvania is famous for being the setting of Bram Stoker's novel \"Dracula,\" as well as its connection to the brutal leader Vlad the Impaler. DOZENS OF ANCIENT SKELETONS FOUND IN HEART OF BUSTLING CITY: 'HARD TO IMAGINE' But the recent archaeological discovery was far from frightening. In a Facebook post, the Breaza Mures Municipality City Hall wrote that two finders named Dionisie-Aurel Moldovan and Sebastian-Adrian Zăhan came across the treasure, which dates back to the Dacians. The Dacians settled in present-day Romania in the 1st millennium B.C. The group unsuccessfully warred against the Roman Empire in the second century A.D., and Dacia became aRoman provincein 106 A.D.

    "article_text": "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with. Windows 11 is the latest and greatest operating system from Microsoft, but it has its flaws, so much so that even four years after its release, some people are sticking with older versions. Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October. If that’s not enough to push you toward upgrading, the latest news might be. The 240 million Windows 10 users are vulnerable to dozens of security vulnerabilities, six of which are reportedly already being exploited by bad actors. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW A person typing on a Windows laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices. The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements. The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features. For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk. Windows laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC Microsoft has released patches to address these issues, andAmerica’s Cyber Defense Agencyhas urged users to update their systems immediately, ideally by this month, or risk severe consequences. The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now. However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft’s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It’s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can’t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually. The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some. Analysts warn this could contribute to a surge in electronic waste, unless recycling and repurposing efforts improve dramatically. RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID If you’re a Windows 10 user, the immediate step is to ensure your system is updated with the latest patches. Follow the steps below to do that: Windows update(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MICROSOFT SETS MAY END DATE FOR SKYPE AFTER 14-YEAR RUN 1)Use strong antivirus software:Even with the latest patches, no system is entirely immune to threats. Strong antivirus software can act as a second line of defense, detecting and neutralizing malware that exploits vulnerabilities before they cause harm. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats. While this won’t fix unpatched system flaws after October 2025, it can reduce risks from common attack vectors like phishing or malicious downloads.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2) Limit exposure:Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled). 3) Plan for the future:The clock is ticking on Windows 10’s security updates. If your hardware can’t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware. The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it’s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.

    "title": "Smarter dairy farms where robots milk the cows",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how robots can milk, feed and clean cows on dairy farms, boosting efficiency and comfort. Picture this: A dairy barn full of cows being milked, fed and cleaned up after, but there’s no farmer in sight. Sounds a bit unusual, right? Well, it’s not as far-fetched as you might think. Thanks to cutting-edge agricultural robotics, this kind of scene is becoming more common. At this farm, a team of autonomous robots is taking care of all the essential chores, completely changing the way dairy farming works. These robots aren’t just doing the heavy lifting; they’re creating a stress-free, comfortable environment for the cows while keeping things efficient and sustainable. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production. Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide. Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HUMANOID ROBOT STUNS WITH PERFECT SIDE FLIP ACROBATICS Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators. Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs. AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity. Discovery Collector manure solution (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SCARY AI-POWERED SWARM ROBOTS TEAM UP TO BUILD CARS FASTER THAN EVER Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows. Lely recognizes the importance of designing robots that are not only functional but also trustworthy and reliable. Jan Jacobs emphasizes that the robots are not intended to be friends with the cows or the farmers but rather professional employees. Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Here are some specs of the Lely Astronaut A5 milking robot: Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for. Lely helps farmers prepare for the shift to robotic dairy farming, both in terms of the physical environment and their mindset. This includes managing the massive amount of data generated by the robots and using it for long-term optimization. Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path. Astronaut milking robot (Lely)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The cost of a milking robot can be several hundred thousand dollars, plus an additional $5,000 to $10,000 per year in operating costs. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES So, what's the future of dairy farming look like? It seems like robots are poised to play a huge role, helping farmers work smarter, not harder. It's interesting to think about how these technologies will continue to evolve and shape the industry in the years to come. At the end of the day, dairy farming is about people and animals. While robots can handle many of the repetitive tasks, it's the farmer's knowledge and care that truly make a difference. These technologies are tools, and how farmers use them will determine the future of their farms and the well-being of their herds. It's definitely a blend of the old and the new for dairy farmers who are purchasing these robots. Knowing what you know now, how would you feel about buying milk from a robotic dairy farm?

    "title": "Republicans say Democrats don't have a message. They do, and it's destructive.",
    "article_text": "'The Five' co-hosts discuss former President Joe Biden gearing up to make his first speech since leaving the White House. In the acrimonious climate of the current political debate, the biggest lie of all is told by Republicans who claimDemocrats are in disarraybecause they have no message to persuade voters to support them. Actually, they do have a message. But it is a message so obvious, destructive, and forbidding that it offends Republicans so profoundly they would prefer not to recognize it – so they don’t. Democrats do have a message, which is this: Every policy of the Trump administration designed to make America safer, stronger, wealthier, and more prosperous is a policy that must be resisted, sabotaged, and obstructed by any means necessary. Worse, its proponents should be demonized and marginalized as extremists. What does this look like in the context of the real world and in America’s cold war with heavily armed nuclear adversaries and totalitarian enemies who have made no bones about their desire to destroy us? In this context, Democrats' divisive strategies weaken America, give comfort and aid to our enemies, and undermine our efforts to defend ourselves. Among his first acts in office, President Joe Biden opened our borders to somewhere between 10 and 20 million mostly unvetted aliens, many on the terrorist watch list and still more with long criminal records. Many Democrats reject the mandate of Donald Trump's 2024 victory which showed the vast majority of Americans thought Biden's border policies dangerous and unwise. Democrats have dedicated themselves to obstructing the Trump administration’s efforts to deport the criminals who Biden welcomed and subsidized. This reflects poorly on Democrats' concern for the safety of their fellow citizens and projects weakness to potential enemies seeking to infiltrate our country. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Moreover, there is no indication Democrats have given serious thought to the negative impact of their policies on the welfare or security of American citizens, whether in regard to their obstruction of Trump's efforts to deport criminals, or their attacks on police, their demonization of America’s commander-in-chief and the undermining of executive authority in enforcing the law. If the commander-in-chief is dismissed as an \"agent of chaos\" what moral authority is left to defend us? MAHER WARNS DEMS' REFUSAL TO DITCH UNPOPULAR ‘WOKE’ ISSUES MAY MAKE THEM AN ‘IRRELEVANT PARTY’ The posture of the Democrat Party is not focused on one nor even a cluster of policy positions. To the social justice warriors leading the Party, it is the American enterprise itself that is the villain. They see America as a nation created and still run by racist oligarchs who oppress people of color and with whom there can be no common ground. \"Social justice\" demands revolutionary solutions, and revolutionary solutions demand no compromise and disregard for the Constitution and the law. Democrats understand their message is toxic. So they project their disloyalty to the Constitutiononto Republicans, hoping to tar them with the same brush. WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 04: Democrats hold protest signs as U.S. President Donald Trump address a joint session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Win McNamee/Pool via REUTERS) But do they believe it? We now knowBiden's incompetencewas known throughout the White House inner circle. With wars raging in Ukraine, Syria, and the Middle East, it presented enormous dangers to America and to the West. Did any member of the cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment which was specifically designed to remove the president if he was no longer competent to be commander-in-chief? On the contrary, too many denied and covered up his incompetence. Such was the contempt Democrats had for America's Constitutional safeguards.

But when the Trump administration attempts this – unless Democrat patriots stand up – there will be an army of saboteurs working to resist them.

    "title": "Why 'toxic masculinity' is a dangerous and terrible fraud",
    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks calls out the idea of toxic masculinity for creating 'weak men' in our society. The idea of ‘toxic masculinity’ has been one of the biggest frauds perpetrated upon the American man. It is not toxic to be a man. It is not toxic to lead with strength and vision. It is not toxic to be responsible and demand it in return. It is not toxic to believe and create. And it is not toxic to believe in God. Yet we men have been served the lie that the American man is toxic. This single ideological lie has done profound damage by creating the weak man, a true toxicity. The weak man who commits crimes is toxic. The weak man who abdicates responsibility is toxic. The weak man who lives off the government  and sits home doing nothing is toxic. The weak man who loses himself within the feminist ideology of how a man should be is toxic.  The weak man who dreams of nothing and ventures nothing is toxic. The weak man who lives fearfully is toxic. And the weak man who does not believe in a higher power is toxic. LIBERAL AUTHOR TELLS 'THE VIEW' THERE'S 'NO SUCH THING' AS TOXIC MASCULINITY When we have weak men, the order and balance of our society is off. Since the beginning of time, the man, a righteous and strong man, has represented both the natural and biblical order of things. We men have allowed that vaunted order to be weakened. We have second guessed ourselves. We thought there was another way.  We men of today have betrayed that long unbroken line of what it means to be a man. We men have been served the lie that the American man is toxic. This single ideological lie has done profound damage by creating the weak man, a true toxicity. I see weak men all the time inmy work as a pastor.  I tell them that two things are required to be a man: belief in yourself and belief in a higher power. A man who believes in himself believes in those around him, especially his woman. A man who believes in himself will not allow himself to grow dependent on others. A man who believes in himself will not let his kids go hungry or astray. A man who believes in himself has that special pride that fuels his every step. We know such a man upon sight because of that quiet confidence with which they carry themselves. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That brings me to my second point:belief in a higher power. I don’t care what power that is. A man must believe in something larger than himself for it keeps him balanced within the natural and biblical order of things.  It keeps him grounded, humble and yet forward moving. I am a Christianand whenever I encounter a weak man, I tell him the following: 1. Jesus Gives You Purpose When Life Feels Pointless 2. Jesus Offers Real Love When the World Only Offers Likes 3. Jesus Can Break Chains the System Can’t Touch 4. Jesus Gives You a Family When Yours Feels Broken 5. Jesus Changes the End of Your Story CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Being a good man is hard but believing in God shines light on that forward path.  We were not granted our gift of life upon this blessed earth to be weak.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Democrats know 'judge shopping' is anti-Democratic and wrong",
    "article_text": "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., dissects the legal battle between the Trump administration and Judge James Boasberg over deportation flights on ‘Fox News Live.’ It is often said that a good baseball umpire goes all but unnoticed while a bad one becomes the center of attention and anger at the ballpark. These days, this is a saying that can apply with equal accuracy to the federal judges handling the avalanche of legal challenges against the Trump administration. What rankles Americans, and not just supporters of PresidentDonald Trump, is how obviously the Democrats and their allies are judge shopping for exactly the umpires who will make the calls they want, seemingly, no matter what happens on the field. The star of the game among the judges handling Trump-aligned cases this season is James Boasberg, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in which capacity, among other things, he ordered the administration to turn around a plane full of gang members going to El Salvador and return mid-flight. The Trump administration declined to do so, but Boasberg did manage to delay many further deportations. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? Much like Judge Juan Marchan who presided over Trump’s hush money case inNew York City, Boasberg has emerged as a liberal darling, to them, a true man of the law speaking truth to power and defending the guardrails against autocracy or fascism, or whatever. Much like Merchan, Boasberg also has an adult daughter who works for left-wing causes, in this case a pro-illegal immigration organization called Partners in Justice, which opposes both the removal of gangbangers and the congressionally approved, the anti-illegal immigrant violenceLaken Riley Act. Put bluntly, James Boasberg could have been assembled in the laboratory of a neoliberal think tank to ensure the will of voters is subject to the approval of the ideological elite. You might elect Donald Trump president, but judges will decide what he actually does. Let’s not kid ourselves, the litigants trying to sue the Trump administration into oblivion, or at least delay its actions indefinitely, know that Boasberg is on their team. The problem is that this is our judicial system. It's not the desert merry-go-round under a glass dome at a Jersey diner, nobody should be able to just point and say, \"I’ll take that one.\" DAVID MARCUS: SORRY DEMS, LITERALLY NOBODY BELIEVES MARRIED WOMEN CAN’T GET IDS We can be sure that Democrats know just how biased the practice of judge shopping is because anytime Trump is rebuked by a judge appointed by a Republican, who was appointed by say, President George W. Bush or Trump himself, they use it as evidence that the decision is unbiased. If a decision has more weight and legitimacy when a judge appointed by a president’s own party signs it, then must not a decision signed by a judge appointed by the opposition party carry less? In an ideal world, a judge's party affiliation would be irrelevant to his interpretation of the law, but we don’t live in that world, and maybe we never have. The best substitute in that case is to assign cases at random, not to stack the court with friends. There are signs that both the judiciary and congress are beginning to take the issue of judge shopping seriously. In its 5-4 decision overruling Boasberg’s order which halted deportations of Tren de Aragua gang members, the critical element in theSupreme Court’s decisionwas where the case was brought. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a concurring opinion, wrote, \"the Court’s disagreement is not overwhetherthe detainees receive judicial review of their transfers—all nine members of the Court agree that judicial review is available. The only question iswherethat judicial review should occur.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In this case, the review must take place deep in the heart of Texas, not in the rarefied air ofWashington, D.C.In other words, no more judge shopping. Likewise,Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is challenging his body to reform a judiciary that, through means including judge shopping, has become thoroughly anti-democratic. \"The President of the United States shouldn’t have to ask permission from more than 600 different district judges to manage the executive branch he was elected to lead,\" Grassley said this month, adding, \"the practice of sweeping nationwide injunctions, broad restraining orders and judicial policy making must end. It’s unconstitutional, it’s anti-democratic and it’s imprudent. If the Supreme Court won’t stop it, Congress must,\" Hear, hear. The Democrats had a chance to defeatDonald Trump, or at least take one or the other of the houses of Congress back in November. They lost. Now they are committed to cherry-picking judges who will thwart the will not just of Trump but of the American people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Umpires, like judges, wear black. This is so nobody can say they prefer the colors of one team to another. Our country cannot function if judicial robes turn to red and blue, and if every plaintiff can choose their preference. No, the American people want and deserve judges who simply and fairly call balls and strikes.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: How the Senate and House find $2 trillion",
    "article_text": "Now the hard work begins Hear me out, members (and staffs) of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee. Do notraise taxeson anyone, even those making a million or more a year. That should be a red line for Republicans. But you need revenue to pay for extending and expanding theTrump 2017 tax cutsthat powered the explosive growth of his first term before the Covid curtain came down. Here’s an option. According to the Investment Company Institute, Americans had $8.9 trillion invested in 401(k)s and $15.2 trillion in IRAs in the third quarter of 2024. Let’s call it $22 trillion in yet-to-be-taxed money. (I suspect retirement funds held in 401(a) and 403(b) accounts are included in these numbers, so let’s stick with $22 trillion in untaxed retirement savings.) GOP SENATORS BULLISH ON POST-EASTER ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL’ BUDGET AGREEMENT Not $24 trillion, because roughly $1.5 trillion of the retirement account amounts cited above are deposited in \"Roth IRAs,\" on which taxes have already been collected and within which funds grow tax-free. Funds in Roth IRAs can be withdrawn tax-free according to the rules governing those accounts under which the account holder must be 59 1/2 or using the money for a first home purchase. Roth IRA contributions were taxed in the year they were treated as income, but they grow in those accounts tax-free. The savings in traditional 401(k)s and IRAs have not been taxed, have grown tax-free, and will only be taxed when their owners or their heirs withdraw the money. What is needed is a \"conversion incentive window.\" Put one in the tax code for 2026. These Roth 401(k) dollars don’t figure in any \"conversion incentive window\" provisions in a future tax code as they have already found their way to the tax-favored Roth accounts. But all the other tax-protected retirement account holders will quickly be assessing —and probably using— any fair opportunity to convert their savings into Roth IRAs provided the \"conversion tax\" isn’t too high. Every year aroundtax timesome older Americans receive suggestions that they \"convert\" their retirement holdings to Roth IRAs. It is perfectly legal to do, but difficult to figure out whether to do it. Thus, financial planners nudge their clients to at least make the calculations as best they can. It sometimes makes sense for the non-Roth IRA saver to do so, but not often. Most older Americans will earn less as they age and thus pay lower taxes on the withdrawals when they are made, so they don’t convert. Some may believe taxes will increase by the time they retire, so they do. Others don’t really want to confront the grim math of actuarial tables, so they don’t do the calculations. So it is very difficult to calculate the eventual tax people will pay to the federal government on their retirement savings because, of course, we don’t know how long everyone will live or the future tax rates or if they intend to leave all or most of their 401/IRA savings to their heirs. But there has to be an educated guess somewhere in the Congressional Budget Office (\"CBO\") on how much the IRS will eventually collect from these $22 trillion inuntaxed retirement savings, though that \"estimate\" is truly throwing a dart in the dark given the number of variables involved. If, however, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee agree to adopt for next year a one-time \"conversion window\" in the reconciliation process that allows and taxes \"conversions\" of savings in traditional 401(k), 403(b) and IRA accounts into Roth IRA accounts, the revenue windfall in 2026 would be immense. Taxpayers would line up to pay that \"conversion tax\" if it was at 10% and would probably shy away if it was 25% or more. If the conversion rate is, say, 15%, the income to the government should be much more than a trillion dollars and perhaps three times that amount, which would count as the \"savings\" the House and Senate have to \"find\" to keep all the promises made in the recently adopted budget. The key legislators, with an assist from CBO, can play with the conversion rates from 10% to 25% and still guarantee a windfall. That’s for the CBO and the tax code writers to figure out. But the concept? It’s as simple as the Kemp-Roth tax plan of long ago and would prove just as popular and growth inducing as that plan did when President Reagan largely adopted it as well. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Some states with high income taxes will complain about such a provision as they fret over the loss of future income tax revenue, but savers are leaving their states for the low-to-no tax states anyway, and the SALT deduction increase is in this mix to begin with. States with high \"state and local taxes\" should accept a win on the SALT deduction increasing and simply shut up on the theoretical loss in tax revenues years down the road, a \"loss\" of tax revenue they can’t count on in any event. The biggest obstacle to this \"window\" opening is that it has no lobby behind it, no well-heeled K-Street bigs pushing for it as there is no lobby for people who save for their retirement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But there is a chasm between the tax andspending blueprintsof the Senate GOP and the House GOP. A \"conversion window\" is the bridge they need and a sponsor of it will enter the Kemp-Roth Hall of Fame. Rather than rattle every bone inside the Beltway by grappling with entitlements except around the margins where \"waste, fraud and abuse\" live, start asking CBO for revenue estimates on the 401(k)/IRA conversion window. Just do it, Congress. Not every idea needs to be advanced by lobbyists.

    "title": "SEN ELIZABETH WARREN: Social Security is under attack. Gutting it is a broken promise",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. GuttingSocial Securityisn’t \"efficient\" — it’s a broken promise. Democrats and Republicans should stand up and fight back to protect it. Social Security is not charity. Americans pay in, paycheck after paycheck, over a lifetime of hard work. When they get older, they get that money back to help them retire. That’s the iron-clad, take-it-to-the-bank promise that America makes to workers. But right now, Social Security is under attack like it has never been before. Billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnicksaidseniors won’t complain if they miss a Social Security check. Elon MuskcalledSocial Security the \"world’s biggest Ponzi scheme.\" Musk then sent his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to gut the agency by indiscriminately firing workers, closing down offices, and trying to cut phone services. WARREN DEMANDS SEC INVESTIGATE TRUMP FOR INSIDER TRADING, ACCUSES HIM OF UNLEASHING 'CHAOS' WITH TARIFFS What does it mean to slash staff and services with no rhyme or reason? Two things: more mistakes in delivering checks to Americans, and fewer workers to fix those mistakes. And when people don’t get their checks, that’s a cut to the benefits they have earned. Mistakes are already showing up. AfterDOGEgot its hands on Social Security,Ned, a retiree from Washington state, was marked \"dead\" in the Social Security system — despite being very much alive. He had $5,000 in benefits snatched right out of his bank account (paid while he was \"dead\") and his monthly checks ceased. Ned spent weeks trying to fix the mistake and still hasn’t gotten paid back for two months of missing checks. Or takeTom and Chrisfrom Westborough,Massachusetts, whose son has autism. For years, disability benefits through Social Security have helped pay for his care. And for years, those benefits have come through on time, without fail. But when they checked their son’s Social Security account recently, his benefits had been terminated. No explanation — just stopped. The money eventually came through, but it led to panic over how they would pay the bills. And while people aren’t getting their checks, there are fewer Social Security workers to help fix problems. Slashing staff and shutting down regional offices means Americans are forced to drive hours to get help with their applications or missing benefits. Once they get to an office, the lines can be out the door. They wait hours before they can get help — if they get help at all. WHO IS TRUMP'S PICK TO OVERSEE SOCIAL SECURITY? Elon Muskand DOGE claim the reason they’re hacking away at people’s Social Security is to cut down on \"extreme levels of fraud,\" saying tens of millions of dead people over the age of 100 are getting payments. But even current Social Security Acting Administrator Leland Dudek — put in place by Donald Trump in February —contradictsthat claim. Here’s the thing: if Elon Musk and DOGE truly want to cut waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, there are easy ways to do it. Igave them 30 suggestionsthat would cut $2 trillion in government waste. Gutting the Social Security Administration so that it works worse for our seniors, veterans, and Americans with disabilities is not one of those ways. Social Security shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It was first created by a nearly unanimous vote by members of Congress from both parties.(Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images) But don’t just take it from me. President George W. Bush’s Social Security Administration Commissionersaidthat if Elon Musk and DOGE wanted to make changes to increase efficiency at the agency, they could, \"but we're doing it the way that 22-year-old frat boys that have never seen the system think is a good idea, and that's a mistake.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Musk himself saidhe’ll make mistakes, and it’s clear that coming for Social Security is a giant one. If he’s really honest enough to admit his own mistakes, why doesn’t he reverse course? Instead of recognizing that DOGE’s Social Security takeover is only hurting Americans, he’s doubling down, even encouraging President Trump to make the same false claims. President George W. Bush’s Social Security Commissioner called it \"a real disservice to President Trump.\" More importantly, it’s a deep disservice to the American people. Musk himself said he’ll make mistakes, and it’s clear that coming for Social Security is a giant one.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) We shouldn’t be cutting Social Security services and threatening Americans’ benefits — we should be making the program stronger. People are struggling with sky-high prices while their retirement savings are evaporating. We need atemporary increase in benefitsright now to give people some relief. We should also protect the long-term security of the system by lifting the cap on the amount millionaires and billionaires pay into Social Security, which would also yield enough money to permanently expand benefits. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Social Security shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It was first created by a nearly unanimous vote by members of Congress from both parties. Even now, as gutting the agency has become a key part of the administration’s agenda,Republicansknow that DOGE’s \"efficiency\" mission isn’t working. They’re seeing reports of long lines at offices, long waits on the phone, and website crashes from their own constituents in places likeArizona,Indiana, andPennsylvania. So where are they? Why are Democrats the only ones concerned about what happens with Social Security? Social Security isn’t something we give away out of the goodness of our hearts. It’s something Americans earned over a lifetime of hard work — an ironclad contract that they can count on. Now,Donald Trump, Musk, and DOGE are trying to skip out on that contract and calling it \"efficient.\" But it isn’t efficiency — it’s a broken promise to the American people, and Democrats and Republicans alike should stand up and fight back.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: Cory Booker’s latest stunt could embarrass Democrats",
    "article_text": "After breaking the Senate record for longest speech, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, gave an innocuous answer on whether he sees himself as the Democratic Party’s next leader. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy) Cory Booker, fresh off demonstrating that he is capable of going 25 hours without a bathroom break, is \"demanding\" an investigation into alleged insider trading at the Trump White House. Booker contends that when the president announced a reprieve from the imposition of draconian tariffs, which setstocks soaringby record amounts, Trump or his White House colleagues likely traded on the news, illicitly reaping gains from the markets’ big moves. TheNew Jersey senatorhas not one iota of proof that anyone in the Trump camp bought stocks ahead of the big announcement, but Booker, rapidly morphing into the P. T. Barnum of Democrat politics, is searching for showstoppers – facts be damned. CORY BOOKER ON WHETHER HE SHOULD BE THE DEMOCRATS' NEXT LEADER: ‘IT’S TIME FOR ALL OF US' Asked on NBC News’ Meet the Press if Democrats had any evidence of wrongdoing, Booker first dodged the question and then said, \"There is enough of an offense here, there’s enough smoke here that should demand congressional hearings.\" So, actually no. Let’s be honest: Booker and his Democrat compatriots were furious that markets boomed in response to the temporary tariff hiatus. They and their media allies have worked overtime to scare voters, predicting that Trump’s trade moves will torpedo our economy; plunging markets fed their narrative. Not only has Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer et al promised that Trump will drive us into recession, they also suggest that his efforts to make global trading more favorable to U.S. firms will undermine the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. Democrats are not afraid that Trump will fail; they are panicked that he might actually succeed. Booker most recently made headlines by breaking a fellow Democrat’s record for staging the longest-ever senate filibuster. Strom Thurmond, senator from South Carolina, held forth on the Senate floor for 24-plus hours in 1957 to block passage of the Civil Rights Act; Booker surpassed his feat, protesting not a bill, but everything to do with President Trump. It was lame, but he received a lot of publicity and for a Democrat panting to become his party’s presidential nominee, that’s evidently all that matters. Now he’s onto his next act. Notwithstanding the lack of evidence of wrongdoing, several Democrats in the House, led by Maxine Waters, wrote a letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins and other officials echoing the call for insider trading investigations. Someone should tell Democrats: be careful what you wish for. If Republicans in the House opened an investigation into trading on non-public information, what they discover might be highly embarrassing for Booker’s party. For years, many have questioned the apparent trading expertise of former House Majority LeaderNancy Pelosi, who appears to have an uncanny knack for beating markets. Last year, for instance, according to trading platform Autopilot, the Nancy Pelosi \"stock tracker\" scored a gain of 54%, beating out nearly every hedge fund but Light Year Capital, which was up 59%. As one reporter described Pelosi’s feat: \"Remarkably, it even beat the Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker, designed to do exactly the opposite of [CNBC’s] Jim Cramer's stock picks, which itself posted an impressive 43% gain in 2024. We can follow Pelosi’s trades, and those made by other members of Congress, because of the STOCK Act, passed in 2012, which required legislators to report stock or bond trades within 30 to 45 days if such transactions amount to more than $1,000. As lawmakers reveal investment decisions, the public can play along, investing in ETFs created by platforms like Unusual Whales. If you like what Democrats buy (or are convinced they have \"special knowledge\"), you can buy NANC; if you prefer the GOP approach, an ETF with the symbol KRUZ is for you. For years, there have been calls to investigateportfolio movesmade by members of Congress. Nancy Pelosi who, with her venture capital husband Paul, has an estimated net worth of about $250 million, has come under special scrutiny. But it is not only her stock trades which deserve scrutiny; much of the activity in her portfolio has included the buying and selling of options, which raises red flags. Trading puts and calls on stocks is done for a variety of reasons, including hedging, but such transactions are typically short term. They are not the vehicle of choice for long-term investors. Instead, they are the preferred vehicle for someone trading on breaking news, or who is aware that near-term events could drive stocks up or down. For example, Investopedia reports that in November 2023, \"Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia stock call options with a strike price of $120, valued at between $1 million and $5 million, with an expiration date of Dec. 20, 2024.\" Her timing was impeccable. Nvidia stock sold at around $40 at the beginning of November; six months later, as significant policies about AI rolled out of the Joe Biden White House, it hit $90. A year later it traded around $140. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Though Congress passed the STOCK Act, it has not prevented legislators from taking advantage of privileged information, though normal insider trading rules apply to them like other members of the public. To be fair, both Republicans and Democrats have been suspected of illegal trading. Many have called in recent years for a ban onstock tradingby members of Congress. Not surprisingly, those calls have gone unanswered. Employees of large banks are prohibited from trading stocks, because they have access to non-public information. The same is true of legislators, who routinely pass bills that can impact the future results of companies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The most recent Gallup poll on the subject asked, \"How much trust and confidence do you have at this time in the legislative branch?\" Only 4% answered \"a great deal\", while 30% responded \"a fair amount.\" Banning stock trading might be a good call. Meanwhile, Cory Booker might want to survey his colleagues before plunging into a widespread review of stock trading by elected officials. And, work on policies that help his constituents rather than troll for headlines. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

    "title": "DOGE reveals what you get for the half million you'll pay in taxes over your lifetime",
    "article_text": "Market analyst and CPA Dan Geltrude joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to give tips on filing taxes as the April 15th Tax Day deadline approaches. With tax day here, it’s time to revisit a shocking study that revealed some unpleasant math for theAmerican taxpayer. It added up the total – all in, with real dollars – for how much average Americans pay in taxes over the course of their lifetime. The result: $524,625, or more than half a million dollars in federal and stateincome taxes, property taxes, sales tax, and taxes on major purchases sent to the government by the time you retire. For all your hard work, and a lifetime of effort and sacrifice, it adds up to a half million dollars you’ll never get to spend.(iStock) That’s a sobering thought for anyone who stared at tax forms this April or for anyone who has had to worry about their own family budget. 15% CORPORATE TAX RATE AND 25% SMALL BUSINESS DEDUCTION SHOULD BE TRUMP TAX CUT CENTERPIECES For all your hard work, all those complicated forms, and a lifetime of effort and sacrifice,it adds up to a half million dollars you’ll never get to spend. And it gets even worse when you realize what youcouldhave spent it on. The median price of a home sold last year in the United States was $419,200. If you add that to the average price of a brand-new car ($49,740), your lifetime of taxes could have bought a brand-new house andtwonew cars, with thousands left over. The average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is estimated at $237,500, so your lifetime of taxes could more than cover that… twice. Adding that total could also more than double the average family retirement savings in the U.S. – about $334,000. And if that money had been invested in the stock market instead, your tax dollars would have nearly tripled in value to about $1.5 million, thanks to compound interest and an annual S&P 500 rate of return (minus inflation) of 6.78%. TRUMP, TARIFFS, THE CR AND THE TAX CUTS Now, take a look at how your tax moneyisbeing spent instead. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at the direction ofElon Musk, has exposed and canceled an estimated 7,300 contracts and 9,300 grants from the federal government, with a total estimated savings of about $140 billion todate. As it happens, some of those grants and contracts are almost exactly equal to your lifetime total of $524,000 – so we can see just what our lifetime of work is worth to Washington, D.C. DOGE recently canceled a $523,000 grant for \"small-scale avocado farmers in Honduras\" who \"currently struggle to get their avocados to market,\" and another $522,000 grant to small-scale farmers in Ahuachapan, El Salvador to \"increase incomes and promote sustainable agriculture and food security.\" Another grant for $509,000 would have funded online trainings and exchanges in 10 Latin American countries for \"sports-based training programs usingfútbol callejero(street soccer) to strengthen leadership among disadvantaged youth.\" An additional $509,000 was earmarked to \"reduce lead exposure from occupational sources\" in India. Not Indiana – India. TRUMP'S 'LIBERATION DAY' IS NO CAUSE FOR PANIC. HERE ARE 5 REASONS WHY A terminated contract for $527,000 was intended for \"senior leadership teambuilding, coaching, and travel with Communication Institute International\" for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food stamp program. That’s how your lifetime of honest, diligent tax paying is spent – on just one grant for one year of a project you likely don’t support. Think of your grandfather's swollen knuckles and cracked skin from a lifetime of labor; the crooked back of your grandmother from shouldering the load. The taxes from their lifetime of calluses are being callously spent in Washington without a second thought. And these are only a few needles in a gigantic haystack. A grand total of 624 grants and 902 contracts are valued between $400,000 and $600,000 – paid for by your lifetime of hard work and publicly named and shamed thanks toElon Musk and DOGE. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Ultimately, that’s the question in front of us as the debate turns to extending the Trump tax cuts. Do you really believe that the federal government isspending your lifetime of taxesbetter than you can? And do youstillbelieve that, knowing that your lifetime of taxes only pays foroneyear ofonegrant for a program halfway around the world?

Its AI voice agents kick in and handle basic operations while handing off more-complex processes to human operators. The Berlin-based startup has now raised $3.6 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Berlin’s Cherry Ventures and Y Combinator. Telli says its AI voice agents can perform a number of tasks, including automated callbacks and even closing deals. The startup, which was founded by Seb Hapte-Selassie, Philipp Baumanns, and Finn zur Mühlen, has concentrated on making its agents blend into company operations. It’s now claiming to have reached revenue growth of more than 50% month over month and has processed close to a million phone calls (and all with only a six-person team) out of the Berlin office. Customers are spread across Germany, the U.K., Latin America, and the U.S., with plans for further expansion. CEO zur Mühlen told TechCrunch that the founders got the idea after working at German unicorn Enpal, one of Germany’s biggest startup successes: “We scaled the customer service people, and we saw firsthand how difficult call automation for customer acquisition is and how difficult it is to manage performance.” He said that Telli’s AI agents “actually achieve outcomes like booking appointments, prequalifying leads, making product suggestions, and so on.” The voices are created by hired voice actors, whose voices are then cloned using the ElevenLabs or Cartesian AI voice-cloning platforms, he said. The underlying AI models Telli uses vary between OpenAI, Claude, and others: “We switch around. Our goal is always to give our customers the best solutions that are out there right now,” he said.

On Monday, the tech giantpushed updates to Google Play services, a core part of Android that provides functionalities for apps and the operating system itself. Listed under “Security & Privacy” is a new security feature that “will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days.” Last year,Apple rolled out the same feature for iOS. The thinking behind adding an automatic reboot after a certain period of inactivity is to make life more difficult for someone who is trying to unlock or extract data from a phone; for example, law enforcement using a forensic analysis device like those made byCellebriteorMagnet Forensics. Before a phone is switched on and unlocked, certain data stored within is fully encrypted and harder to access without the user’s passcode. This is known as the “Before First Unlock” state. Once unlocked, on the other hand, some data gets decrypted and can potentially be accessed by bruteforcing the passcode or taking advantage of security flaws, which is generally how law enforcement forensic devices work. This state is known as “After First Unlock.” Google did not respond to a request for comment, asking what was the motivation behind this new feature.

The new feature, which appears to be a test, eliminates the need to conduct a new search or open Google when you come across a place on TikTok and want to learn more about it. TikTok users who have access to this new feature will see a new “Reviews” tab on the right after they click to view the video’s comments. For instance, if you come across a video of Central Park in New York City where the creator has tagged the location, you’ll be able to see users’ star ratings for the location, their written reviews, and their uploaded photos, if any. You can also click on a reviewer’s username to visit their TikTok profile from this section, which differentiates this feature froman earlier Google Maps integration,which was designated witha Google Maps icon. Although the new feature may be a welcome addition for some, others may think it crowds the user experience when viewing content. The move is the latest way that TikTok is looking to expand its search ambitions to take on Google. In 2022, a Googleexecutive suggested that TikTokwas eating into its core services, Search and Maps, particularly for younger users. Fast-forward to today, and TikTok has challenged Google’s dominance in several areas.

It’s unclear if TikTok plans to roll out its reviews tab more broadly, as the company declined to provide comment ahead of publication.

It’s time forthe Great Moose Migration. For thousands of years, moose have crossed the Ångerman River each spring, trekking to a warmer summer habitat. But since 2019, the whole world can watch along for three weeks as Sweden’s SVT broadcaster airs its livestream of the migration online, using over 30 cameras to catch all of the painstakingly slow action. For the most part, the livestream shows tranquil scenes of forests and rivers, and if you’re lucky, you just might glimpse a passing moose, blissfully unaware of its international superstardom. It’s just a moose, trudging along without a care in the world. Most of the time, the stream is nearly silent. Other times, you’ll hear the wind gust and the birds chirp. It’s nice, even if you forget you left the livestream tab open on your computer and get jumpscared by a flock of creatures thousands of miles away. As one Swedish studenttold the AP: “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose. Oh, what if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” Even overnight, the stream continues. Lack of sunlight, be damned — night vision cameras will make sure we see every last bit of moose content. However, the stark black and white image evokes “The Blair Witch Project” more than National Geographic. But a spooky moose sighting is still a moose sighting. Last year,9 million viewerstuned into SVT’s moose stream. By comparison, the Discovery Channel’s Shark Week saw more than22 million viewersin 2023. Considering that SVT is just streaming live feeds of nature with a 15-person staff, that’s a pretty impressive comparison. What makes this kind of livestream so compelling is that it’s so drastically different from what we’re normally exposed to on the internet. Your TikTok feed shows you bite-sized videos so specifically tailored to your interests that it’s hard to look away. YouTubers meticulously edit their videos to keep us engaged for as long as possible. But the moose don’t want anything from us. They don’t even know we’re here, cheering them on.

In the update, OpenAI stated that it may “adjust” its safety requirements if a competing AI lab releases a “high-risk” system without similar protections in place. The change reflects the increasing competitive pressures on commercial AI developers to deploy models quickly. OpenAI has beenaccused of lowering safety standardsin favor of faster releases, and of failing to delivertimely reports detailing its safety testing. Last week, 12 former OpenAI employeesfiled a briefin Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, arguing the company would be encouraged to cuteven morecorners on safety should it complete its planned corporate restructuring. Perhaps anticipating criticism, OpenAI claims that it wouldn’t make these policy adjustments lightly, and that it would keep its safeguards at “a level more protective.” “If another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards, we may adjust our requirements,” wrote OpenAI in ablog postpublished Tuesday afternoon. “However, we would first rigorously confirm that the risk landscape has actually changed, publicly acknowledge that we are making an adjustment, assess that the adjustment does not meaningfully increase the overall risk of severe harm, and still keep safeguards at a level more protective.” The refreshed Preparedness Framework also makes clear that OpenAI is relying more heavily on automated evaluations to speed up product development. The company says that while it hasn’t abandoned human-led testing altogether, it has built “a growing suite of automated evaluations” that can supposedly “keep up with [a] faster [release] cadence.” Some reports contradict this.According to the Financial Times, OpenAI gave testers less than a week for safety checks for an upcoming major model — a compressed timeline compared to previous releases. The publication’s sources also alleged that many of OpenAI’s safety tests are now conducted on earlier versions of models rather than the versions released to the public. In statements, OpenAI has disputed the notion that it’s compromising on safety. OpenAI is quietly reducing its safety commitments. Omitted from OpenAI’s list of Preparedness Framework changes: No longer requiring safety tests of finetuned modelshttps://t.co/oTmEiAtSjS — Steven Adler (@sjgadler)April 15, 2025 Other changes to OpenAI’s framework pertain to how the company categorizes models according to risk, including models that can conceal their capabilities, evade safeguards, prevent their shutdown, and even self-replicate. OpenAI says that it’ll now focus on whether models meet one of two thresholds: “high” capability or “critical” capability. OpenAI’s definition of the former is a model that could “amplify existing pathways to severe harm.” The latter are models that “introduce unprecedented new pathways to severe harm,” per the company. “Covered systems that reach high capability must have safeguards that sufficiently minimize the associated risk of severe harm before they are deployed,” wrote OpenAI in its blog post. “Systems that reach critical capability also require safeguards that sufficiently minimize associated risks during development.” The updates are the first OpenAI has made to the Preparedness Framework since 2023.

BluSmart, a ride-hailing startup connected to Gensol that was once seen as an emerging Uber rival in the South Asian market, has also been swept up into the investigation. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Gensol Engineering’s founders, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, from holding key positions in the public-listed company and participating in the securities market while the agency investigates. The Jaggi brothers also co-founded BluSmart Mobility. Anmol Singh Jaggi told TechCrunch the company was “fully cooperating” with the Indian regulator and is “putting together all the necessary documents and facts to clarify.” “This is just an interim step, not a final decision, and I’m confident that once everything’s reviewed properly, our position will be clear. We’ve always believed in doing things responsibly, and that won’t change,” Jaggi said. In its interim order, the regulator accused the Jaggi brothers of redirecting substantial loan amounts for personal use, including buying luxury real estate on the outskirts of India’s capital. The regulator said Gensol Engineering availed term loans of 9.78 billion Indian rupees (around $114 million) from the state-owned Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency and Power Finance Corporation. Of that, 6.63 billion rupees were set for purchasing 6,400 EVs to lease to BluSmart. However, the company acquired only 4,704 EVs for 5.68 billion rupees, the regulator noted in itsorder(PDF). “Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities/transfer of funds to promoters’ close relatives; etc.,” the regulator said. Gensol previously denied the alleged defaulting on debt payments. However, the regulator has cited information from the lenders and said there were “multiple instances of default” by the Gujarat-headquartered company. “The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a proprietary firm,” the regulator alleged in the order. The order comes over a month after credit-rating agencies downgraded Gensol, raising concerns over the delays in the company’s debt servicing and corporate governance practices. Meanwhile, BluSmart, a Gensol customer and the entity sharing its co-founders, is struggling due to mounting cash burns and a lack of external capital. The startup shut down its service in Dubai, which waslaunchedlast year, and is currently exploring ways to sustain its business in India, which spans Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Mumbai. The ride-hailing startup planned to pivot into a fleet partner for its arch-rival Uber, the Indian newspaper Economic Timesreportedearlier this week, citing people familiar with the developments. Founded in late 2018 as Gensol Mobility, BluSmart started as an Uber fleet operator. However, the startup emerged as an all-EV rival to Uber after starting its standalone operations before the COVID-19 pandemic. BluSmartraised $25 millionin January 2024 to boost its EV charging stations from Switzerland-based impact fund ResponsAbility. Later that year, the company was reportedly in talks toraise up to $100 million, but that funding never materialized. The Gurugram-based startup has raised more than $486 million in total funding,perCrunchbase. It counts BP Ventures and Mayfield India Fund among its early investors. Last year, BluSmart had a fleet of 6,000 EVs, including around 180 ZS SUVs from MG Motor and the remaining batch made up of Tata Tigor sedans. The startup planned to increase its fleet size to 10,000 EVs by year-end, but it did not reach the target. Jaggi did not answer what measures they are taking specifically for BluSmart. Gensol Engineering’s stock tumbled more than 83% this year, last trading at 129 rupees shortly before the market closed on Tuesday.

    "title": "Figma sent a cease-and-desist letter to Lovable over the term ‘Dev Mode’",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us We may be witnessing the makings of a new tech industry feud between competitors. Figma has sent a cease-and-desist letter to popular no-code AI startup Lovable, Figma confirmed to TechCrunch. The letter tells Lovable to stop using the term “Dev Mode” for a new product feature. Figma, which also has a feature called Dev Mode, successfully trademarked that term last year, accordingto the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. What’s wild is that “dev mode” is a common term used in many products that cater to software programmers. It’s like an edit mode. Software products from giant companies likeApple’s iOS,Google’s Chrome,Microsoft’s Xboxhave features formally called “developer mode” that then get nicknamed “dev mode” in reference materials. Even “dev mode” itself is commonly used. For instanceAtlassian used it in products that pre-date Figma’s copyright by years. And it’sa common feature namein countless open source software projects. Figma tells TechCrunch that its trademark refers only to the shortcut “Dev Mode” – not the full term “developer mode.” Still, it’s a bit like trademarking the term “bug” to refer to “debugging.” Since Figma wants to own the term, it has little choice but send cease-and-desist letters. (The letter, as manyon X pointed out, was very polite, too.) If Figma doesn’t defend the term, it could be absorbed as a generic term and the trademarked becomes unenforceable. Some on the internet argue that this term is already generic, should never have been allowed to be trademarked, and say Lovable should fight. Lovable’s co-founder and CEO, Anton Osika, tells TechCrunch that, for now, his company has no intention of honoring Figma’s demand and changing the feature’s name. We’ll see if Figma escalates. It also has other things on its mind. On Tuesday,Figma announced it had filed confidential paperwork for an IPO.However, should Figma pursue legal action, taking on an international legal battle might be pricey for the early-stage Swedish startup, Lovable,which raised a $15 million seed round in February. What’s more interesting is that Lovable is one of the rising stars of so-called “vibe coding.” That’s where users can describe what they want in a text prompt and the product builds it – complete with code. Its “dev mode” feature was launched a few weeks ago to allow users to edit that code. Lovable advertises itself as a competitor to Figma, declaring onits homepagethat designers can use Lovable “without tedious prototyping work in tools like Figma.”  And manynewly launched startups are doing just that. So this isn’t just a trademark dispute. It is also a bigger competitor cracking its knuckles at a pesky upstart. Figma wasvalued at $12.5 billionabout a year ago. A Figma spokesperson almost admits as much. The person told TechCrunch that Figma has not sent cease-and-desist letters to other tech companies over the term, like Microsoft, because their products are “in a different category of goods and services.” And Lovable’s Osika is ready to throw a few punches of his own telling TechCrunch that he thinks “Figma should focus on making their product great” and not on trademark marketing. He also tells TechCrunch that Lovable is successfully winning customers away from Figma and other such design tools created in the era before LLMs. As for the overall threat of vibe coding products,in a conversationlast month with Y Combinator’s Garry Tan, Figma co-founder CEO Dylan Field naturally pooh-poohed the idea. Field said that even though people like vibe coding for its speed, “you also want to give people a way to not just get started and prototype rapidly but also get to the finish line. That’s where the disconnect is, and not just for design, but also for code.” Still Osika also seems ready to compete. When he shared a copy of the Figma’s letter on X, he usedthe grinning emoji.

Context.ai plans to wind down its products following the acqui-hire, per a message on the company’s website. When reached for comment, OpenAI declined to reveal the terms of the deal. “Evals are a requirement to building high-performing AI applications, but they’re hard to get right today,” reads the message. “We spent two years building evals and analytics for [models] at Context.ai — with a few pivots along the way. We couldn’t be more excited for this next chapter of our journey at OpenAI and are grateful to everyone who played a part.” Context.ai was founded in 2023 by former Googlers Henry Scott-Green (CEO) and Alex Gamble (CTO). The startup raised$3.5 million in seed fundingfrom GV and Theory Ventures that same year. One of Context.ai’s flagship products was a dashboard customers could use to dig into the data generated by a model and figure out if it’s producing content that truly helps answer queries. Context.ai users could share transcripts via an API, which Context.ai would then analyze to group and tag based on subject. “The phrase that I always hear is that ‘my model is a black box,’” Scott-Green told TechCrunch in a 2023 interview. “We’ve spoken to hundreds of developers who are building [models], and they have a really consistent set of problems. Those problems are that they don’t understand how people are using their model, and they don’t understand how their model is performing.” Context.ai had six employees as of August 2023. It’s unclear how large the team is today, and whether every staffer will be offered a job at OpenAI. In apost on X, Scott-Green said that he and Gamble will be creating “the tools developers need to succeed” at OpenAI, with a focus on model evaluations.

The team, which Anthropic appears to have begun hiring several months ago, aims to “accelerate” the adoption of Anthropic’s AI among AWS accounts by “building programs that […] scale across global markets and segments.” That’s according tojoblistingsonAnthropic’s websiteand job boards around the web. “[Y]ou will own and scale one of our most significant strategic relationships, leading a team responsible for multi-billion dollar revenue opportunities through our AWS partnership,” reads alisting for a Head of Amazon GTM Partnership role. “You will work closely with senior leadership across both organizations to drive joint success [and] shape strategy.” Amazon is a major backer of Anthropic,having committed $8 billionin capital to the startup to date. While the company has no governance rights and is a minority investor, Amazon is Anthropic’s “primary” training partner,providing in-house chipsto help Anthropic develop its AI models. Anthropic has also optimized its models to run on AWS infrastructure,releasing models with capabilities exclusive to Bedrock, AWS’ AI development platform. And the company has launched collaborations with Amazon partners, including Accenture andPalantir, to facilitate access to its AI tech through AWS. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in November that Anthropic’s Claude family of models was being used by “tens of thousands” of Bedrock customers. Amazon, which is leveraging Anthropic technology to power components of its revamped Alexa experience,Alexa+, no doubt sees Anthropic as important to its overall AI business’ growth. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recentlyclaimedthat Amazon’s AI revenue is growing at “triple-digit” year-over-year percentages and represents a “multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate.” Anthropic, meanwhile, stands to benefit from AWS’ reach as it looks to grow its own revenue. The startup isreportedlyaiming to notch $12 billion in revenue in 2027, up from a projected $2.2 billion this year. Amazon’s dealings with Anthropic have attracted some regulatory scrutiny. The FTC last year sent a letter to Amazon, as well as to Microsoft and Google,requiringthe companies to explain the impacts their investments in startups such as Anthropic have on the competitive AI landscape. Google has alsoinvestedin Anthropic, pouring billions into the company over multiple funding rounds. The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has also investigated Amazon’s partnership with Anthropic, looking at whether key aspects would result in “Amazon having material influence” over the latter. The FTCthis year published a report findingthat AI investments by Big Tech firms can create lock-in and reveal sensitive information that can undermine competition, but stopped short of recommending enforcement action. The CMA, for its part,concludedthat Amazon’s partnership and equity investment in Anthropic can’t be investigated under current merger rules due to the size and scope of the deal.

In ablog postpublished on Monday, Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine backed the company’s diverse community, saying that businesses shouldn’t have to choose between inclusion and profit. Plus, more people value “understanding and respect over hate and division,” the CEO noted, explaining that culture wars and yelling at others isn’t an effective way to change minds. As a publishing platform, Stubblebine says Medium benefits from diverse voices and that people who come to the site to expand their understanding of the world see diversity as a strength, not a threat. “To understand the full context of a situation, you need to hear from someone with a different life experience from your own,” the executive wrote. “Perspectives of people from marginalized communities are essential viewpoints that deserve to be heard.” He also argued that diversity is a competitive advantage. “As a CEO, I feel confident that embracing diversity as a strategy increases the business, cultural, and intellectual capabilities of our company,” he wrote. In addition, the company’s policies focus on building a civil platform for readers and writers, where “hateful content, threats of violence, harassment, racial slurs, promotion of pseudoscience or disinformation, harmful stereotypes, intentional misgendering of individuals, and other threats” to the community are not tolerated. This stands in contrast to the policies that guide Medium’s competitor Substack, which takes a more “free speech”approachto moderating content. This, in turn, allowed white nationaliststo find a place on Substack, leading to auser backlash. Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie haseven gone on recordto say that the company didn’t believe that “censorship” measures, including demonetizing blogs, would help the problem go away. Medium is taking a different approach. And, at a time when maintaining DEI policies has become politicized, it’s a stand that only a handful of companies have been willing to take. Across the U.S., major corporations like  McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, and Target, among others,have rolled back DEI policies. Apple, Delta, Costco, JPMorgan, and McKinsey, meanwhile, said they would remain committed to diversity efforts. Medium was founded by Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, and Stubblebine took over the CEO role in July 2022, as Williams transitioned to becoming chairman of the board. The company todayclaims to have over a million members(paid subscribers), and reaches 100 million people every month, including both readers and writers.

The expansion comes as Google looks to deliver an answer to OpenAI’s Sora video generation platform, and as competition in the space grows fiercer. Two weeks ago, one of the more formidable synthetic media companies, Runway, released thefourth generation of its video generatorandraised more than $300 millionin new capital. Starting Tuesday, Gemini Advanced subscribers will be able to select Veo 2 from the model drop-down menu in Google’sGeminiapps. Users can create eight-second video clips at 720p resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and upload these clips to TikTok, YouTube, and more via Gemini’s “share” button. Veo 2-generated videos can also be downloaded as MP4 files, watermarked with Google’s SynthID tech. There’s a limit to how many videos users can create each month, and the Google Workspace business and education plans aren’t supported at the moment, the company says. Google is also integrating Veo 2 with Whisk, an experimental feature in Google Labs that lets you use images as prompts with Gemini to create new images. A new feature, Whisk Animate, lets users take images they’ve generated and turn them into eight-second, Veo 2-generated videos. (Google Labs is Google’s platform for early-stage AI products, gated behind the company’s $20-per-month Google One AI Premium subscription.)

But the CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis,recently saidthat the company plans to eventually combine itsGeminiAI models withVeotoimprove the former’s understanding of the physical world. In the meantime, many artists and creators are wary of video generators like Veo 2, which threaten to upend entire creative industries.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Anthropic announced on Tuesday that its AI chatbot, Claude, now integrates with Google Workspace, allowing it to search and reference your emails in Gmail, scheduled events in Google Calendar, and documents in Google Docs. The integration is rolling out in beta first to subscribers to Anthropic’s Max, Team, Enterprise, and Pro plans. Administrators managing multi-user accounts must enable the integration on their end before users can connect their Google Workspace and Claude accounts, according to Anthropic. Google DeepMind’sGemini chatbot also integrates with Workspace, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT integrates with Google Drive. However, Anthropic is one of the first third-party AI companies to offer a way to closely connect to Google’s productivity suite. Anthropic’s team-up with Google aims to give Claude more personally tailored responses without requiring users to repeatedly upload files or craft detailed prompts. OpenAI and Google have tried achieving the same effect via different approaches, such as addingmemory featuresthat allow chatbots to reference past conversations in their replies. In a press release, Anthropic says Claude’s new integration can help users organize their professional and personal lives. For example, Anthropic claims the feature can assist parents by scanning “emails and calendar events to highlight important commitments, while searching the web for updated school calendars, local community events, and weather forecasts that might affect family plans.” Claude will provide in-line citations when it references Workspace content, showing users exactly where specific information originated, says Anthropic. While the integration doesn’t give Claude the ability to schedule calendar events or send emails, it may raise security concerns among some users. It’s unclear how extensively Claude will search through a person’s Google Workspace, or whether users have to direct Claude to look at a particular email or calendar event depending on the nature of their request. It’s also not clear whether users can ask Claude not to search across certain sensitive emails or files. Responding to the above, an Anthropic spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company doesn’t train models on user data by default and has implemented “strict authentication and access control mechanisms” for external services like Workspace. “Each user or organization’s connections to external services (like Google Drive, Gmail, etc.) are properly authenticated and authorized for only that specific user or organization,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Claude doesn’t have the ability to access or transfer data between different users’ connected services, as each connection is bound to the specific authentication credentials of that individual user or organization.” Anthropic also announced on Tuesday the launch of Claude Research, a new feature that conducts multiple web searches to generate detailed answers. Positioned as a competitor to OpenAI and Google’s “deep research” agents, Claude Research offers an “optimal tradeoff” between speed and comprehensiveness, Anthropic says. Claude Research typically runs for less than a minute to compile info, according to an Anthropic spokesperson — faster than some rival deep research agents. However, Claude Research doesn’t use a custom model, instead leveraging Claude’s recently launched web search capabilities. The company is rolling out Claude Research to subscribers to its Max, Team, and Enterprise plans in the United States, Japan, and Brazil. It’ll come to Pro customers soon, Anthropic says. These updates are part of Anthropic’s broader effort to attract users to its AI subscription plans with features that make Claude more capable and useful. WhileClaude is growing in popularity, reaching 3.3 million web users in March, according to data compiled by SimilarWeb, Anthropic’s user base is still dwarfed by ChatGPT’s.

At the time of writing, 4chan’s website was not loading, and users on social media reported the site being intermittently down for hours. Messages on a rival message board, which TechCrunch has seen, celebrated the hack, with one person claiming that the hacker responsible for the breach was inside 4chan’s system “for over a year.” Several screenshots showing what appears to be 4chan’s back end circulated online, showing the site’s alleged back end, source code, and templates to ban users, which would only be accessible to the site’s moderators. Also in the leaked data was a list of alleged 4chan moderators and “janitors,” who are users who can delete posts and threads, but have fewer privileges than moderators, who can also see IP addresses of users, for example. Given 4chan’s known violent political ties, this cyberattack could potentially expose the people who run these forums, which have become central to alt-right movements. TechCrunch reached out to several email addresses that were leaked and spoke to one of the people behind one of the email addresses. One 4chan janitor who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity said they are “confident” the leaked data and screenshots are “all real.” “I have no reason to believe otherwise,” the janitor said. “I’m somewhat taken back. 4chan’s moderation team has had leaks in the past, but this is obviously an issue of greater magnitude,” the janitor told TechCrunch. “I’m not happy about the situation. I’m sure most others aren’t, either. But many of us have been doing this for a long time. Doxxing is a longstanding pastime on 4chan, and the possibility that we could be exposed has always been there.” “I’ve been most concerned with the leaked information, for obvious reasons,” said the janitor. “I’d wager that the fact that 4chan was effectively taken over by a hacker(s) is probably ‘worse’ than screenshots, at least from the perspective of the site’s continued operation.” The janitor also said that it appears that the hacker obtained the personal information of 4chan Pass subscribers, who are users who pay the site to bypass post counters and access a VIP board, per the janitor. 4chan did not respond to an email requesting comment sent to the site’s press email address. 4chan is an ostensibly anonymous internet forum that functions like the dark underbelly of the web. Most of the time, it’s an image board that seems to be populated by bored users who try to shock each other often by posting some of the most vile content imaginable.

    "title": "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
    "article_text": "\"Trump is a crazy man,\" says Lionel Xu, who is surrounded by his company's mosquito repellent kits – many were once best sellers in Walmart stores in the United States. Now those products are sitting in boxes in a warehouse in China and will remain there unless President Donald Trump lifts his 145% tariffs on all Chinese goods bound for the US. \"This is so hard for us,\" he adds. Around half of all products made by his company Sorbo Technology are sold to the US. It is a small company by Chinese standards and has around 400 workers in Zhejiang province. But they are not alone in feeling the pain of this economic war. \"We are worried. What if Trump doesn't change his mind? That will be a dangerous thing for our factory,\" says Mr Xu. Nearby, Amy is helping to sell ice cream makers at her booth for the Guangdong Sailing Trade Company. Her key buyers, including Walmart, are also in the US. \"We have stopped production already,\" she says. \"All the products are in the warehouse.\" It was the same story at nearly every booth in the sprawling Canton Fair in the trading hub of Guangzhou. When the BBC speaks to Mr Xu, he is getting ready to take some Australian buyers to lunch. They have come looking for a bargain and hope to drive down the price. \"We will see,\" he says about the tariffs. He believes Trump will back down. \"Maybe it will get better in one or two months,\" Mr Xu adds with his fingers crossed. Maybe, maybe...\" Last week,President Trump temporarily pausedthe vast majority of tariffs after global stock markets tumbled, and a sell-off in the US bond market. But he kept the import levies targeted at Chinese goods being shipped to the US. Beijing responded by imposing its own 125% levies on American imports. This has bewildered traders from more than 30,000 businesses who have come to the annual fair to show off their goods in several exhibition halls the size of 200 football pitches. In the homeware section, firms displayed everything from washing machines to tumble dryers, electric toothbrushes to juicers and waffle makers. Buyers come from all over the world to see the products for themselves and make a deal. But the cost of a food mixer or a vacuum cleaner from China with the added tariffs are now too high for most American firms to pass on the cost to their customers. The world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors. The effects of this trade war will likely be felt inkitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices. China has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war \"until the end.\" It is a tone also used by some at the fair. Hy Vian, who was looking to buy some electric ovens for his firm, waved off the effects of tariffs. \"If they don't want us to export – then let them wait. We already have a domestic market in China, we will give the best products to the Chinese first.\" China does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market. Chinese policymakers have also been trying tostimulate more growth in a sluggish economyby encouraging consumers to spend. But it is not working. Many of the country's middle classes have invested their savings in buying the family home, only to watch their house prices slump in the last four years. Now they want to save money – not spend it. While China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export-driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth. China also remains the world's factory – with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone. Some of those workers are already feeling the pain. Not far from the Canton Fair, there are warrens of workshops in Guangdong making clothes, shoes and bags. This is the manufacturing hub for companies such as Shein and Temu. Each building houses several factories on several floors where workers will labour for 14 hours a day. On a pavement near some shoe factories, a few workers were squatting down to chat and smoke. \"Things are not going well,\" says one, who was unwilling to give his name. His friend urges him to stop talking. Discussing economic difficulties can be sensitive in China. \"We've had problems since the Covid pandemic, and now there's this trade war. I used to be paid 300-400 yuan ($40-54) a day, and now I will be lucky if I get 100 yuan a day.\" The worker says it is difficult to find work these days. Others making shoes on the street also told us they only earned enough to live a basic life. While some in China feel pride in their product, others feel the pain of increasing tariffs and wonder how this crisis will end. China is facing the prospect of losing a trading partner which buys more than $400bn (£302bn) worth of goods each year, butthe pain will also be felt on the other side, with economists warning that the US could be heading for a recession. Adding to the uncertainty is President Trump, who is known for his brinkmanship. He has continued to push Beijing and China has refused to back down. However, Beijing has said it will not add any more to the current 125% tariff rate on US goods. They could retaliate in other ways – but it offers the two sides some breathing room from a week that sparked an economic war. There is reportedly little contact between Washington and Beijing and neither side appears willing to head to the negotiating table any time soon. In the meantime, some companies at the Canton Fair are using the event to try to find new markets. Amy hopes her ice cream makers will head in a new direction. \"We hope to open the new European market. Maybe Saudi Arabia - and of course Russia,\" she adds. Others believe there is still money to be made in China. Among them is Mei Kunyan, 40, who says he is earning around 10,000 yuan a month at his shoe firm which sells to Chinese customers. Many major shoe manufacturers have moved to Vietnam where labour costs are cheaper. Mr Mei has also realised something that businesses around him are now discovering: \"The Americans are too tricky.\" The chip manufacturing giant, which has been at the heart of the AI boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China. America is trying to create a chip industry through isolation and protectionism, when what allowed it to emerge in Asia is the opposite: collaboration BBC China correspondent Laura Bicker has been speaking to companies at the world's longest running import-export fair.

    "title": "The perils of Trump's chips strategy: the US will struggle to take on Asia",
    "article_text": "Listen to this article The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021. Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect. He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality produce in their American factories. So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale? Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale. Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US. It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades. Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US. With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US. The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success. That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden – an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing. Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas. TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island. But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions. \"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\" And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips. Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\". \"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\" The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive. TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies. Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing. \"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\" One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India. \"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US. \"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\" Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. \"It's a wrench in the machine – a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\" The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US. Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small. \"China ultimately will want to win – it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot. \"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\" In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US – it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good. India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water – chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it. Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector. Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying. Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\" Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips. \"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein. \"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here – TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\" But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale – it will take time. Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.

    "title": "Disposable vape use falling in UK ahead of ban",
    "article_text": "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of aUK-wide banon their sale on 1 June, a study has found. Researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, according to University College London (UCL) research. Overall vaping use stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16, after several years of significant growth. The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments. The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm. The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced. The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over. Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%. In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%. After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds. The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device. Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether. \"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds. Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term. A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged. Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models. \"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says. While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\". \"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says. \"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds. Jobs that could go include those in finance, communication and administration, it is understood.

    "title": "Trump threatens Harvard's tax-exempt status after freezing $2bn funding",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has called for Harvard University to lose a valuable tax break, hours after his administration announced it is freezing more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in federal funds for the elite institution. The White House has demanded the oldest university in the US make changes to hiring, admissions and teaching practices which it says will help fight antisemitism on campus. Since returning to office, Trump has pushed to reshape top universities by threatening to withhold federal funds that are mostly designated for research. Harvard became the first major US university to reject his administration's demands on Monday, accusing the White House of trying to \"control\" its community. In a Tuesday morning post on social media, Trump threatened to go beyond withholding the federal funds and targeted Harvard tax-exempt status. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempt from paying federal income taxes. This valuable tax break, though, can be removed if the groups become involved in political activities or move away from their stated purposes. \"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting \"Sickness?\" he wrote on Truth Social. \"Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!\" Losing the exemption could cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. The Ivy League institution also has a fund of assets, or endowment, valued at $53bn. Later on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wanted the university to apologise for what his administration says is continuing tolerance of antisemitism. \"[Trump] wants to see Harvard apologise, and Harvard should apologise,\" Leavitt said. The sweeping changes demanded by the White House would have transformed Harvard's operations and ceded a large amount of control to the government. Its letter to Harvard on Friday,obtained by the New York Times,said the university had failed to live up to the \"intellectual and civil rights conditions\" that justify federal investment. The letter included 10 categories for proposed changes, including: President Trump has accused leading universities of failing to protect Jewish students when college campuses around the country saw protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel last year. The letter orders the university to take disciplinary action for \"violations\" during protests. In explaining its rejection of these demands, Harvard president Alan Garber said the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights under the First Amendment protecting free speech. \"Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental regulation of the 'intellectual conditions' at Harvard,\" he said. Shortly after his letter of resistance was sent, the education department said it was freezing $2.2bn in grants and $60m in contracts to Harvard immediately. \"Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges,\" the Department of Education said in a statement. The disruption of learning plaguing campuses is unacceptable and the harassment of Jewish students intolerable, the statement said. A professor of history at Harvard, David Armitage, told the BBC that the school could afford to resist as the richest university in the US and no price was too high to pay for freedom. \"It's a not unexpected act of entirely groundless and vengeful activity by the Trump administration which wants nothing more than to silence freedom of speech,\" he said. In March, the Trump administration said it was reviewing roughly $256m in federal contracts and grants at Harvard, and an additional $8.7bn in multi-year grant commitments. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, said on X: \"It is time to totally cut off US taxpayer funding to this institution.\" Harvard professors filed a lawsuit in response, alleging the government was unlawfully attacking freedom of speech and academic freedom. Harvard is one of a number of elite universities in the crosshairs of the new presidency. Columbia University in New York City agreed to a number of demandslast month after the White House pulled $400m in federal funding. But on Monday Columbia struck a less compliant tone, releasing its own letter that said it was continuing \"good faith talks\" with the government as it seeks to win back its funding, but also said it would \"reject any agreement that would require us to relinquish our independence\". Pollingby Gallup last summer suggestedthat confidence in higher education has been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans. Earlier on Monday,a lawyer for an organiser of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University said her client had been arrestedby immigration officials as he attended an interview as part of his application for US citizenship. Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder who is due to graduate next month, was detained on Monday in Colchester, Vermont. Others who took part in campus protests against the war, including Columbia University's Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk, have been detained in recent weeks. Officials in Silicon Valley are investigating and have disabled the audio feature on the pedestrian crossings. Warning of \"no tolerance for gamesmanship\", the judge said she would determine whether to hold the government in contempt of court. The US president has also called for the institution to lose a valuable tax break, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. Officials in the US and El Salvador have been unwilling to return the man home, sparking a legal battle. The former president broke with his practice of not criticising policies or leaders on social media to praise Harvard's stand",

    "title": "UK's rarest wildlife being 'pushed to extinction' by grass fires",
    "article_text": "Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned. They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal. The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed \"the last remaining\" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands. So far this year 110 sq miles (284 sq km) of land has been burnt by wildfires around the UK - an area larger than Birmingham. Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to \"act responsibly\" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police. The National Trust said 2025 was \"turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country\". \"We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,\" said Ben MacCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation. A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them. Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an \"irreplaceable\" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too. Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest. In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire,had gone up in flames. While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\". \"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr MacCarthy said. He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential. Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks. Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed. Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC. \"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said. The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat. \"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry. \"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\" Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s. \"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry. \"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\" The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year. Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone. \"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\" The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely. When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality. Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen. But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year. In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes. Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued anextreme wildfire alertcovering the whole country. Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started by people, including accidental fires from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand. In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact. At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet. Station manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand. \"We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,\" he said. \"We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.\" Additional reporting by Dylan Greene. Once emptied of wildlife, South Africa's Babanango Game Reserve is now home to the Big Five – thanks to a bold rewilding project led by Zulu communities and global conservationists. The charity says it aims to transform low grade arable land into a \"wildlife haven\". Female osprey CJ7 and male 022 are the only breeding pair on the south coast of England. It is believed the ants were destined for exotic pet markets in Europe and Asia. It is the lovebirds' third year together after Aran had to fight off the advances of another suitor.",

    "title": "My unique friendship with the last person who held my baby",
    "article_text": "Rhian Mannings and Andrea Evans have been the best of friends for 13 years - but the circumstances that brought them together could not be more tragic. Nurse Andrea was the last person to hold Rhian's one-year-old son George after he died from pneumonia. \"Leaving a hospital without your child is the most unnatural thing as a parent you will ever have to do,\" said Rhian. \"But leaving George in her arms made it just that little, little bit easier because you knew that somebody really did care.\" After George's death, Rhian and her husband Paul returned home unable to make sense of their seismic loss. Meanwhile Andrea continued her shift, caring for other patients. Warning: This article contains references to suicide Rhian and Andrea are sharing their story to shine a light on the hidden emotional toll the death of a child can have on professionals - everyone from doctors and nurses to police officers, firefighters and teachers. George had been happily playing with his brother and sister before he fell ill very suddenly, just days after his first birthday in 2012. He was rushed to Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and was cared for by a number of staff including Andrea. As well as caring for George, Andrea was responsible for keeping his distraught parents informed about what was happening. Now, 13 years on, Andrea's memories from that evening have not faded. \"I remember seeing Rhian and Paul arrive and just being completely distraught,\" said Andrea from Talbot Green. \"To me I wasn't doing enough, I wasn't saying enough, I wasn't explaining enough. In my own head I was panicking about ways that I could make this better, even though it was never going to be a good situation,\" she said. The team spent a long time working on George until eventually Andrea received a nod from the consultant. \"It was sort of 'get Rhi and Paul back here, we need to hold him because this is going to be his last moments',\" she said. Andrea stayed with Rhian and Paul during George's final moments and was with them when they spent time with him afterwards, as well as staying with George once they eventually left the hospital. Andrea then continued the rest of her shift. \"You're exhausted from those couple of hours… but the department is busy and other people keep coming and they are not aware of what's happened and they need to be cared for in exactly the same way and so you haven't got time, you haven't got time to sit and dwell,\" said Andrea. George's death had impacted her. \"This particular situation was a bit too close for comfort really,\" she said. Like Rhian, Andrea was also a mother-of-three. She had a six-month-old baby at home and two other children a similar age to Rhian's older children. \"It definitely hit home... you just want to get home at that point and hold your own children,\" she said. Meanwhile Rhian and her husband Paul were in agony, facing what felt like insurmountable grief. They had returned home that evening with their other two children asleep and oblivious to what had happened. George's birthday cards were still up. In the days that followed, Rhian was aghast that the only bereavement support they had been offered was a leaflet with a list of phone numbers. \"You have these amazing staff in the hospital doing everything they possibly can but when you leave there's nothing there to pick you up or look after you or answer your questions,\" said Rhian, from Miskin, Rhondda Cynon Taf. Paul was struggling to cope and began blaming himself for George's death. \"He felt we should have taken him in the car rather than wait for the ambulance,\" said Rhian. \"He felt that as a dad he'd potentially failed our family which is really heart-breaking.\" They spoke about Andrea often. \"Paul and I called her our angel,\" she said. Five days after George's death, Rhian faced the unthinkable when her husband Paul took his own life. He had gone for a drive to clear his head but failed to return. Just as Rhian was thinking of calling the police, two officers appeared at her door to tell her he was dead. \"I truly believe that we were failed and that's what led to Paul's death,\" said Rhian. \"No-one knocked on our door and offered us any support from any kind of agency or professional body and that's really hard to live with.\" Andrea learnt about Paul's death after arriving at work for a night shift. \"It was devastating because I then went onto think that I should have done something better,\" she said. \"What if I'd said something different, could I have helped him more?\" Remarkably, while grieving her husband and child, Rhian found herself thinking about Andrea. \"I wanted to check she was okay,\" said Rhian. \"But also now I didn't have Paul anymore there was only really one other person who was there that whole evening with me, and that was her.\" Rhian decided to leave a rose bush and a letter on Andrea's doorstep. Andrea responded and the pair met up for a coffee. \"I think it was perhaps a little bit awkward in the beginning,\" admitted Andrea. She said she did not know what Rhian expected from the meeting and was concerned about saying the wrong thing. \"I don't know what I expected,\" admitted Rhian. \"But you were the last person to hold my little boy... you met Paul.\" Andrea was touched and surprised that Rhian was concerned for her. After that initial meeting the pair - who only live a few miles apart - began bumping into one another. A friendship slowly began to form. They don't often speak about the night George died, but Rhian has been able to reassure Andrea that she could not have done more to support Paul. \"If I hadn't have told you that, you'd still potentially be living with that,\" said Rhian. Andrea agreed: \"Yes, I'd still be carrying that.\" Rhian went on to establish her own charity called 2Wish, which covers Wales and the border counties of England, and offers support to anyone who has experienced the sudden and unexpected death of a child or young adult. Professionals like Andrea are able to self-refer and receive a range of support including debriefing sessions, counselling and complementary therapies. The Welsh government also funds a service called Canopi, which offers mental health support for social care and NHS staff in Wales. Over the years, Rhian has roped Andrea into many fundraising challenges for her charity. Now Andrea is hoping to encourage other professionals to consider seeking support. The You Can't Pour from an Empty Cup campaign is now in its fourth year and the number of referrals has grown year on year. \"During my years in A&E you learn to compartmentalise and try to leave work in work - that does build over the years and your boxes start to overflow a little bit which is when it gets stressful and complicated, and if you don't deal with them soon enough I think it becomes a problem,\" said Andrea. She said it was a \"very good thing\" to take time to reflect properly on the difficult situations that arise at work. Rhian said from the trauma of their first meeting a \"really lovely, honest relationship\" had grown. \"Our children are friendly, we've just got back from holiday together, we've been away many times together, our husbands are happy and get on really well,\" she said. She also goes to Andrea for fashion advice. \"We're honest friends, if I need advice on what to wear she's the one I go to because she'll tell me straight,\" she laughed. Andrea said it had been nice to see their children grow up together. \"We often say it would have been nice to have the six of them and we do talk about George a lot,\" she said. Rhian will always be grateful to Andrea. \"I'll never ever be able to thank her for what she did that night,\" she said. \"And I know Paul would too.\" If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story,BBC Action Linefeatures a list of organisations which can provide support and advice. Jennifer Cousins said it is \"unfair\" that there are no commissioned services for ADHD in Northern Ireland. One barber said he wants customers to trust him with their emotions, as well as their haircuts. People are being asked to think ahead and use the correct service should they become unwell. Islay says she struggled with academic anxiety \"daily\" in the lead up to her GCSEs. Psychiatrists said the numbers waiting for neurodevelopmental assessments were not routinely published.",

    "title": "Faisal Islam: A UK-US deal sounds good but it is all about the detail",
    "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to landthan with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\". UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress. \"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added. The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\". Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\". This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods. In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged. Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit. This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs. The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act. However, there is a big problem now. The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\". But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around. The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners. Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion. But the UK is in a different position than other nations. Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate. The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit. Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about. Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month. The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape. The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation? In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China. The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods. All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China. There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing. Given last week'schaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies. The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away. Warning of \"no tolerance for gamesmanship\", the judge said she would determine whether to hold the government in contempt of court. The US president has also called for the institution to lose a valuable tax break, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. The group says it lost communication after an Israeli strike on where Edan Alexander was being held. Officials in the US and El Salvador have been unwilling to return the man home, sparking a legal battle. The former president broke with his practice of not criticising policies or leaders on social media to praise Harvard's stand",

    "title": "The stars who turned their backs on Hollywood (and some who returned)",
    "article_text": "Actress Cate Blanchett has said she wants to quit acting to do other things, joining a long line of big Hollywood stars who gave up the red carpets for a different lifestyle. The 55-year-old is seen as one of the most talented and bankable actresses in film, but she has indicated several times in recent years that she's keen to break away from the big screen. \"My family roll their eyes every time I say it, but I mean it. I am serious about giving up acting,\" she told the Radio Times in a new interview. \"[There are] a lot of things I want to do with my life.\" Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person. \"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\" Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation. Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as Tár, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator. She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back): The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago. Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\" She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx. The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight. Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy. He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York. A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\". Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\". Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen. Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment). The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men, Batman and The Departed. Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously saidhis retreat from the spotlight was brought onby a desire to not \"be out there anymore\". His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know. But just last week,that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter:\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\" Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement. It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again. Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances. The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight. However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\" One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84. Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles. He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger. Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007. In 2005, however, he said he was\"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\" That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement. The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance. Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?). But then he just seemed to disappear off the face of the earth. So what happened? He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. \"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005. \"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\" He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through. We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year,along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico. Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman. He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004. Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note. \"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\" Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame. Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing. Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001. When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough! Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that\"she wasn't having fun anymore\". But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law. \"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\" Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville. Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer. A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\" Duvall did return to acting in horror movie, 2023's The Forest Hills. \"Acting again - it's so much fun. It enriches your life,\" she told People. \"[Jessica Tandy] won an Oscar when she was 80. I can still win,\" she joked. Sadly, she didn't get the chance. Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan? He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies. A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director. \"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\"he told the Telegraph.\"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\" He reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.

    "title": "The Lady: The decline and fall of the bible of female gentility",
    "article_text": "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication. The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings. In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue. Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years. The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life. Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\". The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden. The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels. \"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted. Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\". Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor. Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes. In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\". Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\" And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies. That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78. A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines. Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue. And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture. The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat. He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest. The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character. No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea. Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels. The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices. However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away. Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging. And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine. However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on. Authors say their books have been taken without permission and used to train Meta's AI systems. Imy Harris modelled designer implant covers for the world-famous fashion magazine.

    "title": "Fifteen years after a volcano shut European airspace, could it happen again?",
    "article_text": "For eight days in April 2010 UK and European airspace was closed or partially closed causing chaos to travellers around the world. The EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano in Iceland explosively erupted on14 April sending a huge ash cloud into the atmosphere and the weather pattern directed it towards Europe. Creating the worst disruption to air travel since World War Two, it put a spotlight on how unprepared the aviation industry was for the consequences of a volcanic eruption. Fifteen years on procedures have changed but could we see turmoil like that again? Heathrow airportclosed for a day in late Marchafter a fire at a nearby substation cut power and resulted in 1,300 cancelled flights, with thousands of passengers affected. It feels hard to imagine now what it was like havingeightdays of airspace closure across the UK and Europe in 2010 with 300 airports closed, 100,000 flights cancelled, 10 million passengers unable to travel and a reported Â£1.1 billion loss for the airline industry. Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world The day after the EyjafjallajÃ¶kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace. International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down. This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue. According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\" Passengers were stranded around the world, scrambling to find any method of transport to get home. Volcanic ash disruption leaves Britons stranded Flight chaos continues The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland. Once EyjafjallajÃ¶kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since. He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\" Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia. As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way. Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines. Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe. Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\" On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration. Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal. EyjafjallajÃ¶kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures. Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010 In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules. \"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are nowâ¦but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said. Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage. \"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added. \"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\" There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash. As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations. New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes. In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere. Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash. In recent months there have beensmall eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavikand the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa. However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from EyjafjallajÃ¶kull. Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in. But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\" If a volcano erupted with really high levels of ash affecting UK or European airspace, then \"absolutely we will see disruption because it's a safety issue\", added  Mr Nicholson. How safe is it to fly in bad weather? Could the UK actually get colder with global warming?",

    "title": "Pope puts 'God's architect' Antoni Gaudí on path to sainthood",
    "article_text": "The Vatican has put Spanish architect Antoni Gaudí on the path to sainthood in recognition of his \"heroic virtues\". Gaudí - who has been dubbed by some as \"God's architect\" - is the designer of one of Spain's most famous religious sites and tourist attractions, the unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona. On Monday, the Vatican issued a statement which said Pope Francis had authorised a decree declaring the Catalonia-born architect \"venerable\". That is an early step on the road to a candidate for sainthood being formally canonised by the Catholic Church. It is the latest development in a decades-long campaign to have Gaudí, who was a devout Catholic, recognised as a saint. The Archbishop of Barcelona, Cardinal Juan Jose Omella, called the news a \"joy\". \"It is a recognition not only of his architectural work but something more important,\" he said, according to AFP news agency. The cardinal continued: \"He is saying you... amid life's difficulties, amid work, amid pain, amid suffering, are destined to be saints.\" The usual formal process for someone to be declared a saint would next involve beatification, one step short of full sainthood. That is a category reserved for martyrs, those deemed to have lived a life of heroic values and candidates who the Church declares to have a saintly reputation. In the case of Gaudí, who died in 1926 after being hit by a tram while walking to church, the Vatican would likely require proof of a miracle that could be attributed to him post-death in order to proceed with beatification. Gaudí was born in 1852 and many of his best known works continue to attract visitors to Barcelona, where much of his legacy is situated. The Sagrada Familia basilica has been under construction since 1883 and remains unfinished. It has been placed on Unesco's World Heritage list, along with some of Gaudi's other works, and was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. Twice a year, the Thiruvananthapuram airport shuts operations for a few hours for a temple procession. The new gurdwara is needed because the one in West Street, Banbury, is now too small. A state of emergency was declared in the Spanish Canary Island after 6cm (2.4in) of water fell in two hours on Saturday. More than 10,000 people are expected in Gravesend to celebrate a major date in the Sikh calendar. Osasuna's appeal over Barcelona defender Inigo Martinez's eligibility to play in a La Liga against them is dismissed by Royal Spanish Football Federation.",

    "title": "Ancient oak tree cut down by Toby Carvery",
    "article_text": "The cutting down of an ancient oak in north London was ordered on health and safety grounds by the pub chain that owns Toby Carvery after it was told the tree was dead. The felled oak, estimated to be about 500 years old, was found by council workers at the edge of Whitewebbs Park in Enfield earlier in April. An emergency tree preservation order has now been imposed on what remains of the tree, which is near a Toby Carvery. The tree, with a girth of 6m (20ft), was a nationally significant pedunculate oak listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory. A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: \"We tooknecessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met.\" The pub chain spokesperson added: \"This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care.\" Earlier, a Mitchells & Butlers source said the company had \"done the decent thing\" although they apologised to locals who loved the tree. Enfield Council's leader, Ergin Erbil, previously said they were treating the matter as criminal damage and had reported it to the police. The Met Police confirmed it had received a report from the council, but it is understood the force believes there is no evidence of criminality. The spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: \"The tree was cut back after we were advised that it caused a serious health and safety risk. \"Upon further inspection, our specialist arboriculture contractors made the assessment that the split and dead wood posed a serious health and safety risk and advised that the tree was unsafe and should be removed. \"We are grateful to our expert contractors for warning us of this hazard so swiftly, allowing us to act before anyone was harmed.\" Benny Hawksbee, a member of the Guardians of Whitewebbs group, said \"the tree belonged to Enfield and to our national heritage - I am devastated. \"We have now placed a legal protection [Tree Preservation Order] on the tree and are looking at ways to help it grow back.\" Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, said the felling of such a \"magnificent\" tree was shocking. \"Ancient oaks can live up to 1,000 years old and are as precious as our stately homes and castles,\" he said. \"Our nation's green heritage should be valued and protected and we will do everything we can to achieve this.\" The Woodland Trust's head of campaigning Adam Cormack said: \"This depressing sight is a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place. \"It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for heritage trees like the Whitewebbs Oak is long overdue.\" The trust's Living Legends petition, which aims to secure such status for heritage trees, and which attracted more than 100,000 signatures,was handed in to Downing Street in November. The issue of tree preservation was highlighted after the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in September 2023. There was outrage when the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, was chopped down. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, are accused of causing criminal damage put at more than £600,000. The men, who deny the charge, will appear before a jury at a trial starting on 28 April at Newcastle Crown Court.

    "article_text": "Harriet Dart made the comment during her loss to French player Lois Boisson British number four Harriet Dart has apologised for asking the umpire to tell her French opponent to put on deodorant during a first-round loss at the Rouen Open. Dart lost 6-0 6-3 to Lois Boisson, which included the 28-year-old being swept aside in the opening set in just 28 minutes. During a changeover in the second set, Dart was heard on the broadcast asking the official: \"Can you ask her to put on deodorant? She smells really bad.\" But Dart later posted on her Instagram story: \"I want to apologise for what I said on court today, it was a heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret. \"That's not how I want to carry myself, and I take full responsibility. I have a lot of respect for Lois and how she competed today. \"I'll learn from this and move forward.\" Boisson, who had walked back on to the court while Dart was still sat down, appeared to be out of earshot when the Briton made the comment to the umpire. However, she later made light of the incident on her Instagram story, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they \"apparently need a collab\". Lois Boisson won her first WTA 125 title last year BBC Sport has contacted the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for comment. During the match, Dart failed to convert any of her six break points as the 21-year-old Boisson claimed a comprehensive victory to reach the last 16. Boisson, who is making her first WTA Tour appearance of the season after struggling with injury, is currently 303rd in the world rankings. She caused an upset by beating the 62nd-ranked Dart, who lost her serve four times in the match.

    "title": "Hamas rejects Israeli ceasefire disarmament proposal, Palestinian official says",
    "article_text": "Hamas is said to have rejected an Israeli proposal for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza which called for the armed group to give up its weapons. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan gave no commitment to end the war or for an Israeli troop pull-out - key Hamas demands - in exchange for releasing half of the living hostages which it holds. It comes as Israel continues its military offensive in Gaza. A security guard was killed and nine other people were injured in an air strike on a field hospital in Khan Younis, the hospital said. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck the head of a Hamas cell. A UN agency meanwhile warned that \"the humanitarian situation in Gaza is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities\". It is six weeks since Israel allowed any supplies to enter through crossings into the Palestinian territory - by far the longest such stoppage to date. UN agencies strongly refute Israel's claim that there is enough food in Gaza to last for a long time and suggest the blockade could breach international humanitarian law. Israel's prime minister said the block on supplies was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages and to extend the ceasefire which expired on 1 March. At the same time, the UN's humanitarian affairs office stated: \"Partners on the ground report a surge in attacks causing mass civilian casualties and the destruction of some of the remaining infrastructure that's needed to keep people alive.\" Israel is said to have submitted its latest ceasefire proposal to regional mediators late last week, just days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met US President Donald Trump in Washington. A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya then met Egyptian intelligence officials in Cairo. The senior Palestinian official told the BBC: \"The Israeli proposal relayed to the movement through Egypt explicitly called for the disarmament of Hamas without any Israeli commitment to end the war or withdraw from Gaza. Hamas therefore rejected the offer in its entirety.\" It is understood to be the first time that Israel has added Hamas disarmament as a condition for advancing a ceasefire - a red line for the group. The Palestinian official accused Israel of stalling for time, seeking only to retrieve the hostages while prolonging the war. It is believed that 59 hostages remain in Gaza, of whom 24 are alive. On Tuesday afternoon, the spokesman for Hamas's military wing said it had \"lost contact\" with a group of fighters holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander following what he described as \"a direct strike on their location\". Abu Ubaida produced no evidence to support the claim and gave no indication of when contact had been lost. Israel has said it avoids hitting locations where it believes hostages are being held. Hamas released a video of the 21-year-old soldier on Saturday, in which he appeared to be speaking under duress as he criticised the Israeli government. Recently released hostages related how many were held with them in dire conditions underground. Some are in poor health with untreated injuries. Hamas has said it is ready to return all of those held captive, in exchange for a complete end to hostilities and full Israeli pull-out from Gaza. It previously offered five hostages in exchange for a truce extension but claims to have shown flexibility on the number of hostages to be released. The BBC understands that Egypt has put forward a modified proposal to Hamas which it is now considering. Israeli media had not been anticipating an imminent ceasefire breakthrough. The newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth quoted an unnamed Israeli senior security official as saying: \"We assess that there will be a deal within two-three weeks, but right now there are still gaps and the distance is great.\" \"We want to get them to release 19 living hostages. Israel and the United States are co-ordinated, and the military pressure is having an impact,\" the official went on. \"They have a shortage of gas, and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents' return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. Pressure from the residents has begun. That's rattled them.\" Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 18 March and then restarted ground operations, saying it was targeting Hamas. The prime minister said future ceasefire talks would be held \"under fire\". Since Israel restarted its offensive in Gaza, at least 1,630 people have been killed - bringing the total killed in 18 months of war to 51,000, according to the latest figures from the Hamas-run health ministry. Some 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the unprecedented Hamas-led 7 October attacks which triggered the war, Israel says. On Tuesday morning, Israeli warplanes struck by the gate of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in al-Mawasi, a crowded tented area for displaced people on the coast near Khan Younis in southern Gaza, hospital spokesman Saber Abu Arar told the BBC. The man killed worked at the site, he said, and those injured were both hospital staff and patients. Three ambulances and some tents used as a reception area were damaged. Graphic footage released by the field hospital on Facebook showed a man covered in blood being rushed away with attempts made to resuscitate him. The IDF said in a statement that it \"struck the head of a Hamas terrorist cell and a combat zone commander\" outside the hospital, without giving any evidence. It also said a \"precise munition\" was used to mitigate harm in the area. The attack comes after the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, said he was \"deeply alarmed\" at Sunday's strike on al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, his spokesman said. Israel said it targeted a building at the site which Hamas was using as \"a command-and-control centre\" - something the group denied. Doctors scrambled to evacuate the hospital, saying they were given just a 20-minute warning by the IDF. A 12-year-old boy being treated for head injuries is said to have died because his care was disrupted. The hospital - which had been the best functioning in northern Gaza - is now out of service and cannot admit new patients. \"Under international humanitarian law, wounded and sick, medical personnel and medical facilities, including hospitals, must be respected and protected,\" the spokesman for Guterres said. He added that the attack dealt \"a severe blow to an already devastated healthcare system in the strip\", adding that with aid blocked, there was strong concern that medical supplies were now running low as well as stocks of food and water. The UN secretary general pointed out that under international humanitarian law, an occupying power had obligations to ensure relief for the civilian population. Recent Israeli military evacuation orders have led to wide-scale displacement of Gaza's 2.1 million population. The UN says about 70% of the strip is currently under displacement orders or in \"no-go\" zones,\" where the Israeli authorities require humanitarian teams to coordinate their movements. In Israel, polls suggest that a majority of Israelis back a Gaza ceasefire deal and - when it comes to their countries' stated war goals - prioritise bringing home the hostages over dismantling Hamas' governing and military capabilities. However, Netanyahu is backed by hard-line religious ultranationalist parties who have threatened to collapse the government if he ends the war. Israel signed onto a ceasefire deal in January, leading to the release of 33 hostages - 25 of them alive - in exchange for some 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in the first six-week stage. It then largely refused to begin talks on the planned second stage which was supposed to lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and a complete end to fighting. In the past week, Israeli military reservists and veterans have signed several open letters condemning the ongoing war and questioning its priorities. There has also been criticism of the IDF's chief of staff and air force commander for sacking air force reservists who signed an original statement. This has coincided with rising frustration among reservists and their families over the cost of ongoing reserve duty along with the government's failure to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews despite the IDF facing shortages of combat soldiers. The group says it lost communication after an Israeli strike on where Edan Alexander was being held. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempted from paying federal income taxes. The green card holder was held \"in direct retaliation\" for his role in campus protests, says his lawyer. The agency says it is seeing \"attack after attack\" and supply shortages following an Israeli strike on al-Ahli hospital. Asaad al-Nassasra has been missing since Israeli troops killed 15 other emergency workers in south Gaza three weeks ago.",

    "title": "Civil case against Andrew Tate could be legal first, barrister says",
    "article_text": "A civil case brought by four women against Andrew Tate is believed to be a legal first, a barrister for his accusers has said. The women accuse Tate of rape, assault and coercive control between 2013 and 2015. One claims he threatened to kill her, another says he made clear he would kill anyone who spoke to her, and a third claims he convinced her he had killed others. In written submissions, Anne Studd KC said she believed this was the first case of its kind in which it is argued that coercive control amounted to \"intentional infliction of harm\" - a legal concept similar to emotional distress. Tate denies the claims, saying they are a \"pack of lies\" and \"gross fabrications\". The women are seeking damages \"arising from the assaults, batteries, and infliction of intentional harm\", their civil claim states. A case management hearing was held in London on Tuesday, which deals with preliminary matters and logistics. The court heard that a trial could be held in early 2027, and that it could last three weeks. Judge Richard Armstrong told the court the four women were \"seeking damages likely to reach six figures\". Proving the intentional infliction of harm would mean the claimants could be awarded additional damages. Coercive control, Ms Studd said, was \"a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way\". She added that a victim \"may not leave even if the door is open\". Vanessa Marshall KC, acting for Tate, told the court that they \"accept in this day and age that coercive and controlling behaviour does exist\", but that it was \"really not the issue in this case\". The case concerns incidents the four women allege took place in Luton and Hitchin. Two of the claimants worked for Tate's webcam business in 2015, while the other two were in relationships with him in 2013 and 2014. Three of the women previously reported Tate to the police, but in 2019 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to bring criminal charges. Tate denies all the allegations, and argues that the women cannot now take legal action against him because too much time has passed, and emails, texts, and other potential evidence would have been lost. His solicitor Andrew Ford previously said in a statement that the women's allegations \"are vehemently denied and will be fully contested in court\". \"When the matter was referred to the CPS, they concluded there was insufficient prospect of conviction and chose not to charge Mr Tate with any offence,\" Mr Ford added. The women's claim against Tate is one of several serious legal challenges around the world that he is fighting, including some where he is co-accused with his brother Tristan Tate. They are currently facing a mix of criminal and civil legal action in three countries - the UK, the US and Romania. Last year, the brothers were detained in Bucharest after Bedfordshire Police in the UK said it had obtained an arrest warrant in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating back to between 2012 and 2015. A Romanian court ruled in March 2024 that the pair could be extradited to the UK once separate proceedings there had concluded. The brothers deny all accusations against them. A travel ban imposed on the brothers in Romania was recently lifted. They travelled to Miami in the US state of Florida from late February until late March. The UK government faced criticism for not requesting the extradition of the brothers at the time, in connection to the criminal investigation in the UK. An email from the Florida Attorney General's Office, seen by BBC News and dated 7 March, says that \"should the United Kingdom have an extradition order that needs to be acted upon, our state authorities will assist in executing and complying\". \"I hope this assists in service of process for the cases in the United Kingdom,\" the email adds. One of the claimants in the civil case, who we are calling Sienna, previously told the BBC that it was \"horrible to see\" Tate travelling internationally and she thought the UK should be \"pushing a lot harder\" for the brothers' extradition. In a statement, the Home Office said: \"As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, the UK will neither confirm nor deny that an extradition request has been made or received. Given the ongoing Romanian investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\" The BBC has been told by sources close to the matter that UK officials are concerned a separate extradition request to the US would be seen as subverting the Romanian legal process, potentially risking the existing agreement between the UK and Romania. A spokesperson for Tate previously said he \"categorically denies these unproven and untested allegations\". \"Mr Tate will defend himself vigorously and remains confident the truth will prevail,\" they added in a statement. Neither of the brothers have been convicted of any crimes.",

    "title": "'Despair for Emery, but Villa showed they belong'",
    "article_text": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery falls to his knees after his side miss a chance against Paris St-Germain at Villa Park Unai Emery has enjoyed too much success in Europe to listen to talk of glorious failure but. if there is such a thing, Aston Villa delivered it on a night of pure theatre at Villa Park. Villa's Champions League odyssey ended with defeat by Paris St-Germain, but the manner in which they unnerved arguably the most impressive side in this season's competition demonstrated that they belonged in this elite company. It has been 43 years since they were last in this competition, then as holders. It will not be as long again if they continue the progress under expert European operator Emery, who almost engineered yet another glory night to add to his stellar managerial CV. It is probably just as long since the grand old stadium rocked like this in such an electric atmosphere, as Villa looked down and out when PSG struck twice early on to extend their 3-1 advantage from the first leg in Paris. At 5-1 down on aggregate, it had all the makings of a long and painful night for Spanish boss Emery and his players as they were punished by this brutally brilliant PSG. But they launched a stunning series of counter-punches that left PSG on the ropes, and Villa just one goal away from forcing extra time. Villa Park is a stadium built for the Champions League - although there was a mis-step before kick-off when the Europa League theme was played. It is something they will not want to hear next season. 'He was on fire' - so was Emery wrong to replace Rashford? Heroic Villa comeback falls just short against PSG Champions League quarter-finals - how it stands & route to final Villa's John McGinn and PSG's Achraf Hakimi, who both scored, tumble together during a second-half incident The pre-match build-up was more rock concert than football match, with flames and pyrotechnics lighting up Villa Park, fireworks flying over either side of the stadium from the roof of the towering stands. The trademark stern expression of legendary former Villa manager Ron Saunders gazed down from the giant screens before kick-off as one of the most famous quotes in the club's history was revived, echoing around the stadium. \"Do you want to bet against us?\" is a message fixed in Villa folklore, Saunders delivering it when they stumbled and were doubted before winning the league title in 1981. Everyone inside Villa Park would have had a bet against them as Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes put PSG 2-0 up inside the first half-hour. \"Start the car,\" said one despondent Villa fan. It is to be hoped he did not follow his own advice otherwise he would have missed a thriller that left the stadium knee-deep in chewed fingernails by the final whistle. Instead of subsiding, Villa rose to rattle PSG in a manner that was well beyond Manchester City and Liverpool in previous Champions League rounds this season. Youri Tielemans got one back, then it really was game on when John McGinn and Ezri Konsa struck twice in three minutes early in the second half. PSG's inexperience was exposed, but the brilliant keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saved superbly from Marcus Rashford, Tielemans and Marco Asensio to repel Villa's assault. In a deafening wall of sound and with PSG being given a fearful going over, Emery actually threw himself to the floor in a mixture of despair and disbelief when Konsa just failed to make contact with a header and the goal at his mercy. The great comeback was just beyond Villa, but in the disappointment there was glory. The task now is for Villa and Emery to ensure they are back on the Champions League stage next season because nights like this - and triumphs such as those against Bayern Munich earlier in the campaign - will have whetted the appetite and more. Those Villa will count on in the future, such as Konsa, Morgan Rogers and Boubacar Kamara, will benefit hugely from being exposed to the quality they faced at this level, while other such as keeper Emiliano Martinez, McGinn and Tielemans will believe this is their natural stage. Emery will also store away the knowledge and experience of this season, making it instantly clear he wants more, saying: \"It is now most important to get Europe again. The most important competition is the Champions League. \"The challenge we have for the last six matches in the Premier League is to try and get Europe and the Champions League.\" He added: \"To get this level is the next step forward that I want to try to build with Aston Villa.\" Emery's standards are sky high, saying: \"We are in a process. This is a higher level we have achieved. We want to test ourselves and how we respond. I am so proud, happy, confident in our standards. Hopefully we can come back quickly. \"Our squad showed it can respond at this level. We competed. They deserve to be here. We are ambitious. It is a big challenge and we want the club to push for this level.\" Latest Aston Villa news, analysis and fan views Get Aston Villa news sent straight to your phone Whether Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, will be part of wherever Villa are next season remains to be seen. He struggled desperately through the first half here before mirroring Villa's own effort with a transformed second half performance, in which he set up Konsa's goal and was left in disbelief when a shot he thought was arrowing towards the top corner was turned away by the twisting Donnarumma. Rashford was given the nod ahead of England striker Ollie Watkins, who has been nursing a knee injury and only came on for the last 14 minutes. The final whistle at first brought groans of despair followed by a standing ovation for Villa's players and Emery as he marched down the touchline. Villa left nothing out there at Villa Park in their quest to reach the semi-final. And Emery, who has made Europe his speciality, will want this to be just the start of Villa's Champions League experiences.

    "title": "Rodent nests found near house where Gene Hackman's wife died of hantavirus",
    "article_text": "Nests and some dead rodents were found in outbuildings of the house where Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead. New Mexico Department of Public Health records seen by BBC News documented evidence of the animals in eight detached buildings at their home in Santa Fe. US officials previously confirmed that Ms Arakawa, 65, died from arespiratory illness linked to hantavirus, which can be transmitted by infected rodents. It is believed she died a week before her husband, 95, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities found the deceased couple in their home in February. An environmental assessment of the property took place on 5 March, a week after they were discovered, as part of the investigation into their deaths. It found rodent faeces, a live rodent, dead rodent and a rodent nest in three garages, in addition to further rodent droppings in two small external houses and three sheds. Traps had also been set up. There were sightings of rodents, a nest and faeces in two abandoned vehicles or farming machinery in the grounds of the property. All eight detached outbuildings were within 50 yards (45 metres) of the main house where the couple lived, which itself was \"clean with no signs of rodent activity,\" New Mexico public health officials said in their eight-page report. Authorities believeMs Hackman died around 12 February and her husband on 18 February, with their bodies discovered on 26 February. Medical investigators believe Ms Arakawa contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a life-threatening lung condition with symptoms including fatigue, fever, muscle aches, dizziness and abdominal issues, which led to a sudden death. Hantavirus refers to a strain of viruses carried by rodents, primarily transmitted to humans through inhalation of airborne particles from dried rodent droppings. Infections typically occur when the virus becomes airborne from a rodent's urine, droppings, or saliva, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If respiratory symptoms develop during HPS, the mortality rate is approximately 38%, according to the CDC. The agency reported 864 cases of hantavirus in the US between 1993 and 2022, mostly in rural western states. Mr Hackman's cause of death was severe heart disease, with advanced Alzheimer's disease listed as a contributing factor. Experts told the BBChis Alzheimer's may have prevented him from realisinghis wife of more than 30 years was dead in the home where he was living. Officials in Silicon Valley are investigating and have disabled the audio feature on the pedestrian crossings. Warning of \"no tolerance for gamesmanship\", the judge said she would determine whether to hold the government in contempt of court. The US president has also called for the institution to lose a valuable tax break, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. Officials in the US and El Salvador have been unwilling to return the man home, sparking a legal battle. Universities, as well as many charities and religious groups, are exempted from paying federal income taxes.",

    "article_text": "Harriet Dart made the comment during her loss to French player Lois Boisson British number four Harriet Dart has apologised for asking the umpire to tell her French opponent to put on deodorant during a first-round loss at the Rouen Open. Dart lost 6-0 6-3 to Lois Boisson, which included the 28-year-old being swept aside in the opening set in just 28 minutes. During a changeover in the second set, Dart was heard on the broadcast asking the official: \"Can you ask her to put on deodorant? She smells really bad.\" But Dart later posted on her Instagram story: \"I want to apologise for what I said on court today, it was a heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret. \"That's not how I want to carry myself, and I take full responsibility. I have a lot of respect for Lois and how she competed today. \"I'll learn from this and move forward.\" Boisson, who had walked back on to the court while Dart was still sat down, appeared to be out of earshot when the Briton made the comment to the umpire. However, she later made light of the incident on her Instagram story, posting an edited photo of her holding some deodorant and telling toiletries company Dove that they \"apparently need a collab\". Lois Boisson won her first WTA 125 title last year BBC Sport has contacted the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for comment. During the match, Dart failed to convert any of her six break points as the 21-year-old Boisson claimed a comprehensive victory to reach the last 16. Boisson, who is making her first WTA Tour appearance of the season after struggling with injury, is currently 303rd in the world rankings. She caused an upset by beating the 62nd-ranked Dart, who lost her serve four times in the match. The Briton was appearing in her second clay-court match of the season before next month's French Open, having also lost to Varvara Gracheva last month in the first round at the Charleston Open.

    "title": "Why Amorim's next move on Onana is a big call",
    "article_text": "Andre Onana has made eight mistakes leading to goals in all competitions since his Manchester United debut at the start of the 2023-24 season - the most of any Premier League goalkeeper Among all the chaos around Manchester United's season and the talk of summer transfer priorities, the goalkeeper situation had not been top of the list. Yes, Andre Onana's Â£47.5m transfer was one of those \"inherited\" dealsnamechecked by co-owner Sir Jim Ractliffe, as part of the Â£400m the club still owes on unpaid transfer fees. And Ratcliffe did mention Onana by name as he talked about getting \"the house in order\" financially, and explaining why it will take time for the club \"to move away from the past into a new place in the future\". But when former United midfielderNemanja Matic labelled Onana one of United's \"worst-ever goalkeepers\"- and then the Cameroon international subsequently made two more errors in last week's 2-2 draw in Lyon - yet another 'crisis' in United's chaotic season emerged. Amorim will be asked by media on Wednesday who will start in goal for their crucial Europa League quarter-final with Lyon, Onana or United's latest scapegoat, number two Altay Bayindir. Whether he chooses to answer or not is a different matter. But when the choice is made between the goalkeepers, it could shape what the future looks like for Amorim and his ailing team. Leaving Onana out of the Premier League defeat at Newcastle was the easy bit. In terms of the domestic situation, barring an unlikely late season surge into a Uefa Conference League spot, United's campaign is done. Telling Onana to have the weekend off and clear his head was a decision with few negatives attached. The same cannot be applied to the decision Amorim has to make on Thursday. No matter which keeper misses out, they have to be on the bench. The goalkeeper overlooked will surely be looking for a new club this summer. And it could yet turn out both will leave - meaning more money being paid out on replacements that the club can ill afford. It is not an ideal situation and not one United chiefs were thinking about when Amorim arrived at the club from Sporting in November. How on earth did we get here? Injured Zirkzee could miss rest of Man Utd's season This video can not be played Man Utd goalkeeper conundrum a 'huge problem' - Murphy The motivation for Matic's attack has not been explained. He was responding to relatively innocuous comments Onana made about Lyon in the build-up to the game, when he said he respected the French club but believed United were \"way better\". However, it is notable how strongly the former Serbia midfielder defended the man Onana replaced, David de Gea, when the Spaniard made his own series of mistakes in May 2019, saying, \"He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and will be for years to come.\" Was Matic using Onana as collateral damage to reinforce a point shared by many that United made a mistake and treated one of their best players of recent times badly when they opted not to renew De Gea's contract in 2023 and sign the Cameroon international instead, for Â£47.2m from Inter Milan? The situation was heightened when Onana, rather than remaining silent or at least waiting until after the game to respond, ignored cautionary advice and hit back, adding: \"At least I've lifted trophies with the greatest club in the world. Some can't say the same.\" Matic never won a trophy as a United player. It was against that backdrop Onana made a catastrophic mistake for Lyon's opening goal in the 2-2 draw, then erred for the injury-time equaliser, the negativity for that heightened massively by the first inexplicable blunder. If that performance was an isolated one, it would have been bad enough. But it is acknowledged even by those closest to the former Ajax and Inter Milan goalkeeper that Onana's United career has been scarred by a series of big mistakes. He has eight errors leading to goals in all competitions since he joined United - the most by any Premier League goalkeeper in that time. A feeling Onana was being scrutinised in a way he hadn't been previously in his career became evident in his first few weeks at United, when he was chipped from 50 yards in a pre-season friendly against Lens. Onana had been following instructions to take up a starting position higher up the pitch when his team had the ball, only for Diogo Dalot to give it away under no pressure. The reaction was intense and the keeper was lampooned in some parts of social media. Even though he wasn't to blame, his performances became the subject of debate. It put Onana on the back foot from the first moment. Bayindir's failed Man Utd audition offers Onana dilemma How does Onana compare to other Man Utd keepers after Matic criticism? Onana dropped from Man Utd squad to face Newcastle Bayindir meanwhile, waited patiently for his chance. And waited. And waited. A Â£4.3m arrival from Fenerbahce in September 2023, Bayindir was a regular member of the Turkey squad. Yet Erik ten Hag would not play him. The former United boss even persuaded Onana to delay his departure to the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in January 2024 long enough to allow him to play in an FA Cup tie at League One Wigan and Premier League draw with Tottenham. Bayindir did eventually make his debut during Onana's absence in the FA Cup fourth round at Newport, which United won 4-2 after throwing away a two-goal lead. It turned out to be Bayindir's only appearance of the season. It was not much of a show of faith from Ten Hag. Before the Newcastle game, Bayindir had played six times this season, all in cup competitions. He featured in the last two games of United's Europa League first-phase campaign but was injured for the last-16 tie with Real Sociedad and back on the bench in Lyon. Little wonder that the feeling had been growing from those close to him he would move on in the summer. Newcastle offered a chance to change the narrative. But Bayindir's kicking was shaky and he made a mistake for the home side's fourth goal. What was to be expected, countered Bayindir's supporters, with the 27-year-old pitched into a much-changed team, with some players badly lacking in confidence. Yet Onana, outwardly so boisterous and confident, could be forgiven for sharing the same uncertainties. His leadership around the dressing room is viewed as a major strength in a squad that lacks them. Yet, reunited with his old boss Ten Hag partly because of his ability with the ball at his feet, Onana is now frequently asked to go long and hit strikers who struggle to hold the ball up. It is felt Amorim is hugely supportive of him but the change in defensive structure, with players largely not used to the system, has been hard to adapt to. He is more comfortable with life off the field than he was in Italy, mainly because he and his family speak English. But Onana knows United's performances have not been good enough. He knows he bears some responsibility for that but is starting to feel he is shouldering most of the blame when there are multiple factors at play. Those closest to him also suspect if United's Europa League campaign does not end with them lifting the trophy in Bilbao next month and taking with it that prized Champions League berth, the events in Lyon will be cited as a significant reason, which could hasten Onana's departure from Old Trafford. That is a situation United had not bargained for six months ago. They have known for some considerable time multiple areas of Amorim's squad needed work - everyone can see a goalscorer is desperately required - but felt first-choice goalkeeper was reasonably secure. United will still be paying off Onana's fee in instalments spread across his five-year contract, meaning they would surely lose money if they were to consider selling him this summer. Since the start of 2023-24, only Jordan Pickford (8.7) has prevented more goals based on Opta's expected goals model in the Premier League than Manchester United's Andre Onana (7.5).

    "title": "Guirassy's rise from journeyman to Champions League 'goal machine'",
    "article_text": "Against Barcelona on Tuesday Serhou Guirassy became the first African player to score a hat-trick in a Champions League knockout game since Sadio Mane for Liverpool against Porto in 2018 Serhou Guirassy - a man with a modest career until two years ago - finds himself at the top of the Champions League scoring charts after his hat-trick against Barcelona, though it was not enough to prevent Borussia Dortmund going out. The striker, 29, has relegations from the German and French top tiers on his CV - and had never produced a 15-goal season until last term. His six transfers in a journeyman career often hit by injury have cost a combined Â£45m. But now the Guinea forward is the Champions League's top scorer with 13 goals. \"He has been absolutely amazing in this competition, he's been a goalscoring machine,\" two-time Champions League winner Owen Hargreaves told TNT Sports. \"There will be a lot of teams looking at Guirassy. He's scored all those goals for Stuttgart, now at Dortmund. A big physical presence and a natural goalscorer.\" BBC Sport looks at the remarkable rise of Guirassy - who has been linked with a host of British clubs throughout his career. Guirassy (centre) played for France at U16, U17 and U19 level - scoring 12 goals in 24 games Guirassy, then a France Under-19s international, made his first-team breakthrough at Laval and scored six goals in 29 games in the 2014-15 Ligue 2 campaign. QPR and Leeds United were both linked with him before he moved to Lille that summer for a reported 1m euros (now Â£840,000). Herve Renard was the manager who brought him to Lille - but was sacked in November and, after only three Ligue 1 starts, Guirassy was sent on loan to second-tier Auxerre in January. He scored eight goals in 16 games but Lille - who lost to Dortmund in the last 16 of this season's Champions League - sold him that summer. Guirassy netted nine goals in 45 games for Cologne Arsenal, still managed by Arsene Wenger then, were reportedly scouting him during that loan spell to Auxerre. But instead he moved to Cologne - in a somewhat protracted deal. The German side spotted something in his medical and the clubs had a minor war of words before Cologne eventually negotiated a lower fee - understood to be about 4m euros (now Â£3.4m). Injuries would blight his time there and he managed just 21 Bundesliga appearances, and four goals, in his first two seasons before their relegation. According to Transfermarkt he has missed 75 games through injury or illness in his career, with 41 of them coming during his time at Cologne. He netted just two goals in the opening half of the 2018-19 German second tier season before returning to France to join Amiens on loan. Guirassy played for Rennes against Leicester in the 2021-22 Conference League - and has been linked to the Foxes Guirassy netted three Ligue 1 goals in the second half of 2018-19 and Amiens paid about 5m euros (about Â£4.2m now) to sign him permanently that summer. West Ham, Aston Villa, Leicester, Bournemouth, Brighton and Tottenham were all reportedly interested in signing him midway through the 2019-20 season - but he ended up staying at Amiens as they were relegated to Ligue 2. Amiens sports director John Williams says Guirassy turned down a move to Chelsea in the summer of 2020 because he wanted first-team guarantees - so instead he moved to French top-flight Rennes for about 15m euros (now Â£12.6m). He hit double figures for the first two times in his career with 25 goals in two seasons - but a return to Germany was calling. Everton were the latest British team to be linked to him when he was leaving Rennes in 2022 - and were supposedly close to signing him at one stage. But instead he went back to the Bundesliga, joining Stuttgart in a loan deal. He scored 14 goals, including one in the promotion-relegation play-off win over Hamburg, as he avoided a third relegation in his career. Stuttgart made the signing permanent for a fee of about 9m euros (now Â£7.6m). And then his career really got going. The 2023-24 season was the year Guirassy really found his shooting boots. In all competitions last season he netted 30 goals in 30 games for Stuttgart - in an injury-hit campaign. He scored 28 Bundesliga goals in as many games - one every 79 minutes - and only missed out on the Golden Boot to Harry Kane's 36. Stuttgart finished second in the table behind Bayer Leverkusen. Guirassy was unfortunate because without Kane, he would have won not only the German top-scorer award but also the European Golden Shoe - awarded to the leading scorer across Europe's top leagues. Despite missing several games through injury, he played 2,211 minutes in the league (equivalent to 24.5 full games) - the most in his career. It was at Stuttgart too that he became a senior international for Guinea, having represented France at youth level. Guirassy has scored Champions League goals against Club Brugge, Celtic, Dinamo Zagreb, Barcelona, Bologna, Shakhtar and Sporting Manchester United and Newcastle United were among the English teams to be linked to him last summer. But he instead moved to Borussia Dortmund, who triggered a release clause to sign him for Â£14.7m. Another injury delayed his debut but he has been prolific since getting into the team - with 28 goals in 40 games. Thirteen of those have come in the Champions League, in his debut season in Europe's top competition - the most ever scored by an African player in a single campaign. \"I understand that my form might surprise some, but I'm not surprised,\"he said recently.,external \"I have had two crazy seasons, but I've not changed anything. I'm not working more, I'm not sleeping more, I'm not doing more video analysis. \"It's just a question of confidence. And I have understood that at the highest level, talent isn't enough. \"You have to push through the pain barrier in challenges, in the effort you put in, in making high-intensity runs again and again, more quickly and more frequently than your opponents. \"Perhaps that is where the change has come from.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "'Don't give up' - why Peaty was convinced to go again",
    "article_text": "Peaty was bidding to become only the second man, after the great American Michael Phelps, to win the same swimming event at three consecutive Olympics Adam Peaty was not immediately convinced he would return to competitive swimming after hisemotional, gut-wrenching week at the Paris Olympics last summer. Alandmark change to the sport's schedule- one that significantly boosts the 30-year-old's chance of further success going forward - was not all that was needed to seal the deal. \"If I retired post-Paris on something I deeply wasn't happy with - what message does that send to my children?,\" Peaty tells BBC Sport. \"I want them to not give up when it does get tough. I want them to dig down, dig deep and find another way through that problem.\" Olympians to battle for titles at GB Championships Peaty aims for LA 2028 after 50m events added Burnout and back again - Peaty's road to Paris The problem to which Peaty refers was his quest for a third consecutive Olympic 100m breaststroke gold last July. He had to settle for silver by an agonising 0.02 seconds, having contracted Covid-19 earlier in the week. He was in tears afterwards and again soon after when holding his three-year-old son, George. \"I got ill on the day you are most healthy,\" says Peaty, who also won relay gold in Tokyo in 2021. \"I have got to laugh about it because it is one of those incredibly painful moments but I don't see it is one of those things I am always going to look back on and say 'what a horrible moment'. \"It has taught me so much about myself, about my future and where I want to apply that experience to my potential next Olympic Games. \"It is just life. It will be tough sometimes and will be easy sometimes too.\" Peaty's first two Olympic golds - in Rio de Janeiro and then Tokyo - came during his period of dominance. The third individual medal, not quite the colour he wanted, followed his time out of the sport after issues with alcohol and his mental health. Since then Peaty's long-time coach Mel Marshall has left for a job in Australia, leading plenty to believe he would walk away from the sport, but the Englishman committed to another Olympic cycle last week after the 50m breaststroke races were added to the schedule for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. \"I watched the press conference and thought 'this is going to change the sport for everyone',\" Peaty says. \"Swimming is one of those sports where it is incredibly demanding. \"You are doing 4,000 to 5,000m in the morning, doing a whole day of work or school then 4,000m at night. \"Sprinting is a little bit different because you don't have to commit to the metres as much. \"You still have to put the time in, it is going to be difficult like anything, but it is going to give longevity to those athletes that have been doing that for a long time, are getting tired of the sport and can train a bit differently.\" The British swimming championships began on Tuesday - and are live on BBC iPlayer until 20 April - but Peaty will not defend his title. He is making a careful return to the sport after a break post-Paris with LA the ultimate goal, by which time his son will be eight. \"He is going to fully appreciate what it is like to be at an Olympic Games,\" Peaty says. \"That is the journey we are on. \"It is no longer a selfless decision it is a family and broader decision. \"I race fastest when I am happiest. You have got to get results, most of the time you will not be happy but at least there is a balance there. \"That is something I learned from my previous cycle into Paris.\" Peaty content after night of pure Olympic emotion",

    "title": "'He was on fire' - so was Emery wrong to replace Rashford?",
    "article_text": "Rashford has made 15 appearances in all competitions for Aston Villa, scoring three goals and registering five assists He may not have scored himself, but Marcus Rashford arguably provided the spark that almost led Aston Villa to one of the great Champions League comebacks against Paris St-Germain. The England forward had been fairly quiet in the first half as the French champions looked on course for a routine win, leading 2-0 after 27 minutes and 5-1 on aggregate. But Rashford starred in the second period, tormenting the PSG defence asVilla fought back to lead 3-2on the night and come within one goal of levelling the tie. In the end they just couldn't find a fourth goal, but the 27-year-old, on loan at Villa amid an uncertain Manchester United future, showed exactly what he is capable of against a side tipped to go all the way in this season's Champions League. \"He is feeling better and he played a fantastic match,\" Villa boss Unai Emery told Amazon Prime. \"We are very happy. If he is happy, we are happy.\" 'Despair for Emery, but Villa showed they belong' Heroic Villa comeback falls just short against PSG Champions League quarter-finals - how it stands & route to final Rashford's January move appears to have revived the England international's career but, after a number of decent displays, this was arguably his best for Emery's side. The way he set up Villa's third goal against PSG was a brilliant display of skill as he nutmegged one player to get into the box, sidestepped another before cutting the ball back perfectly for Ezri Konsa to fire home. That assist was his fifth for the club - no Premier League player has managed more since his Villa debut. Rashford memorably scored a last-minute penalty for Manchester United against PSG in 2019 to send them out of the Champions League, and he almost came back to haunt them once again as only a stunning Gianluigi Donnarumma stop denied him finding the top corner. \"Marcus Rashford didn't score, but the energy levels that he had... he was making those defenders make mistakes,\" former Villa and Manchester United striker Dion Dublin said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"For me, he was man of the match for Villa.\" Marcus Rashford operated as the central striker against PSG - but popped up everywhere in attack, often drawn out wide in a lively display Rashford's impressive display was underlined by the statistics. He had the most touches inside the opposition box (12) of any player, created the most chances (four) and produced the most crosses on the pitch (nine). \"Rashford was brilliant,\" former Villa full-back Stephen Warnock said on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"He was involved in everything and everything that was good, was coming from him.\" Former Liverpool striker and two-time Champions League winner Daniel Sturridge admitted Rashford's performance was the kind that showed critics were wrong to write him off. \"The narrative before he came here was that he's not the same player any more,\" Sturridge told Amazon Prime. \"That was the narrative. He's proven everyone wrong. \"He has come here and shown everybody this is who I am, and this is how I play. This is what I can bring to the table.\" Emery has been rightly commended for turning Villa from relegation battlers into Champions League contenders since he was appointed in October 2022. But the Spaniard was questioned for making a wrong call against PSG, with his decision to replace Rashford with Ollie Watkins in the 76th minute appearing to disrupt Villa's momentum. \"I don't know what Unai Emery saw, with the way Marcus Rashford was playing, he got it wrong,\" Warnock added. \"It felt like the tempo dropped when he made that substitution. You need a goal - why are you taking a striker off?\" Moments before the substitution was made, Dublin added: \"Marcus Rashford is on fire tonight. You don't want to take him off.\" This video can not be played Emery \"proud of everything\" Villa achieved Rashford's loan spell comes with an option to buy for Â£40m. With just over a month of the season remaining, he and Villa have a decision to make over his future. However, Emery said nothing has been decided yet, and added: \"It depends on the circumstances for now and the next weeks.\" Watkins also likely has a big decision to make too. The England striker, who was the subject of a failed bid from Arsenal in January, has a decent return in the Premier League this season with 14 goals. But the 29-year-old has often found himself having to settle for a place on the bench this term and that was the case on Tuesday, which meant he has started just one of Villa's last six games. Watkins came off the bench to score against Southampton last weekend, after which he expressed his frustration at not starting more games. With a World Cup next year, he will need regular football to keep himself in contention for a place in the Three Lions squad. \"For me, I'm not happy to sit on the bench,\" he said after the Saints game. \"It's disappointing every game that I'm on the bench, but it's the manager's decision at the end of the day.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "UK conference on Sudan fails to set up contact group for ceasefire talks",
    "article_text": "A British-led attempt to establish a contact group to facilitate ceasefire talks inSudanfell apart on Tuesday when Arab states refused to sign a joint communique after a conference in London. The daylong argument between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emiratesover the communique represents a big diplomatic setback for efforts to end two years of civil war in Sudan. Hopes of a negotiated end to the conflict were further dimmed late on Tuesday when the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, declared the establishment of a government rivalling the army-backed administration. “On this anniversary, we proudly declare the establishment of the Government of Peace and Unity, a broad coalition that reflects the true face of Sudan,” Dagalo said in a statement on Telegram. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in two major refugee camps in Darfur in recent days, and millions have been displaced by the fighting. TheForeign Office said it was saddened that agreement on a political way forward had not been reached, but insisted progress had been made. In the absence of a final communique, the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, and his counterparts from France, Germany, the African Union and the EU issued a joint co-chairs’ statement pledging to support “efforts to find a peaceful solution and reject all activities, including external interference, that heighten tensions or that prolong or enable fighting”. The statement also called for a solution that did not lead to Sudan’s partition. Lammy had opened the conference with high hopes. “Many have given up on Sudan. That is wrong,” he said. “It’s morally wrong when we see so many civilians beheaded, infants as young as one subjected to sexual violence, more people facing famine than anywhere else in the world. “We simply cannot look away. And as I speak, civilians and aid workers in El Fasher and Zamzam IDP camp are facing unimaginable violence. “The biggest obstacle is not a lack of funding or texts at the United Nations, it’s lack of political will. Very simply, we have got to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians, to let aid in and across the country, and to put peace first.” His effort to persuade the Arab states to agree a set of diplomatic principles for a future contact group did not, however, bear fruit. Officials had said the conference did not constitute an attempt at mediation or aid-pledging, but instead intended to build greater political coherence about Sudan’s future among the many countries that have claimed a stake in the country. In a measure of the expanding, intractable and externally fuelled nature of the war, Lammy chose not to invite any of the principal Sudanese actors or members of civilian society. The conference’s objectives are set modestly at seeking agreement on an African Union-led international contact group, and renewed commitments to end restrictions on aid. The war, which erupted in April 2023, stemmed from a power struggle between Dagalo’s Rapid Support Forces and the army, led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The aim of establishing a contact group had been to persuade Middle Eastern states to focus on diplomacy rather than strengthening the warring factions. But from the start officials struggled to find neutral wording that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates could accept on Sudan’s future. Sudan and others have long accused the UAE of arming the RSF – which it strenuously denies – while Egypt has maintained close ties with the Sudanese army. Sudan’s government criticised the conference organisers for excluding it from the meeting while inviting the UAE. The UAE minister for political affairs, Lana Nusseibeh, who attended the conference, said both sides were committing atrocities and condemned the recent RSF attacks on displacement camps. She called for an unconditional ceasefire, the end to unconscionable obstruction of humanitarian aid, and a transition to an independent civilian-led government. The army and the RSF have both been accused of committing atrocities in the course of the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 13 million, and pushed large parts of the country into famine. Two refugee camps in Darfur, the site of a genocide in the 2000s, were captured in the past few days by the RSF as it seeks to take El Fasher, the only major population centre in Darfur not under its control. Lammy also announced an extra £120m in humanitarian aid from the depleted UK Foreign Office aid budget, enough to help deliver food to 650,000 people. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, released a further €125m (£105m) for Sudan and neighbouring states. At a separate event on Tuesday morning, aid and human rights groups called on the international community to punish the vast array of countries accused of either directly or indirectly sending arms to the warring parties in breach of a UN arms embargo. “The international community will have utterly failed if we have a conference today including those actively involved in the conflict and nothing comes from it again,” said Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch. “We need a coalition of states with the UK and the co-hosts at the front ready to say we are galvanising the necessary political momentum to protect civilians on the ground. “It is necessary that it is made clear that this cannot continue. The international community cannot sleepwalk into another genocide. They have international obligations to protect and respect international law.” However, neither side seems interested in discussing peace, and some fear the country is heading for a form of partition based around the current areas of control. The meeting comes against the backdrop of US cuts to its aid programme. Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice-president of global policy at the aid group Mercy Corps, said the nature of the US cuts meant it was hard to know how badly Sudan had been affected, but in her agency’s case, a lifeline for 220,000 people had been cut.",

    "title": "France expels 12 Algerian officials as row over alleged kidnapping escalates",
    "article_text": "France has expelled 12 Algerian consular and diplomatic officials and recalled its ambassador in Algiers, the French presidency said on Tuesday, in a retaliatory measure as a spat escalates between the two countries. “The Algerian authorities are responsible for the sudden degradation of our bilateral relations,” President Emmanuel Macron’s office said. Algiers has been protesting against France’s detention of an Algerian consular agent suspected of involvement in the kidnapping of an Algerian opposition activist. France later saidAlgeria had expelled 12of its diplomatic staff. France’s relations with its former colony have long been complicated, but took a turn for the worse last year when Macron supported Morocco’s position over that of Algeria over the disputed Western Sahara region. Last week the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, had said that ties between the two countries were returning to normal. The activist and influencer Amir Boukhors is a critic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than 1 million subscribers on TikTok, where he posts as Amir DZ. He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism, but France refuses to extradite him. In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, telling France 2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said. Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested worked for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris. Algeria has denied the official’s involvement in the kidnapping. In a separate source of tension between the countries, Macron has also called on Algeria to release Boualem Sansal, a 75-year-old writersentenced to five years in prisonfor “undermining the integrity” of the country. Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Sudan in ‘world’s largest humanitarian crisis’ after two years of civil war",
    "article_text": "Sudan is suffering from the largest humanitarian crisis globally and its civilians are continuing to pay the price for inaction by the international community, NGOs and the UN have said, as the country’s civil war enters its third year. The UK is hosting ministers from 20 countries in London on Tuesday inan attempt to restart stalled peace talks. However, diplomatic efforts have often been sidelined by other crises, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Two years to the day sincefighting erupted in Khartoumbetween the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, hundreds of people were feared to have died inRSF attacks on refugee campsin the western Darfur region in the latest apparent atrocity of a war marked by its brutality and wide-scale humanitarian impact. The consequences for Sudan’s 51 million people have been devastating. Tens of thousands are reportedly dead. Hundreds of thousandsface famine. Almost 13 million people have been displaced, 4 million of those to neighbouring countries. “Sudan is now worse off than ever before,” said Elise Nalbandian, Oxfam’s regional advocacy manager. “The largest humanitarian crisis, largest displacement crisis, largest hunger crisis … It’s breaking all sorts of wrong records.” There were “massive-scale” violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict, said Daniel O’Malley, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Sudan. “All of the civilian population, irrespective of where they are in the country, have basically been trapped between one, two or more parties. And they have been bearing the brunt of everything. The sheer numbers are just mind-boggling.” Last month, Sudan’s military recaptured thehighly symbolic presidential palacein Khartoum and it has retaken most of the capital. But in much of the country, the conflict rages on. Sources cited by the UN reported that more than 400 people had been killed in recent attacks by the RSF in Darfur, where the group is trying to seize El Fasher, the last state capital in the region not under its control. Since late last week, the RSF has launched ground and aerial assaults on El Fasher itself and the nearby Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps. A UN spokesperson told Agence France-Presse that the UN’s rights office had verified 148 killings and received reports from “credible sources” that the total number of dead exceeded 400. Reuters reported that data from the UN’s International Organization forMigrationsuggested that up to 400,000 people had been displaced from the Zamzam camp alone since the weekend. In a statement the UN rights chief, Volker Türk, said the “large-scale attacks … made starkly clear the cost of inaction by the international community, despite my repeated warnings of heightened risk for civilians in the area”. He added: “The attacks have exacerbated an already dire protection and humanitarian crisis in a city that has endured a devastating RSF siege since May last year.” El Fasher is one of several areas of Darfur where a famine, affecting about 637,000 people, has been declared. Almost half the 50-million population of Sudan – 24.6 million people – do not have enough food. Leni Kinzli, the World Food Programme’s head of communications for Sudan, said the other conflicts, as well as a lack of access for journalists, and Sudan’s relative international isolation since the days of the regime of the ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir all meant Sudan was not getting the attention it needed. “We don’t see the level of international attention on Sudan as we do for other crises,” she said. “There should not be a competition between crises. But unfortunately we’re seeing with everything going on in the world, other conflicts, other humanitarian crises and other things making headlines, that unfortunately Sudan is – I wouldn’t even call it forgotten – it’s ignored.” The origins of the war can be traced to late 2018, when popular protests broke out against the Sudanese dictator Bashir. Sudan’s army leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, allied with the RSF chief,Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a former warlord known as Hemedti, to oust Bashir in a coup in April 2019. They then allied again in 2021 to depose a civilian government meant to transition Sudan to a democracy. However, Hemedti had long coveted ultimate power for himself, and the friction between the two spiralled into full-on war less than two years later. The RSF, a paramilitary force that grew out of the Janjaweed Arab militiasaccused of committing genocidein the Darfur region in the mid-2000s, made rapid gains in the first weeks and months, as the fighting spread beyond Khartoum. In Darfur thousands of people died in the first year of the war, in well-documented attacks by the RSF and allied militias on non-Arab Masalit and other ethnic groups. Masalit refugees who had fled west to Chad recounted women and girls beingtargeted for gang rapesand boys shot in the street. Militia fighters said they wouldforce women to have “Arab babies”, according to a UN report released in November 2024. The RSF and the army have both been accused of committing war crimes in the course of the conflict. In January of this year the USformally declared that the RSF had committed genocide, marking the second time in less than 30 years that genocide had been perpetrated in Sudan. The United Arab Emirates has been accused of fuelling the conflict by arming the RSF.Emirati passports allegedly foundon the battlefield last year point to potential covert boots on the ground. The UAE has denied all involvement in the war. This article was amended on 15 April 2025. An earlier version featured maps which mislabelled the Central African Republic as Cameroon.",

    "title": "Judge rebukes Trump officials for not securing return of wrongly deported man",
    "article_text": "A federal judge sharply rebuked theTrump administrationand scolded officials on Tuesday for taking no steps to secure the return of a man wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, as the US supreme court had ordered in a contentious ruling last week. The US district judge Paula Xinis said that Donald Trump’s news conference with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, where the leaders joked that Kilmar Ábrego García would not be released, did not count as compliance. “To date nothing has been done,” Xinis said, a day after senior Trump officials also mounted an effort to sidestep the supreme court decision byoffering increasingly strained readingsof the order to claim they were powerless to bring back Ábrego García. The judge ultimately said she would require the administration to produce details under oath about its attempts to return Ábrego García to US soil in two weeks, an unusually expeditious timeline for discovery that indicated how she intends to move with the case. At issue at the hearing in federal district court in Maryland was the administration’s narrow reading of the supreme court order that compelled it to “facilitate” the return of Ábrego García, who was supposed to have been shielded from being sent toEl Salvador. The administration had earlier conceded Ábrego García’s deportation was an administrative error. But it has since taken the position that it is powerless to bring him back beyond removing domestic obstacles, and that courts lack the constitutional power to dictate the president to do more. The lead lawyer for the administration, Drew Ensign, also said in legal filings before the hearing that even if Ábrego García were returned to the US, the justice department would deport him to a different country or move to terminate the order blocking his removal to El Salvador. But the judge rejected the administration’s narrow reading of “facilitate”, noting the plain meaning of the word meant officials needed to secure Ábrego García’s release – and thatUS immigrationand customs enforcement had previously taken a number of positions on its meaning. “Your characterization is not bound in fact,” Xinis said. “I need facts.” The administration argued it had sought to comply with the supreme court’s order when Trump addressed the case and Bukele questioned whether he was supposed to smuggle Ábrego García across the border – which Ensign argued showed the matter had been raised at the “highest levels”. The judge appeared unimpressed by the argument. “It’s not a direct response,” Xinis said. “Nor is the quip about smuggling someone into the US. If you were removing domestic barriers, there would be no smuggling, right? Two misguided ships passing in the night.” Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion The judge told Ábrego García’s lawyers to prepare by Wednesday their questions for the administration about what steps it had taken. She said they could depose up to six officials, including Robert Cerna, a top official at Ice, and Joseph Mazarra, the acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security. “Cancel vacation,” Xinis told Ensign. “Cancel appointments. I’m usually pretty good about this in my courtroom, but not this time.” After the hearing, Ábrego García’s lawyer Rina Gandhi called the hearing a win but added they were not yet done. “We have not brought Kilmar home,” she told reporters, “but we will be able to question those involved and get information and evidence as required.” She also accused the administration of acting in bad faith. “This case is about the government unlawfully – and admitting to unlawfully – removing a gentleman from this country, from his home, his family, his children, and taking no actions to fix them as ordered by the supreme court,” Gandhi said.",

    "title": "Canadian universities report jump in US applicants amid Trump crackdown",
    "article_text": "More students living in the United States are applying to Canadian universities or expressing interest in studying north of the border asDonald Trumpcuts federal funding to universities and revokes foreign student visas. Officials at the University of British Columbia’s (UBC) Vancouver campus said the school reported a 27% jump in graduate applications as of 1 March from US citizens for programs starting in the 2025 academic year, compared with all of 2024. UBC Vancouver briefly reopened admissions to US citizens for several graduate programs this week with plans to fast-track applications from US students hoping to begin studies in September. University of Toronto,Canada’s largest university by number of students, also reported more US applications by its January deadline for 2025 programs, while a University of Waterloo spokesperson reported an increase in US visitors to campus and more web traffic originating from the United States since September. Gage Averill, UBC Vancouver’s provost and vice-president of academics, attributed the spike in US applications to theTrump administrationabruptly revoking visas of foreign students and increased scrutiny of their social media activity. “That, as a result, and especially as a result of the very recent crackdown on visas in the United States for international students, and now the development of a center that’s reading foreign students’ social media accounts,” Averill said. The administration hasfrozen hundreds of millions of dollarsin federal funding for numerous universities, pressing them to make policy changes and citing what it claims is a failure to fight antisemitism on campus. It has detained andbegun deportation proceedingsagainst some foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, while visas for hundreds of other students have been canceled – actions that have raised concerns about speech and academic freedoms in the US. At the same time, Canada has capped the number of international students allowed to enter the country for the second year in a row, meaning there may be fewer spots for US and other international students. Canada’s immigration ministry said it expects learning institutions to only accept the number of students they can support, including providing housing options. Provinces and territories are responsible for distributing spaces under the cap, the ministry said. The University ofToronto, considered an alternative to US Ivy League schools, said it was seeing a “meaningful increase” in applications from those living or studying in the US over previous years. University of Waterloo, which is known for its technical graduate programs and churns out top-notch engineering talent, said some faculties including engineering have seen increased interest and applications from students in the US. “We have seen an increase in US visitors to the UW visitors centre on campus, and web traffic that originates in the US has increased by 15% since September 2024,” a University of Waterloo spokesperson said. It did not specify whether these students were foreign students studying in the US or US citizens. Averill said UBC has seen only a modest 2% increase in undergraduate applications for this year’s programs, which closed around the time of Trump’s inauguration. However, interest appears to be growing, with campus tour requests from US students up by 20%. “We were concerned about the United States universities, our sister institutions in the US, who areunder enormous pressureright now,” said Averill, referring in particular to the Trump administration’s efforts to withhold funds from universities that continue with diversity and equity initiatives or study climate science. According to UBC’s annual report, the United States ranks as one of the top three countries for international student enrollment. Currently, about 1,500 US students are enrolled in both graduate and undergraduate programs at the university’s two campuses.",

    "article_text": "A Peruvian court has sentenced former president Ollanta Humala and his wife, Nadine Heredia, to 15 years in prison for laundering funds received from the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to finance Humala’s 2006 and 2011 campaigns. The judges of the national superior court found that Humala and Heredia received several million dollars in illegal contributions for these campaigns from Odebrecht and the government of the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez. The verdict makes Humala the third former Peruvian president to be imprisoned for corruption in the last two decades. He joins Alejandro Toledo,sentenced in 2024 to 20 years for Odebrecht-related crimes, and Alberto Fujimori, whoreceived multiple convictions for corruption and human rights abuses. The trial began in 2022, and alongside the 62-year-old former military officer and his 48-year-old wife, the court convicted eight others. Both Humala and Heredia were held in pre-trial detention from 2017 to 2018 at the prosecutor’s request to prevent their flight. Odebrecht’s 2016 admission ofwidespread bribery across Latin Americapreceded the initial investigations against Humala, which started in 2015, a year before the company’s revelations. Most of the presidents who have governed Peru since 2001 have faced legal problems due to their connections with Odebrecht. Toledo is currently imprisoned, while the former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is under house arrest. Alan García, who served two non-consecutive terms,died by suicide in 2019 as authorities moved to arrest him in connection with Odebrecht bribes. In addition to former presidents, prominent figures such as the former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori and numerous ex-governors are also under investigation.",

    "article_text": "The US attorney general Pam Bondi declined on Tuesday to say whether Donald Trump’s suggestion of removing US citizens to El Salvador was legal, in alarming remarks about what experts think is an obviously illegal idea. Trump proposed the idea on Monday in the Oval Office during a visit with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who has been accepting people deported from the US and imprisoning them in a gigantic facility notorious for human rights abuses. The US president said “homegrown criminals that push people into subways, that hit elderly ladies on the back of the head with a baseball bat when they’re not looking” could be sent to El Salvador and imprisoned. Asked by the Fox Newshost Jesse Watters if the idea was legal, Bondi demurred. “These are Americans who he is saying have committed the most heinous crimes in our country, and crime is going to decrease dramatically because he has given us a directive to make America safe again,” she said. “These people need to be locked up as long as they can, as long as the law allows. We’re not going to let them go anywhere, and if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it.” Trump has previously said he “loved” the idea of deporting US citizens to El Salvador. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has said Trump “simply floated” the idea. During a White House briefing on Tuesday, Leavitt was asked whether it was legal to deport US citizens to Central American prisons. “It’s a legal question that the president is looking into,” she said, adding that Trump was only considering the action for those Americans “who are the most violent, egregious repeat offenders of crime”. Lawyers and other experts say the idea is clearly illegal. “There is no provision under US law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,” the University of Notre Dame professor Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert,told Reuters.

    "article_text": "A 19-year-old Venezuelan in New York City reportedly was apprehended by Trump administrationimmigrationauthorities and deported to El Salvador despite agents’ realizing he was not whom they meant to arrest in a targeted operation. Merwil Gutiérrez, whose family opened an asylum case after arriving in the US, was deported from the Bronx to the notorious Cecot prison in El Salvador despite his relatives’ insistence that he has no gang ties or criminal history, according toDocumented, a newsroom dedicated to telling the stories of immigrants in New York City. The Gutiérrez family says it has been left without information or answers. The teen was detained alongside 237 other Venezuelans on 24 February by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). His father, Wilmer Gutiérrez, told Documented: “I feel like my son was kidnapped. “I’ve spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.” The elder Gutiérrez reportedly said he overheard Ice agents saying that his son had not been the person they had come to get. “The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building. One said: ‘No, he’s not the one,’ like they were looking for someone else. But the other said: ‘Take him anyway,’” he recalled. Gutiérrez has no criminal record either in Venezuela or the US, his family said. He also did not have any tattoos, which is a feature that US law enforcement often use to link people to the Tren de Aragua gang – a transnational criminal organization from Venezuela – and to justify their expulsions from the country. Despite this, Gutiérrez was arrested and later deported toEl Salvador, to which he has no ties. Wilmer Gutiérrez says he discovered through a news report that his son had been deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. He watched videos on social media that showed detainees facing harsh conditions, such as having their heads shaved by authorities and being marched to their prison cells.

The president of El Salvador said in a meeting with Trump on Monday that the Salvadoran government wouldnot order the returnof Abrego García to the US. Monday’s meeting at the White House came amid a broader push by the Trump administration to remove noncitizens from the US, including peoplewho are here legallyand have not been charged with crimes. Trump has also openly stated that he would like toremove US citizenswho commit unspecified violent crimes and send them to the same Salvadoran prison as Abrego García and Gutiérrez.",

    "title": "UK trade secretary to visit China with aim of reviving key joint trade commission",
    "article_text": "The trade secretary,Jonathan Reynolds, will travel to Beijing to revive a key trade dialogue with China despite saying it had been naive to allow Chinese investment in sensitive sectors, the Guardian has learned. Reynolds is scheduled to travel toChinalater this year for high-level talks in an effort to boost bilateral trade and investment. His trip is intended to restart the UK-China joint economic and trade commission (Jetco), which has not met since 2018 whenrelations began deterioratingafter Beijing’s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong. In documents published after Rachel Reeves’strip to Chinain January, the Treasury set out its intention to revive the talks. The government is also planning to conclude itscross-Whitehall audit of UK-China relationsby June, although the results will not be published in full. The audit fulfils a Labour manifesto commitment and is expected to make a number of policy recommendations, including a call to improve expertise on China within government. This could include Mandarin language programmes, and training for civil servants and parliamentarians about the Chinese system. The Foreign Office declined to comment. Reynolds’s trip will raise eyebrows after he said on Sunday that the UK had “got it wrong in the past” and Conservative governments had been “far too naive” about allowing Chinese investment in sensitive industries such as steel. The government has also come under pressure to take a tougher stance towards Beijing over human rights and security concerns.In an article for the Guardian on TuesdayWera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP who was refused entry to Hong Kong to visit her grandchild last week, said that “until we get a clear answer for why I was deported, no government minister should be visiting China on official business”. Hobhouse said she believed she was denied entry “because of my role as a British parliamentarian, and one who haslevelled criticism at Beijingfor its human rights abuses”. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Ministers seized control of British Steel’s Scunthorpe steelmaking plantfrom its Chinese owners, Jingye, on Saturday amid a rapid deterioration in relations with the company’s executives. Some inside the government suspect Jingye’s actions may have been intended to stop Britain producing its own virgin steel and force it to rely on imports from China. “You’ve got to be clear about what is the sort of sector where actually we can promote and cooperate and ones, frankly, where we can’t,” Reynolds told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector.” He argued that even privately owned firms had direct links to the Chinese Communist party, said “a lot of UK-Chinese trade is in non-contentious areas” such as agriculture, life sciences and the automotive sector. He appeared to moderate his comments about the steel industry on Tuesday, telling broadcasters that he would look at Chinese firms “in a different way” without ruling out their involvement completely. Reynolds’s planned trip is a signal that the government does not intend to row back on its rapprochement with Beijing. Keir Starmer is also expected to visit China later this year. Asked in October whether the UK would revive the Jetco, Reynolds said he was “certainly open to having a conversation” about it. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak both drew up plans to do so while they were in office. The Guardian revealed this week that ministers were consideringtargeting parts of the Chinese stateunder new foreign influence rules. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said: “We are taking a consistent and strategic approach to our trade relationship with China, engaging in areas of trade that benefit the UK’s national interests.”",

    "title": "China reportedly orders its airlines to halt Boeing jet deliveries amid US trade war",
    "article_text": "China has reportedly ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries ofBoeingjets, the latest move in its tit-for-tat trade war with the US. The Chinese government has asked carriers to stop purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies, according to a Bloomberg News article, which cited people familiar with the matter. The order was reported to have come after the country raisedits retaliatory tariffs on US goods to 125%on Friday in response to Donald Trump’s levies on Chinese importstotalling 145%. Beijing was also said to be considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs. About 10 Boeing 737 Max jets are being prepared to join Chinese airlines, and if delivery paperwork and payment on some of them were completed before Chinese ”reciprocal” tariffs came into effect, the planes may be allowed to enter the country, sources told Bloomberg. The restriction marks a serious blow for Boeing and other manufacturers trying to navigate the escalating trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. The group chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, has said his company could delay taking deliveries of Boeing aircraft if they become more expensive. He told the Financial Times that Ryanair was due to receive a further 25 aircraft from Boeing from August but would not need the planes until around March or April 2026. “We might delay them and hope that common sense will prevail,” O’Leary said. Shares in Boeing have been buffeted by worries about the impact of trade tariffs, as well as complaints from some shareholders that the company has underinvested in its engineering. The company has lost 7% of its market value since the start of the year, and in March its chief financial officer, Brian West, said tariffs could hit availability of parts from its suppliers. The rival European plane manufacturer Airbus said on Tuesday that it was watching the evolving situation on trade tariffs. Its chief executive, Guillaume Faury, told shareholders the company was having problems receiving components from the American supplier Spirit AeroSystems, which was weighing on the production of its A350 and A220 jetliners. The chaotic introduction of Donald Trump’s tariffs has triggered volatility in the stock market since 2 April, although there has been a tentative recovery this week after the US president announced he was temporarily suspending planned tariffs on imports of smartphones and laptops. The S&P 500, the American blue-chip index of stocks, ticked up 0.7% in early trading on Tuesday, but was still down about 7% so far this year. There remains a great deal of uncertainty around possible tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical imports, with the Trump administration initiating an investigation into the impact of trade in these areas on American national security. Meanwhile, the chip designer Nvidia has announced it will build up to$500bn (£378bn) worth of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the USover the next four years. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index rose by 0.8% on Tuesday and South Korea’s Kospi by 0.9%, withstrong gains for carmakers such as Honda, Suzuki and Hyundai, after Trump signalled there would be help for the industry. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion On Monday the president told reporters in Washington he was “looking at something to help some of the car companies”, and added that carmakers “need a little bit of time” before they can start to build parts in the US rather than in countries such as Canada and Mexico. The US administration previously announced a 25% tariff on all imports of foreign cars, excluding some exemptions for Mexico and Canada. Analysts at the advisory firm Telemetry predicted the move could result in 1.8m fewer car sales in the US and Canada this year. Shares also rose in Europe, with London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index and the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 rising by 0.8% and 1% respectively after optimistic comments from the US vice-president, JD Vance, about apossible trade deal with the UK. In an interview on Tuesday with the website Unherd, Vance said he believed both sides could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. “We’re certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer’s government” on a trade deal, he said. “There’s a real cultural affinity. And, of course, fundamentally, America is an Anglo country. I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries.” Boeing was approached for comment.",

    "title": "China’s Xi aims to ‘screw’ US on south-east Asia tour, says Trump",
    "article_text": "Xi Jinping’s tour of south-east Asia this week is probably intended to “screw” the United States,Donald Trumphas suggested, as Xi embarks on a five-day tour of some of the nations hardest hit by Trump’s tariffs. China’s presidentvisited Hanoion Monday, where he met the leader of Vietman’s Communist party, Tô Lâm, called for stronger trade ties and signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on enhancing supply chains, before heading to Malaysia. Reacting to theVietnammeeting, Trump said the discussions were focused on how to harm the US, but he didn’t hold it against the two countries. “I don’t blame China; I don’t blame Vietnam,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “That’s a lovely meeting. Meeting like, trying to figure out: ‘How do we screw the United States of America?’” Vietnam, a major industrial and assembly hub, is among countries in south-east Asia that are reeling from some of themost punitiveof Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, hit with a rate of 46%. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, for which it is a crucial source of everything from footwear and apparel to electronics. In the first three months of this year, its exports to Washington amounted to $31.4bn, while Hanoi imported goods worth about $30bn from Beijing. Xi’s visit to Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia this week comes as Beijingfaces tariffs of 145%, and as other countries seek to negotiate reductions in their tariffs during a 90-day reprieve. Xi’s trip to Hanoi offered anopportunity to consolidate relationswith a neighbour that has received billions of dollars of Chinese investments in recent years, as China-based manufacturers moved south to avoid tariffs imposed by the first Trump administration. InMalaysiaon Tuesday, the Chinese leader said he was looking forward to “further deepening the traditional friendship” between the two countries. “China will work with Malaysia … to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical and camp-based confrontation, as well as the countercurrents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi wrote in an article for Malaysia’s The Star newspaper. Xi had planned to travel to the region before Trump’s tariff announcement, but the visit was fortuitously timed, with the Chinese leader positing China as a stable trading partner, in contrast to the chaotic policy backflips coming out of Washington. In an article in Nhân Dân, the newspaper of Vietnam’s Communist party, Xi wrote that there were “no winners in trade wars and tariff wars” and that protectionism “leads nowhere”. In a meeting with Vietnam’s prime minister, Pham Minh Chính, Xi said the two countries should oppose unilateral bullying. Vietnam and many other south-east Asian countries are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China amid fears the region could be used as a potential dumping zone for Chinese exports barred from the US. Phan Xuan Dung, a research officer in the Vietnam studies programme at ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “If past patterns hold, it would be reasonable to expect that Vietnam might seek to balance this significant Chinese engagement with comparable diplomatic outreach to the United States or other partners in the coming months.” Escalating tensions between the US and China have fuelled concerns about a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies, a fear the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, sought to dispel on Monday. “There’s a big deal to be done at some point,” Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV. There did not “have to be” decoupling, he said, “but there could be.” One of China’s lead officials overseeing Hong Kong hit out at the US on Tuesday over its trade war. Xia Baolong said in a televised speech that the dispute was “extremely shameless” and aimed to “take away Hong Kong’s life”. Hong Kong is subject to the same tariffs imposed on mainland China but has not proposed any of its own in retaliation. Xia said China was not “afraid of trouble”. “Let those peasants in the United States wail in front of the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,” he said, possibly in reference toJD Vance’s recent criticism. China-US tensions appear to have shifted some trade war battles to other fronts. Xi has sought further US-excluded cooperation with the EU, and in Latin America the US is pushing governments to reduce their financial ties with China. Bessent said he had met the Argentinian president, Javier Milei, on Monday, telling Bloomberg the Trump administration was focused on helping Latin American countries avert what he called “rapacious” agreements made with China to give up mining rights in return for aid. Beijing’s embassy in Argentina accused Bessent of “maliciously slandering and smearing” China and told the US to refrain from “obstructing and deliberately sabotaging” developing countries. The White House had appeared to dial down the pressure recently,listing tariff exemptionsfor smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronic products for which China is a major source. But Trump and some of his top aides said on Sunday the exemptions had been misconstrued and would only be temporary. “Nobody is getting ‘off the hook’ … especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

    "title": "Peter Dutton’s nuclear power plan could lead to major electricity shortages, analysis says",
    "article_text": "Peter Dutton’s plan to build less renewable energy and keep Australia’s coal plants running longer has overestimated the reliability of ageing generators and could lead to major electricity shortages, according to a new analysis. TheCoalitionhas pledged to put taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven sites around Australia and has pointed to modelling by Frontier Economics that shows the country’s ageing coal fleet would need to take up the slack in electricity generation while they are built. But the Institute forEnergyEconomics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said the modelling had assumed the ageing coal plants would be able to generate between 72% and 81% of their capacity, much higher than previous plants that were near the end of their life. The IEEFA report looked at the 13 coal plants to have closed since 2000 and found in the 10 years before they were turned off, they were only available on average 66% of the time due to unplanned outages and the need for increased maintenance. When IEEFA adjusted the Coalition’s numbers between 2034 and 2043 to account for what it said was a more realistic estimate of the coal fleet’s capabilities, it found a shortfall of 9,300 gigawatt-hours a year – the equivalent of the power consumed by 2 million households. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Johanna Bowyer, lead analyst on Australian electricity at IEEFA, said failing to account for the poor performance of an ageing coal fleet would risk unexpected coal outages “and a system that hasn’t been built to account for them”. Tristan Edis, a co-author of the report and analyst at Green Energy Markets, said the average age of a coal plant when it retired was 42 years. “Over the 2030s, the existing coal-fired power stations will be close to, or have exceeded, the age at which past coal plants typically retired. “We should be planning for the likelihood that they will suffer a similar deterioration in their availability.” Areport commissioned by the Climate Council last yearlooked at data from 2014 to 2024 and found coal plants less than 40 years old were available for 81% of the time, dropping to 65% in their later years. Edis said if a future government was forced to rely on more gas generation to fill the gaps, this would burn between 49 and 93 petajoules of gas annually from 2034 to 2043.Edis said: “This is a large amount of additional gas considering the average amount of gas used for electricity generation over the past five years was 122PJ per year. “This additional gas requirement would have serious consequences for the price and availability of gas for other consumers.” The modelling backed by the Coalition assumed the first nuclear reactor would be producing power by 2036, with further plants coming online from 2039 onwards. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Many energy experts, including the CSIRO, have been less optimistic, saying it could take until the early 2040s before a plant could be operating,and possibly longer. The IEEFA report said four nuclear plants recently brought online in Europe and the United States had seen delays of between six and 14 years – an average delay of 11 years. Bowyer said: “If we have an 11-year delay with the nuclear build, we would see a huge energy supply gap. Filling that gap with new generation becomes really tricky and extending those coal plants even further just exacerbates the risk [of them becoming less reliable].” Guardian Australia approached Frontier Economics for comment. A statement from the Coalition said Labor’s renewables-based approach was “forcing the premature closure of coal generation – well before their notified closure dates”. “Proper maintenance can ensure coal plants are not closed prematurely. The Coalition’s approach, based on comprehensive and evidence-backed modelling, ensures that coal continues to play a crucial role in Australia’s energy mix, both now and in the future.” The Frontier modelling was a “realistic and comprehensive view”, the statement said, of the maintenance costs for coal plants “while recognising the ongoing importance of coal in maintaining grid stability during the energy transition”. “Labor talks about phasing out coal, but behind closed doors they are cutting deals with the states to keeping them online.”",

    "article_text": "Worldwide consumption ofwinefell in 2024 to its lowest level in more than 60 years, the main trade body has said, raising concerns about new risks from US tariffs. The International Organisation of Vine andWine(OIV) said on Tuesday that 2024 sales fell 3.3% from the previous year to 214.2m hectolitres. The OIV, whose report was based on government figures, said this would be the lowest sales figure since 1961, when sales were 213.6m hectolitres. Production is also at its lowest level in more than 60 years, having fallen 4.8% in 2024 to 225.8m hectolitres. The OIV’s statistics chief, Giorgio Delgrosso, said the wine industry had been hit by a perfect storm as health concerns drive down consumption in many countries and economic factors added to troubles. “Beyond the short-term economic and geopolitical disruptions, it is important to consider the structural, long-term factors also contributing to the observed decline in wine consumption” the IOV’s annual report said. The OIV said the consumer was now paying about 30% more for a bottle now than in 2019-20 and overall consumption had fallen by 12% since then. In the United States, the world’s top wine market, consumption fell 5.8% to 33.3m hectolitres. Delgrosso said tariffs ordered by the US president, Donald Trump could become “another bomb” for the wine industry. Sales in China remain below pre-Covid levels. InEurope, which accounts for nearly half of worldwide sales, consumption fell 2.8% last year. In France, one of the key global producers, 3.6% less wine was consumed last year. Spain and Portugal were among the rare markets where consumption increased. The OIV said production had been hit by environmental extremes such as above-average rainfall in some regions and droughts in others. Italy was the world’s top producer with 44m hectolitres, while France’s output fell 23% to 36.1m hectolitres, its lowest level since 1957. Sign up toFeast Recipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews. Get our best food writing every week after newsletter promotion Italy is also the biggest wine exporter and its trade increased because of the popularity of sparkling wines such as prosecco. Spain produced 31m hectolitres, while US wine output fell 17.2% to 21.1m hectolitres, mainly because of extreme heat. The OIV could not predict if consumption would take off again and industry players, such as the French chain of wine shops Nicolas, say there is a “generational” fall in drinking. “People do not drink in a festive way any more and young people consume less than their parents,” the company said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. However, “people drink less, but better”, Nicolas said, and so are ready to spend more.",

    "article_text": "The United States has removed sanctions on a close aide of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the state department said, adding that the punitive measures had been “inconsistent withUS foreign policyinterests”. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, spoke on Tuesday with his Hungarian counterpart, the foreign minister Péter Szijjártó, and informed him of the move, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. “The Secretary informed Foreign Minister Szijjarto of senior Hungarian official Antal Rogán’s removal from the US Department of the Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, noting that continued designation was inconsistent with US foreign policy interests,” Bruce said. The two also discussed strengthening US-Hungary alignment on critical issues and opportunities for economic cooperation, Bruce said. Orbán and his Fidesz party have been among Donald Trump’s most vocal supporters inEurope. Joe Biden’s administrationimposed sanctions on Rogánon 7 January over alleged corruption, in a move that Budapest pledged to challenge once Trump returned to the White House on 20 January. Rogán is a close aide of Orbán and has run his cabinet office since 2015. “Throughout his tenure as a government official, Rogán has orchestrated Hungary’s system for distributing public contracts and resources to cronies loyal to himself and the Fidesz political party,”the US treasury department said at the time. Accusations of corruption and cronyism have dogged Orbán since he came to power in 2010, while Budapest’s relations with Washington became increasingly strained during Biden’s presidency, due in part to Budapest’s warm ties with Moscow despite the war in Ukraine.

    "title": "Russia jails four journalists for alleged links to Alexei Navalny anti-corruption group",
    "article_text": "A Russian court has convicted four journalists of extremism for working for an anti-corruption group founded by the late opposition leaderAlexei Navalnyand sentenced them to five and a half years in prison each. Antonina Favorskaya, Konstantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty of involvement with a group that had been labelled as extremist. All four had maintained their innocence, arguing they were being prosecuted for doing their jobs as journalists. The closed-door trial was part of a crackdown on dissent that has reached an unprecedented scale since Moscowsent troops into Ukrainein February 2022. The authorities have targeted opposition figures, independent journalists, rights activists and ordinary Russians critical of the Kremlin with prosecution, jailing hundreds and prompting thousands to flee the country. Favorskaya and Kriger worked with Sota Vision, an independent Russian news outlet that covers protests and political trials. Gabov is a freelance producer who has worked for multiple organisations, including Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has done work for western media outlets including the Associated Press. The four journalists were accused of working with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which wasdesignated as extremist and outlawed in 2021in a move widely seen as politically motivated. Navalny was Vladimir Putin’s fiercest and most prominent critic and relentlessly campaigned against official corruption in Russia. Navalnydied in February 2024in an Arctic penal colony while serving a 19-year sentence for several charges, including running an extremist group, which he had rejected as politically driven. Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she wrote on abuse Navalny had faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants’ cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping to organise Navalny’s funeral. Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution had failed to prove them. “I understand perfectly well … what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,” Gabov said in the statement. “Independent journalism is equated to extremism.” Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict. The journalists’ lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict, which Kriger’s lawyer, Yelena Sheremetyeva, described as illegal and unfair. “The profession of a journalist in itself is not extremism,” said Irina Biryukova. “And based on the case materials that are available, I will say that in our opinion, there is no evidence that they committed any crimes, or even minor offences.” She said the four were “holding up” and were “happy that so many people came”. The Russian human rights group Memorial designated all four as political prisoners, among more than 900 others held in the country.",

    "title": "Millions tune in for three-week live stream of Sweden’s moose migration",
    "article_text": "Most of the time, nothing much happens. A wide Nordic river, melting snow still lining its banks,meanders peacefully through a pristine forestof spruce and pine. But this spring, as every spring for the past six years, a lot of people will be glued to it. WhenDen stora älgvandringen– variously translated as The Great Moose Migration or The Great Elk Trek – first aired on the public broadcaster SVT’s on-demand platform in 2019, nearly a million people tuned in. Last year, it was 9 million. This year, who knows? Given the state of the world, a three-week-long, round-the-clock live stream of a few hundred moose gingerly crossing the Ångerman River in northernSwedento reach their summer pastures could be just what viewers need. The show’s latest edition launched a full week early on Tuesday because of warmer than usual spring weather. “There are a lot of moose about,” the producer, Stefan Edlund,told SVT. “They’re waiting for us. We’ve had to adjust. But it should be OK.” The programme’s 15-strong crew, working out of a control room in Umeå, 400 miles (600km) north of Stockholm, had already laid most of their 20,000 meters of cables and positioned their 30-plus remote video and night vision cameras, Edlund said. Which is just as well, because the show’s fans are more than ready. Ulla Malmgren, 62, said she had stocked up on coffee and pre-cooked meals for the duration so she did not miss a moment. “Sleep? Forget it. I don’t sleep,” she said. Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, told the Associated Press she loved the thought that there were “about a million people” watching “all saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!’” Another fan, William Garp Liljefors, 20, said he had been known to be late for class while the show was on. “I feel relaxed, but at the same time I’m like, ‘Oh, there’s a moose. Oh, what if there’s a moose? I can’t go to the toilet!’” he said. The show – and its success – are part of a growing trend for “slow television” that some argue was pioneered by the late US pop artist Andy Warhol, whose 1964 film Sleep showed the poet John Giorno sleeping for five hours and 20 minutes. More recently, the concept took off with the Norwegian broadcaster NRK’s pre-recordedBergensbanen,which showed, minute by minute, a seven-hour train journey from Bergen to Oslo with archive footage to enliven time spent in the line’s 182 tunnels. About 20% of Norway’s population tuned in at least once to that. Two years later, roughly half the country’s 5.5 million people watched at least some of NRK’s coverage – live and non-stop, this time – of a 134-hour sea voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes. Since then the broadcaster has aired at least one slow TV show a year, including 18 hours of salmon swimming upstream, 12 hours of firewood burning, 24 hours of academic lectures on the constitution and a 12-hour knitting marathon. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Broadcasters in Spain, Portugal, France,the UK,Australiaand elsewhere have followed suit. In Utrecht, in the Netherlands, alive stream from an underwater cameraallows viewers to ring a virtual doorbell and let spawning fish through a lock gate. Slow TV shows something happening at the rate it is experienced, rather than speeded up through plotting and editing. Its attraction, media experts say, seems to lie precisely in the soothing absence of staged tension and drama. “It becomes, in a strange way, gripping, because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,” said Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden. “But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.” Espen Ytreberg, a professor of media studies at the University of Oslo, has likened slow TV to a sort of window or “escape valve” from the medium’s usual frenetic pace. “Just when did we come to accept that television should be this accelerated, busy, intense, in your face thing?” he wondered – appropriately, almost a decade ago – in aninterview with CBS. “But at some point, that became the norm.” Just occasionally, of course, stuff does happen. SVT even sends a push alert when the first moose shows up on The Great Moose Migration, and runs an on-screen counter showing how many have managed to cross the river, which is wide and can be perilous. Last year, the programme’s cameras captured 87 making it safely across. Some do get into difficulties. Undeniably, though, viewers are, most of the time, staring at sky, water and trees. Maybe a duck or two. Wait, is that a moose?",

    "title": "Nato chief in surprise Ukraine visit as US fails to condemn Sumy attack – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Mark Rutte makes unannounced visit to Odesa and tells Zelenskyy that ‘Nato support is unwavering’ Speaking inOdesa,Ruttestrongly condemned the Russian attack on Sumy as “simply outrageous” and “part of a terrible pattern ofRussiaattacking civilian targets and infrastructure,” as he assuredZelenskyyof Nato’s continued support. In a statement,published in the last few minutes by Nato, he said that “Ukraine’s people deserve real peace– real safety and security in their country. In their homes,” and said he wanted to use his visit to “affirm … this simple message:Nato stands with Ukraine.” “I also know that some have called Nato’s support into question in the last couple of months. Butlet there be no doubt. Our support is unwavering,” he said. He said in his remarks that he spoke with Zelenskyy about “the important talks that president Trump is leading withUkraineas well as with Russia to try to end the war and secure a durable peace.” He acknowledged that “these discussions are not easy– not least in the wake of this horrific violence –but we all support president Trump’s push for peace.” “So let me say again – to the people of Ukraine: We stand with you. And look forward to a day that the brave men and women of this incredible country can enjoy freedom without fear,” he said. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, for today. Nato secretary generalMark Ruttemade a surprise visit to Odesa in Ukraine to meetVolodymyr Zelenskyyand reaffirm the alliance’s support for Ukraine after recent “outrageous” attacks by Russia (15:52,15:59,16:06), amid growing concerns about the US administration’s unwillingness to criticise Russia for recent attacks in Sumy with reports it refused to sign a G7 statement on the strike (9:23and15:48). TheEuropean Unionwarned that“significant joint efforts will be needed”for a successful outcome to trade talks at the end ofDonald Trump’s90-day pause on tariffs (12:35), with European Commission spokesperson admitting that the bloc would need “an additional level of engagement from the US to keep the ball rolling forward” (12:46). France’snational terrorism officelaunchedan investigationinto a wave ofapparently coordinated attacks at multiple prisons across the countrybelieved to be linked to a government clampdown on drug traffickers (11:07,11:12,13:22andstory). A group ofSerbian studentswere on the final approach toStrasbourgfinishingtheir epic 1,300km cycling trip to draw the European Union’s attention to mass protests in the countryagainst alleged corruption among political leaders (10:51,10:56,18:33). And that’s all from me,Jakub Krupa,for today. If you haveany tips, comments or suggestions,email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at@jakubkrupa.bsky.socialand on X at@jakubkrupa. I was hoping to bring you one final update onthe Serbian students cycling to Strasbourgbefore we close the blog today but they appear to be slightly delayed and still some 25 kilometers out from their finish line,according to their live tracker. Their ETA has been updated to 7.30pm local time. The good news is thatthere appears to bea big welcome partywaiting for themwhen they reach Strasbourg… We now have a bit more detail onUkraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy’scomments about that meeting on Black Sea security in Turkey involving Ukraine, the UK, France and Turkey (16:26). Reuters reported that Zelenskyy, speaking alongside Nato secretary generalMark Rutte, said “this is a military meeting on security in the Black Sea, first of all, a coalition of the willing, appropriate steps.” Reuters noted it was not immediately clear whether meetings were already ongoing. “There are already quite a few such meetings, in various formats,” Zelenskyy added. “Turkey has in 2022 already successfully agreed a ceasefire when it came to a greater grain deal … let’s be positive on the fact that Turkey, again, tries to bring together all relevant parties, And let’s hope they are successful,” Rutte said. “We are talking about the presence of a contingent at sea, and we believe that Turkey can have a serious place in future security guarantees for the sea,” Zelenskyy said. “This is not about ending the war, this is about what will happen after the ceasefire – security guarantees.” On a different note, today marksthe 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration campby British forces on 15 April 1945 and our Athens correspondentHelena Smithspoke with one of the survivors,Lola Hassid Angel. For a long time, Lola Hassid Angel did not want to talk about the horrors of her childhood. Her experiences of the second world war had not been light: by the age of eight, theHolocaustsurvivor had “reached adulthood”, seen things she should never have seen, heard sounds she should never have heard, been confronted by terrors she could neither forgive nor forget. Which is why the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen by British forces on 15 April 1945 is as much a cause for joy as for the horror to come flooding back. “But it’s also different,”Angel, now 88 and a great-great-grandmother, admitted over tea in her apartment in Athens.“Now I want to tell the whole world what happened. And that’s because I want all these men who lead us to know what war really looks like.The Germans had a zeal for death; they had turned it into a science.” Read Helena’s story here: You can also readRichard Nelsson’scompilation of how the Guardian’sDavid Woodward,Manchester Guardian war correspondent, covered these events in 1945. And we recently reviewedSam Mendes’sdebut documentaryWhat They Found,which combines two precious artefacts held at the Imperial War Museum in London: 35mm film, shot bySgt Mike LewisandSgt Bill Lawrieof the British Army Film and Photographic Unit, before and during the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near the town of Celle in northern Germany in April 1945 and audio interviews given by the cameramen in the 1980s. By their own admission, Lewis and Lawrie are not prepared for what is inside the camp gates, having only heard rumours about what the Nazis have been doing to Jews and other minorities. A little like viewers of this film who may have read and heard about theHolocaust, but who have not before encountered moving images of the unique terror of Belsen, what Lewis and Lawrie are about to see will change them and stay with them for ever. The official commemoration of the liberationwill take place on 27 April. We are also getting more lines fromZelenskyy, as he revealed thatrepresentatives ofUkraine, the UK, France and Turkey are meeting in Turkey today to discuss Black Sea security. And in the last few minutes,Ukraine’smilitary said that it had hit a base belonging to theRussianrocket brigade that conducted the missile attack onSumyon Sunday. “(A base) of the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers was hit, a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded. The results of the strike are being clarified,” the military said ina statement on Telegram, Reuters reported. Ukraine’sVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid ina social media postthat the pair “visited a hospital where Ukrainian defenders are recovering from their wounds,” and spoke with some of the soldiers. “I am grateful to our guys for their strength, resilience, and for protecting our people,” he said. Separately, the Ukrainian president spoke withNato’s Rutteaboutthe country’s “acute” neeed for air defence systems and missiles, AFP reported. Zelenskyy also spoke about the importance of the UK-French-led “reassurance force” being ready “fast enough” to helpUkraine, the agency said. Speaking inOdesa,Ruttestrongly condemned the Russian attack on Sumy as “simply outrageous” and “part of a terrible pattern ofRussiaattacking civilian targets and infrastructure,” as he assuredZelenskyyof Nato’s continued support. In a statement,published in the last few minutes by Nato, he said that “Ukraine’s people deserve real peace– real safety and security in their country. In their homes,” and said he wanted to use his visit to “affirm … this simple message:Nato stands with Ukraine.” “I also know that some have called Nato’s support into question in the last couple of months.

And look forward to a day that the brave men and women of this incredible country can enjoy freedom without fear,” he said. And in the last few minutes, Nato secretary generalMark Rutterevealed he made an unannounced trip to Odesa in Ukraine to meet withVolodymyr Zelenskyy. In a post on social media, he said he reassured Zelenskyy thatNato’s support remained “unwavering”andthe alliance would “continue to help Ukraineso it can defend today and deter future aggression.” Here is his post in full: Today I visited Odesa along with @ZelenskyyUa. Ukraine’s people have endured so much - not least Russia’s Palm Sunday attack on Sumy. Nato support is unwavering. We will continue to help Ukraine so it can defend today and deter future aggression, ensuring a just and lasting peace. I will bring you more lines from Rutte soon. In the latest example of US presidentDonaldTrump’srather lenient response to Russian actions,Bloomberg (£) is now reportingthatthe US declined to endorse a G7 statement condemning Russia’s attack on Sumy over the weekendas it feared it could derail peace negotiations on Ukraine. The attack on Palm Sunday killed at least 34 and injured over 110 people. But diplomatic sources told Bloomberg that the US administration “told allies it couldn’t sign the statement denouncing the attack asit is working to preserve the space to negotiate peace.” In his only public comments on the attack, Trump said he had been told that the Russians had“made a mistake”in the strike on Sumy. Giorgia Meloni’sinfluence overDonald Trumpis to be put to the test when the pair reunite in Washington on Thursday for their first bilateral summit. She is the first European leader to meet Trump since he paused some of his planned tariff hikes last week. The summit will be closely watched. On one hand,it is an ideal opportunity for Meloni to demonstrate an affinity with Trump, with whom her natural political tendencies lie, while boosting her credentials as a conduittowards more meaningful dialogue. On the other, it will bea delicate balancing act for the prime minister,who also knows she must becareful to maintain her allegiance to Italy’s EU partners. Behind the scenes, the president of the European Commission,Ursula von der Leyen,and Meloni are understood to have discussed a gameplan. Still, the solo trip has caused anxiety among EU allies, with the French industry minister,Marc Ferracci, warning last week that it threatened to undermine European unity against the US tariffs. Their concerns are not without reason. Meloni, a former Eurosceptic, defended a blistering attack against European values by Trump’s deputy,JD Vance, at the Munich Security Conference in February. She will be back in Rome on Friday to meet Vance, who is in Italy for the Easter weekend. Read the analysis in full: Earlier today, I brought youthe latest on the fragile state of the EU-US trade talksin Washington. On Thursday, Italian prime ministerGiorgia Meloniwill try a different tactic as she goes to Washington for talks with US presidentDonald Trump, who has (so far) been more receptive to interventions from individual national leaders rather than the EU as a whole. So let’s go to our Rome correspondentAngela Giuffridafor her analysis… Elsewhere, French presidentEmmanuel Macronwill bestow awards on around 100 craftspeople and officials who helped restoreNotre Dameto its former glory after a fire nearly destroyed the beloved Paris cathedral six years ago, AFP reported. The ceremony at the Élysée Palace will take place from early Tuesday evening, around the same time the devastating fire broke out at the Gothic masterpiece in 2019. AFP noted that Macron will honourPhilippe Jost, who headed the public organisation tasked with restoring the cathedral and was elevated to the rank of “commander” of the Legion of Honour, France’s highest national award. Jost succeededJean-Louis Georgelin, the general who had been put in charge of overseeing the restoration but who died in 2023. Georgelin was conferred with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, the highest rank of the award established by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The architectsRemi FromontandPhilippe Villeneuvewill also be decorated. Alongside them,nearly 100 civil servants, entrepreneurs and craftspeoplewill be awarded the Legion of Honour or the National Order of Merit, another top award established by Charles de Gaulle. They represent around 2,000 people who took part in the restoration of the cathedral. They come from “all the trades” and include carpenters, ironworkers, scaffolders, rope access workers, organ restorers and stained glass artisans, the French presidency said. TheSerbianstudents cycling towardsStrasbourgthat we reported on earlier today (10:51and10:56) are now back on the move on the final stage of their journey. You canfollow their finish live here– they are currently passing through a small town ofDurmersheimin Germany, near the French border. TheEuropean Commissionis consideringplans that would allow European companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without paying penalties to Moscow, it has been reported. Citing three officials with knowledge of the plan, the Financial Timesreported(£) that the commission was studying the possibility ofallowing companies to declare force majeure, which would absolve importers of their obligations to pay penalty fees for ending contracts. The plans arereported to be part of a roadmap on how the EU will rid itself of Russian fossil fuels by 2027, a document scheduled to be published on 6 May, following repeated delays. A commission spokespersondeclined to comment. Full story: Back toFrance,the country’s national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said it had taken charge of the investigation into attacks on several French prisons overnight that we reported earlier (11:07). Reuters said that France’s DGSI national security agency will also be involved into the investigation into the attacks, the prosecutor said. … and more than 1,200 people have signeda petition,launched by academics at Budapest’sEötvös Loránduniversity,protesting against the Hungarian government’s ban on public events by the LGBTQ+ community. On Monday, Hungary’s rightwing populist government, led byViktor Orbán,voted througha constitutional amendment backing the ban, in what rights campaigners described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to chip away at human rights. The university remains committed to inclusion, the petition noted. “As university lecturers and researchers, we protest against this curtailment of basic rights,” it said. It also sought tohighlight the worrying precedent set by the ban.“The government’s spurious claim, all too familiar from history, to protect our children sets the stage for the curtailment of the freedom of assembly of arbitrarily designated groups – in the first instance LGBTQI communities – as well as their surveillance and punishment.” Staff at the internationally renowned university had decided to speak out as “many of our students and staff rightly feel threatened by discriminatory, arbitrary legislation and stigmatisation,” the petition noted. The signatories said they would work to ensure that students or employees belonging to the LGBTQ+ community would feel free to speak up when it comes to matters concerning themselves or the wider university community. “It is especially important to take this responsibility at a time when our institutions and communities are under increasing government pressure and similar attacks are taking place in other countries,” the petition said. Rights campaignershave calledon theEuropean Commission to launch a procedure against the Hungarian government, arguing that the legal changes – believed to be the first of their kind in the EU’s modern history – are a breach of EU law. (Asked about the next steps at the commission’s briefing, Hrncirova said she could not offer any timeline on this process. – Jakub) Separately, European Commission spokesperson on equalityEva Hrncirovawas asked about the executive’s view on the Hungarian constitutional amendment passed yesterday that campaigners described as a “significant escalation” in the government’s efforts to crack down on dissent and chip away at human rights. She said the EU was“obviously aware” of the amendment, butneeded time to “analyse the changes, because [they] cover several topics and we need to look at them very carefully to be able to see them from the perspective of the European law.” Yesterday’s vote prompted further protests inBudapestagainst the decision, so let me bring you some pictures from that protest, and… And on trade talks with theUS,the European Commission’strade spokespersonOlof Gilljust told reporters thattheEUneeded “an additional level of engagement from the US to keep the ball rolling forward.” “Our offers are still clearly and plainly on the table, zero for zero tariffs on industrial products, including cars, and we’re willing to look at a range of other areas,” he said. Responding to Trump’s comments that the EU “have got to come to the table, and they’re trying to,” Gill said: “Mr President,we are at the table,”as he rejected the suggestion that the EU exploits the US by saying “the facts do not support this claim.” Pushed on what is being discussed, he said that – despite Trump’s longstanding frustration with EU regulations – “EU standards, particularly as they relate to food, health and safety,are sacrosanct.” “That’s not part of the negotiation.It never will be, not with the US, not with anyone else,” he said. He also added that“our regulation that applies to technology and digital markets, that’s not up for negotiation.” These comments will particularly resonate with the US as there is growing anticipation that the EU should announce its first enforcement against Apple and Meta under the Digital Markets Act in the coming days and weeks.",

    "title": "‘It’s sheer terrorism’: Sumy buries dead after Russia’s Palm Sunday attack",
    "article_text": "On a warm spring day relatives gathered to say goodbye to Viktor Boiko and his wife, Olha. Their open coffins were laid out next to one other. Viktor wore his best suit. Olha was in a flowery blouse, with carnations heaped around her slippered feet. A priest sang prayers. Gravediggers lowered the couple into the ground, and shovelled earth on top. It landed with a percussive thud. “Give me a weapon. Any weapon. I want to kill those butchers in Moscow,” said Viktor’s brother-in-law Anatolii Prykhodko, as his wife stood sobbing next to him. “They have murdered so many people. Adults, kids, peaceful citizens. If you lose a house or a car in a war, you can get it back. If you lose a person, a loved one, they are gone for ever.” On Sunday morning, the Boikos were on their way to church to celebrate Palm Sunday. Like most hard-up pensioners, they went by public transport. A ride costs eight hryvnia (15p). Their bus, No 62, was driving down Petropavlivska Street in the centre of Sumy, north-easternUkraine. On either side were elegant buildings belonging to Sumy state university. It was 10.23am. A Russian Iskander missile carrying cluster munitions plunged down from the sky, exploding next to the bus. Shrapnel engulfed the Boikos, other passengers and people in the street strolling past cafes and shops. The couple died instantly. Another missile hit the university’s conference centre, 200 metres away, punching through its glass atrium and balcony. Rescuers saw an apocalyptic scene. Bodies lay sprawled on the ground, cars burned, smoke billowed. The blast ripped a hole in the university’s economics and business department. It blew out the windows and wooden doors from the 19th-century institute of applied physics across the road. Fragments flew through the institute’s garden, shredding tulips and roses. The spot was a popular backdrop for wedding photos. On Tuesday, people visited the scene to lay flowers as firefighters perched on a shattered roof. “It was Palm Sunday, a holiday, a day off,” one Sumy resident, Tetyana, explained. “The weather had recently warmed up and people were on their way to church. We have a tradition in Ukraine that we buy willow branches.” She added: “This is a huge sorrow for the whole city. We are grieving. In my opinion this isn’t an act of war. It’s sheer terrorism.” Among the dead were two children. One was 11-year-old Maksym Martynenko, who died with his parents, Mykola and Natalia. There were cuddly toys at the spot where he perished, including a bear and a hippo. Someone had left a plastic football with “To Max” written on it. The organist at Sumy’s philharmonic concert hall, Olena Kohut, was killed nearby on her way to a rehearsal. Other victims were students, teachers, a notary and the bus driver. Sumy is situated a mere 16 miles (25km) from the Russian border. It is home to soldiers and civilians. Residents are used to frequent drone and rocket attacks, and to the constant wail of air raid sirens. Sunday’s double-tap strike, though, was terrible. It was the most egregious Russian attack this year, leaving 35 dead and 129 injured. Eleven people remain in a critical condition. There are 15 wounded children. Asked for his reaction, Donald Trump appeared to downplay the latest Russian atrocity, calling it “a mistake”. Subsequently, he blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and Joe Biden, the previous US president, by falsely claiming they “started” the war with Russia. Serhii Khvostov, the head of the damaged conference centre in Sumy, was unimpressed. “Trump is a mistake. This is an act by stupid and angry Russians. There’s no logic to it,” he said. “It’s easy to look away. But the world has to understand what is happening here.” Khvostov gave a tour of the ruined building. The missile blew a four-metre hole in the ground floor and careened into the basement, a community theatre space. A children’s show was due to take place there at 11am, shortly before the attack. Jagged pieces from the Iskander missile landed amid prepared sandwiches, costumes and a collection of puppets, including a dragon and Kermit the Frog. Large holes dinted the venue’s black walls. “It was a miracle nobody was killed,” Khvostov said. After hearing the explosion, he called the centre’s elderly security guard. There was no answer, so he ran to the building. The guard was concussed but OK, and had managed to drag one of Khvostov’s colleagues from the administration’s office, pushing him out of a broken window. A cleaner also survived. No one else was inside. Several people drinking coffee from a mobile kiosk were injured. On Tuesday, staff swept away glass, ducking to avoid dangling bits of ceiling. Khvostov’s office was a mess. There were broken computers and desks and a toppled-over safe. “We can’t find the key,” he said. “It’s too early to say if this place can be rebuilt. I hope so.” Outside, a JCB digger scooped piles of debris into a lorry. A tow truck removed a damaged car. Its owner, Tetyana, said: “My windows blew in and my neighbour was hurt. I gave her a tourniquet.” The theatre’s founder and director, Volodymyr Niankin, said one of his friends was planning to leave Sumy due to the attack. Niankin said he himself would stay, to take care of his ailing grandmother. Of Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, he said: “I think they are stupid old men. They are representatives of a past cold war generation, when it was just the US and the USSR. It seems their plan is to divide up the world between them.” At the institute of applied physics, a clean-up was under way. Volunteers tidied the flowerbeds. The explosion damaged a chandelier in an upstairs lecture room and a charcoal portrait of a Sumy physicist, which had been hanging in a corridor. A whiteboard with an equation on it survived unscathed. Next to the entrance, a Quartz wall clock had stopped at the exact moment of impact: 10.23am and 40 seconds. Serhii Lebedynskyi, a senior researcher, examined his smashed office with his wife, Yulia. A shelf of physics books was covered in a layer of thick dust. Ornate plasterwork on the ceiling had disappeared. “We were planning to go into town with our small son on Sunday morning. He decided he didn’t want to leave the house. This probably saved us. We heard an enormous bang,” Lebedynskyi said. He added: “For more than 10 years the Russians have behaved like terrorists.” An American volunteer, Karl Ahlgren, said the Russians had known exactly what they were doing when they fired two missiles into a crowded city centre. “What Trump says is atrocious and unconscionable,” he said. “It’s clear he listens to Russian propaganda. I don’t know if it comes from Vladimir Putin or from [Trump’s special envoy] Steve Witkoff. There was no mistake here. The second strike was meant to kill rescuers.” On Tuesday, Ukraine’s armed forces carried out a form of revenge. The country’s military said it had successfully hit the headquarters of a Russian missile brigade responsible for Sunday’s carnage. “[A base] of the 448th missile brigade of the Russian occupiers was hit, a secondary detonation of ammunition was recorded. The results of the strike are being clarified,” it said in a statement. Back at Sumy’s cemetery, a gravedigger spoke fondly of Kohut, describing her as a talented and popular organist. “She was my friend. A very democratic person. She treated everyone the same way, whether you were important or not,” Valeriy Rodenko said. Rodenko said he had worked for seven years as a carpenter at the city’s philharmonic concert hall. “I got to know Olena well. She was a wonderful person. A bright spirit,” he said. He put down his spade and broke down in tears.",

    "title": "Trump envoy demands Iran eliminate nuclear programme in apparent U-turn",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has announcedIranmust totally eliminate its nuclear programme, seeming to reverse the policy he had articulated on Fox News only 12 hours earlier that would have allowed Iran to enrich uranium at a low level for civilian use. The switch to a more hardline policy is likely to make it much harder for the US to reach a negotiated agreement with Tehran, bringing back the threat of an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. In a further switch, it was agreed that the next round of indirect US-Iran talks, due to start on Saturday, will continue to be in Oman and the venue would not switch to Italy as proposed by the US. In astatement posted to social media on TuesdayWitkoff said: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal. Any final arrangement must set in place a framework for peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East – meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponisation program. It is imperative for the world that we create a tough fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” The previous day on Fox News, the special envoy had said “the conversation with the Iranians” would concern uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes. “In some circumstances they are enriching at 60% and at others at 20%. That cannot be,” he said. “You do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear programme where you are enriching past 3.67%. This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme and then ultimately verification on weaponisation – that includes the type of missiles they have stockpiled there and the trigger for a bomb.” Witkoff’s two positions are hard to reconcile – unless he is trying to distinguish between an interim deal that reduces Iranian uranium enrichment to civilian levels and a final agreement that eliminates its nuclear programme entirely. It also possible Trump has faced a backlash from Iran hawks who warned that Witkoff’s negotiating stance was largely re-establishing the nuclear deal Barack Obama had agreed with Iran in 2015, from which Trump withdrew the US in 2018 saying it was unenforceable. Witkoff’s apparent volte face may also be seen as another example of chaotic foreign policymaking, in which the administration battles behind the president’s back and he either does not focus on the policy details or does not understand the choices he is allowing to be made on his behalf. Witkoff, a man with no diplomatic experience and charged with producing diplomatic breakthroughs in Gaza, Ukraine and Iran, has never tried to portray himself as anything than Trump’s messenger. He would have thought the proposals he aired in the weekend talks in Oman and on Fox News were those of the president. Iran has repeatedly demanded the right to maintain a civil nuclear programme, meaning the latest iteration of US thinking will cause consternation in Tehran and could strengthen hardliners, who maintain the US cannot be trusted. A rare consensus had broken out in Tehran that the talks between Witkoff and the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, could result in some US sanctions being lifted as part of the most positive development in relations between Iran and the US in a decade. The head of the UN nuclear inspectorate, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit Iran this week to see if progress can be made on improving his inspectors’ access to Iran’s nuclear sites.",

    "title": "One person killed and several wounded in Israeli attack on Gaza hospital",
    "article_text": "One person has been killed in an Israeli missile strike on a hospital in Gaza, just as the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, was making a visit to the war-torn territory. The attack on Tuesday occurred two days after another major hospital was targeted, fuelling warnings from the UN that the humanitarian crisis inGazais now the worst it has been since conflict began. According to medical staff, the latest strike hit the entrance to the Kuwaiti field hospital in al-Muwasi, near the city of Khan Younis. One security guard died and nine medics were wounded. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are living in the area, mostly in ragged makeshift tents alongside sand dunes. They left their homes after Israeli forces resumed conflict and seized swathes of southern Gaza, including Rafah City, which Palestinians are banned from entering. On Tuesday, Netanyahu made a rare visit to Gaza. Israeli forces have continued their air and ground offensive in the territory since the collapse of the ceasefire in March. The visit was confirmed by the prime minister’s office, who said he had visited troops in northern Gaza. Just two days previously, an Israeli missilepartly destroyed al-Ahli hospital, which was the only facility still providing critical care in northern Gaza. Doctors said the blasts had left the hospital barely operational and unable to carry out surgeries or accept patients. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said he was “deeply alarmed” by the attack, and stressed that hospitals were protected under international humanitarian law. Israel has repeatedly targeted hospitals in Gaza over the past 18 months, alleging that they are used by Hamas to conceal terrorist activities. Israeli forces claimed al-Ahli was being used as a “command and control” centre by Hamas, an allegation the group denied. Paramedics carrying out rescue operations in Gazahave also been targeted. Doctors working in Gaza warned that the situation for provision of medical care was at breaking point. Dr Mohammad Zahir, an emergency doctor at Indonesia hospital, said that if the aid blockade continued, severely ill children, cancer and kidney patients would soon die. “We are living through a severe crisis alongside the broader humanitarian catastrophe,” said Zahir. “Inside the hospital, there is not only a lack of resources, but a massive shortage of essential medicines and medical supplies. There is also a shortage of ambulances, medications for chronic illnesses and cancer patients, surgical supplies, and even hospital beds – all due to the ongoing closure of the border crossings.” The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said the situation in Gaza was “likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities”. Since the collapse of the ceasefire with Hamas, Israel has blocked all aid to the territory since 2 March, resulting in critical shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. Staff at Nasser hospital, one of the largest in Gaza – which is only partially functional after beinghit in an airstrike last month– reported running out of gauze and burn creams this week. It is the longest period that Israel has denied aid to Gaza. Human rights groups said the tactic – meant to put pressure on Hamas to releasing the remaining hostages it holds – amounted to a war crime. Raeda Hijazi, living in a tent in the humanitarian zone in western Gaza with her four children, said they regularly survived only on salt and bread and had no choice but to drink contaminated water. “There is no fuel to purify or pump water, and even the available food is contaminated,” she said. “Vegetables are completely unaffordable. I cook using burning plastic, even though I know it contains carcinogenic substances, but there’s no alternative. Insects are everywhere in the tents due to the garbage accumulating in the streets. Words are not enough to describe the suffering.” Khetam abu Ouda, 49, living in Abasan al-Kabira, east of Khan Younis, said he and his family had been displaced 20 times since the start of the war. They recently returned to the rubble of their home but were sharing it with 30 other displaced people and feared that as water was running out, they would soon have to move again. He said said aid groups were no longer distributing food. “The closure of crossings will lead to a slow and gradual death for the people here unless a radical solution is reached and the war is stopped,” said Ouda. Israel has also resumed its airstrikes and ground operations in Gaza, displacing about 400,000 people and leading to a surge in civilian casualties, with 1,600 killed since March alone. Speaking to Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, an unnamed security official claimed the strategy was working and would force Hamas to agree to a deal on the hostages. “The military pressure is having an impact,” said the official. “They have a shortage of gas and the food and the fuel will run out in a few weeks. The big achievement of the residents’ return to the northern Gaza Strip has been erased. That’s rattled them.” Pressure has been mounting on Netanyahu’s government to secure the release of the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Thousands of former and reservist soldiers, as wellas over 250 former Mossad agents, gave their backing to a letter calling for an end to the war, accusing Netanyahu of putting the lives of the hostages at risk for his own political gain. As Israel launched more missiles in Gaza on Tuesday, a Hamas armed wing spokesperson said on Telegram that they had lost contact with the group holding Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who has been held captive in Gaza for more than 550 days, after a “direct strike” on his location. Alexander had appeared alive and agitated in a Hamas propaganda video released over the weekend in which he accused the “disgusting Israeli government” of deserting him and said he was “collapsing mentally and physically”. Reports emerged this week that Israel had put forward a ceasefire deal with Hamas that included releasing half of the living hostages. However, on Tuesday a Palestinian source told the BBC that Hamas had rejected the deal as it did not include a commitment to end the war or withdraw IDF forces from Gaza. Israeli’s offensive in response to the attacks by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October 2023 has now claimed 51,000 lives, according to the Gaza health ministry. The count does not differentiate between civilians or combatants but women and children make up more than half of the dead. This month, agroup of UN expertssaid Israel’s actions in Gaza were leading to the “destruction of Palestinian life”. “If they are not killed by bombs or bullets, they slowly suffocate for lack of basic means of survival,” they said. “The only difference is the means and speed of death.”",

    "title": "The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timeline",
    "article_text": "At 4.20am, a Red Crescent ambulance on its way to collect people injured by an airstrike in Rafah comes under Israeli fire in Hashashin. Two paramedics are killed. One survivor, Munther Abed, is detained and interrogated. A few hours later, a convoy including ambulances, a fire truck, health ministry vehicles and a UN car is dispatched to recover the bodies of the two paramedics. It also comes under fire. Two health ministry vehicles drive away but contact is lost with the rest of the convoy. Two ambulances sent from Rafah also disappear. Six days earlier, Israel had ended a two-month-old ceasefire and resumed its military campaign against Hamas and other militant groups inGazawith heavy aerial bombing and ground operations. Gaza’s civil defence agency says it has not heard from the missing people. Access to the site is blocked by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). A convoy of vehicles carrying officials from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) tries and fails to access the site. While en route, the Ocha team see a woman being shot, the bullet hitting her in the back of the head, and a man who is trying to retrieve her also being shot. The woman’s body is recovered and put into a UN vehicle. The Ocha team finally make it to the site. They report finding the ambulances, the UN vehicle and the fire truck crushed and partially buried. The body of a civil defence worker is recovered from under the fire truck, but the recovery mission has to withdraw as the situation becomes unsafe. The civil defence agency says it has accessed the site and found the body of its team leader there, as well as an ambulance and the Red Crescent’s fire truck, which it says has been “reduced to a pile of scrap metal”. Ocha officials and Red Crescent workers return to the site and find the bodies of eight Red Crescent workers, the five other civil defence responders and one UN staff member buried in a mass grave. A ninth Red Crescent worker remains unaccounted for. The crushed UN vehicle and the fire truck can be seen in photographs taken at the scene. In a video filmed at the scene, Jonathan Whittall, the head of Ocha in Palestine, says the dead wereshot “one by one”and then buried in a mass grave. The burials are postponed pending autopsies. The head of Ocha, Tom Fletcher, says the dead were found buried by their wrecked and well-marked vehicles. “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives,” Fletcher says. “We demand answers and justice.” The IDF claimsits soldiers opened fireon the vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals” and alleges, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. None were reported to be in the mass grave. Two witnesses tell the Guardianthat some of the bodies recovered from the grave had had their hands or feet tied, suggesting they were shot after being detained. ARed Crescentofficial says Israeli soldiers could be heard – over a phone line that was open to one of the paramedics at the time of the convoy shooting – ordering restraints to detain apparent survivors from the convoy. A forensics consultant who examined five of the bodies says there isevidence of execution-style killingin some cases based on the “specific and intentional” location of shots taken at close range. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, says Gaza has become the world’s most dangerous place for humanitarian workers and calls for those responsible for the killings to be held accountable. The Israeli military says it is investigating the killings. It maintains that “terrorists” were advancing in the ambulances. Abed, the survivor,tells the Guardianhe was detained and beaten and had to watch as one ambulance and rescue vehicle after another approached the scene and came under intense gunfire. He says he witnessed the wreckage being buried by military bulldozers, and that he saw the missing Red Crescent worker, Assad al-Nsasrah, alive and in Israeli detention. Abed says that after several hours of Israeli interrogation he was released and left to walk homewards. Footage emergesthat contradicts the official Israeli version of events. Found on the phone of one of the victims, which had been buried with his body, andfirst published by the New York Times, it shows a convoy of ambulances and a fire truck driving along a dirt road, clearly marked with official insignia and with their red and blue emergency vehicle lights flashing. TheIDF admits in a press briefingthat its first version of events was “mistaken” and says it is launching a thorough investigation, though the unnamed military briefer sticks to its insistence that “there were terrorists” at the scene of the incident. No evidence to support the claim is presented. The brother of one of the paramedic victims, Saleh Moamer,tells the Guardianthere were “marks from restraints on Saleh’s wrists where the Israeli army had bound him”. The Red Crescent says autopsies conducted on those killed on 23 Marchshow they were shot in the upper bodywith “intent to kill”. Germany, one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe, calls for a full investigation of the incident. IDF confirms that the soldiers involved in the incident were from its Golani Brigade. At the time, the brigade was under the control of the Armoured 14th Brigade, whose commander, Brig Gen Yehuda Vach, is reported by Haaretz to have told troops “there are no innocents in Gaza”. In a video of Golani troops being briefed before their redeployment to Gaza earlier this month, aired by Israel’s Channel 14, a battalion commander tells the soldiers: “Anyone you encounter there is an enemy. You identify anyone, you eliminate him.” A senior military intelligence sourcetells the Guardianthat Unit 504, a military intelligence team with a reputation for cruelty and reckless behaviour including torture, was also present during the attack. The International Committee of the Red Cross says Nsasrah, the missing paramedic, ,is being detained in Israel. The ICRC adds that it has not been able to visit him.",

    "title": "Iran expected to resist US plan to move uranium stockpile to third country",
    "article_text": "Iran is expected to resist a US proposal to transfer its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to a third country – such as Russia – as part of Washington’s effort to scale back Tehran’s civil nuclear programme and prevent it from being used to develop a nuclear weapon. The issue, seen as one of the key stumbling blocks to a future agreement, was raised in the initial, largely indirect, talks held in Muscat, Oman, between Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, and Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Iran is arguing the stockpile, amassed over the past four years, should remain in Iran under the strict supervision of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran sees this as a precaution, or a form of insurance in case a future US administration withdraws from the agreement, as Donald Trump did in 2018 when he rejected the 2015 deal brokered by Barack Obama. Tehran says that if the stockpile was to leave Iran and the US pulled out of the deal, it would have to start from scratch in enriching uranium to higher purity – effectively punishing Iran for a breach committed by Washington. Although the bulk of the exchanges in Muscat were held indirectly between the Iranian and US delegations, with Oman acting as the intermediary, direct meetings between Witkoff and Araghchi also took place. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, has agreed to host the next round of talks on Saturday in Rome, in a move seen as a political gesture by Trump towards Italy. It also serves to marginalise the main European powers in the Iran negotiations, with Oman continuing to act as the mediator. The US vice-president, JD Vance, will also be in Rome over the Easter weekend. During the initial nuclear talks in 2015, Italy felt it was excluded from the process, with France, Germany and the UK – the so-called “E3” – representing European interests at the talks. Mohamed Amersi, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: “Meloni is an interesting choice since Meloni seems to be the European leader that has the best personal line to Trump, more than France, Germany and the UK. If Italy hosts the meeting it begs the question of the future role of the E3 in the US-Iran dialogue.” Iran is negotiating under the threat of not just further sanctions but a potential military attack on its nuclear sites by the US. With the Iranian economy in decline, Tehran is eager to attract direct investment by lifting US sanctions. Discussions have already started on potential insurance options for companies looking to invest in Iran, in case of a further breakdown in US relations. After the 2018 withdrawal and the imposition of sanctions on foreign companies trading with Iran, the EU was unable to devise a viable way of protecting businesses that wanted to invest in Iran. Trump has so far excluded other aspects of the US-Iran relationship from the talks, such as Tehran’s “destabilising regional behaviour”, a decision that has confounded both Israel and anti-regime hawks in Washington. The US may seek some form of Iranian assurance that it will not use its influence to interfere in the sovereignty of other states. Iran, however, argues it is Israel making land grabs in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. Iran’s influence in the region has been weakened by the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Israel’s assaults on Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and US attacks on Yemen. Iran’s oil export fleet is also facing increasing sanctions pressure from the US president.",

    "title": "Wealthiest English private schools spend below 6% on means-tested bursaries, research finds",
    "article_text": "England’s wealthiest private schools devote only a fraction of their income towards means-tested bursaries, according to research that undermines claims thatadding VAT to school feeswould decimate support for poorer pupils. ThePrivate Education Policy Forum(PEPF), a thinktank campaigning for greater equality and transparency among independent schools, gathered data from more than 200 leading schools and found they spent less than 6% of their total fee income on supporting pupils based on family income. While independent schools argue that they support tens of thousands of pupils with assistance, the PEPF found that much of the support at the schools it examined was not means-tested, and included discounts for siblings attending the same school, fee rebates for children of staff, and sports or music scholarships. As a result, the PEPF said, much of the fee remission given by those private schools may not go to genuinely disadvantaged children. A spokesperson for the PEPF said: “This research shows that these private schools channel very little of their income into providing an education for those who cannot afford their fees, now £16,000 a year on average. “Despite increases in fees above inflation, we can see from the report that some private schools have not hugely increased their spending on bursaries for poorer children. Half of reduced fees are not means-tested on family income at all, the research shows. “This is not a good enough performance from a sector wishing to claim it is charitable and motivated by the public good, and which argues it should retain VAT tax relief despite the rest of the country having to considerably tighten its belt.” The PEPF said many private schools did not publish details of their bursaries and scholarships, meaning that the larger schools it surveyed might not be representative of the sector. Its figures found that in 2022-23, the schools gave £224m worth of means-tested support, and £185m in unassessed support. TheIndependent Schools Council(ISC), which represents 60% of England’s 2,400 private schools, said its figures showed that £1bn in fee assistance by its members was divided between both forms of assistance. The £494m devoted to means-tested support in 2023 was 32% higher than in 2012 after adjusting for inflation. An ISC spokesperson said: “This report takes an unrepresentative sample of independent schools and starts from a baseline of one of the most anomalous years schools have ever seen. “There is a good conversation to be had – one we are keen to participate in – about bursaries and how independent schools could more effectively target them. Sadly, this research adds absolutely nothing to that conversation.” After Labour announced it would add VAT to school fees, a string of private school leaders said they would beforced to cut backon financial assistance. The PEPF’s research uncovered considerable variation in means-tested support between schools with similar fee incomes, some spending £500,000 and others up to £5m a year. There was also variation in the number of full means-tested bursaries, with Manchester grammar school remitting the full fees of one in 10 pupils. “Of course there are notable exceptions among some private schools but overall this charitable sector is not proving very impressive when it comes to genuinely helping ordinary and poorer families,” the PEPF said.",

    "title": "Reform a ‘racist and far-right’ party, says teaching union after Farage attack – as it happened",
    "article_text": "NEU leader says union is ‘living rent free’ in Farage’s head after the politician accused him of ‘poisoning the minds of our kids’ The largest education union in the country,the National Education Union(NEU), has called Reform UK a “racist and far-right” political party. Reform – led byNigel Farage- has been neck and neck with Labour and ahead of the Tories in some recent polls and will contest nearly all the 1,600 council seats up for re-election on 1 May. Delegates at the annual NEU conference called for the union’s political fund to be used to help campaign against Reform UK election candidates whose policies and campaigns were described as “racist”, according to the PA news agency. A motion, which was passed by delegates at the conference on Tuesday, said it believes Reform UK is racist because of its hardline policies on immigration and its “campaigns against migrants”. It added that organisations like Reform UK “seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. Speaking to the media at the union’s annual conference in Harrogate in North Yorkshire,Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said: “I think there’s an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform. I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.” Speaking about Farage specifically, Kebede added: I’m surprised that our union seems to be living rent free in his head, to be honest. But this is just lifted directly from the Donald Trump playbook. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been directly attacking the AFT and the NEA, the American teachers’ unions, and this is what Nigel Farage is. He’s a pound shop Donald Trump. When asked about the union’s stance on Reform UK at a press conference in County Durham on Tuesday afternoon, Farage accused the NEU leader of being a “self-declared Marxist” who he claimed was determined that “children should be poisoned at school” about everything to do with the country. The UK’s largest teaching union has calledReform UK“far-right and racist”, and its leader has dismissed Nigel Farage as “a poundshop Donald Trump,” as the union pledged funds to oppose the party’s candidates in elections.Delegates to the National Education Union’s annual conference backed a motion stating that “far-right and racist organisations, including Reform, seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. Nigel Farage has said Reform UK’s are “parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’” in a speech ahead of May’s local elections in England.He claimed that Labour had become a middle-class party and abandoned the roots it was founded for, saying “our support is coming directly from people who have been, in many cases, lifelong Labour voters. “Reform are parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’”, he said. “Today’s the first day I’ve said that but I absolutely mean it, and we’re here, and we’re here to stay. And the evidence is that people who are switching to us, this is not a short term protest. They actually believe in us.” The business secretary has refused to rule out redundancies at the Scunthorpe steelworks, despite calls from trade unions to end the programme of job losses started by its former owners.Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday the plant might need to have a “different employment footprint” after the government’s takeover, even as he promised to try to save the plant’s two blast furnaces. Foreign secretary David Lammy has said it is “morally wrong” to give up and turn away from the violence in Sudan, and committed the UK government to £120m worth of additional support.Opening a conference on the topic at the Foriegn Office in London, he said he personally had “refused to turn away”, saying it was wrong for people to “conclude that further conflict is effectively inevitable” because of “the country’s fraught history.” Business and trade minister Sarah Jones has insisted that funds to rescue theBritish Steelplant in Scunthorpe has already been budgeted for, and is “within the existing fiscal envelope”.Speaking on Tuesday morning on Times Radio, the Labour MP for Croydon West said: “We have been really clear on steel that securing the future of the site in Scunthorpe is not just important for the 2,700 people who work there, but also because we know that demand for steel in the UK is growing. We know there’s a market there.” Ed Davey has called on China to release the tapes of the interrogation of a Liberal Democrat MP who was denied entry to Hong Kong to visit her family.The party leader also urged foreign secretary David Lammy to summon the country’s ambassador to Britain to demand an explanation for Wera Hobhouse’s deportation, saying the UK should not be “kowtowing” to Beijing. Ministers have announced an overhaul of the way carer’s allowance overpayments are checked in an attempt to fix the failing system which has left thousands with life-changing debts,fines and criminal records.In a significant policy change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been ordered to hire extra staff to investigate 100% of the carer’s allowance earnings breach alerts it receives and swiftly notify carers if they are at risk of falling into debt. Keir Starmer’s Labour party faces a very difficult electoral test in the bellwether Scottish parliament seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in June, after Reform UK confirmed Nigel Farage will make a rare campaigning visit to Scotland.It emerged today a byelection will be held there on 5 June after the unexpected death last month of its widely respected MSP, Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat for the Scottish National party for 14 years. McKelvie, who had been fighting secondary breast cancer, had already announced she would stand down before the Holyrood elections next year. The business secretary has refused to rule out redundancies at the Scunthorpe steelworks, despite calls from trade unions to end the programme of job losses started by its former owners. Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday the plant might need to have a “different employment footprint” after the government’s takeover, even as he promised to try to save the plant’s two blast furnaces. Reynolds was speaking during a visit to Immingham docks to oversee coal and iron ore being unloaded on its way to the Scunthorpe plant. The governmenttook controlof the plant after finding out its Chinese owner, Jingye, was attempting to sell the supplies and hasten the closure of the furnaces. “What we need for the long-term future ofBritish Steelis that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme,” Reynolds said. The UK’s largest teaching union has calledReform UK“far-right and racist”, and its leader has dismissed Nigel Farage as “a poundshop Donald Trump,” as the union pledged funds to oppose the party’s candidates in elections. Delegates to the National Education Union’s annual conference backed a motion stating that “far-right and racist organisations, including Reform, seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. The motion also committed the NEU to use its political fund for campaigns against Reform election candidates and to support the union’s branches in local activity. Speakers in favour of the motion argued that some Reform UK candidates and activists “have been former members of fascist organisations or espoused their views” as justification. Daniel Kebede, the NEU’s general secretary, told journalists: “I’m sure Reform claim that they are not a racist organisation. However, they seem to be attracting an awful lot of former BNP activists, which would make me question that. “But fundamentally I have great concerns about what a Reform government would do to education.” Ed Davey has called on China to release the tapes of the interrogation of a Liberal Democrat MP who was denied entry to Hong Kong to visit her family. The party leader also urged foreign secretary David Lammy to summon the country’s ambassador to Britain to demand an explanation for Wera Hobhouse’s deportation, saying the UK should not be “kowtowing” to Beijing. Hobhouse, the MP for Bath who is a member of the Inter-parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) which has been critical of Beijing’s human rights record, has said she believes the action was taken to silence her. She had flown to Hong Kong to see her son and newborn grandson but was held at the airport, questioned and sent back to the UK. Asked whether he agreed that she had been detained to “shut her up”, Davey told the PA news agency: “I think it’s very likely the case. “Liberal Democrats have stood up for the people of Hong Kong against oppression from Beijing, stood up for human rights, and I don’t think the Chinese government likes that. “And this may be a part of retaliation, even though Wera was only on a family visit, but I think that shows you that they behaved in a shocking way – they need to back down.” He added: “I very much hope the British Government, the foreign secretary, David Lammy, will call in the Chinese ambassador and demand an explanation. We shouldn’t be kowtow(ing), I’m afraid, to Beijing.” Keir Starmer’s Labour party faces a very difficult electoral test in the bellwether Scottish parliament seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse in June, after Reform UK confirmed Nigel Farage will make a rare campaigning visit to Scotland. It emerged today a byelection will be held there on 5 June after the unexpected death last month of its widely respected MSP, Christina McKelvie, who had held the seat for the Scottish National party for 14 years. McKelvie, who had been fighting secondary breast cancer, had already announced she would stand down before the Holyrood elections next year. In normal circumstances this contest would be a straight head to head between the SNP and Scottish Labour, which had hoped to finally regain power at Holyrood after nearly 20 years in opposition. Labourtrounced the SNP in a byelectionfor the adjacent Westminster seat of Rutherglen and Hamilton West in late 2023, but its popularity has plummeted since the general election. Although it has primarily cut into Scottish Conservative support in Scotland, Reform UK is also making inroads into Labour’s vote, adding to its difficulties. This byelection could become a classic protest vote against Starmer’s government: Scottish Labour’s support has slumped in parallel with the fall in Labour’s UK-wide popularity. The SNP, which has seen its support flatline under current leader John Swinney, will focus heavily on Labour’s decision not to compensate the Waspi pensioners; its continuing two child benefits cap and the cuts to winter fuel payments. A Reform UK spokesperson toldthe Heraldit had already started canvassing: Nigel is definitely coming. The team will be up here … I’m sure if there is an opportunity for Nigel to campaign in Hamilton Nigel will be looking to do that. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said the byelection was “a chance to vote for a new direction with Scottish Labour. People in this community and right across Scotland are being let down by this tired and out-of-touch SNP government.” The SNP has already selected Katy Loudon, who lost to Labour in the Rutherglen byelection. She said: Households across the constituency are benefiting from SNP decisions – including free prescriptions and social care, free university tuition or help for older people with heating bills. In stark contrast, the UK Labour government is making life harder for ordinary people across Scotland. Ministers have announced an overhaul of the way carer’s allowance overpayments are checked in an attempt to fix the failing system which has left thousands with life-changing debts,fines and criminal records. In a significant policy change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been ordered to hire extra staff to investigate 100% of the carer’s allowance earnings breach alerts it receives and swiftly notify carers if they are at risk of falling into debt. Last year, the Guardian revealed that for the last six years,the DWP has chosen to investigate just 50% of alerts on cost grounds– even though this has led to huge numbers of carers unknowingly accruing massive overpayments. Campaigners are optimistic the move could, over time, significantly reduce the numbers of carers falling foul of the system – but warned thousands more will be unfairly hit by overpayments as huge backlogs of alerts are processed over the next few months. Carers inEnglandand Wales who breach carer’s allowance earnings limits of £196 a week must return the full £83.30 a week benefit payment, a “cliff edge” penalty that means going £1 a week over the limit for one year would result in the claimant being hit with a repayment demand not of £52, but £4,330. Ed Davey said Donald Trump was “acting like a bully” and the government should respond with “strength”. Speaking to the PA news agency from manufacturing business LJA Miers & Co in St Neots, the Liberal Democrats leader said: We [should] say to president Trump, if you’re not going to play fair, we’re going to keep trading with each other. We’re going to grow elsewhere, but also come together to oppose what president Trump is doing to the world economy at the moment. At the moment he’s picking us off, he’s dividing and ruling, he’s acting like a bully. The only way you respond to a bully is by strength and by people coming together to oppose that. We briefly mentionedin an earlier postthat the National Education Union (NEU) indicated that it would launch a formal ballot on strike action if the government’s final pay offer for teachers “remains unacceptable”. We now have some more details from their annual conference, held in Harrogate in North Yorkshire this year. A motion passed at the conference said the government’s recommended 2.8% pay rise for September was “inadequate and unfunded” and it would prevent the government achieving its target of recruiting 6,500 more teachers. In its evidence to the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) in December, the department for education (DfE) said a 2.8% pay rise for teachers in 2025/26 would be “appropriate” and would “maintain the competitiveness” of teachers’ pay despite the “challenging financial backdrop” the government is facing. The government has yet to publish the recommendations of the teachers’ pay review body, or its decision on whether to accept them. Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has said “any move towards industrial action by teaching unions would be indefensible”. An urgent motion, carried by conference delegates on Tuesday, called for a formal industrial action ballot to be launched if the final outcome of the STRB process “remains unacceptable” – or if the government does not announce real-terms funding increases in the spending review in June. NEU members staged eight days of strike action in state schools in England in 2023 in a long-running pay dispute. In July 2023, the government agreed to implement the STRB’s recommendation of a 6.5% increase for teachers in England, and co-ordinated strike action by four unions was called off. Teachers in England received a fully funded 5.5% pay rise in September last year. The largest education union in the country,the National Education Union(NEU), has called Reform UK a “racist and far-right” political party. Reform – led byNigel Farage- has been neck and neck with Labour and ahead of the Tories in some recent polls and will contest nearly all the 1,600 council seats up for re-election on 1 May. Delegates at the annual NEU conference called for the union’s political fund to be used to help campaign against Reform UK election candidates whose policies and campaigns were described as “racist”, according to the PA news agency. A motion, which was passed by delegates at the conference on Tuesday, said it believes Reform UK is racist because of its hardline policies on immigration and its “campaigns against migrants”. It added that organisations like Reform UK “seek to build on the despair, poverty and alienation in our society by scapegoating refugees, asylum seekers, Muslims, Jews and others who do not fit their beliefs”. Speaking to the media at the union’s annual conference in Harrogate in North Yorkshire,Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said: “I think there’s an awful lot of racists who are getting involved in Reform. I think Nigel Farage is a right-wing populist.” Speaking about Farage specifically, Kebede added: I’m surprised that our union seems to be living rent free in his head, to be honest. But this is just lifted directly from the Donald Trump playbook. Both Elon Musk and Donald Trump have been directly attacking the AFT and the NEA, the American teachers’ unions, and this is what Nigel Farage is. He’s a pound shop Donald Trump. When asked about the union’s stance on Reform UK at a press conference in County Durham on Tuesday afternoon, Farage accused the NEU leader of being a “self-declared Marxist” who he claimed was determined that “children should be poisoned at school” about everything to do with the country. Ed Daveyhas been campaigning in Cambridgeshire today, where he has been planting flowers, and also posing with a baby, which makes for a guaranteed inclusion in the politics live blog while I am at the helm. This is my last post for the day however, as I am now handing you over to the good care of my colleague Yohannes Lowe. I will see you again tomorrow. Nigel Farage has said Reform UK’s are “parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’” in a speech ahead of May’s local elections in England. He claimed that Labour had become a middle-class party and abandoned the roots it was founded for, saying “our support is coming directly from people who have been, in many cases, lifelong Labour voters. “Reform are parking their tanks on the lawns of the ‘red wall’”, he said. “Today’s the first day I’ve said that but I absolutely mean it, and we’re here, and we’re here to stay. And the evidence is that people who are switching to us, this is not a short term protest. They actually believe in us.” Listing recent council byelection gains, the MP for Clacton, speaking in County Durham, claimed the party is giving Labour “one hell of a run for their money” and is now “the opposition to the Labour party, with the Conservatives trailing some way behind”. He attacked the Conservatives as a spent force and wasted vote in large areas of England, saying “The sheer level of betrayal of what people who voted for Boris Johnson in 2019 got, they didn’t get the Brexit they voted for, and they got mass immigration on a scale never seen before in the history of these islands, those people are not ever going to trust the Conservative party again.” In a lengthy speech covering regular Reform UK talking points, Farage claimed there had been a cover-up over the Southport stabbings, that it was a conspiracy theory to suggest he held favourable views of Vladimir Putin, and said Reform was against “DEI and that madness”. At one point during the speech, made on the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, Farage posed with a front page of today’sthe Sun newspaperwhich declared Britain was broken. The Reform UK leader wrotean op-ed for the papertoday. Farage appeared to try to claim credit for the government’s rescue ofBritish Steel, telling supporters at the event “I don’t believe there would have been a Saturday sitting in parliament if Richard Tice and I had not been up to Scunthorpe and been greeted the way we were by those workers, especially in the local ‘Spoons afterwards, they actually felt there was someone speaking up for them.” Farage said it was Reform’s policy to “re-industrialise” Britain, and claimed that investments in oil and gas would provide tens of thousands of well paid jobs. He accusedEd Milibandof wanting to “despoil” the British coastline with windfarms, and suggested that the removal of inheritance tax perks from farms was partly because Miliband wanted to replace agricultural land with “Chinese slave-labour made solar farms.” Farage also angrily attackedDaniel Kebede, president of the National Education Union (NEU) as someone he said was “poisoning the minds of our kids”, and said that if Reform won the next general election it would “go to war with the National Education union and all the left wing teaching unions.” The Reform UK leader ended his speech by saying it was the party’s “historic mission” to change Britain’s culture. He said “It’s about understanding that Britain is broken, and that without the right leadership, without the right change of mentality, and I think most of us feel, within a decade, it frankly, won’t be a place worth living in. And we are damn determined to turn this round.” The business secretary has said that he might accept offers of involvement withBritish Steelfrom Chinese companies, but would “look at a Chinese firm in a different way” from other bidders. He also said he would not rule out job losses, saying there might be a “different employment footprint” at Scunthorpe. Speaking as raw materials were being delivered to the keep the blast furnaces running,Jonathan Reynoldssaid: What we need for the long-term future of British Steel is that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme. That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future. These blast furnaces have given this country nearly a century of service in one case, so they know they need the future and that might be a different model, different technology. What they didn’t want was the unplanned, uncontrolled shutdown of the blast furnaces with thousands of job losses and no plan in place for the future. And by what we’ve been able to do, working with the brilliant team here at British Steel, is secure the possibility of that better future – and I for one am confident that we’ve made the right decision to support the people here. Reynolds said he believed the government “can improve on the financial performance that we have seen” but that the support that has been put in place is “better value for the taxpayer” than if jobs had been lost. On the issue of potential future partners, Reynolds told broadcasters “I think we’ve got to recognise that steel is a sensitive sector. It’s a sensitive sector around the world, and a lot of the issues in the global economy with steel come from over-production and dumping of steel products, and that does come from China. “So I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way but I’m really keen to stress the action we’ve taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn’t acting in the UK’s national interest, and we had to take the action we did.” The Liberal Democrats have urged the government to rule out any involvement from Chinese firms in the future domestic production of steel. Foreign affairs spokespersonCalum Millersaid that would put national security at risk and be “completely unacceptable.” Earlier Reform UK leaderNigel Farageappeared totry to take credit for the rescue operation, claiming Labour had only moved the way it did because of the warm reception Farage and Richard Tice received when they visited the plant last week.",

    "article_text": "Liz Truss is preparing to launch her own social media platform championing free speech, as she warned the “deep state” and mainstream media were stifling freedom of expression in Britain. The former prime minister said the platform would launch this summer. It is her latest attempt to become a leading figure on the radical right in Britain, openly declaring her support for Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s mission to slash state spending in the US. Truss made the revelation at a cryptocurrency conference in Bedford over the weekend. She said that she had been “cut off at the knees” when she became prime minister by “the elite”, which opposed radical change. “That has made me think that it’s not enough just to get into number 10,” she said. “What I’m now thinking is we need a media network to be able to communicate to people, to be able to have a grassroots movement that is actually really demanding change of our leaders.” She said she was worried about how issues were “suppressed or promoted” by the mainstream media, appearing to compare Britain to communist Russia. “This is the kind of thing that we used to see going on in the Soviet Union and it’s now happening to us and it is absolutely shocking that that is the case in modern Britain,” she said. “I do think this needs to be actively fought and what I am doing is establishing a new free speech network, which will be uncensored and uncancellable, to actually talk about the issues people don’t want to talk about.” Her attempt to create her own social media platform follows in the footsteps of Trump’s Truth Social, operated by the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG). Investing in TMTG became a means by which individual investors showed their support for the US president. TMTG lost $400.9m (£303.5m) last year. The track record of UK political figures attempting to start their own social networks is not encouraging.

    "title": "UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworks",
    "article_text": "The business secretary has refused to rule out redundancies at the Scunthorpe steelworks, despite calls from trade unions to end the programme of job losses started by its former owners. Jonathan Reynolds said on Tuesday the plant might need to have a “different employment footprint” after the government’s takeover, even as he promised to try to save the plant’s two blast furnaces. Reynolds was speaking during a visit to Immingham docks to oversee coal and iron ore being unloaded on its way to the Scunthorpe plant. The governmenttook controlof the plant after finding out its Chinese owner, Jingye, was attempting to sell the supplies and hasten the closure of the furnaces. “What we need for the long-term future ofBritish Steelis that private sector partner to work with us as a government on a transformation programme,” Reynolds said. “That might be new technology, new facilities, that might have a different employment footprint. The staff here absolutely know that, they know they need a long-term future.” He added: “These blast furnaces have given this country nearly a century of service in one case, so they know they need the future, and that might be a different model, different technology. What they didn’t want was the unplanned, uncontrolled shutdown of the blast furnaces with thousands of job losses and no plan in place for the future. “And by what we’ve been able to do, working with the brilliant team here at British Steel, is secure the possibility of that better future – and I for one am confident that we’ve made the right decision to support the people here.” Reynolds made his comments even as the GMB union called for an end to the formal redundancy programme, which British Steel began last year. Those planscould have meantthe closure of both blast furnaces and more than half of the site’s 3,500 workers losing their jobs. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, national officer at GMB, said: “We are expecting the immediate threat of redundancies to be taken off the table, and we are looking to work with the secretary of state on planning the longer-term future for Scunthorpe and the steel making there.” Reynolds has the task both of securing immediate supplies to keep the furnaces running and looking for a longer-term bidder for the Scunthorpe site. Ministers want to find a private sector company to help the government pay for a new electric furnace at the plant, which forms the central part of British Steel’s £1.25bn decarbonisation plan. Reynolds said over the weekend he would not “bring a Chinese company into our steel sector” again, but on Tuesday he appeared to change his mind and refused to rule out the possibility that a Chinese company could take over the site once more. “I think you would look at a Chinese firm in a different way but I’m really keen to stress the action we’ve taken here was to step in, because it was one specific company that I thought wasn’t acting in the UK’s national interest, and we had to take the action we did,” he said. Reynolds’ change of tone comes amid a broader push by the UK government to limit the political fallout from the crisis surrounding British Steel. Over the weekend, the business secretary refused to rule out the possibility that Jingye’s actions might have been part of a deliberate act of sabotage to undermine the British steel industry. But by Monday, officials and ministers were insisting that was not the case, saying they believed the company had been acting purely out of commercial considerations. The government’s push to secure Chinese investment in British infrastructure has begun to alarm some senior figures within Labour. Liam Byrne, the chair of the business select committee,told the Guardianthis week: “We must now be fiercely vigilant about just who is granted the keys to the industries and infrastructure that keep our nation moving.”",

    "title": "Civil case against influencer Andrew Tate is first of its kind, UK judge told",
    "article_text": "A civil case againstAndrew Tateover allegations he subjected four women to sexual violence and coercive control is the first case of its kind, a judge has been told. The influenceris being suedby two women who worked for his webcam business in Luton, Bedfordshire, in 2015 and two former girlfriends in 2013 and 2014. One woman has accused Tate, 38, of raping, strangling and whipping her with a belt in 2015. She has also alleged he pointed a gun in her face and said: “I’m a boss, I’m a fucking G, you’re going to do as I say or there’ll be hell to pay.” Anne Studd KC, representing the women, told the judge, Richard Armstrong, it was thought to be the “first occasion” that coercive control was “brought before the high court in a civil context”. In written submissions, the barrister added the case was “understood to be the first claim where allegations of coercive control have been considered in a civil context of whether that behaviour can amount to intentional infliction of harm”. The hearing at the high court in London on Tuesday dealt with preliminary matters, including disclosure and legal costs. The judge said the claimants were “seeking damages likely to reach six figures” and scheduled a three-week trial for early 2027. Tate denies the allegations and claims his relationships with the women were consensual. Studd told the court there was “a total denial of wrongdoing” and that Tate had dismissed the claims in his written defence as “a pack of lies” and “nonsense”. Tate’s lawyers further claim the allegations for personal injury are barred as they are subject to a three-year limitation period. Studd said there was a “vast amount” to review in the case, including “thousands of pages of open-source material” produced by Tate, “as well as material provided from law enforcement agencies, material from criminal proceedings in other jurisdictions” and video footage. She told the court: “[Tate] has a profile, largely made by himself, where he regularly discusses issues of violence against women and girls and misogyny” and gave his “seemingly high-profile support for behaviours of that type”. The judge allowed the women to rely on evidence from one expert on “why victims of sexual violence do not always bring claims precipitously”, but refused to allow them to rely on a second expert on coercive control. Studd had said expert evidence was needed so the court had “the whole picture”, describing coercive control as “a form of grooming and manipulation where the victim becomes less and less able to respond in what might be perceived as a normal way. In particular, she may not leave even if the door is open.” But Vanessa Marshall KC, for Tate, said the additional expert evidence was “unnecessary”. Armstrong did not allow Tate’s lawyers to claim the costs of travelling to Romania to take statements. “He has travelled to the US and Dubai recently, there is no reason he cannot travel to the UK,” the judge said. Three of the women had reported Tate to Hertfordshire police in 2019 but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges. Tate and his brother Tristan are under criminal investigation in Romania over allegations of human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering. Bedfordshire police are seeking to arrest the Tate brothers in relation to allegations of rape and trafficking dating to between 2012 and 2015. The two men deny all accusations against them.",

    "title": "UK weather: heavy rain warning issued for western England and Wales",
    "article_text": "A month’s worth of rain is expected to fall on parts of the UK within 48 hours as the good weather the country has basked in for weeks comes to a soggy end. WesternEnglandand the whole of Wales have been warned of possible flooding as the Easter weekend approaches. The Met Office issued ayellow warning for rainbeginning at noon on Tuesday and lasting for 24 hours, advising that there could be transport disruption, flooding of homes and businesses and a chance of power cuts. Spray and flooding on roads could make journey times longer and there may be delays on bus and train services, forecasters said. Areas within the zone include popular holiday spots inCornwalland Devon as well as Bristol, Bath, Herefordshire, Shropshire, parts of Cheshire and Merseyside. The Met Office said: “Whilst there is some uncertainty in where the heaviest rain will fall, 20-40mm of rain is expected fairly widely. A few places may see 50-75 mm of rain during this period.” By Tuesday evening 36mm (1.4in) had fallen in Culdrose in Cornwall in 24 hours and 30mm in Milford Haven in south-westWales. The east of England did not completely escape, with 21mm falling on parts of Suffolk. By the end of Wednesday as much as 75mm was expected to have fallen in some areas of west Wales over 48 hours – about the same as the average for the whole of April. Wind was also expected to be an issue on Wednesday, with very strong gusts hitting parts of the south coast of England and 50mph flurries inland. A yellow warning was in place for Northern Ireland for much of Wednesday, where up to 60mm of rain was predicted over the high ground of Antrim and Down. After weeks of fine weather for many parts of the UK, the Met Office said low pressure was leading to unsettled conditions. Its chief meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, said: “After a long spell of high pressure bringing dry weather and sunshine, gloomier and unsettled conditions are on the horizon. Low pressure has become established to the west of the UK, bringing cloud, rain showers and lower temperatures for many. “More persistent and heavy rain is expected on Tuesday into early Wednesday. A low-pressure system near Portugal is of particular interest as it moves towards the UK, bringing with it potentially heavy rain and thunderstorms. “High rainfall totals are possible but, given the recent dry conditions, significant impacts are not anticipated. The situation remains under close watch, with further wet conditions anticipated on Thursday and another weather front moving in on Friday.” In England, the Environment Agency hadnine flood alerts– meaning flooding is possible – in place on Tuesday afternoon. There were no flood warnings for Wales. The Environment Agency was monitoring the River Mimram, a chalk stream in Hertfordshire, where the persistent rain in December and January has led to high groundwater levels. It said there may be risk of flooding there to very low-lying properties. Storm Hans, named by the Italian Met Service, is due to bring strong winds and rough seas to parts of the Mediterranean this week. Heavy rain is a concern, particularly in northern Italy, where over 200mm (8in) may fall by Thursday, giving a risk of flash flooding and landslides. Temperatures in the UK are likely to be around average for the time of year, with potentially unsettled days, dry interludes and chilly nights. The AA issued anamber warning for trafficfor the Easter weekend. It said more than 19m journeys were expected on Good Friday and more than 18m on Easter Monday.",

    "title": "Zuckerberg feared monopoly scrutiny and mulled Instagram split, files show",
    "article_text": "Meta’s chief executiveMark Zuckerbergconsidered spinning off Instagram in 2018 in anticipation of a potential antitrust suit, documents unveiled at a trial in Washington showed on Tuesday. ​​“While most companies resist break-ups, the corporate history is that most companies actually perform better after they’ve been split up,” he wrote in an email at the time. He said there was a “there is a non-trivial chance” his company would be forced to spinInstagramand WhatsApp out anyway. Zuckerberg made another key concession during the US trial on Tuesday, saying he bought Instagram because it had a “better” camera than the oneFacebookwas trying to build for its flagship app at the time. In the email, he said Instagram was a “rapidly growing, threatening, network”. The acknowledgement appeared to bolster allegations by US antitrust enforcers thatMetahad used a “buy or bury” strategy to snap up potential rivals, keep smaller competitors at bay and maintain an illegal monopoly. It came during Zuckerberg’s second day testifying at the high-stakes trial in Washington, in which the US Federal Trade Commission is seeking to undo Meta’s acquisitions of prized assets Instagram, acquired for $1bn, andWhatsApp, bought for $19bn. The case, filed during Donald Trump’s first term, is widely seen as a test of the new Trump administration’s promises to take on big tech companies. Asked by an attorney for the FTC whether he thought fast-growing Instagram could be destructive to Meta, then known as Facebook, Zuckerberg said he believed Instagram had a better camera product than Facebook was building. “We were doing a build versus buy analysis” while in the process of building a camera app, Zuckerberg said. “I thought that Instagram was better at that, so I thought it was better to buy them.” Zuckerberg also acknowledged that many of the company’s attempts at building its own apps had failed. “Building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we have tried to build a new app, it hasn’t gotten a lot of traction,” Zuckerberg told the court. “We probably tried building dozens of apps over the history of the company and the majority of them don’t go anywhere.” Zuckerberg’s testimony comes as Meta is defending itself years after the release of damning statements plucked from Facebook’s own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said “it is better to buy than compete”. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion The company argues that his past intentions are irrelevant because the FTC has defined the social media market inaccurately and failed to account for stiff competition Meta has faced from ByteDance’s TikTok, Alphabet’s YouTube and Apple’s messaging app. The FTC accuses Meta of holding a monopoly on platforms used to share content with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap’s Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC argues.",

    "title": "US claims student’s activism could ‘undermine’ Middle East peace",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationis justifying its efforts to deport a student at Columbia University by saying that his activities could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process. In a memo from the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, reviewed exclusively by the New York Times, the administration asserts that Mohsen Mahdawi, 34, a green-card holder and student who led pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, had undermined the Middle East peace process and threatened the US goal to “peacefully” resolve conflict in Israel and Gaza. Mahdawi was apprehended at an immigration services center in Vermont, where he had arrived to complete the final step in his citizenship process. Instead of taking a citizenship test, as he had expected to do, he was arrested and handcuffed by immigration officers. Rubio’s memo justifying the arrest cites the same authority used to detain Mahdawi’s fellow Columbia protester and green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil. In both cases, Rubio cited a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that he said allows him to deport any person who is not a citizen or national of the US. In Khalil’s case, Rubio argued that Khalil’s activism undermined the US goal of combatting antisemitism; the reasoning is currently being challenged in court. But the memo addressing Mahdawi’s case, the New York Times reports, is more specific, noting that Mahdawi had “engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders”, saying his activism had undermined efforts to protect Jewish students from violence, and saying it had undermined the Middle East peace process by reinforcing antisemitic sentiment. The state department declined to comment, and Mahdawi’s lawyers did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. According to the court filing challenging Mahdawi’s arrest, he was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, where he lived until he moved to the US in 2014. He became a lawful permanent resident of the US in 2015. He was expected to graduate Columbia in May, and had been accepted into a master’s program at the university’s school of international and public affairs, according to the court documents. As a student at Columbia, his lawyers say, Mahdawi was “an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist and organizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024, after which he took a step back and has not been involved in organizing”.",

    "title": "Sudan paramilitary declares rival government two years into civil war",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has announced the formation of a rival government, two years since the country descended into a brutal war that has left tens of thousands dead and triggered what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo — also known as Hemedti — declared on Tuesday the establishment of the “Government of Peace and Unity” in areas under its control. The move directly challenges the army-led administration headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. “On this anniversary, we proudly declare the establishment of the Government of Peace and Unity, a broad coalition that reflects the true face of Sudan,” Dagalo said on Telegram. The RSF and its allies had already signed a charter in Nairobi in February, laying out their intention to form an alternative authority. Dagalo said they had now endorsed a transitional constitution, which he described as a “roadmap for a new Sudan”. The document proposes a 15-member presidential council representing all regions of the country. Experts have long warned that the protracted conflict risks permanently fracturing Sudan. Sharath Srinivasan, a Sudan specialist at the University of Cambridge, told the AFP news agency that the RSF’s entrenchment in Darfur could result in “de facto separation.” Since war erupted on 15 April 2023, nearly 13 million people have been displaced, with no political solution in sight. The fighting began after months of tension between Sudan’s military and the RSF, once close allies who jointly led the 2021 coup that derailed a civilian-led transition. As the RSF seeks to consolidate control in western Sudan, the paramilitary and its allied militias are facing renewed international scrutiny over their conduct in the war. The United States on Tuesday criticised the RSF for attacking civilians in and around the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps – home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people – in the North Darfur region in recent days. The UN said at least 300 civilians were killed in theRSF attacks on the campson Friday and Saturday. “We are deeply alarmed by reports the RSF has deliberately targeted civilians and humanitarian actors,” said US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. She called for all parties to respect international humanitarian law and face accountability for violations. With Sudan’s humanitarian crisis deepening, the United Kingdom hosted a donor conference in London, where international partners pledged to ramp up support. The European Union pledged over $592m, while the UK committed an additional $158m. “We do need patient diplomacy,” UK Home Secretary David Lammy said. “We cannot resign ourselves to inevitable conflict. We cannot be back here, one year from now, having the same discussion.” Sudan’s military-aligned government criticised the gathering, noting that no representatives from either faction were invited. The conference’s co-chairs issued a unified call for an immediate ceasefire and a transition to civilian rule, stressing the importance of preventing Sudan’s partition and keeping external actors from interfering.",

    "title": "Barcelona and PSG reach Champions League semifinals; Dortmund and Villa out",
    "article_text": "Barcelona and Paris-Saint Germain have booked their places in the semifinals of the Champions League but were heavily tested by Borussia Dortmund and Aston Villa, respectively, in the quarterfinal second legs. Barca went through with a 5-3 aggregate win, despite losing 3-1 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, with Serhou Guirassy hitting a hat-trick. Holding a 4-0 lead after a dominant performance in Catalonia, the visitors were made to sweat as Dortmund, and Guirassy nearly pulled off a stunning turnaround. Guirassy put Dortmund in front with a panenka from the spot, with 11 minutes gone, and headed them two goals clear early in the second half. Dortmund sensed a sensation but Barcelona hit back, with Fermin Lopez forcing Ramy Bensebaini into an own goal with just more than half an hour remaining. Guirassy reignited Dortmund’s belief with a third on the 76th-minute mark, and the final stages may have been different had Julian Brandt not been offside before scoring with 11 minutes remaining. Despite losing their first competitive game in 2025, Barcelona are through to the semis, keeping their dream of a remarkable treble alive, 10 years after last completing the feat by winning the Champions League in Berlin. Barcelona, considered the title favourites, will face either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich in the final four. Clearly outclassed in the first leg, Dortmund will take inspiration from Tuesday’s performance, not least the goalscoring form of Guirassy. The 29-year-old Guinean, who has spent most of his career bouncing between the first and second divisions in Germany and France, now has 13 Champions League goals this season, more than any other player. “I’m proud of what we were able to do. Barcelona are a strong team but we fought until the death. We showed what we can do,” Guirassy told Amazon Prime. Despite a big first-leg lead, coach Hansi Flick made good on his pre-match pledge to continue attacking, opting against resting any of his attacking trident of Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal or Raphinha. With coach Niko Kovac admitting that Dortmund needed a “miracle” to reach the semis after the debacle in Catalonia, the hosts’ task got a little harder when captain and centre-back Emre Can was ruled out with injury just before the match. But Dortmund raced out of the blocks, with Guirassy and strike partner Maximilian Beier going close inside the opening 10 minutes before Pascal Gross was the victim of a clumsy foul in the box by Wojciech Szczesny. Guirassy stepped up to the spot and was nerveless, calmly unleashing a panenka to get the hosts under way. Dortmund sliced Barcelona open repeatedly without reward until half-time but made it count four minutes into the second half, with Guirassy heading in a Ramy Bensebaini assist from a corner. With Dortmund’s 81,355-strong Westfalenstadion smelling blood, Barcelona’s familiar response was to send their attack down the right, and the move paid off almost immediately. After Yamal’s cross was half-cleared, Fermin Lopez found himself in the teenager’s channel, whipping a pass towards Lewandowski, which Bensebaini hit into his own net. With Barcelona content to control possession as the clock wound down, Guirassy relit the hosts’ hopes when he scored his third in the final quarter of an hour, blasting in from close range after some delightful dribbling from teenage winger Julian Duranville. The home fans erupted when Brandt scored three minutes later, but the midfielder was offside, allowing Barcelona a breather. Barcelona managed to hold on, despite waves of energetic Dortmund attacks in the final stages, to remain on track for the treble. PSG kept alive their dream of a first Champions League title by squeezing past Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate after a thrilling second leg of their quarterfinal, which the English side won 3-2. Ahead 3-1 from the first leg, PSG appeared to have sealed the contest within the first half-hour as their marauding fullbacks, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes, scored from two flowing counterattacks to stun the Villa Park crowd. But Youri Tielemans revived hope with a 34th-minute deflected goal before Villa stunned the visitors early in the second half, with two goals in two minutes from John McGinn and Ezri Konsa. Villa poured forward, drawing a string of outstanding saves from PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to preserve the aggregate win and enable his side to move into a semifinal against either Real Madrid or Arsenal. PSG were hot favourites to win the quarterfinal, given their first-leg advantage and recent form, including sealing a fourth straight Ligue 1 title and reaching the final of the French Cup. But Villa were not lacking belief themselves, especially at home where they were on a 17-match unbeaten run in all competitions. The hosts came out flying, nearly taking the lead from a corner in an early flurry of attacks. However, PSG struck first blood in the 11th minute when Hakimi stroked the ball in after Villa’s usually ultra-reliable goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, pushed it into his path. Sixteen minutes later, Mendes curled in Villa’s second goal off the post at the end of another fast-flowing counterattack. Tielemans’s first-half goal appeared unlikely to swing the tie but it inspired Villa to storm out in the second half, with McGinn letting fly from outside the box to score in the 55th minute, helped by a small deflection. Then Konza struck Villa’s third on the night after being set up with a brilliant dribble from Marcus Rashford. One more goal would have put Villa level on aggregate but Donnarumma defied Rashford, Tielemans and then substitute Marco Asensio during a nerve-racking finale. “Very proud of the boys, of what we’ve done tonight,” said Konza. “Obviously, the two goals at the start killed us. But we showed great belief, great character to get back into the game. But unfortunately, it wasn’t enough.”",

    "title": "Hamas ‘lost contact’ with group holding Gaza captive after Israeli attack",
    "article_text": "The armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas says it has lost contact with a group holding Israeli-US captive Edan Alexander in the Gaza Strip after “direct Israeli bombardment” targeted the area where he was being held. “It seems that the occupation army is deliberately trying to kill him and hence relieve themselves from the pressure caused by the dual-citizen prisoners in order to continue its genocide against our people,” Abu Obeida, spokesman for the Qassam Brigades, said on Tuesday. On Saturday, Hamas had released a video showing Alexander – a New Jersey native and a 21-year-old soldier in the Israeli army – alive. Alexander appeared to be under duress in the video and appealed to US President Donald Trump to get him out of Gaza and urged the US president not to believe “lies” told by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In his latest statement, Abu Obeida did not say where Alexander was being held in Gaza. The group’s armed wing later released a video warning families of the captives that their “children will return in black coffins with their bodies torn apart from shrapnel from your army”. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said Palestinians across the enclave believe that the US “has an interest” in securing Alexander’s release in a negotiated deal. “They believe this will increase pressure on the Israeli government to speed up the process and come to an agreement,” Mahmoud said. “If it is confirmed that Alexander has been killed, then the Palestinian groups will lose what they hoped would be a lever of pressure against the Netanyahu government to get him to sign a ceasefire agreement.” Hamas haspreviously blamed Israelfor the deaths of captives held in Gaza, including as a direct result of bombardment, while also acknowledging on at least one occasion that a captive was killed by a guard. It said the guard had acted against instructions. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters at the White House in March that securing the release of Alexander, believed to be the last living US hostage held by Hamas in Gaza, was a “top priority for us”. The potential release of Alexander was at the centre ofearlier talksheld between Hamas leaders and US negotiator Adam Boehler last month. The announcement comes as Netanyahu said Israel would press on with its military offensive in Gaza to secure the release of captives and praised troops during a visit to the devastated north of the territory. “They are striking the enemy and Hamas will continue to suffer blow after blow. We insist that they release our hostages, and we insist on achieving all of our war objectives,” Netanyahu told soldiers in Gaza, according to a statement from his office. In a phone call with Netanyahu, France’s President Emmanuel Macron said he told Israel’s leader that the suffering of the people in Gaza “must end”, and that only a ceasefire could free the remaining Israeli captives. Hamas released 38 captives under the last truce agreement that began on January 19. In mid-March, Israel’s militaryresumed its ground and aerial offensive on Gaza, abandoning the ceasefire and reimposing a total blockade of Gaza. Hamas decried the ongoing blockade, saying Israel has been preventing the entry of “all essential items necessary for life, including food supplies, medicine and fuel”. The United Nations has also warned that Gaza’s humanitarian crisis is spiralling out of control. “The humanitarian situation is now likely the worst it has been in the 18 months since the outbreak of hostilities,” said the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Israeli forces continued to bombard areas across Gaza on Tuesday, killing at least 21 people, according to Gaza’s civil defence. Since Israel’s assault began in October 2023, more than 51,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israeli officials say that the offensive will continue until the remaining 59 captives are freed and until Hamas is demilitarised. Hamas insists it will free hostages only as part of a deal to end the war permanently, and has repeatedly rejected demands to lay down its arms. Israel issued a truce proposal to Egyptian and Qatari mediators on Monday, offering a 45-day temporary ceasefire in exchange for Hamas disarming and releasing 11 Israeli captives still held in Gaza. Hamas said in a statement it was “studying” the proposal, but senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Al Jazeera prior to the release of the official statement that Hamas would not accept any demand to disarm.",

    "title": "Former Brazil President Bolsonaro in recovery after 12-hour surgery",
    "article_text": "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has posted an updateabout his healthto social media, after undergoing a sixth abdominal surgery that he says is related to a stabbing he endured on the campaign trail in 2018. On Tuesday, the embattled far-right leader shared a video of himself walking through a hospital corridor, electrodes taped to his bare chest and a walker keeping his steps steady. A team of medical staff flanked him on either side. “Don’t give up! Let’s move forward, Brazil!” Bolsonaro wrote in a caption alongside the video. In a second message, he explained that he remained in relative isolation, as his condition is delicate. Following his doctors’ advice, he said he is interacting only with family members and healthcare professionals in an effort to take “maximum caution” during his recovery. “I remain focused on the recovery process, which from what I understand was the most invasive procedure that has ever occurred,” he said. Last Friday, Bolsonaro announced he was forced to call off a rally in the northeastern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte after he suffered “severe abdominal pain”, resulting from “a complication in the small intestine”. The 70-year-old was hospitalised first at the Aluizio Bezerra Municipal Hospital in Santa Cruz, then at the Rio Grande Hospital in Natal, before being transferred to the capital, Brasilia. His most recent surgery took place on Sunday at the DF Star Hospital. The procedure lasted 12 hours, according to the president and his allies. In his latest pair of updates, Bolsonaro took a swipe at his rivals in the Workers’ Party, known as the PT. He emphasised that hisstabbing in September 2018came at the hands of a “former member of the PSOL [the Socialism and Liberty Party], a historical ally of the PT”. Allies of Bolsonaro have repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that left-wing leaders masterminded the attack, which took place as he was carried through a crowd of supporters during a campaign rally in Juiz de Fora. Federal police in Brazil have not found any connections between the PT and the attack. But Bolsonaro has long been accused of spreading conspiracy theories, particularly as it pertains to his electoral rivals. While on the campaign trail, both in 2018 and 2022, he spreadrumoursthat Brazil’s electronic voting machines were unreliable and rife with fraud, an unsubstantiated claim. Those comments led to him being banned from holding public office until 2030, with the justices of Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court finding he had abused his power while president to instil fears about the voting system. Bolsonaro served as Brazil’s president from 2019 to 2022. Since leaving office, he has faced a series of legal battles, including over whether he participated in efforts to destabilise the government of his successor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Lula is a member of the PT party, and in October 2022, he narrowly beat Bolsonaro in a run-off election to earn a third, nonconsecutive term as president. Butturmoilrocked the post-election period. Bolsonaro refused to publicly acknowledge his defeat, although media reports indicate he did soprivately. Nevertheless, his supporters blocked roadways and even stormed Brasilia’spolice headquarters, as they sought to prevent Lula from taking power. Bolsonaro and his allies also attempted to challenge the results in court, but Justice Alexandre de Moraes found that their complaint was made in “total bad faith” and levied a $4.3m fine. The tensions reached a boiling point shortly after Lula’s inauguration. On January 8, 2023, thousands of rioters descended on the Three Powers Plaza in Brasilia, home to government buildings for Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidency. There, they clashed with police and vandalised several of the buildings, smashing windows, furniture and decorations. Lula called the attack a coup attempt and has pushed for justice. Although Bolsonaro was in Florida at the time of the January 8 attack, critics have accused him and his allies of secretly pushing for the military to overthrow Lula. On March 26, Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered Bolsonaro tostand trialfor allegedly leading an attempted coup d’etat. Federal police had issued an 884-page report in November last year indicting Bolsonaro and 36 others for allegedly engaging in a criminal conspiracy that would have involved murdering Lula, his vice president and Justice de Moraes. The idea was to create a circumstance wherein a caretaker government would be created and Bolsonaro would return to power, according to the indictment. Prosecutors have filed multiple charges against Bolsonaro, including that he sought the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. Bolsonaro, meanwhile, has maintained his innocence and said he is the victim of political persecution.",

    "article_text": "France says it will expel 12 Algerian diplomatic and consular staff members and has recalled its ambassador from Algiers, deepening a crisis that threatens to unravel months of attempted reconciliation between the two countries. The announcement on Tuesday comes a day after Algeria ordered12 French diplomatsto leave within 48 hours. Algiers announced the expulsions after French prosecutors indicted three Algerian nationals, including a consular official, over the alleged kidnapping of a prominent government critic in Paris last year. The activist, Amir Boukhors – better known to his more than one million TikTok followers as “Amir DZ” – was granted asylum in France in 2023. He was abducted in a Paris suburb in April last year and released the next day. French authorities said the three suspects are also facing charges of “terrorist” conspiracy. It is the first time France has detained an employee of the Algerian consulate, marking a sharp escalation in tensions between Paris and the former French colony. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Monday that the expulsions were directly linked to the arrests. The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs noted that Algeria’s move, if carried out, would mark the first expulsion of French diplomats from the country since its independence in 1962. Algeria, which has issued nine international arrest warrants for Boukhors on charges including fraud and “terrorism”, is demanding his extradition. The escalation comes despite recent overtures between the two countries. Just a week earlier, Barrot met with Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and declared bilateral relations had returned to normal after a period of simmering tensions. French President Emmanuel Macron’s backing of Morocco’s autonomy plan for the disputed region of Western Sahara last year sparked outrage in Algiers. The jailing of French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal by an Algerian court last month only added to the strain with Macron calling for his release.",

    "title": "Iran ‘must stop and eliminate’ nuclear enrichment, says US envoy Witkoff",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –United States special envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Tehran “must stop and eliminate” its nuclearenrichment programmeto reach a deal with Washington, seemingly raising the bar of US demands ahead of another round of talks with Iranian officials. Witkoff’s remarks on Tuesday appear to contradict his suggestion a day earlier that the US would be satisfied with Iran enriching uranium at a low level to produce energy. “Any final arrangement must set a framework for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East – meaning that Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,” Witkoff said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is imperative for the world that we create a tough, fair deal that will endure, and that is what President Trump has asked me to do.” Witkoff’s official title is special envoy to the Middle East, but US President Donald Trump has given him several high-stakes responsibilities beyond the region, including spearheadingtalks with Russiaas well as Iran. The State Department echoed Witkoff’s latest statement about the Iran negotiations later on Tuesday, explaining that the US seeks to “eliminate” Iran’s uranium enrichment. Witkoff had been part of a round of negotiations with Iranian officials and was in direct contact with Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Oman on Saturday. Further talks are scheduled for April 19. Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Witkoff suggested that the US wants Iran to cap its uranium enrichment, a process of changing the atomic composition of uranium to produce nuclear fuel. When enriched at 90 percent, uranium can be used for weapons. “They do not need to enrich past 3.67 percent,” Witkoff said. “In some circumstances, they’re at 60 percent. In other circumstances, 20 percent. That cannot be. And you do not need to run — as they claim — a civil nuclear programme where you’re enriching past 3.67 percent, so this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment programme.” That assertion garnered criticism from conservative hawks who have been calling for abolishing theIranian enrichmentprogramme altogether. Tehran and Washington have gone through talks and tensions over the nuclear programme for decades. Successive US administrations have said that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon was a top foreign policy priority. In 2015, the US was a key party in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a deal that saw Iran scale back its uranium enrichment to 3.67 percent in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions against its economy. The US administration of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat, hailed that deal as a means of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. But Trump, a Republican, nixed the deal in 2018 during his first term. Since then, the US has been piling sanctions on Iran, and Tehran has escalated its nuclear programme in response. After returning to the White House for a second term this year, Trump re-launched his so-calledmaximum pressurecampaign against Iran, with the aim of choking off Iranian oil exports, particularly to China. During his interview with Fox, Witkoff implied that the Trump administration is seeking concessions from Iran beyond the JCPOA, particularly over its missile programme. He said Washington is seeking “verification on weaponisation” from Iran, including “the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there”. However, his statement on Tuesday seems to indicate the US would like to see all uranium enrichment in Iran cease. While Iranian officials have been saying for decades that the country is not seeking a nuclear bomb, they have also stressed that their country has a right to use and create nuclear energy. Tensions between the two countries have been particularly high over the last month. In mid-March, Trumpthreatened to retaliateagainst Iran should one of its regional allies, the Houthi group in Yemen, continue its attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea. “Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump wrote on his platform Truth Social. Trump also indicated US could consider military action if the current round of nuclear talks falls through. “If the talks aren’t successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,” he said last week. Still, the US president has also stressed that he prefers a diplomatic deal to ensure that Tehran never acquires a nuclear weapon. That was a position his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reiterated on Tuesday, saying Trump “emphasized the need for Iran to end its nuclear programme through negotiations” in a call with Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said. “Of course, the maximum pressure campaign on Iran continues. But as you know, the president has made it clear he wants to see dialogue and discussion with Iran, while making his directive about Iran never being able to obtain a nuclear weapon quite clear,” Leavitt said. On Monday, Trump called for speedy negotiations to resolve the issue and again threatened to take “harsh” action against Tehran. With thetalks under way, foreign policy hawks have cautioned Trump against drawn-out negotiations or entering a deal that resembles the JCPOA. Last week, nine Republican Congress members — including Claudia Tenney of New York and Barry Loudermilk of Georgia — penned a letter to Trump calling for “permanently stripping Tehran of the ability to enrich uranium”. “The regime in Tehran has mastered the art of delay and deception, using diplomatic negotiations as a shield while advancing its nuclear ambitions,” the lawmakerswrote. “We cannot afford another failed agreement that enables Iran to play for time. Nor can we repeat the mistakes of the past by permitting Iran to enrich uranium or maintain the capability to ever reconstitute its nuclear program.” Israel — the US’s top ally in the region — is widely believed to have an undeclarednuclear arsenal. Iranian officials have also expressed doubt about a new deal, noting that Tehran lived up to its commitments under the JCPOA while the US abandoned the agreement. “The negotiations may or may not yield results,” Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. “We are neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic about them. Of course, we are very sceptical of the other party, but confident in our own capabilities.”",

    "article_text": "China has reportedly ordered its airlines not to take any further deliveries of Boeing jets in response to United States President Donald Trump’s decision to impose 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods. Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter, reported the development on Tuesday. The global aerospace industry is in the middle of a full-blown tariff war, with planemakers, airlines and suppliers reviewing contracts worth billions of dollars, after US supplier Howmet Aerospace ignited a debate over who should bear the cost of the tariffs. China’s top three airlines – Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines– had planned to take delivery of 45, 53 and 81 Boeing planes, respectively, between 2025 and 2027. Beijing has also asked that Chinese carriers halt purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from US companies like Boeing, the Bloomberg report said. China’s move to halt purchases of aircraft-related components is expected to raise maintenance costs for the jets flying in the country. The Chinese government is also considering ways to provide assistance to airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs, Bloomberg News reported. Investors are taking note. The move could open more opportunities for France-based Airbus and Chinese domestic aerospace manufacturer the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). Shares for Airbus, which is a publicly traded company, are up by almost a full percentage point on the news as of 12pm ET in the US (16:00 GMT), while Boeing shares are down more than a full percentage point. In Washington, DC, Trump said on Tuesday that China has gone back on a major Boeing deal, after a news report that Beijing ordered airlines not to take further deliveries of the US aviation giant’s jets. “Interestingly, they just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft,” said Trump in a Truth Social post, referring to China as trade tensions flared between the world’s two biggest economies. China first grounded Boeing’s 737 MAXjets after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 killed nearly 350 people. China had also suspended most orders and deliveries of the jet in 2019. The halt in deliveries to China marks yetanother setback for the planemaker,which is navigating a slow recovery following a challenging year marked by a labour strike, enhanced regulatory scrutiny and persistent supply chain disruptions. In 2024, the aerospace manufacturer took centre stage after a number of high-profile accidents involving its planes, including a door plug blowing off the side of a 737 MAX flown by Alaska Airlines minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, the US on January 4.",

    "title": "Russian journalists jailed for more than 5 years over alleged Navalny ties",
    "article_text": "A Russian court has sentenced four journalists to five and a half years in prison each after convicting them of “extremism” linked to their alleged work with an organisation founded by thelate opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Antonina Favorskaya, Konstantin Gabov, Sergey Karelin and Artyom Kriger were found guilty on Tuesday by Moscow’s Nagatinsky district court of collaborating with a group designated as extremist by Russian authorities. All four deny the charges, insisting they are being punished for carrying out their journalistic duties. The verdict is the latest chapter in Russia’s sweeping crackdown on dissent – an effort that has only intensified since Moscow launched itsfull-scale invasion of Ukrainein February 2022. Authorities have moved aggressively against critics of the Kremlin, including political opponents, human rights defenders and independent journalists. Hundreds have been jailed, and thousands have fled the country in fear of prosecution. Favorskaya and Kriger were both affiliated with SotaVision, a media outlet known for documenting protests and court proceedings. Gabov, a freelance producer, has worked with several international media groups, including the news agency Reuters. Karelin, a freelance video journalist, has contributed to The Associated Press news agency. Prosecutors accused the four of being involved with Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which was outlawed and labelled extremist in 2021 – a move that critics condemned as politically motivated. Navalny, long seen as President Vladimir Putin’smost formidable critic, gained prominence through his investigations into state corruption. He died in February 2024, aged 47, while serving a 19-year sentence in a remote Arctic prison colony, convicted on charges many said were designed to silence him. Favorskaya said at an earlier court appearance open to the public that she was being prosecuted for a story she did on abuse Navalny faced behind bars. Speaking to reporters from the defendants’ cage before the verdict, she also said she was punished for helping organise Navalny’s funeral. Gabov, in a closing statement prepared for court that was published by the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said the accusations against him were groundless and the prosecution failed to prove them. “I understand perfectly well … what kind of country I live in. Throughout history, Russia has never been different, there is nothing new in the current situation,” Gabov said in the statement. “Independent journalism is equated to extremism.” In a statement Karelin prepared for his closing arguments that also was published by Novaya Gazeta, he said he had agreed to do street interviews for Popular Politics, a YouTube channel founded by Navalny’s associates, while trying to provide for his wife and a young child. He stressed that the channel wasn’t outlawed as “extremist” and had done nothing illegal. “Remorse is considered to be a mitigating circumstance. It’s the criminals who need to have remorse for what they did. But I am in prison for my work, for the honest and impartial attitude to journalism, FOR THE LOVE for my family and country,” he wrote in a separate speech for court that also was published by the outlet, in which he emphasized his feelings in capital letters. Kriger, in a closing statement published by SotaVision, said he was imprisoned and added to the Russian financial intelligence’s registry of “extremists and terrorists” “only because I have conscientiously carried out my professional duties as an honest, incorruptible and independent journalist for 4 1/2 years.” “Don’t despair guys, sooner or later it will end and those who delivered the sentence will go behind bars,” Kriger said after the verdict. Supporters who gathered in the court building chanted and applauded as the four journalists were led out of the courtroom after the verdict. “They will all appeal” their sentences, said Ivan Novikov, the lawyer defending Kriger. “The sentence is unlawful and unjust,” said a second lawyer for Kriger, Yelena Sheremetyeva. “No evidence was presented that these guys committed any crimes, their guilt was not proven,” Gabov’s lawyer Irina Biryukova said.",

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg back in US court amid push to break up Meta",
    "article_text": "The blockbuster antitrust case against Meta — the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp — has kicked off in Washington, DC, the United States. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand for the second straight day today. The landmark case accuses Meta of taking over Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. The suit is the culmination of a nearly six-year investigation into whether the social media giant broke US competition laws in acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. At stake is the future of Meta’s $1.4 trillion advertising business and the prospect of having to spin off its hugely popular services into separate companies. The federal court trial in Washington has dashedZuckerberg’s hopes that the returnof US President Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. Zuckerberg, the world’s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tried to persuade the president to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial. As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump’s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23m mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the centre of political power. But the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has shown no interest in letting up its push against Meta. Trump-appointed FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in an interview on Fox Business that the agency would not let a Meta-like monopoly arise again. Ferguson’s push is not a far cry from the previousFTC Chairwoman, Lina Khan,who under former US President Joe Biden was known to be tough on Big Tech. The case could see the Facebook owner forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyouts. The suit was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether the Republican president, on his return to the White House, would ask the FTC to stand down. Central to the case is Facebook’s 2012 $1bn purchase of Instagram — then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram’s emergence as “really scary” and adding that this was “why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this”. In his first day of testimony on Monday, Zuckerberg downplayed those exchanges as early talk before plans for Instagram came together. But the FTC argues that Meta’s $19bn WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta’s defence attorneys counter that substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They also highlight that Meta’s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said in opening remarks on Monday that “they decided that competition is too hard and it would be easier to buy out their rivals than to compete with them.” Meta attorney Mark Hansen countered in his first salvo that “acquisitions to improve and grow an acquired firm” are not unlawful in the US, saying that is what Facebook did. A key part of the courtroom battle will be how the FTC defines Meta’s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,” a spokesperson told the news agency Reuters. If the FTC is ultimately successful in its efforts to break up Meta, it would be the first time in 40 years that the agency would have forced a corporate breakup. In the early 1980s, the FTC forced telecommunications company AT&T to split apart.",

    "title": "Trump-China trade war: Which US companies could be worst hit",
    "article_text": "From Apple to Nvidia, United States tech companies have received a temporaryexemptionfrom President Donald Trump’s sky-high tariffs. For other businesses, the damage imposed by existing levies on Chinese exports may prove fatal. While Trump stepped back from the edge for most countries – announcing a 90-day pause on the bulk of his “reciprocal” tariffs onWednesday– he doubled down on China, eventually increasing import taxes on its goods to145 percent. Trump has pitched his protectionist agenda as essential for reviving US industry. However,many US firmshave grown used to cheap imports from China. For many of them, prices will rise and profits will fall. Beijing has also responded to Trump’s moves withretaliatory tariffs of its own, now at 125 percent. US exports to China, and agricultural products in particular, will be hit badly by China’s blanket levy. Here is the state of trade ties between the world’s two largest economies and the US companies that could be worst affected: Despite growing tensions between the US and China, Washington and Beijing remain major trading partners. According to data from the Office of the US Trade Representative, the total goods trade between the US and China stood at $582.4bn in 2024. After Canada and Mexico, China is America’s third largest trading partner. US imports from China totalled $438.9bn while its exports the other way tallied in at $143.5bn. The upshot is that the US trade deficit with China was $295.4bn last year, bigger than for any other country. On Friday, China’s Ministry of Commerce said it was increasing tariffs on US goods from 84 percent to 125 percent, reiterating that Beijing would “fight to the end” shortly after Washington raised US duties on Chinese imports to 145 percent. Late that same day, the Trump administration announced temporary exemptions for smartphones, solar panels and other electronic products like semiconductor chips – most of which are made in China – from Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which he has said are meant to level the playing field with trading partners who impose duties on US goods and run trade surpluses with the US. China’s governmentwelcomed the exemptionsand urged Trump to go further. However, the US president has said those products will ultimately be subject to their own different levy. As of now, they are still subject to the 20 percent tariffs that Trump imposed on all Chinese goods before April 2. In the meantime, companies will be forced to pass down at least some of Trump’s tariffs onto consumers to try to preserve their profit margins. That will result in higher inflation and lower business output. According to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, tariffs could cause 740,000 people to lose their jobs across the US by the end of 2025. But which sectors will be most exposed to these trade disruptions? The price of Nike trainers, Levi jeans and Gap T-shirts will almost certainly rise in the US as tariffs undermine the Asian factory hubs that underpin the global clothing industry. In 2024, factories in China, Vietnam and Indonesia made 95 percent of all Nike footwear. Trump has already introduced 145 percent tariffs on China while Vietnam and Indonesia currently face 10 percent tariffs, which could go up in July if they don’t succeed in striking a trade deal with Washington by then. Vietnam, in particular, is seen as a major indirect source of Chinese imports, both by rerouting Chinese goods through Vietnamese ports and by using Chinese parts in its exports to the US. Gap is also highly exposed to production processes in Vietnam. Since Trump’s “reciprocal” tariff announcement on April 2, Gap shares have fallen by 14 percent. For Nike, it’s 14.7 percent. Elsewhere, Levi’s stock price has plunged by 10.6 percent. On Friday night, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a notice exempting some technology products from the tariffs placed on Chinese goods. The CBP listed 20 product categories, including computers, smartphones and automatic data processors. It also included semiconductor equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays. The exemptions were a welcome relief to major technology firms, including Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing. But even with all post-April 2 tariffs on them waived for now, these electronic goodsstill face 20 percent tariffsthat Trump had imposed on them before April 2. Trump has also said the exemptions are temporary, and new tariffs might be coming soon. Additionally, on Monday he announced an investigation into the national security implications of importing semiconductors and chip-making equipment, injecting new insecurities for electronics firms. Supply chains in general are hard to move. For electronic goods, they are particularly difficult to replace – lining up industrial processes across different locations requires time and investment. Bradley Saunders, a North America analyst at Capital Economics, told Al Jazeera that technology goods assembly processes have been “built up over years. … Markets have found the most efficient supply chains that they can.” For now, Apple outsources most of its assembly operations to China. Smartphone companies are not alone. Almost 90 percent of gaming consoles sold in the US by Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo have been shipped in from China. Elsewhere, Nvidia relies heavily on components from China. The technology giant relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to manufacture its cutting-edge graphics cards and AI chips. Apple and Nvidia led a broad advance across US stock markets after Trump announced his recent exemptions. According to Saunders, any new tariffs could hit US technology sectors “hard”. Trump’sfirst trade war with Chinafrom 2018 to 2019 resulted in billions of dollars of lost revenue for American farmers. “The agriculture industry always tends to lose out in trade wars,” Saunders said. He pointed out that “about 15 percent” of US farm exports went to China in 2024. Thesoya bean sector, in particular, stands to lose because China is its largest export market. When Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in his first presidential term, Beijing retaliated by buying soya beans from other countries like Brazil. It also imposed retaliatory tariffs of its own. This time around, those tariffs are five times higher. The American Soybean Association has publicly opposed Trump’s tariffs on China, and soya bean farmers have warned that many in the industry could go out of business if the trade war continues. The US hasmore than 500,000 soya bean producers, according to the Department of Agriculture’s Census of Agriculture. That includes at least 223,000 full-time jobs supported by the soya bean industry, according to a 2023 report for the National Oilseed Processors Association and the United Soybean Board. The industry is worth $124bn in the US. That’s more than the entire economy of Kenya or Bulgaria. Corn and pig farmers have also been urging the Trump administration to step back from its tariff spat. Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland and Tyson Foods are three of several large US food companies that will likely lose export earnings from China.",

    "title": "Israel has killed at least 71 civilians in Lebanon since ceasefire, UN says",
    "article_text": "The United Nations says at least 71 civilians have been killed by Israeli forces in Lebanon since a ceasefire was struck at the end of last year. Thameen Al-Kheetan, spokesperson for the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), said on Tuesday that the death toll included 14 women and nine children. He called for investigations into “each and every military action where civilians are killed”. OHCHR raised concerns about recent Israeli military operations hitting civilian infrastructure, including a strike on April 3 that destroyed a newly established medical centre run by the Islamic Health Society in the southern city ofNaqoura. It also noted that at least five rockets, two mortars and a drone have been launched from Lebanon towards northern Israel, according to the Israeli army, and tens of thousands of Israelis remain displaced from the north. “The ceasefire must hold, and any escalation is a risk for stability in general in Lebanon, Israel and the whole region,” Al-Kheetan said. Later on Tuesday, Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health reported that an Israeli drone strike on a car in the southern town of Aitaroun killed one person and injured three, including a child. The Israeli military in a statement said the air strike killed “a squad commander in the special operations unit” of Hezbollah. Israelhas continued to strike Lebanon, including attacks on the capital,Beirut, since a November 27ceasefire, which largely halted more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah, including two months of all-out war. Under the truce, Hezbollah was to withdraw fighters from south of Lebanon’s Litani River and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure there while Israel was to pull out all of its forces from southern Lebanon. Lebanon’s army has been deploying in the south near the border with Israel as Israeli forces have withdrawn although Israel continues to hold five fortified positions in Lebanon that it deems “strategic”. Lebanese PresidentJoseph Aountold Al Jazeera on Monday that the army was “dismantling tunnels and warehouses and confiscating weapons bases” south of the Litani “without any problem from Hezbollah”. On Thursday, a senior Hezbollah official told the Reuters news agency the group is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon and stops its strikes.",

    "title": "Jordan says it thwarts plot that threatened national security",
    "article_text": "Jordan says it has arrested 16 people, thwarting a plot that threatened national security and that involved manufacturing and importing rockets illegally, explosives and a drone production site. In a statement on Tuesday, the General Intelligence Department said it uncovered plans to recruit and train “operatives” in Jordan and neighbouring Lebanon. A drone factory was also found, according to the statement that was released on state media. The suspects were referred to the state security court for trial, it added. Authorities later said at least one rocket was ready to be launched as part of an operation that had been under surveillance by security forces since 2021. A security source cited by the Reuters news agency said the suspects were connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s largest opposition group, while the head of the cell who trained some of its members was based in Lebanon. The Muslim Brotherhood has been accused of instigating street protests in Jordan, which has a large Palestinian population. In recent months, thousands were regularly protesting Israel’s deadly assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 51,000 people since October 2023. Demonstrators have been calling for an immediate ceasefire. “We are talking about new tactics, rockets and drones. This means a complete change in the way the Muslim Brotherhood are dealing with Jordan and targeting its security,” Amer Al Sabaileh, a prominent security analyst, told Reuters. Government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told a press briefing that the government would be airing full confessions from the suspects, some of whom had been trained in Lebanon. The rockets found in a secret hideout on the outskirts of the capital, Amman, were being manufactured with a range of 3-5km (2-3 miles) for use against targets inside the kingdom, Momani added. Shortly after the announcement, in a call with his Jordanian counterpart, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam expressed “full readiness to cooperate with Jordanian authorities as needed after information that some suspects … received training in Lebanon”. “Lebanon refuses to be a hub or launching pad for any action that would threaten the security of any brotherly or friendly country,” Salam was quoted as saying by Lebanon’s National News Agency. He affirmed his country’s support of the kingdom in “confronting any plots to undermine its security and stability”. Over the past year, Jordan said it foiled attempts to smuggle weapons by infiltrators linked to pro-Iranian groups in Syria and Lebanon-based Palestinian groups. Jordanian authorities claimed some of the arms were bound for the neighbouring Israeli-occupied West Bank, adding that they have arrested several Jordanians linked to Palestinian groups. Security officials said the incidents were related to “terrorism” based on the quantities of explosives found. They said the plot was linked to Iran and its allies’ clandestine efforts to recruit agents to carry out acts of sabotage within Jordan to destabilise one of Washington’s allies in the region. Jordan has more than 3,500 United States troops stationed in several bases and, since Israel’s assault in Gaza began, it has been increasingly targeted by Iranian-aligned groups operating in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. Last year, Jordan shot down over its territory retaliatory missiles fired from Iran towards Israel. This angered many of Jordan’s citizens, including those who are descendants of Palestinians who were forced out of their lands during the 1948 Nakba and the 1967 war.",

Skullcandy’s Method 360 ANC wireless earbuds feature sound tuning and technology licensed from Bose. byAndrew Liszewski If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Skullcandy has made a name for itself in recent years withwell-featuredbudget earbuds that don’t sound awful. Although its new Method 360 ANC earbuds are launching with a “special $99.99 introductory price” (that will eventually go up to $129.99) making them one of the brand’s most expensive offerings, the company has partnered with Bose to help ensure they’re Skullcandy’s most comfortable and best-sounding earbuds. Like theMotorola Moto Buds Plusthat debuted a year ago, the Method 360 ANC feature licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose to deliver “Skullcandy’s most advanced audio experience to date,” the company said in a press release. That includes three different sizes of ear gels and fit fins designed to comfortably keep the earbuds in place while effectively blocking out unwanted sounds. Don’t expect audio and ANC performance on par withBose’s QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, but you’ll be potentially saving yourself close to $200 by instead opting for Skullcandy’s latest. While most wireless earbuds include a charging case with a clamshell design, the Method 360 ANC’s charging case has a sliding design –similar to the company’s Dime Evo earbuds– with an O-ring clip on one end that functions similar to a carabiner. The case isn’t tiny by any stretch of the imagination, but boosts the earbuds’ battery life from 11 hours to 40 hours, or from nine hours to 32 hours with ANC turned on. Available in five color options including black, bone, primer, plasma, and leopard, the Method 360 ANC also feature a four-microphone hybrid ANC system with a Stay-Aware mode for boosting ambient sounds plus a low latency mode that helps ensure audio stays in sync when gaming or watching videos. Wear detection automatically connects the earbuds to a device and pauses playback when you remove them from your ears, while multipoint pairing streamlines switching between devices. The Method 360 ANC also have an IPX4 rating against sweat and water (you won’t want to dunk them), support Spotify Tap and Google Fast Pair, and connect to Skullcandy’s Skull-iQ mobile app allowing the function of the earbuds’ shortcut buttons to be customized as well as EQ adjustments.

    "title": "The student arrested at his naturalization interview knew it was coming",
    "article_text": "Mohsen Mahdawi was admired among pro-Palestine and pro-Israel activists for speaking peacefully to both sides. ICE detained him anyway. Mohsen Mahdawi was admired among pro-Palestine and pro-Israel activists for speaking peacefully to both sides. ICE detained him anyway. byGaby Del Valle Mohsen Mahdawi had a feeling his naturalization appointment would go awry. A week before his meeting with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Mahdawi called his friend Chris Helali and told him he was concerned. “He thought it was likely — and I agreed — that he would be arrested, that they would ambush him at this interview,” Helali tellsThe Verge. Mahdawi had been so fearful of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that he hadreportedlybeen in hiding for weeks. But Mahdawi couldn’t miss the appointment. According to USCIS, “failure to appear for a scheduled interview” almost always “results in denial” of a person’s application. The interview was scheduled for 11AM on April 14th. Helali waited outside the building. “We started to realize that something was amiss,” Helali says. Around noon, the group was told Mahdawi had been handcuffed. Three minutes later, he was escorted out of the building by two Department of Homeland Security officers. Helali captured the arrest,first reported byThe Intercept, on video. It’s unusual — though not unheard of — for immigrants to be arrested during USCIS interviews. Matt Cameron, a Boston-based immigration attorney, says it has happened to a couple clients of his, but “always because they have previous immigration or criminal history which makes them deportable.” Mahdawi’s attorneys say he has no criminal record and is a “committed Buddhist” who “believes in non-violence and empathy as a central tenet of his religion.” He doesn’t appear to have violated immigration law. But Mahdawi, who was born in the West Bank, was involved inColumbia University’s student protestsagainst Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza. He knew about the Trump administration’sefforts to deport any noncitizens— even those with green cards and visas — for their involvement in pro-Palestine activism under the auspices of aMcCarthy-era immigration law. “He knew he was a target,” Helali says. For him, the arrest was “shocking” — not because it was unexpected but because it made him feel as if “the rule of law that we constantly talk about is not as stable and not as foundational as we might think it is.” What was most striking, though, was how calm Mahdawi appeared. “Mohsen is a calming presence,” Helali says. “He went like a Buddhist: peacefully, calmly, and serenely.” In the video Helali captured, Mahdawi seems calm as he walks out of the USCIS building flanked by agents from ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations division. Handcuffed, Mahdawi threw up two peace signs to the camera but didn’t say a word as the agents put him in an unmarked car and drove off. Unlike other videos of ICE arrests, in which the targets appear confused or scared after being approached by plainclothes officers and told they’re under arrest, Mahdawi immediately understood what was happening to him. He knew it was a possibility before he even walked in. In ahabeas corpuspetitionfiled shortly after Mahdawi’s arrest, his attorneys wrote that 10 days after Trump’s inauguration, the far-right and Zionist group Betar US posted about Mahdawi on X, saying he was “on our deport list.” In a March Instagram post, Canary Mission, another right-wing group, said Mahdawi had “justified Hamas terrorism.” ‘Mr. Mahdawi was always willing to engage in dialogue with people whose views and beliefs differed from his own.’ Both Betar and Canary Mission have claimed that they’re providing lists of foreign students involved in anti-Israel advocacy to the Trump administration, which has conflated opposition to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians with antisemitism writ large. Canary Missionaddedan “Uncovering Foreign Nationals” page to its website in late March, which identifies foreign students that the group wants Trump to deport. That same month, Betarreportedly claimedit had “reason to believe” that Mahdawi and the Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha were “on the short list of those who will shortly be deported.” News of other students being arrested by ICE — including Columbia graduate studentMahmoud Khaliland Tufts University PhD candidateRumeysa Ozturk— gave Mahdawi’s attorneys time to prepare for his potential apprehension. Attorneys filed ahabeaspetition just hours after the arrest, requesting not only that Mahdawi be released on bond but that he not be removed from the countryorfrom the state of Vermont. Both Khalil and Ozturk were transferred to ICE detention facilities in Louisiana, where they remain incarcerated far from their attorneys and families — and in jurisdictions that are friendly to the Trump administration. On Monday, a federal judge in Vermont issued atemporary restraining orderprohibiting DHS from deporting Mahdawi for now. The order also forbade ICE from removing him from Vermont. Like others arrested by ICE for their pro-Palestine activism, Mahdawi is likely being targeted for statements that would have no legal repercussions if he were a US citizen. Under Trump’s “Executive Order 14188—Additional Measures To Combat Anti-Semitism,” government departments were ordered to come up with ways to “Combat Campus Anti-Semitism.” For DHS, that has meant arresting students involved with pro-Palestine activism. In a State Department memoobtained by theNew York Times, secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed, without evidence, that Mahdawi had “engaged in threatening rhetoric and intimidation of pro-Israeli bystanders.” Mahdawi’s lawyers denied Rubio’s assertion. Mahdawi remains detained for now. Advocates are calling for his release, noting that he has spoken out against both antisemitism and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians — a point also made in hishabeaspetition. “Mr. Mahdawi was always willing to engage in dialogue with people whose views and beliefs differed from his own,” it reads.The Interceptreports that in December 2023, Mahdawi got coffee with Shai Davidai, a Columbia professor and vocal supporter of Israel who is now gloating about his arrest. Around the same time he got coffee with Davidai, Mahdawi started meeting with a group of Israeli students at Columbia. “His compassion blew me away,” Roni Ziv, one of the Israeli students who attended the meetings,toldHaaretz. “Especially in the US, where people on the left often take an ‘anti-normalization’ stance — he didn’t. The fact that I served in the military wasn’t a dealbreaker for him. That’s rare.” Helali describes Mahdawi as a “bridge-builder.” “[Mahdawi] is very much about reconciliation,” he says.

Huerta was a prominent labor activist during the 20th century, while Lozano was the president and CEO of the College Futures Foundation and is a member ofApple’s board of directors. Ross previously served as president and CEO of the health and wellness foundation The California Endowment, and OpenAI says Oliver is a “leader in government, technology, business and advocacy.” Their appointment comes just months after OpenAI announced itsplan to shift into a for-profit company. Several former OpenAI employeesopposed the changein a proposed amicus brief supportingElon Musk’s lawsuit against the company, which accuses it of abandoning its original mission of helping humanity. Acoalition of nonprofit, labor, and philanthropic leadershave also urged California Attorney General Rob Bonta to probe OpenAI’s transformation into a for-profit company. “As we’ve said, OpenAI’s nonprofit isn’t going anywhere—and this commission will be key to expanding its reach and impact,” OpenAI says in the announcement. “The commission’s goal is to help ensure that our nonprofit becomes a force multiplier for communities and mission-driven organizations tackling urgent global challenges—from health and education to public service and scientific discovery.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "There are deals to be had on every model right now, from the latest entry-level models to the noise-canceling AirPods Pro. There are deals to be had on every model right now, from the latest entry-level models to the noise-canceling AirPods Pro. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newAirPods MaxandAirPods 4(with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do thelatest AirPods Pro with USB-C. The same goes for the original AirPods Max, which are nearly indistinguishable from the last-gen model aside from the switch to a USB-C connector and a few new color options. Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max. Apple’s AirPods 4 improve on previous models with better sound, clearer voice calls, and an even more comfortable design. For $50 extra, you can purchase a model with active noise cancellation and wireless charging. The fancier version of the new AirPods 4 offer support for active noise cancellation, a wireless charging case that can use either Qi or Apple Watch pads, and a speaker in the case that chirps to help you find it. At itsSeptember event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments. The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app. Although they launched at the end of last year, we’ve consistently been seeing discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. We recently saw the standard AirPods 4 drop to as low as $99.99 ($30 off), but right now the best deal is available atAmazonandWalmart, where you can buy them for $119 ($10 off). The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, meanwhile, are on sale for $168.99 ($11 off) atAmazonandWalmart, which is $20 shy of their all-time low. The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features aUSB-C charging caseand an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used withApple’s new Vision Pro headsetanddoubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids. As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available atAmazon,Walmart, andBest Buyfor $189.99 ($60 off). That’s a little less than their typical sale price, and $64 shy of their all-time low of $153.99, which we last saw at the end of December. Apple’s AirPods Max feature exemplary build quality, sound phenomenal, and keep up with the best at noise cancellation.Read our review. The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not thebest noise-canceling headphonesfor most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user. At the beginning of September, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with anew modelthat features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. They’re currently on sale atAmazon,Best Buy, andWalmartfor $479.99 ($70 off), which is their second-best price to date and $30 shy of their all-time low. Keep in mind that you can also occasionally pick up the first-gen model for less than $400, but right now we’re not seeing any deals of note on Apple’s original headphones.

The new Library is rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users. byJay Peters OpenAI is adding an image library to ChatGPT to make it easier to access your AI-generated images, the company announced today. It’s rolling out to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and on the web. Ina short video, OpenAI shows how it works. From the ChatGPT sidebar, you’ll be able to see a new “Library” section. Tap into it and you can see a grid of images that you’ve created. The video also briefly shows a button hovering at the bottom of the screen to make a new image. I already have the library available in the ChatGPT iOS app, and it works like OpenAI’s video shows. I don’t seem to have it yet on the web, but I would guess it will roll out there in a matter of time. The feature seems like it could be useful if you use ChatGPT to make a lot of images.

    "article_text": "Financial support for the system that tracks publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities expires on April 16th. Financial support for the system that tracks publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities expires on April 16th. byEmma Roth Funding is about to run out for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program – a system used by major companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Intel, and AMD to identify and track publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The program helps engineers identify how bad an exploit is and how to prioritize applying patches or other mitigations. MITRE, the federally funded organization behind the program, confirmed toThe Vergethat its contract to “develop, operate, and modernize” CVE will expire on April 16th. First launched in 1999, the CVE program houses a database whereparticipating organizationscan assign IDs to known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The IDs consist of the letters “CVE” followed by a year and a number, such as CVE-2022-27254, allowing security professionals to monitor details about the vulnerabilities that may impact the devices we use every day and systems that contain information critical to practically everything we do. Lukasz Olejnik, a security and privacy researcher,said in a post on Xthat a lack of support for CVE could “cripple” cybersecurity systems around the globe. “The consequence will be a breakdown in coordination between vendors, analysts, and defense systems — no one will be certain they are referring to the same vulnerability,” Olejnik wrote. “Total chaos, and a sudden weakening of cybersecurity across the board.” “The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource,” Yosry Barsoum, MITRE’s vice president and director at the Center for Securing the Homeland, said in an emailed statement toThe Verge. Barsoum also said the change will affect the Common Weakness Enumeration program, which catalogs hardware and software weaknesses. The news was first spotted in aleaked letter to CVE board membersposted on X and Bluesky. MITRE receives funding from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to “operate and evolve the CVE Program as an independent, objective third party,” according toa video about the program.

The possibility was discussed on Monday via internal emails shown by the FTC as Zuckerberg testified duringMeta’s antitrust trial. Zuckerberg floated the idea of considering “wiping everyone’s graphs” — their friends lists — “and having them start again,” possibly once a year, notedThe Vergedeputy editor Alex Heath, who observed the testimony inside the courtroom. Meta’s CEO said he was concerned that Facebook’s “cultural relevance is decreasing quickly.” Zuckerberg proposed a staggered approach, like starting with an experiment in a smaller country, in case too many people quit Facebook in response to the move. “Even if [Instagram] and [WhatsApp] do well,” he said, “I don’t see a way for our company to succeed in the way we need if FB falters, so we need to get this right.” Head of Facebook Tom Allison replied, saying he wasn’t sure the idea was “viable given my understanding of how vital the friend use case is” to Instagram,according toBusiness Insider.The outlet says that, in his reply, Zuckerberg also asked “how much work it would be to convert profiles to a follow model.” When a Federal Trade Commission attorney reminded Zuckerberg about the idea during questioning on Monday,Business Insiderwrites that the executive replied, “As far as I can tell, we never did that.” Meta has taken a different approach to revitalizing the Facebook experience lately, with the recentintroduction of a revamped friends tabthat doesn’t show algorithmic content to users. In January,Zuckerberg saidthat a big focus for the company this year would be to “get back to some OG Facebook.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Blackmagic Design says tariffs have made camera price hikes ‘unavoidable’",
    "article_text": "﻿The impact on Blackmagic’s supply chain has also made US production financially unviable. ﻿The impact on Blackmagic’s supply chain has also made US production financially unviable. byJess Weatherbed Blackmagic Design, an Australia-based digital cinematography camera company, was gearing up to start making products in the United States before the Trump administration blew a tariff-shaped hole in its plans. Now, not only is Blackmagic having to increase prices in the US to mitigate some of the levies on imported goods, but those same tariffs are also making it difficult to justify opening a US production line. “We were planning to build a new factory in Dallas, Texas, to streamline our supply chain and allow us to work more directly with US semiconductor companies,” Blackmagic Design spokesperson Patrick Hussey toldThe Verge. The introduction and ever-shifting confusion around President Donald Trump’s blanket global tariffs have since complicated things according to Hussey, because while the semiconductor parts and PCBs used in Blackmagic’s cameras are sourced from US companies, those companies are importing them from overseas. “If we proceed with the US factory, we’d incur tariffs on those parts, increasing costs and negating the savings we anticipated,” said Hussey. It’s a no-win situation thatmany other businesses in and outside of the US are facingif they deal with global suppliers. While Trump has brazenly declared that tariffs will incentivize companies to bring manufacturing to the US to remain competitive, if these manufacturers use foreign equipment or materials in their supply chain, they may — directly or indirectly — still get hit with hefty import fees. (That’s leaving aside the cost of doing business when the fees change dramatically from day to day.) Asupply chain survey conducted byCNBCfound that 61 percent of respondents from unspecified businesses would be financially better off moving from high-tariff countries to lower-tariffed countries instead of the US, and 81 percent said if they did relocate to the US, they would automate production instead of hiring human workers, failing to deliver the manufacturing jobs Trump promised. 61 percent of the companies also warned they would raise prices for products coming in under the new tariff rates. Blackmagic Design customers have already noticed a price hike has been applied to all products sold in the US, with the new Pyxis 12K briefly listed at $6,600 after initially being marketed at $5,000. This has since fallen to $5,500 afterBlackmagic announced it had moved Pyxis productionto lessen the tariff impact, butprices in every country besides the UShave remained completely unscathed. “Due to new government tariffs, price increases in the US have been unavoidable,” said Hussey. “That said, we operate factories in several countries, so production of some product lines has been relocated to reduce the impact on our customers.” Hussey toldThe Vergethat Blackmagic is now planning to “wait a few months” to see if the supply chain for the components it needs will move to the US. “If it does, we could still achieve the supply chain benefits we were aiming for.” The Trump Administration added “smartphones, computers, and other electronics” toits list of tariff exemptions last week— a list with no clear carveout for cameras or camera-specific manufacturing equipment — but then swiftly warned that companies shouldn’t get comfy. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said these are not “a permanent sort of exemption,” and that these goods will be hit with the same unspecified tariff rules that Trump is expected toapply to the semiconductor industryin “a month or two.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The man identifies himself in the statement as \"S\" in order to protect his identity. Please call me 'S.' This is not the name given to me by my parents when I was born. I am choosing a new name for myself, and I will use that name as I reclaim control over my life and my future. My name is my choice, and it is the first of many choices I will make for myself now that I am free. I am a survivor of more than 20 years of captivity and domestic abuse. I was held prisoner in my home from the time I was taken out of the fourth grade at age 11 until two months ago at age 31 when I purposely set the fire that helped set me free. I am speaking out today to begin the process of reclaiming my life and to have my say in how my story is told. I am much better and stronger than I was the day the first responders carried me out of my home. I am beyond grateful for the care I have received since then. To all the health care professionals who have helped and nurtured me, thank you. In addition to all of your care, I appreciated the chance to have my first ever birthday party to celebrate turning 32. I also want to thank the first responders, the law enforcement investigators and everyone who is working to hold those responsible for my abuse accountable. Thank you to everyone at Safe Haven Waterbury and everyone who has given to the GoFundMe page that will help cover some of the overwhelming expenses I will face in the weeks, months and years to come. I am grateful to the conservator and my attorney, who will help guide me through the legal process ahead. They have been invaluable to me, and I am grateful for their tireless support. Much has already been said that tells part of the story of the abuse I endured. Someday, perhaps my whole story will be told. I ask everyone involved in my story to fully cooperate with the authorities who are helping me seek justice for these crimes. I also ask the public and the media to respect those investigations and my privacy as this process plays out. This isn't just a story. It's my life. Thank you all for your thoughts and messages, your support and your continued prayers as I recover. Please forward any inquiries about my recovery, requests for information or interviews, or the process ahead to David Guarino at Survivors Say, who has volunteered to serve as my spokesman. Thank you. The statement comes on the heels of police releasingdozens of photos showing the interior of the home. The disturbing photos show the home where the 32-year-old man said he was held captive. The images also capture damage from the fire he said he set in order to get free.

    "title": "Meta CEO Zuckerberg pushes back against FTC claims on Day 2 of trial",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 15, 2025 / 5:53 PM EDT/ AP Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as ahistoric antitrust trialalleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day. Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses. Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive. While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\" But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product. Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat. \"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said. In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\" Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments. The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps. \"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation…  building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers. \"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said. The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Facebook bought Instagram — which was a photo-sharing app with no ads — for $1 billion in 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" — a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\" \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is presiding over the case. Late last year, he denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. © 2025 The Associated Press.

    "title": "Gayle King says she can \"take on anything\" after space journey",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 15, 2025 / 5:41 PM EDT/ CBS News \"CBS Mornings\" co-hostGayle Kingconquered her fears Monday as shetraveled to the edge of spacewith anall-women crew on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. Journeying to space isn't something King said she ever dreamed of doing. Prior to the historicspaceflight, she even admitted she's a nervous flyer. \"I'm very safe right here on the ground,\" King said prior to the launch. To calm her nerves before embarking on the spaceflight,Kinginvited meditation teacher Bob Roth to her home. \"So I want you to close your eyes … and then I want you to begin your meditation, your mantra,\" Roth told King as he taught her techniques that she would use once she arrived in Texas. In West Texas where the rocket launched, King met with Sarah Knights who prepares astronauts at Blue Origin. She's also a trained high-speed driver. At the Astronaut Training Center, Knights explained everything from pre-launch to landing. \"We're throwing a lot at you,\" she told King. Knights said the astronauts have two phrases they can use up to 2 minutes and 30 seconds prior to liftoff, \"timeout\" and \"I will not fly.\" She said \"I will not fly\" removes an individual from the flight, which no one has ever done. On \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday, King said she didn't come close to using either phrase. \"I just think when you go through all of that and all of the preparation that Blue Origin did, that never crossed my mind,\" she said. In the training capsule, Knights went over the sounds King and her crewmates would hear before the rocket launches. \"You're going to hear the fans turn on and you're going to hear some sound from the rocket,\" Knights said as she explained the process. \"Thump, thump, thump — that's the rocket underneath you getting ready to light the engine.\" They ran through the entire mission and after the first day of practice, King felt more prepared, saying, \"I'm hoping that it will be second nature to me by Monday.\" At Astronaut Village, King first saw her official flight suit. The soon-to-be astronaut immediately noticed it said \"King\" on it. \"This is official … wow,\" she said. \"Here's something I never thought I'd see, me in an astronaut suit.\" Blue Origin also needed to take inventory of her flight payload bag that was filled with personal items that could come along for the journey. King brought her grandson Luca's favorite stuffed toy, Tamir, from Sesame Street. However, she learned the bag would get stowed under her seat, so Tamir wouldn't be accessible during the flight. \"My dream was to hold him up while I'm floating and say 'this is Tamir,'\" King said. To help, Sesame Street was able to ship a much smaller Tamir to King overnight. With Tamir in tow, King and the rest of the crew got familiar with the New Shepard rocket and learned more about what to expect — preparing for every scenario leading up to launch day. On Monday, launch day, the crew took an emotional ride to the launchpad, preparing for liftoff. In addition to King, pop starKaty Perry, journalist and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe and civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen were aboard the spaceflight. The crew rang the bell as they approached the capsule and took their seats inside. Shortly after liftoff, the crew made it to the edge of space with just minutes to take in the life-changing view. The total time of the spaceflight from liftoff to landing was approximately 10 minutes and 21 seconds. When King exited the spacecraft, she kissed the ground in celebration. \"I am so proud of me right now,\" she said shortly after landing. \"This was not a ride. What happened to us, this was a bona fide freakin' flight.\" Shedescribed the experienceas \"peaceful\" and \"oddly quiet\" as she looked down at Earth. Shooting for the stars, King showed you can always overcome your fears. \"I stepped out of my comfort zone in a way I never thought was possible for me,\" she said. \"Now that I've done it, I really do feel I can take on anything.\" On Tuesday, King said while she wouldn't travel to space anytime soon, she would do it again. \"Now that I've been through it, I know now that I could do it again,\" she said.

    "title": "How to request a tax extension from the IRS",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 15, 2025 / 5:21 PM EDT/ CBS News If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off. Normally, the IRSrecommendsthat people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, atax extensiongives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty. As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes,accordingto the IRS. The tax agencysaidin January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed. Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an AprilTaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected. If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind. The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions. U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns. This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for13 statesdue to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file. The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. Theonline payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension. Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filingextensionwhile using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software. Another option is to file aForm 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS. Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRSsays, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15. Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%. The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline. Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to areasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says. The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on theIRS website.

    "title": "Video shows elephants shielding calves during California earthquake",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 15, 2025 / 5:09 PM EDT/ CBS/AP As the ground shook from a5.2-magnitude earthquake, a herd of elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park sprung into action to protect their young. Avideo shot of their enclosureat the park Monday morning shows the five African elephants standing around in the morning sun before the camera shakes and they run in different directions. Then the older elephants — Ndlula, Umngani and Khosi — scramble to encircle and shield the two 7-year-old calves, Zuli and Mkhaya. They remain huddled for several minutes as the older elephants look outward, appearing to be at the ready, their ears spread and flapping — even after the rocking stopped. \"Elephants have the unique ability to feel sounds through their feet and formed what is known as an 'alert circle' during the 5.2 magnitude earthquake that shook Southern California this morning,\" the safaripark wrote on a Facebook reelshowing the pachyderms scrambling to protect the calves. The park called the behavior \"a natural response to perceived threats.\" The quake was felt from San Diego to Los Angeles, 120 miles away. Seismologist Dr. Lucy Jonestold CBS Los Angelesthe earthquake is likely associated with the Elsinore Fault, which is a branch of the larger San Andreas Fault system. Jones said the depth of the quake was about eight miles below the surface of the Earth. The quake sent boulders tumbling onto rural roads in San Diego County and knocked items off store shelves in the tiny mountain town of Julian near the epicenter but caused no injuries or major damage. But it spooked the elephants. Once in a circle, \"they sort of freeze as they gather information about where the danger is,\" said Mindy Albright, a curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Elephants are highly intelligent and social animals. In an \"alert circle,\" the young are typically clustered in the center and the adults face outward to defend the group. In the video, one of the calves can be seen running for refuge between the adults, a group of matriarchs that all helped raise her. But the other calf, the only male, remained on the edge of the circle, wanting to show his courage and independence, Albright said. Meanwhile, the female elephant, Khosi, a teenager who helped raise him along with his biological mother, Ndlula, repeatedly tapped him on the back with her trunk, and even on the face, as if patting him to say, \"Things are OK,\" and \"Stay back in the circle.\" Zuli is still a baby and is coddled as such, Albright said, but his role will change over the next few years as he becomes a bull and moves to join a bachelor group while the female elephants stay with the family unit for their entire lives. \"It's so great to see them doing the thing we all should be doing — that any parent does, which is protect their children,\" Albright said. About an hour later when an aftershock hit, they briefly huddled again and then dispersed once they determined everyone was safe. At least seven aftershocks were immediately reported after the initial quake, CBS Los Angeles reported, with the strongest one registering at 4.0-magnitude. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 15, 2025 / 5:06 PM EDT/ CBS News \"CBS Mornings\" co-hostGayle Kingreturned safely to Earth on Monday after a roughly 10-minute journey to the edge of space with an all-women crew aboardBlue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft. \"I am so proud of me right now,\" King said shortly after landing. \"This was not a ride. What happened to us, this was a bona fide freakin' flight.\" The spacecraft reached an altitude of 346,802 feet, with the mission lasting 10 minutes and 21 seconds from launch to landing. The crew experienced weightlessness and viewed Earth from a unique perspective. During the flight, King's excitement was captured on audio as she urged her fellowcrew membersto look at the celestial view. \"The moon. You guys,\" she could be heard saying. \"Look at the moon.\" King described the experience of being in space as \"oddly quiet\" and \"peaceful,\" adding that looking down at Earth was profound. \"You look down at the planet and you think that's where we came from? To me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better, be better,\" she said. Upon landing in West Texas, King was seen kissing the ground in celebration and relief. King, who recently turned 70, admitted she had been terrified of flying but found courage through themission's extensive preparation. \"Our instructor said I am her best success story. She's never had somebody go through the course who is terrified of flying,\" King said. King said she thought about Eleanor Roosevelt's quote about courage during the flight. \"I stepped out of my comfort zone in a way I never thought was possible for me. I really do feel I can take on anything. Anything. Anything,\" King said. Thecrew, including singer Katy Perry, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA rocket scientistAisha Bowe,and civil rights activistAmanda Nguyen, was assembled by journalist and philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, fiancée of Blue Origin founderJeff Bezos. Sánchez formed what King described as a \"true sisterhood\" during their journey. \"We are forever bonded because you can't go through what we went through to look out for each other, to help each other and not be changed by that,\" she said. When asked if she regretted the experience, King responded definitively: \"I am glad I did it. I am very glad. I have no regrets about doing it.\" As for what's next for King, she's looking to conquer another fear. \"I may now get my ears pierced, I have always been afraid,\" said King. In a touching moment during the flight, King revealed pop superstar Perry sang \"What a Wonderful World\" after the crew returned to their seats following the zero-gravity portion of the journey. \"The best part was when we got back in our seats after zero Gs, Katy sang 'What a Wonderful World,'\" King said. She explained that the crew had been asking Perry to sing throughout the trip, suggesting hits like \"Roar\" or \"Firework,\" but Perry declined. \"It's not about me. I wanted to talk about the world,\" Perry told her crew mates.

    "title": "Trump is using federal agencies to make life in the U.S. untenable for undocumented immigrants",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is waging a concerted pressure campaign against undocumented immigrants — as well as hundreds of thousands here legallywhose status it is trying to revoke. The measures threaten to make daily life more untenable for millions as President Donald Trump aims to carry out the immigrant purging he promised during his campaign. Trump has escalated his clampdown on immigrants beyond what was done during his first presidential term, which includedseparating children from their parents at the border, working to builda border wall betweenthe United States and Mexico andcurbing legal immigration throughfewer visas and refugee admissions. This time around, on top of immigration raids and arrests, the administration is inflicting hardship on immigrants by pulling multiple levers of government to undercut their day-to-day lives. The administration is threatening criminal charges against immigrants without legal status who do notregister with the government. It has given Immigration and Customs Enforcementaccess to previously confidential taxpayer information to locate immigrantsandcanceled Social Security numbers of thousandsof immigrants by marking “illegal immigrants” as being dead. Officials have canceledparole that the Biden administration granted to some groups. A federal judge hasblocked the revocations temporarily. “What we are seeing now is this full-court press by the government on immigration,” said Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit immigrant rights advocacy organization whose funding to provide legal help to unaccompanied immigrant childrenTrump cut. The many actions are all parts of the administration’s strategy to subtract as many immigrants from the United States as possible without having to go through more cumbersome deportation processes. The Trump actions build on an “attrition through enforcement” strategy tried in 2010 with state anti-immigration laws,a strategy pushed by Kris Kobach, a former attorney general of Kansas who has championed conservative causes. Dataobtained by NBC News showsthat the Trump administration’s deportations are running slightly behinddeportations under President Joe Biden at the same time last year, even though Trump has made mass deportations one of his main priorities since he assumed office. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made it clear recently what level of departures the administration wants to see. At a recent Cabinet meeting, she said, “We got 20, 21 million people that need to go home.\" Republicans and conservatives have long used about 20 million as the number of undocumented people in the country, though longtime analyseshave pegged the number atcloser to 11 million to 12 million. As is evident in the case ofKilmar Abrego Garcia— a Maryland man who a Justice Department official said wasmistakenly deportedto a prison in El Salvador — the administration iswilling to push theedge of thelegal envelopeto meet its mass deportation goal. At a contentious hearing Tuesday, a U.S. district judge ordered the administration to provide evidence of any steps it has taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \"Over 77 million people delivered a resounding Election Day mandate in November to secure our borders, mass deport criminal illegal migrants, and enforce our immigration laws,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told NBC News in a statement. \"The Trump administration is aligned on a whole-of-government approach to deliver on this mandate to once again put Americans and America First.” He did not respond to questions about criticism of the administration's actions or about any spillover effects on U.S. citizens. White Housepresssecretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday that Trumpwould sign an order preventing undocumented immigrants from getting Social Security benefits. But undocumented immigrants, and many people legally working, are already prohibited from receiving Social Security payouts or Medicare, said Marielena Hincapié, a distinguished immigration fellow and visiting scholar at Cornell Law School. She said Trump's latest order is \"continued fearmongering and disinformation because, in fact, undocumented immigrants pay into Social Security but are never eligible to get those benefits.\" \"On the one hand, the rhetoric of Trump has been about focusing on the undocumented immigrants and the worst 'criminals,' etc., but what we've actually seen from a policymaking perspective is they are actually taking people's legal status away,\" Hincapié said. There are immigrants in the United States with different forms of legal status, such as Temporary Protected Status or work authorization that was granted while they were awaiting asylum claim outcomes, which makes them eligible to apply for Social Security numbers. But getting Social Security numbers does not mean they are eligible for benefits, Hincapié said. \"There are separate laws dating all the way to the 1996 welfare reform law that indicate who is eligible for what program, and for most people, you have to have been a legal permanent resident — a green card holder — for at least five years to be a qualified legal immigrant that is eligible for certain benefits,\" she said. The administration has threatened penalties against undocumented immigrants 14 and older who fail to register with the government and carry proof they registered with them. To register, they must fill out a form that asks them not only about any crimes they may have been arrested for or charged with, but also any they committed but for which they were not prosecuted, said Bill Hing, founder of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Thelaw to register has existed for decades buthadnot previouslybeen enforced. Hing questioned how Trump would enforce the required registration, because, he said, trying to get someone indicted for not carrying registration papers would complicate and lengthen a deportation process. He acknowledged that the administration might try to make an example of a case or two. But the requirement \"is a mechanism to induce people, to coerce people, into exposing themselves,\" he said. In addition, Hing said, if he were representing people arrested for failing to register, he would argue they have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, since they are asked to admit to crimes when they fill out the forms. \"I don't know about you, but I've jaywalked. I've sped,\" he said. \"I think someone being prosecuted has a very good Fifth Amendment argument not to register.\" While the immigration crackdown actions are aimed at immigrants, they are affecting citizens, too. In early April, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner posted on social media that he had directed HUD offices to ensure HUD programs do not benefit undocumented immigrants. People here illegally cannot get federal subsidized housing. But an estimated 25,000 families in public housing include at least one U.S. citizen and at least one person without legal immigration status, according to the National Housing Law Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization. The citizen would be eligible for the housing. Marie Claire Tran-Leung, an attorney for the National Housing Law Project, said Trump and Turner are trying to deploy HUD \"to scare immigrant families into self-evicting.\" Whether the administration's measures will force out enough immigrants to satisfy Trump and his base is unknown. But Hincapié said that with the administration moving “so rapidly” and in a “chaotic way,” some U.S. citizens may get caught in the immigration dragnet. For instance, some could end up wrongly classified as dead and their Social Security numbers put in the agency's death file, she said. \"Are they going to do the same thing they are doing with Kilmar [Abrego Garcia] of saying, 'Oops, sorry, we made a mistake and we can't do anything about it now'?\"",

    "title": "Maryland senator says he will travel to El Salvador on Wednesday to push for Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Sen. Chris Van Hollen announced that he will travel to El Salvador on Wednesday to push for the release ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who the Justice Department said itmistakenly deported. “My hope is to visit Kilmar and check on his wellbeing and to hold constructive conversations with government officials around his release. We must urgently continue working to return Kilmar safely home to Maryland,” Van Hollen, D-Md., said in a statement Tuesday night, calling Abrego Garcia’s deportation “unlawful” and an “abduction.” Follow live politics coverage here Van Hollen plans to travel after he sent a letter to El Salvador's ambassador to the United States on Monday asking for a meeting with PresidentNayib Bukele, who said in a meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump earlier that day that he “of course” would not send Abrego Garcia back to the country. Several Democratic lawmakers have said this week that they are willing to travel to El Salvador to seek the man's release. \"We must all stand as a united front against the kidnapping and illegal detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador,\" progressive Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla.,said onX, tagging Van Hollen. \"Senator, I am willing to join you and help Organize other members of the House to do the same.\" Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz.,shared Frost's post, writing that she was \"ready to join\" her colleagues in traveling to El Salvador to demand Abrego Garcia's release. Frost and Ansari have not announced plans to join Van Hollen on his trip. A spokesperson for Frost did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kaitlin Hooker, a spokesperson for Ansari, said in a statement Tuesday night that if a Democratic \"delegation is created and approved by Chairman Comer and Speaker Johnson, Rep Ansari absolutely plans to attend.\" Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., is chair of the House Oversight Committee, whose members include Frost and Ansari. Comer's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night on whether he would approve such a delegation. The push to return Abrego Garcia to the United States began after Justice Department officials acknowledged that he should not have been sent to El Salvador because of a 2019 order from an immigration judge, who barred him from being sent to the country because he might be subject to persecution. In a decision last week, the Supreme Courttold the administrationto \"facilitate\" his return. President Donald Trumpsaid in an interviewwith Fox Noticias that aired Tuesday night that it was up to El Salvador’s government whether Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States. Meanwhile, an official at the Department of Homeland Security said in a court filing Tuesday that the federal governmentcould “facilitate”Abrego Garcia’s entry into the United States — echoing the Supreme Court language — if he appeared at a port of entry. However, the official added, Abrego Garcia could run the risk of being removed a second time upon his return. At a court hearing Tuesday afternoon, the judge presiding over Abrego Garcia’s case said she isweighing contempt proceedingsagainst the Trump administration over its inaction to bring Abrego Garcia back. Trump administration officials have argued that the situation is out of their hands now that Abrego Garcia is in the custody of another country. During his White House visit Monday, Bukele called the question of returning him \"preposterous.\" \"How can I return him to the United States? Like if I smuggle him into the United States?\" Bukeletold reporters. \"Of course I’m not going to do it.\" The White House has shown no signs of pushing for Abrego Garcia's return, and Trump has repeatedly touted his push to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador, where they have been transferred to a notorious prison. The administration has also deported people using the rarely invokedAlien Enemies Act,though the matter is now tied up in court. During Bukele’s White House visit, Trumpalso floated the ideaof deporting U.S. citizens, a move that immigration advocates and law experts panned, with one law professor calling the idea “pretty obviously illegal and unconstitutional.” Van Hollen said after the White House meeting that he believes Bukele \"will reconsider when he understands the full story of this illegal detention.\" \"I don’t think he wants to essentially be the president who’s kidnapped the United States citizen,\" he added. Van Hollen told reporters Monday that the Salvadoran Embassy had received his request to meet Bukele but that he has not heard back.",

    "title": "Atlanta Braves broadcast slammed for 'gross' moment when reporter asks for fans' numbers",
    "article_text": "Fellow journalists are calling out a sports reporter over an inappropriate moment during the Atlanta Braves broadcast Monday night when he asked for female fans' phone numbers on the air. Wiley Ballard, a sideline reporter with FanDuel Sports Network, was interviewing two fans at the rooftop of the Rogers Centre in Toronto during the Braves-Blue Jays game. He asked whether if they would consider rooting for Atlanta before he threw it back to the broadcast team. Braves play-by-play announcer Brandon Gaudin, in the booth, then suggested getting both of the women's phone numbers. \"OK Wiley, you got five innings, four innings to get the numbers,\" Gaudin said. \"Get us some more Braves fans.\" Ballard pulled out his phone and told the women he was being asked to get their numbers. It was suggested among Ballard, Gaudin and analyst C.J. Nitkowski that that was a new way to pick up women. \"This might be the new move,\" Nitkowski said. Many other journalists were appalled by the segment and called out the unprofessional moment on social media. Ralph Vacchiano, an NFL writer for Fox Sports, described it as a standard for harassment and blamed all the people involved in the broadcast. \"An unprofessional disgrace, from the reporter, to the guys in the booth, to the producer in the truck who could've stopped it at any point,\" Vacchiano wrote on X. Ben Baby, an ESPN reporter who covers the Cincinnati Bengals, called it a \"terrible look all the way around.\" \"Feels like there were several moments in which someone could have said this wasn’t a good idea,\"Baby said in a post. Associated Press White House correspondent Seung Min Kim simplywrote on X: “this is gross.” Women in the industry also said the moment represented a double standard. \"Imagine if a female reporter did anything like this,\" Chelsea Janes, who covers baseball for The Washington Post,wrote on X. \"Career over. Pretty brutal to see it glorified by the broadcast.\" Dani Sureck, a reporter covering the Arizona Cardinals, asked whether people were still going to ask \"women in sports if they’re only doing their job to date athletes??\" \"We can all agree how inappropriate and nasty this is, not to mention the double standard, right?\"Sureck wrote. Ballard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Gaudin and the Braves also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "title": "Autism rates have risen to 1 in 31 school-age children, CDC reports",
    "article_text": "One in 31 children in the United States are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by their 8th birthday, theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionreported Tuesday. The finding, based on an analysis of medical records from 2022, reflects adramatic rise in autismover the past two decades. PreviousCDC reportsshowed that 1 in 54 8-year-olds had been diagnosed with autism in 2016. In 2000, it was 1 in 150. “The most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common presentations of autism are,” said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report. Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder. Doctors are better than ever at identifying autism, with awareness at an all-time high. “Without a doubt, we’ve become exceptionally efficient in this surveillance work,” Warren said. In a statement Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “the autism epidemic has now reached a scale unprecedented in human history.” The phrase “autism epidemic” doesn’t sit well with Dr. Alex Kolevzon, who’s been working with people with autism for more than two decades. Kolevzon, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and clinical director of the Seaver Autism Center at Mount Sinai in New York City, agreed that the increase is likely to stem from increased awareness and diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorder. He was not associated with the new report. “Parents shouldn’t panic,” he said. “We’re not seeing an epidemic with autism.” The report comes from the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, a biennial surveillance program that takes a snapshot of prevalence and characteristics of how doctors identify autism spectrum disorder among kids at ages 4 and 8. Data was collected from 16 sites in 14 states, including Arizona, California, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, and Puerto Rico. Autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds in the new report were estimated at 1 in 34. Boys were three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism. Diagnoses were also more common among Black and Hispanic children compared with white children, most likely reflecting increased awareness. Answers are both inconclusive and wildly complicated. Potential causes have been scrutinized for decades, and there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun. The leading theory lies in genetics. “We have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,” Warren said. “We may have hundreds, if not thousands, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.” Despite proven research to the contrary,Kennedyhas repeatedly suggested that vaccines— specifically the shots that protect against measles, mumps and rubella — are linked to autism. Thatlink has been widely debunked, but it continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the U.S. — even amid a growing measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young children in Texas. “There’s a lot of things that we do not understand as of yet about autism, but one thing for certainty is that vaccines do not cause autism,” Kolevzon said. “This has been studied extensively among multiple continents, and it’s been well established in the scientific community.” The disorder appears to be a focus of the Trump administration. President Donald Trump and Kennedy have said it’s critical to find what’s causing autism in kids. “President Trump has tasked me with identifying the root causes of the childhood chronic disease epidemic — including autism,” Kennedy said in a statement Tuesday. “We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September.” It was unclear how the HHS effort would be different from previous research.",

    "title": "Federal employee alleges DOGE activity resulted in data breach at labor board",
    "article_text": "A federal cybersecurity specialist has alleged in a whistleblower statement made public Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) caused a security breach at the National Labor Relations Board and may have illegally removed sensitive data from the board. The specialist, Daniel Berulis, made the allegations ina sworn declarationsubmitted to members of Congress and to a federal whistleblower office, asking them to investigate what he called a cybersecurity breach. His lawyer said that Berulis had also been targeted with a threatening note and photographs showing him near where he lives. The declaration wasfirst reported by NPR, and NBC News has not independently verified the allegations. The whistleblower report, which NBC News has reviewed a copy of, comes as DOGE and Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk continue to facemultiple lawsuitsquestioning their accessto computer systemsacross the federal government. Berulis, who works at the labor board, wrote in the declaration that within days of DOGE staffers arriving in March, he noticed a series of “anomalous” events in the board’s computer systems. Those included changes to the use of multi-factor authentication, which is a widely used security protocol, and internal alerting systems being switched off, he wrote in the 14-page statement. He also wrote that he tracked what appeared to be the outbound transfer of around 10 gigabytes or more of data — “the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias” if the data were all text files, he wrote. He wrote that the removal was “extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB’s databases.” The database accessed by DOGE contained personally identifiable information of “claimants and respondents with pending matters before the agency” as well as confidential business information gathered during investigations, he wrote. He added that after DOGE gained access to the labor board’s systems, there was an increase in attempted logins from locations outside the United States including from a user with an internet protocol (IP) address in Russia. He wrote that the person with the Russian IP address appeared to have a correct username and password, created minutes earlier by DOGE engineers, and was blocked from logging in only because of their location. “Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming,” Berulis wrote. Berulis included in his disclosure several screenshots from a computer workstation that he says are evidence of data being transferred. He wrote that he has almost two decades of experience in his field and that he has held a Top Secret security clearance. Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that DOGE had been transparent about its work at the NLRB. “It is months-old news that President Trump signed an Executive Order to hire DOGE employees at agencies and coordinate data sharing,” she said. “Their highly-qualified team has been extremely public and transparent in its efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse across the Executive Branch, including the NLRB,” she added. Her statement did not address the alleged transfer of data. The NLRB and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a comment to NPR, an NLRB spokesperson denied that the agency had granted DOGE access to its systems, said DOGE had not requested access to the agency’s systems and said that an internal investigation conducted after Berulis raised his concerns “determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.” In litigation about DOGE’s access to federal data, although not specifically at the NLRB, the Justice Departmenthas argued that DOGE enjoys sweeping authorityto access data under an executive order that Trump signed on the first day of his second term. Thatexecutive orderdirects all agency heads to “take all necessary steps” to ensure that DOGE “has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems” to the “extent consistent with law.” It was not immediately clear if Berulis’ disclosure would lead to an investigation. Two lawmakers to whom Berulis addressed his disclosure did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Andrew Bakaj, a lawyer representing Berulis in his capacity as a whistleblower, wrote in a letter to members of Congress that he believed the conduct at issue violated the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, a 2014 law designed to safeguard government data, as well as the federal Privacy Act. “As you are certainly aware, the practical, legal, and national security implications of such an intrusion are vast,” Bakaj wrote. The lawyer also wrote that on April 7, while Berulis was preparing his written statement, someone physically taped a threatening note to his home door along with photographs taken via a drone of him walking in his neighborhood. “The threatening note made clear reference to this very disclosure he was preparing for you, as the proper oversight authority. While we do not know specifically who did this, we can only speculate that it involved someone with the ability to access NLRB systems,” Bakaj wrote.",

    "article_text": "On Friday,federal authorities ordered Nicole Micheroni to leave the countrywithin seven days. Micheroni — a 40-year-old U.S. citizen, immigration attorney and Massachusetts resident —told MSNBCthat as of Tuesday, she has heard nothing from the Department of Homeland Security, which she believes mistakenly sent the notice that told her “it is time for you to leave the United States.” “The process is a mess right now,” she said. “DHS is not being careful.” The email came from a no-reply address, Micheroni said, and it informed her that her “parole” — which in immigration law allows noncitizens to enter or remain in the United States for limited periods of time — had been terminated, according to a screenshot of the email shared withNBC Boston. \"If you do not deport the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States,\" the email says. The notice was sent to her work email, Micheroni said, but it was different from the emails she typically gets from immigration authorities about clients. No name was included in the message, she said, nor was there a case number. Initially, Micheroni wasn't sure whether it was real. \"I kind of laughed at first, and then I was like, wait a minute,\" she said. \"This is very concerning.\" In a statement, a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security said a separate agency — Customs and Border Protection — is issuing parole termination notices to people who do not have lawful status to remain in the United States. \"CBP used the known email addresses of the alien to send notifications,\" the official said. \"If a non-personal email — such as an American citizen contact — was provided by the alien, notices may have been sent to unintended recipients. CBP is monitoring communications and will address any issues on a case-by-case basis.” To be clear: If you are an alien, being in the United States is a privilege—not a right. We are acting in the best interest of the country and enforcing the law accordingly.” A second U.S. citizen and Boston-area immigration attorney, Carmen Bello, told NBC Boston that she, too, received a notice of parole termination telling her to leave the country. \"They’re not even checking if it’s the attorney’s email or the applicant’s email,” Bello said, referring to migrants who have applied for parole. \"I think there’s a lack of responsibility on the department on sending the letters like this.”",

    "title": "Biden goes after Trump on Social Security in his first public post-presidency speech",
    "article_text": "CHICAGO — Former President Joe Biden used his first public remarks since he left office in January to rebuke the Trump administration’s approach to Social Security, saying its cuts were already putting the institution in peril for millions of deserving Americans. In roughly a half-hour of remarks Tuesday before disability advocates, Biden — often speaking in a subdued, hushed tone — did not mention President Donald Trump by name, referring to him instead as “this guy,” and held back from robust criticism of the administration. Biden more broadly took aim at Trump's tenure so far, saying that in “fewer than 100 days, this new administration has made so much ... damage and so much destruction. It’s kind of breathtaking.” \"We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are. Like I said, I've been doing this a long time. It's never been this divided,\" Biden said. \"Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart.\" It's not clear what group of people the 30% remark referred to. White House spokesman Steven Cheung sharply criticized Biden, saying his \"incoherent speech\" showed he had a \"feeble mind\" in a \"rapid decline to new lows.\" \"President Trump has repeatedly promised to protect Social Security and ensure higher take-home pay for seniors by ending the taxation of Social Security benefits. Anybody saying otherwise is either stupid or an all-out liar, or both in Biden’s case,\" Cheung said in a statement. After his election, Trump told NBC News that “we’re not touching Social Security,” other than to make it more efficient. But since Trump took taking office, billionaire Elon Musk has cut staffing at the agency. Musk also prompteda flare-upamong Trump allies after he called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\" Biden referred to the comment Tuesday. \"We heard others, empowered and emboldened by this administration, talk about Social Security; one of them called it a Ponzi scheme,\" Biden said. \"A Ponzi scheme — what the hell are they talking about? People earn these benefits. They paid into that benefit. They rely on that benefit. And no one, no one, no one should take it away.\" Biden also referred to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — also without naming him — painting him as detached from the average American. Biden cited comments Lutnick has made thathis mother-in-law wouldn’t complainif she didn’t get her next Social Security check. “The current secretary of commerce doesn’t seem to get it, or based on his comments, he doesn’t seem to even care,” Biden said. “He said his 94-year-old mother-in-law wouldn’t complain. Wouldn’t bother her. She’s probably a lovely woman. No kidding. Her-son-in-law is a billionaire. What about that 94-year-old mother living all by herself? Don’t have a billionaire in the family. All the retirees who depend on that monthly check to feed themselves. All those people with disabilities have no other source. What about all those?” Despite a regular churn of verbal abuse from Trump, it was the first time Biden has spoken publicly since he left the White House on Jan. 20. But on Tuesday, he did not offer a defense of himself or his own administration. At times, it was difficult to hear Biden — so much so that those in the room at the event remained still and quiet to hear him speak. Shortly after the speech,Trump put up a post on Truth Social, featuring a clipped video of Biden during the speech, saying, \"I had never seen, I'd never seen hardly any Black people in Scranton at the time, and I was only going on fourth grade. And I remember seeing the kids going by — at the time, called colored kids — on a bus going by.\" In context Trump left out, Biden went on to say that the fact that the bus went to a different school “sparked his outrage” as a kid and inspired him to get involved in politics. Trump routinely chastises Biden, having called him “theworst presidentin American history.” He frequently characterizes Biden’s tenure as a mess that his administration must now clean up, particularly with regard to border security. In the earliest days of his second term, Trump repeatedly blamed lagging economic indicators on Biden. Soon, however, it wasTrump’s own topsy-turvy tariff policiesthat threw the stock marketinto disarray. Biden spoke to a conference for Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled at the Sofitel Hotel on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile. The meeting focused on strengthening Social Security at a moment when the Trump administration hasset its sights on revampingthe agency in a way that beneficiaries fear could put them in peril. Last month, Biden spoke at a National High Schools Model United Nations event, but the speech it was not open to members of the media. Biden, 82, left office deeply at odds with his own party, which pressured him to abandon his re-election bid in the wake of a devastating presidential debate against Trump in June, when Biden struggled at times to express a clear thought. The debacle aggravatedlong-standing concernsabout hisage and mental capacity. Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, claimed the Democratic nomination and embarked on a whirlwind, 107-day campaign against Trump that shattered fundraising records, offering fleeting hope to the party. Ultimately, Harris went on to lose to Trump, including in each of six battleground states, as well as the popular vote. In January, Biden said in an interview thathe believed he could have defeated Trumphad he run again — but at the same time, he admitted in the USA Today interview that he was unsure he could have served out a full term.",

    "title": "New York prison guards indicted in connection with inmate's death, governor says",
    "article_text": "Multiple New York prison guards have been indicted in connection with the “disturbing” death of an inmate last month during a wildcat officers’ strike, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday. Messiah Nantwi, a prisoner at the Mid-State Correctional Facility, died at a hospital March 1following what other prisoners said was a severe beating by several guards. At the time, the state’s prisons were in a state of crisis caused by the walkout of thousands of prison personnel during an unauthorized 22-day strike that had forced the governor to call in the National Guard. “The tragic death of Mr. Nantwi at the hands of correction officers who are responsible for protecting the incarcerated population is deeply, deeply disturbing,” Hochul said in a brief video message. The governor didn’t immediately say how many guards had been indicted or reveal details about the charges. Her office did not respond to an email seeking more information. A special prosecutor investigating Nantwi’s death, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, said earlier Tuesday that a “noteworthy development” in the case will be presented to a judge in Utica on Wednesday — a signal that criminal charges might be imminent. The Rev. Kevin McCall, a spokesperson for Nantwi’s relatives, said family members planned on attending. The New York Timesinterviewed multiple inmatesat the prison who reported that Nantwi was severely beaten by correctional officers before he died. The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a court filing last month there was “probable cause to believe” that as many as nine correctional officers either caused or could be implicated in Nantwi’s death. Prison officials said Tuesday that seven officers have resigned in the wake of Nantwi’s death and 11 have been suspended without pay. The special prosecutor’s office declined Tuesday to provide details on the new development. Fitzpatrick, who had said he would not comment on the case until a grand jury took action, has scheduled a news conference for 3:30 p.m. Wednesday following the court appearance. Nantwi’s death came several months after another inmate,Robert Brooks, was fatally beaten at another prison, the Marcy Correctional Facility, that sits across the street from the Mid-State Correctional Facility. Six guards were charged with murder, three with manslaughter and one with evidence tampering in Brooks’ death. They have pleaded not guilty, and their cases are pending. Correctional officers upset over working conditions began illegally walking off the job Feb. 17 at many state prisons. Incarcerated people and their advocates complained that services and conditions deteriorated during the walkout. The strike ended when many guards returned to work and Hochul fired the remaining 2,000 holdouts. Nantwi entered the state prison system last May and had been serving a five-year sentence for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon related to an exchange of gunfire with police officers in 2021. At the time, he was shot multiple times, while the officers were uninjured. Manhattan prosecutors say Nantwi shot and killed Jaylen Duncan, 19, on a Harlem street in April 2023. The following evening, they say, he shot and killed Brandon Brunson, 36, at a Harlem smoke shop after an argument.",

    "title": "A Michigan community takes a novel approach to moving 9,100 books for shop's next chapter",
    "article_text": "In a heartwarming show of community spirit, the small town of Chelsea, Michigan, pulled off a literary feat worthy of its own novel. When the beloved local bookstore Serendipity Books announced it was moving to a larger space, owner Michelle Tuplin was faced with a logistical challenge: how to move 9,100 books — and hundreds of boxes — without closing the business for days. \"People really consider independent bookstores theirs,\" Tuplin said Tuesday. \"It’s really a part of the community, and they have ownership.\" So she came up with a novel idea. Tuplin put out a call for volunteers, hoping some might lend a hand. What she got was a full-on movement — a human conveyor belt stretching 350 feet from the old store’s stockroom, around the corner and into the new location. More than 300 people — and one very good dog — showed up to help. Neighbors, customers and even passersby joined in, forming two human chains to get the job done. “It was just a joyful experience,” said Donna Zak, one of the volunteers. “We were passing the books and noticing and commenting to each other, ‘Oh, have you read this one? I really enjoyed this one!’” In less than two hours, Serendipity Books’ entire inventory had been transferred — in alphabetical order, no less. “There was a 91-year-old woman. There was a good customer who has issues with his heart. There was somebody with their 6-year-old child. And we figured if we just did it book by book, everybody could be involved,” Tuplin said. The new storefront, which is more than twice the size of the old one, will open later this month ahead of Independent Bookstore Day on April 26, a celebration of indie shops and the communities that support them. “To see the community come out and, you know, put all those words that they say, usually say, into action, it truly just meant the world,” Tuplin said. “It was overwhelming.” It was proof that the written word, at least in one Michigan town, is alive and well. Sometimes, all it takes to spark a little magic is a shared love of books — and a willingness to pass it on.",

    "title": "Mississippi officers charged in young father's shooting death",
    "article_text": "Two Mississippi Capitol Police officers have been charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a young father during a 2022 traffic stop, part ofa string ofshootingsby officers in an aggressive push to stamp out spiking crime in Jackson. A grand jury in Hinds County indicted the officers, Michael Rhinewalt and Stephen Frederick, last month. Rhinewalt is on unpaid administrative leave; Frederick resigned from the Capitol Police in March 2023after adrunkendriving arrest. Rhinewalt was arrested last week and released on $100,000 bond; his indictment was unsealed Monday. His defense lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Frederick has not yet been arrested, and it is not clear when or whether he would surrender to authorities, nor was it clear whether he had an attorney who could speak about the charges. After he left the Capitol Police, Frederick went to work for the Scott County Sheriff’s Office; it was unclear Tuesday whether he remained employed there. The Capitol Police are a state-run force that had been largely responsible for security at state government buildings until 2022, when the governor deployed officers to help with spiking crime. The charges Tuesday are the third case in which a current or former officer has been accused of wrongdoing during that effort. Rhinewalt and Frederick have been charged with shooting Jaylen Lewis, 25, during what authoritiessaid at the timewas “a police response to a traffic violation.” Lewis’ mother has long maintained that officers wrongly shot her son and has sought justice since the shooting. Rhinewalt, Frederick and other members of the Capitol Police’s crime suppression unit, called Flex, were conducting a drug narcotics operation around 9 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2022, and saw a white Jeep Grand Cherokee run a red light, according to an incident report provided in response to a public records request. The officers opened fire after they tried to pull over the Jeep, but details of the encounter were redacted from the report at the time.A death certificate later confirmed that Lewis, the father of a 4-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy, had been shot in the head. Rhinewalt and Frederick said they fired on Lewis in self-defense, according to the indictment, but the grand jury concluded it \"was not a reasonable belief under the circumstances.\" Lewis was one offour peopleCapitol Police shot in the first six months of their 2022 deployment to Jackson. The victims included Sherita Harris, a mother of five whowasstruckin the headwhile she was riding in a car that Rhinewalt and another officer, Jeffery Walker, fired on during a chase on Aug. 14, 2022. Rhinewalt and Walker were indicted in December on aggravated assault charges in that shooting. A federal grand jury also indictedWalker, who left the Capitol Police in July 2023, in December on civil rights charges alleging he beat a motorist after a 2022 pursuit. Rhinewalt and Walker have pleaded not guilty in those cases. In another shooting by Capitol Police, Latasha Smithwasstruckin the armin her apartment on Dec. 11, 2022, as police opened fire on a suspected car thief outside. State authorities have deemed the shooting justified. In the wake of the barrage,NBC News foundthat the Capitol Police had deployed the officers to Jackson without modernizing policies to reflect their new mission. In 2023, the agency quietly revised its rules on use of force. It also now equips officers with body cameras and dashboard cameras. But the Capitol Police have also amassed more power, broadening their jurisdiction to the entire city, from beyond a district surrounding downtown Jackson. Most elected leaders in the Democratic-run city opposed the measure, but state Republicans made it law.",

    "article_text": "As the two largest economies in the world — the United States and China — continue to spar over tariffs, the escalating trade war is  spurring some Americans to favor Chinese goods in ways they never did before. President Donald Trump has said his sweeping tariffs around the globe are aimed at bringing manufacturing back to American shores. But as he continues to target China with his highest tariff yet, now at 145%, some Americans online say they are flocking to Chinese manufacturing rather than away from it. “What do American companies think we’re gonna do? We’re gonna pay their prices rather than Chinese prices, when I can get a thousand times more product for the same price as we get here?” a TikTok usersaid in a videothat got more than 16.5 million views. “We’re not gonna do that.” Since Friday, videos on TikTok from Chinese manufacturers have drawn millions of views touting a wide variety of goods — including some making questionable claims about their roles in producing high-priced luxury items that say they’re made in Europe. Others tout dupes, or replicas, of common brand-name items that they say are of the same or similar quality. The videos come as the United States imposes high tariffs on China and plans to close a trade loophole, called de minimis, that allows shipments under $800 to enter the country without taxes. Domestic and international discontent over Trump’s trade policy has spilled over into the internet, where artificial intelligence videos that appear to show Americans working in factories and various other memes have flourished. Much of the content is surfacing on TikTok even as it faces an uncertain future in the United States. Having emerged as by far the most popular Chinese-owned social media app, itcould be bannedif its Beijing-based parent company doesn’t divest ownership by June 15. Tony Wu, founder of the family business TLucky Sourcing, works behind the scenes with several popular Chinese factory sourcing accounts on TikTok. He said the accounts are using global social media platforms to advertise various Chinese suppliers to buyers, whether from the United States or elsewhere. The tariffs “make some troubles, for sure, but in two or three months it’ll go back to normal, I think,” said Wu, who connects with factories to find retail and individual buyers abroad. “We will find new buyers. And [Americans] cannot replace the China factory. Finally I think they will realize that they need to buy from China. ... There are no alternatives.” Americans make up only around 5% of buyers for the factories he works with, he said, and those factories have much bigger export markets in South Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. So far, Wu said, American buyers aren’t canceling orders but are instead opting for smaller orders or trying to negotiate prices. “Honestly, America is not our main market. TikTok’s just based in America — doesn’t mean our customers are mainly from America,” he said. He said that while he believes Trump’s tariffs won’t be detrimental to Chinese exports, manufacturers are growing nervous about the sheer unpredictability of his trade policies. Many of the videos claimed the Chinese suppliers behind popular brands sell the same or similar pieces at much cheaper prices. “They sell you a legging pants for $100, and guess what? Here in these two factories, you can get them for around $5 to $6,”@LunaSourcingChina, an account that works with Wu’s sourcing business, said in a video that got more than 11 million views on TikTok. “And what’s even better, the material and the craftsmanship are basically the same because they all come from the same production line.” A spokesperson for Lululemon, one of the brands mentioned in the video, said it “does not work with the manufacturers identified in the online videos and we urge consumers to be aware of potentially counterfeit products and misinformation.” Another TikTok account that gained traction this week,@senbags2,claimed his factoryhas been the original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, for most of the world’s luxury bags for over 30 years. He claimed that bydiscreetly making bags in Chinabefore they are shipped to Europe for final touches, “the bags will appear at their boutiques as ‘made in Italy’ or ‘made in France.’” In a video thatcaused heavy debate online, he claimed that a $38,000 Hermes Birkin handbag costs around $1,400 to make in a Chinese factory using the same high-quality materials. Hermes is well-known for crafting its Birkin bags exclusively in France, dedicating a single artisan to each bag. A spokesperson for Hermes didn’t respond to a request for comment. Even as many online remained skeptical about the claims made in the trending warehouse videos, the discourse hasraised questions about the true material valueof Western name-brand goods. Chinese-made dupes of expensive luxury brands have been popular among American consumers for years — often sold by street vendors and on Chinese e-commerce sites like DHGate — but they’ve long carried a stigma of being perceived as low-quality. What the recent videos from Chinese manufacturers purport, however, is that the knockoffs are equal in everything but the value of their names. As viral videos invited shoppers abroad to buy directly from the Chinese warehouses instead of paying top prices for Western brand logos, they generated a flurry of shock and glee among Americans who say they’relooking to purchase cheaper wholesale goodsthat might save them enough money to offset Trump’s tariffs on China. In response to the tariffs, some online have been pointing out that much of Trump’s own “Make America Great Again” merchandise ismade in China, as well. Others have noted that for most things Americans consume —even, for example, a Florida tangerine— moving full production processes to the United States would be highly inefficient and expensive. Among those calling out the Chinese-made MAGA merch is a Chinese journalist whoshared a videolast weekend showing that inside the Trump Tower store in New York City, price tag stickers appeared to be placed in a way that covered up the “Made in China” label on several products. Though his video made waves in China, a visit to the store by NBC News didn’t find anything that appeared to be purposefully trying to obfuscate its origins. Zhang Zhisheng, China’s consul general in Denpasar, Indonesia, also accused White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt of wearing a Chinese-made dress,writing on X: “Accusing China is business. Buying China is life.” Many people online appear unconvinced by Chinese knockoffs of their favorite brands. But as such content circulates on Chinese and American social media platforms alike, some users, including Americans, are mocking Trump’s tariffs as fears grow about a trade war that’s potentially more disadvantageous to the United States than to China.",

Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. President Donald Trump and the GOP are facing renewed pressure from the courts, Democrats and members of the public over the U.S. government mistakenly deporting a Maryland man to a prison in El Salvador. Here are the latest developments: In the courts:The judge presiding over Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s case suggested she was weighing contempt proceedings against the Trump administration,Gary Grumbach and Dareh Gregorian report. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to provide evidence about what steps it’s taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return, as she had ordered, saying the government had shown her “nothing” to date. Democrats’ plan of action:Democratic lawmakers say they are willing to go to El Salvador to seek Abrego Garcia’s release, a plan that has gained steam after the country’s president said during a visit to the White House on Monday that he would not send the man back to the U.S.,Megan Lebowitz and Frank Thorp V report. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., sent a letter Monday to El Salvador’s ambassador in the U.S. requesting a meeting with the country’s president, Nayib Bukele, who said in meeting with Trump later in the day that he “of course” would not send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. Van Hollen said if Abrego Garcia was not in the U.S. by “midweek,” he would “travel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release.” The idea gained support from several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida and Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, who said they would be willing to join Van Hollen on the trip. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, also sought to dial up the pressure on Republicans. “Now is the time for my Republican colleagues to step up,”he said in a statement. “You can no longer stay silent in the face of a constitutional crisis. You must join Democrats in responding to this madness and demanding that Mr. Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States immediately.” Town hall heat:GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley faced pushback at a town hall in southeastern Iowa over Abrego Garcia’s deportation,Kate Santaliz reports. Attendees started shouting “due process!” at Grassley after he said that he would not bring Abrego Garcia back because that’s “not a power of Congress.” After more shouting, Grassley placed the blame on El Salvador’s president, saying he is “not subject to our Supreme Court.” Zooming out:Trump administration officials are pushing immigrants to leave the United States of their own volition, or “self deport,” as the number of people the government is deporting from the interior of the country remains stagnant, far below the vision for mass deportations promised by the president,Julia Ainsley reports. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported just over 12,300 immigrants from March 1 to March 28, slightly under the 12,700 people it deported during the same period last year, according to ICE data obtained by NBC News. ICE deported around 11,000 people in February. More on Trump’s immigration agenda: The possibility that Kamala Harris might seek a quick comeback in next year’s California governor’s race continues to be raised. Since leaving office, Harris’ camp has signaled interest in a potential candidacy. Two weeks ago, the former vice president used aspeech in her home stateto declare, “I’m not going anywhere.” Andrecentpollssuggestthe state’s Democratic voters retain broadly positive feelings toward her. Harris’ ultimate decision is a key variable for national Democrats, since she would also be a logical candidate for the party’s 2028 presidential nomination. On Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Sen. Cory Booker, a potential presidential candidate himself,sidestepped questionsabout another Harris White House bid. Between the two options, the California governorship seems the obviously more attainable goal for Harris, given her familiarity to voters and the state’s overwhelming Democratic bent. Among Democratic voters, polls show she’d be the top choice for now, but the field is still forming and name recognition is a major factor. The state’s open primary system adds another variable. Candidates all run on the same ballot regardless of party affiliation, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the general election. That raises the possibility that, if Harris advanced to a general election for California governor, she might have to face a fellow Democrat. In theory, that could be a concern against a candidate like Rick Caruso, a wealthy businessman who sought Los Angeles’s mayoralty in 2022 with a campaign that emphasized crime, homelessness and quality-of-life issues. A former Republican, Carusohas been visiblein the aftermath of this winter’s devastating fires and could appeal to voters on both sides of the aisle — if he were to run and make it to the general election. There’s also some uncomfortable history here for Harris, who would not be the first former VP to lose a presidential race only to turn around and seek California’s top job. Richard Nixon had been a senator and congressman from California before becoming Dwight Eisenhower’s No. 2. After narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy in the race to succeed Ike, Nixon threw himself into the 1962 California governor’s race. At first, it seemed like a cinch: AJuly 1961 poll found him 16 points aheadof the incumbent Democrat, Pat Brown. Nixon saw it as a chance to put a win on the board before running for president again in 1964, but those early sentiments from the electorate gave way to a comeback victory by Brown, who defeated Nixon by 6 points. Since then, two other vice presidents have sought to revive their careers after losing White House bids. Hubert Humphrey, who as Lyndon B. Johnson’s VP lost to Nixon in 1968, won back a U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota in 1970. Like Nixon in California, Humphrey was still dreaming of the presidency, but he was a deeply admired figure in Minnesota and the outcome was never in doubt. Minnesota was also the setting for Walter Mondale’s extremely brief, late-in-life comeback effort in 2002. The former VP, who’d been crushed by Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election, was recruited by Democrats as an emergency candidate following the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone in a plane crash. Mondale entered the race a week before Election Day and lost narrowly to Republican Norm Coleman. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "article_text": "Harvard University’s defiance of the Trump administration Monday brought instant repercussions for the institution — and a burst of jubilation from some on campus and in the broader education world who’ve clamored for an elite school to take a stand. “If Harvard can’t do it, then who can?” said Michael Bronski, a professor in the university's Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality program. “It’s always right to make the most moral decision, and we’ll see what the outcome is.” Harvard's lawyers senta letterMonday rejectinga list of demandsthe Trump administration had sent the school as part of an ongoing review of several universities over allegations of antisemitism. In a statementposted online, Harvard President Alan Garber referred to the demands as “an attempt to control the Harvard community” and vowed to fight back. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” he wrote. The administration’s sweeping demands would have required the university to restrict the acceptance of international students who are “hostile to the American values and institutions” and report to the Department of Homeland Security any foreign-born student who violates Harvard’s code of conduct, among other measures.",

    "title": "Why colleges like Harvard can't use endowments to replace federal funding",
    "article_text": "So why can’t Harvard just dip further into its famously steep endowment? As the Trump administration announced a $2.2 billion freeze in grants to the university this week after the school rejected its demands, some critics have questioned why the Ivy League institution and other wealthy schools like it can’t just make up for federal funding that way. Finance and higher education experts say endowments aren’t a simple replacement for government funding because of restrictions related to donor earmarking, legality and research priorities. “If there’s a major source of revenue that has disappeared, which is the threat from the administration, it’s like any family with a shock to their income stream,” said Catharine Bond Hill, former president of Vassar College. “You’d have to decide how you were going to allocate your spending priorities.” The Trump administration said in a statement Monday that it would cut the $2.2 billion in multiyear grants and $60 million “in multi-year contract value” to Harvard because of what it considers the university’s “troubling entitlement mindset.” The freeze was announced hours after the school said it wouldn’t concede to the administration’s demands, which include auditing viewpoints of the student body and restricting the acceptance of international students who are “hostile to the American values and institutions. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” the university’s X accountsaid in a statement Monday. “Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.” Harvard has the largest endowment among U.S. universities, at$53.2 billionin 2024. That is higher than the gross domestic products of almost 100 countries. Yale University has the second-highest endowment, hovering around$41.4 billion. But those elite schools don’t represent the norm. A2024 National Association of College and University Business Officersstudy of 658 U.S. colleges and universities found that the median endowment was $243 million. And30% of the participating universitieshad endowments of $100 million or less. While Harvard no doubt has substantial funding, it doesn’t mean it can rely on its endowment to make up for loss, experts say. Hill, managing director of the research and consulting organization Ithaka S+R, compared the endowment to a pot of financial assets that are invested in a variety of things, from stocks and bonds to real estate. Much of that pot of money, Hill said, comes from donors, including alumni, foundations, local community members or anyone else looking to support the institutions’ spending. And it’s not to be used immediately. “They don’t give it as a pot of money to be spent this year,” Hill said. “They give it as an endowment, so that the earnings can be used over time to support the thing that the donor is interested in the university doing in perpetuity.” There are also other restrictions. Liz Clark, vice president of policy at the college business officers group, said that essentially, endowments can be seen as a “collection of contracts” with donors. “Donors may have given to support scholarships, they may have given to support faculty positions, perhaps they donated to support a specific area of scientific inquiry or medical research,” Clark said. “The university has a legal responsibility to uphold that contract and agreement.” At Harvard, for example, donor terms direct70% of the annual distributionof its endowment to specific programs or departments or other purposes. That leaves around 25%, Hill said, for discretionary spending approved by the board. It’s still a large amount; however, Hill said that “you can burn through that pretty quickly.” And the school may have to make financial trade-offs. “That board-designated money may have been earmarked to support need-based financial aid for undergraduates,” Hill said. “If they spend it down on covering this research shortfall, they can certainly do it for a while, but when it’s gone, it’s gone. It may mean that they have to reduce spending in some other areas where that money was being used.” Federal funding has also historically played a critical role in research, experts said. Cecilia Orphan, an associate professor of higher education at the University of Denver, said the funding often comes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for the Arts and other major agencies. And those sources often come with national strategic priorities attached to them, Orphan said. The National Science Foundation, for example, has been making concerted efforts to increase the country’s competitiveness in STEM, she said. When a university receives a grant, Orphan said, it is usually broken up in a variety of ways to support things like materials for research, staffing costs or construction of physical spaces to conduct research. “It is very difficult for a university like Harvard or Columbia to conduct that kind of cutting-edge research without that kind of infrastructural support that is separate from the actual research itself,” Orphan said. Experts say it remains to be seen how universities will adapt to such federal funding freezes. But, Orphan said, the impact on research could be devastating. “The larger implication here is a university like Harvard is doing research that has global benefit across a variety of areas, including cancer research and weapons development and other strategic concerns that we might have as a country and the world has,” Orphan said. “When you cut the research funding, that means that research will cease or it will be greatly diminished.”",

    "title": "FDA OKs trial of pig livers as dialysis-like treatment for liver failure",
    "article_text": "U.S. researchers will soon test whetherlivers from a gene-edited pigcould treat people with sudden liver failure — by temporarily filtering their blood so their own organ can rest and maybe heal. The first-of-its-kind clinical trial has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, according topig producer eGenesis, which announced the step Tuesday with its partner OrganOx. An estimated 35,000 people in the U.S. are hospitalized each year when their liver suddenly fails. There are few treatment options and death rates as high as 50%. Many don’t qualify for a liver transplant or can’t get a match in time. The new study, which is expected to get underway later this spring, is a twist on the quest foranimal-to-human organ transplants. Researchers won’t transplant the pig liver but instead will attach it externally to study participants. The liver is the only organ that can regenerate, but the question is whether having the pig’s liver filter the patient’s blood for several days could give it that chance. In experiments with four deceased bodies, that “bridge” attempt showed the pig liver could support some functions of a human liver for two or three days, said Mike Curtis, CEO of Massachusetts-based eGenesis, which genetically modifies pigs so their organs are more humanlike. The trial will enroll up to 20 patients in intensive-care units who don’t qualify a liver transplant, he said. A device made by Britain’s OrganOx, currently used to preserve donated human livers, will pump participants’ blood through the pig liver. It’s the latest step in attempts to usegene-edited pig organsto save human lives. Pig kidneys from eGenesis and another pig producer, United Therapeutics, are being used in experimental transplants.",

    "title": "Judge demands to know if White House is helping return wrongly deported Maryland man",
    "article_text": "Ximena Bustillo President Trump meets with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in the Oval Office on April 14.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption A Maryland federal judge wants to find out if government officials are acting in \"bad faith\" in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who wasmistakenly sentto a notorious Salvadoran prison. Judge Paula Xinis on Tuesday called for a two-week process of \"expedited discovery,\" including questioning government officials under oath, to learn whether the government is doing enough to try to bring him back. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen, had lived in Maryland for about 15 years before he was deported to El Salvador last month, despite being granted protections by an U.S. immigration judge. He is in custody in Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele's mega-prison, known as CECOT. TheSupreme Court saidthe Trump administration should facilitate his return. \"It is a fact now, of this record: every day he is detained in CECOT is a day of irreparable harm,\" Xinis said from the bench on Tuesday. \"We have to give process to both sides but we are going to move. No tolerance for gamesmanship and grandstanding.\" Lawyers for the Justice Department and those representing Abrego Garcia have one week to conduct depositions of Joseph Mazzara, the acting general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, as well as of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office director Robert Cerna, and of other officials who have filed declarations before the court. The hearing is the first courtroom appearance about Abrego Garcia's case since Bukele met with President Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, and told reporters that he is not going to \"smuggle a terrorist into the United States.\" The U.S. government has accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, which the Trump administration has since designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Abrego Garcia's lawyers dispute that he is a member of the gang, and say he doesn't have a criminal record. Ina court filing ahead of the hearing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued \"the Government should at least be required to request the release of Abrego Garcia\" — and that to date it has not done so. The Department of Homeland Security said it \"prepared to facilitate Abrego Garcia's presence in the United States in accordance with those processes if he presents at a port of entry,\" Mazzara said ina declarationfiled minutes before the hearing began. However, Mazarra said that if Abrego Garcia does appear at a port of entry to the U.S., he would be detained by DHS and either removed to a third country, or the government would go through a judicial process to try to send him back to El Salvador. The DOJ also filed a transcript of Monday's press conference in the Oval Office. Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the Justice Department, presented the transcript, arguing that the issue of Abrego Garcia was \"raised at the highest level\" and provided proof the government was trying to \"facilitate\" his return. But Judge Xinis called references to the comments made at the White House \"nonresponsive\" in court about whether the administration is working to release Abrego Garcia from CECOT and ensure that his case is handled as it would have been in the U.S., were he not improperly sent abroad. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller speaks as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pam Bondi, U.S. Attorney General, sit nearby as President Trump meets with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in the Oval Office on April 14.Win McNamee/Getty Imageshide caption \"If you were removing domestic barriers then there would be no smuggling, right?\" Xinis said, referencing Bukele's \"smuggling terrorists\" remark. \"If I make a finding of contempt it will be based on the record before me,\" she added. \"No, I don't consider the transcript you gave me to be answering the question.\" The White House has argued its actions align with the court's orders. \"We're very confident that every action taken by this administration is within the confines of the law, and we continue to comply with the court's orders,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. The U.S. Supreme Court last week in an unsigned decision upheld Xinis' order that the federal government must \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and \"to ensure his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" However, the Supreme Court also said the judge should clarify her decision \"with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\" Focusing on that line of \"deference\" over foreign policy, several administration officials have argued it's up to Bukele whether Abrego Garcia is returned. \"If they [El Salvador] wanted to return him, we would facilitate it – meaning provide a plane,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said during the Oval Office press conference. But in that same press conference, Bukele said he does not have the power to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as White House officials, admitted that an administrative error resulted in Abrego Garcia's deportation. An immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal in 2019, meaning that although he did enter the country illegally, the U.S. could not deport him to El Salvador. His attorney told NPR he had applied and had been granted a work permit, which had been regularly renewed since then. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Trump signs executive action to lower drug prices",
    "article_text": "By Sydney Lupkin Medicare negotiations on drug prices can happen sooner for pills than many drugs that are injected.Spencer Platt/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump signed an executive action Tuesday intended to lower prescription drug prices for Americans. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters ahead of the signing that the move would include \"delivering lower prices to seniors\" and improve theMedicare drug price negotiation program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022. \"We are confident we will eclipse the savings the Biden administration achieved in the first year,\" the official said. Because the number of drugs subject to negotiation increases each year, greater savings over time were baked into the law. Medicare negotiated theprices of 10 drugsin 2024, and it will negotiate15 more this year, including for Ozempic, the blockbuster diabetes medicine with a list price ofaround $1,000 a month. But consumers will have to wait to see the results. The lower Medicare prices negotiated in the Biden administration won't take effect until 2026. And prices from the new round of negotiations by the Trump administration won't be available until 2027. And if the administration applies tariffs to imported pharmaceuticals and ingredients used to make medicines domestically, consumers could pay more for many medications. Afederal notice filed Mondaysaid the secretary of commerce is investigating the national security effects of the importation of drugs and drug ingredients. The findings could be a precursor to tariffs. The official said the administration would resurrect a program from Trump's first term to give insulin to low-income individuals, including those without insurance. In some cases, the official said, patients would pay 3 cents a vial, plus a small administrative fee, for insulin; injectable epinephrine would cost $15 for auto-injector under the program, the official said. \"The president is leveraging current programs to deliver meaningful cost savings here,\" the official said. The action directs the Food and Drug Administration to facilitate approval of state importation programs and to streamline the approval for lower-cost generics and biosimilars. So far, only one state, Florida, received FDA approval to import lower cost drugs from another country like Canada. According to anews report from November, it had not yet begun doing so. The official added that the action would seek to address Medicare's drug price negotiation program as it applies to small molecule drugs – which comprise most prescription pills like statins and blood pressure treatments -- versus more complex biologic drugs, like blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Humira. Under current law, small molecule drugs are eligible for Medicare negotiation seven years after FDA approval; for biologics, negotiations aren't allowed until 11 years after approval. This creates an \"imbalance\" that pushes companies to invest in biologics drugs, usually given by injection, over pills. Trump's action instructs Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to work with Congress to address this imbalance in a way that does not increase overall Medicare spending. In addition, the executive action would take steps to align the price Medicare pays with the cost for hospitals to acquire drugs and begin the process to align payment across care settings, the same official said on background.

    "title": "The White House is starting the process to eliminate funding for public media",
    "article_text": "By Scott Neuman The White House is proposing that virtually all federal funding for public media—that's NPR and PBS—be eliminated, starting a process that will reach Congress later in April. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:The White House is proposing that virtually all federal funding for public media - so NPR and PBS - that it be eliminated. The Trump administration has drafted a memo to Congress outlining its intent to cut that money, a move that the broadcasters say would be devastating to American communities nationwide. Here at NPR, we report on ourselves just as we would any other organization, and my colleague, NPR's Scott Neuman, has been working this story today. Hi, Scott.SCOTT NEUMAN, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So we have, of course, been tracking pieces of this story for weeks now. We covered the FCC launching an investigation into NPR and PBS underwriting practices. We covered last month's testimony by the leaders of NPR and PBS before a House subcommittee. Walk me through this latest development. This is the White House asking Congress to eliminate funding. Explain.NEUMAN: Yeah, this is something called recision. In a memo that is being drafted by the White House, we're told, that will be sent to Congress once lawmakers return from recess on April 28, what will happen is that will start a window of 45 days in which the House and Senate have the opportunity to either approve the administration's call to end funding or to allow the money to be restored.KELLY: And just to explain recision - this would include money that has already been approved, already been allocated. How much money are we talking?NEUMAN: Yeah. Congress has already appropriated $1.1 billion over the next two years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And a reminder, that's the nonprofit, congressionally chartered body that partly funds NPR and PBS and other public media. So essentially, the federal funds for public broadcasting would be cut immediately and then the next two years, so through 2027, the end of the fiscal year.KELLY: In a few sentences, what would the impact of that be on public broadcasting in the United States?NEUMAN: Well, NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government, but hundreds of NPR member stations across the country get a larger percentage, and they would be hit harder. And since those stations use some of the federal money they get from CPB to pay a fee to NPR to carry programs such as ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, the indirect impact on NPR could be greater. Since television is more expensive than radio, PBS gets a larger chunk of the pie from CPB - about 15% of its funding.KELLY: Why does the White House say it wants to do this?NEUMAN: Well, for some Republicans, canceling federal funding for CPB has been on the agenda for years, but in the past few years, conservatives have stepped up attacks on NPR and PBS, accusing the networks of left-wing political bias and woke programming. The networks say they produce high-quality, balanced and informative programs. In the past, though, many conservatives have been more supportive of public media. But with today's charged political environment, more of them seem to be standing behind Trump and people like Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been a loud proponent of defunding public media.KELLY: I know that you've been reaching out and getting a reaction on this. What are you hearing back from the leaders of NPR and PBS?NEUMAN: Well, a reminder that NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO and president Paula Kerger both appeared in March before a congressional subcommittee that was chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene to defend public broadcasting. Today, NPR issued a statement saying that eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be a great disservice to the American public. In a statement, the network said, we serve the public interest. It's not just in our name. It's our mission. Across the country, locally owned public media stations represent a proud American tradition of public-private partnership for our shared common good.KELLY: Thanks for your reporting, Scott.NEUMAN: Thank you.KELLY: That's NPR's Scott Neuman. And I will note we have invited NPR's CEO Katherine Maher to take our questions on this, and we hope to bring you that interview tomorrow.Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:The White House is proposing that virtually all federal funding for public media - so NPR and PBS - that it be eliminated. The Trump administration has drafted a memo to Congress outlining its intent to cut that money, a move that the broadcasters say would be devastating to American communities nationwide. Here at NPR, we report on ourselves just as we would any other organization, and my colleague, NPR's Scott Neuman, has been working this story today. Hi, Scott.SCOTT NEUMAN, BYLINE: Hi there.KELLY: So we have, of course, been tracking pieces of this story for weeks now. We covered the FCC launching an investigation into NPR and PBS underwriting practices. We covered last month's testimony by the leaders of NPR and PBS before a House subcommittee. Walk me through this latest development. This is the White House asking Congress to eliminate funding. Explain.NEUMAN: Yeah, this is something called recision. In a memo that is being drafted by the White House, we're told, that will be sent to Congress once lawmakers return from recess on April 28, what will happen is that will start a window of 45 days in which the House and Senate have the opportunity to either approve the administration's call to end funding or to allow the money to be restored.KELLY: And just to explain recision - this would include money that has already been approved, already been allocated. How much money are we talking?NEUMAN: Yeah. Congress has already appropriated $1.1 billion over the next two years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And a reminder, that's the nonprofit, congressionally chartered body that partly funds NPR and PBS and other public media.

In a memo that is being drafted by the White House, we're told, that will be sent to Congress once lawmakers return from recess on April 28, what will happen is that will start a window of 45 days in which the House and Senate have the opportunity to either approve the administration's call to end funding or to allow the money to be restored.KELLY: And just to explain recision - this would include money that has already been approved, already been allocated. How much money are we talking?NEUMAN: Yeah. Congress has already appropriated $1.1 billion over the next two years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And a reminder, that's the nonprofit, congressionally chartered body that partly funds NPR and PBS and other public media. So essentially, the federal funds for public broadcasting would be cut immediately and then the next two years, so through 2027, the end of the fiscal year.KELLY: In a few sentences, what would the impact of that be on public broadcasting in the United States?NEUMAN: Well, NPR receives about 1% of its funding directly from the federal government, but hundreds of NPR member stations across the country get a larger percentage, and they would be hit harder. And since those stations use some of the federal money they get from CPB to pay a fee to NPR to carry programs such as ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, the indirect impact on NPR could be greater. Since television is more expensive than radio, PBS gets a larger chunk of the pie from CPB - about 15% of its funding.KELLY: Why does the White House say it wants to do this?NEUMAN: Well, for some Republicans, canceling federal funding for CPB has been on the agenda for years, but in the past few years, conservatives have stepped up attacks on NPR and PBS, accusing the networks of left-wing political bias and woke programming. The networks say they produce high-quality, balanced and informative programs. In the past, though, many conservatives have been more supportive of public media. But with today's charged political environment, more of them seem to be standing behind Trump and people like Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been a loud proponent of defunding public media.KELLY: I know that you've been reaching out and getting a reaction on this. What are you hearing back from the leaders of NPR and PBS?NEUMAN: Well, a reminder that NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO and president Paula Kerger both appeared in March before a congressional subcommittee that was chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene to defend public broadcasting. Today, NPR issued a statement saying that eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be a great disservice to the American public. In a statement, the network said, we serve the public interest. It's not just in our name. It's our mission. Across the country, locally owned public media stations represent a proud American tradition of public-private partnership for our shared common good.KELLY: Thanks for your reporting, Scott.NEUMAN: Thank you.KELLY: That's NPR's Scott Neuman. And I will note we have invited NPR's CEO Katherine Maher to take our questions on this, and we hope to bring you that interview tomorrow.Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

    "title": "Top House Democrat says DOGE data access at NLRB may be 'technological malfeasance'",
    "article_text": "By Stephen Fowler , Jenna McLaughlin Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., speaks during the House Oversight Committee meeting at the U.S. Capitol on March 25.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Imageshide caption The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee is calling for an investigation into DOGE's access to the National Labor Relations Board followingexclusive NPR reportingon sensitive data being removed from the agency. Ranking Member Gerry Connolly, D-Va.,sent a letter Tuesdayto Acting Inspector General at the Department of Labor Luiz Santos and Ruth Blevins, inspector general at the NLRB, expressing concern that DOGE \"may be engaged in technological malfeasance and illegal activity.\" \"According to NPR and whistleblower disclosures obtained by Committee Democrats, individuals associated with DOGE have attempted to exfiltrate and alter data while also using high-level systems access to remove sensitive information—quite possibly including corporate secrets and details of union activities,\" Connolly wrote in a letterfirst shared with NPR. \"I also understand that these individuals have attempted to conceal their activities, obstruct oversight, and shield themselves from accountability.\" According to an official whistleblower disclosure shared with NPR, interviews with the whistleblower and records of internal communications, technical staff members at the NLRB were alarmed about what DOGE engineers did when they were granted access, particularly when those staffers noticed a spike in data leaving the agency. Daniel Berulis started working at the NRLB six months before President Trump started his second term.Grace Raver/NPRhide caption \"I can't attest to what their end goal was or what they're doing with the data,\" the whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, said in an interview with NPR. \"But I can tell you that the bits of the puzzle that I can quantify are scary. ... This is a very bad picture we're looking at.\" Connolly shared similar concerns in his letter, highlighting the fact that billionaire businessman and DOGE leader Elon Musk's companies like SpaceX, Tesla and X have cases pending before the NLRB and the Department of Labor. Berulis saw around 10 gigabytes of data leave NLRB's network — or the equivalent of a full stack of encyclopedias if someone printed them. Much of that data came from a system that houses information about pending cases, proprietary data from corporate competitors, personal information about union members or employees voting to join a union, and witness testimony. Access to that data is protected by numerous federal laws, including thePrivacy Act. The letter asks the inspectors general to answer a number of questions regarding waysDOGE may have potentially violated federal law,including any NLRB networks DOGE staffers had access to and what records of DOGE's work within NLRB systems exist. NPR reportedDOGE staffers demanded \"tenant owner level\" access, which offers essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy and alter data, according to the whistleblower disclosure to Congress. The disclosure also noted that controls to prevent insecure or unauthorized mobile devices from logging on to the system without the proper security settings were disabled, an interface was exposed to the public internet and internal alerting and monitoring systems were found to be manually turned off, among other things. Someone with an IP address in Russia tried to log in with the username and password of a newly created DOGE account just minutes after its creation, the disclosure reads. In over a dozen lawsuits infederal courts around the United States, judges have demanded that DOGE explain why it needs such expansive access to sensitive data on Americans, from Social Security records to private medical records and tax information. But the Trump administration has been unable to give consistent and clear answers, largely dismissing cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "New Israeli ceasefire offer demands Hamas discuss disarming, but group rejects it",
    "article_text": "The conflict between Israel and Palestinians — and other groups in the Middle East — goes back decades. These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them. By Daniel Estrin , Aya Batrawy People walk by a tent shelter near the rubble of a collapsed building in western Gaza City on April 15.OMAR AL-QATTAA/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption TEL AVIV, Israel and DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Hamas is rejecting a new Israeli proposal to pause the war in Gaza, free more Israeli hostages and negotiate the disarmament of Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, a Hamas official told NPR. The Hamas official spoke on condition of anonymity because the group had not yet presented its formal response to ceasefire mediators. Earlier Tuesday, officials involved in mediating Gaza ceasefire talks had expressed optimism that a deal could be reached within weeks, Egyptian mediators told NPR. Mediators have feared that any potential temporary ceasefire could be shattered by Israel if the deal did not include U.S. guarantees for a permanent end to the war. Israel's latest ceasefire proposal presented to Hamas included a willingness to negotiate a permanent end of the war, but on condition of a new demand that Hamas, and all militant groups in Gaza, be disarmed. That's according to Egyptian mediators, a senior Hamas official and an additional official involved in the talks. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the details of the closed-door negotiations. Hamas had said on Monday that it was studying Israel's latest offer, which was presented by mediators to a Hamas delegation in Cairo over the weekend. Israel has not publicly released details from the negotiations. As part of the new 45-day ceasefire proposal offered by Israel, Hamas would release 10 living hostages, which is about half the number of hostages presumed alive, according to the Egyptian officials. The first to be released would be Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, who holds U.S. citizenship. In exchange, Israel would release nearly 1,400 Palestinian detainees and prisoners serving life sentences during those six weeks. If the sides agree on a permanent end to the war during those six weeks, including an agreement by Hamas to lay down its arms permanently, the remaining hostages held in Gaza would also be released, according to the Israeli offer. The Egyptian officials say Hamas is agreeing to release more hostages, but maintains any agreement must ensure a permanent end to the war, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the reconstruction of the territory, where more than 90% of homes have been damaged or destroyed, according to United Nations estimates. Hamas said in a statement Tuesday that it had lost contact with Alexander's guards in Gaza due to Israeli bombardment of their location. Israel had no immediate comment. As part of a ceasefire, mediators say Israel has proposed easing aweeks-long blockadeon vital supplies like food, fuel and medicines entering Gaza, but Israel is demanding a new mechanism for distributing humanitarian aid. Israel has not publicly disclosed the details of this mechanism, but has beenlooking at waysto keep aid out of the hands of Hamas. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres says Israel, as the occupying power under international law, must open crossings into Gaza and ensure lifesaving aid reaches people there. Gaza's bakeries have shut down without flour and aid groups say supplies are being depleted. Guterres says Israel's proposed new aid mechanisms \"risk further controlling and callously limiting aid down to the last calorie and grain of flour.\" Israel's government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is facinggrowing calls from reservistsand former military officers to change course in Gaza and halt the fighting in order to immediately free all hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas-led militants killed nearly 1,200 people and took 251 hostages in that attack, according to Israeli authorities. Gaza health officials say Israel's war has killed nearly 51,000 Palestinians. It is rare for Israeli soldiers to speak out against the military, but hundreds of Israeli paratroopers, Navy SEALs, military students and retired air force officers have released letters in recent days critical of Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza. In a letter published this week, hundreds of Navy SEALs demanded the return of the hostages even at the cost of \"an immediate halt to the fighting.\" Last week, the Israeli military said it would fire any active duty air force reservists who signed an open letter by fellow air force reservists that argues the war is serving Netanyahu's political interests instead of prioritizing the return of hostages. Israel's far-right government has adopted President Trump's vision for Gaza and is encouraging Palestinian displacement from the territory. Israel describes it as a plan of \"voluntary migration.\" Since resuming the war last month, Israel's militaryhas seized large swaths of territoryin Gaza, with hundreds of thousands ofPalestinians displacedagain. More than 1,600 Palestinians, a third of them children, have been killed by Israeli fire since theceasefire was shattered, according to Gaza's health ministry. Netanyahu paid a surprise visit to the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday to visit Israeli troops serving there, and \"emphasized the importance of continuing the military pressure on the Hamas terrorist organization,\" according to a statement from his office. \"We insist that our hostages be released and we insist on achieving all of our objectives for the war, and are doing so thanks to our heroic fighters,\" Netanyahu said during the visit.

    "title": "Higher ed war heats up as Trump threatens Harvard's tax-exempt status",
    "article_text": "By Elissa Nadworny , Steve Drummond President Trump threatened on social media to revoke the tax-exempt status of Harvard University.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption President Trump today threatened on social media to revoke the tax-exempt status of Harvard University. \"Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?'\"Trump said in a Truth Social post. His comments marked the latest volley in a battle between the Trump administration and the wealthiest college in the world, a battle that heated up last Friday when the administration sent Harvard a list of demands it said must be met, or risk losing some $9 billion in federal funding. Harvard's president yesterday rejected the administration's demands, saying they were illegal and an intolerable attempt to dictate \"what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\" The administration responded within hours, freezing more than $2.2 billion in grants and multi-year contracts to Harvard, much of it intended for research on a wide range of subjects. Many higher education leaders welcomed Harvard's stance, saying the school was uniquely positioned to take the lead. \"Harvard really had no choice given the extent of the demands the Trump administration had made upon it,\" said Michael Dorf – a law professor at Cornell University. Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, an organization that represents more than 1,600 colleges and universities, said that by taking the lead, Harvard paved the way for other institutions to oppose the administration's demands. \"If Harvard hadn't stood up,\" Mitchell said, \"it would have sent a chill across higher education that would have really hampered the ability of other institutions to define for themselves where that red line is.\" A battle rooted in ideology The administration maintains that its attacks on Harvard and dozens of other universities are an attempt to root out antisemitism on campus. In March, the government announced that60 universities were under investigationby the U.S. Education Department for allegedly failing to protect Jewish students. \"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable,\" the administration's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism said in a statement yesterday. \"It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support.\" But President Trump has also repeatedly said that he wants to curb what he views as a far-left bias in academia. \"We are going to choke off the money to schools that aid the Marxist assault on our American heritage and on Western civilization itself,\" Trump said in a speech in Florida in 2023. \"The days of subsidizing communist indoctrination in our colleges will soon be over.\" And in the last month, the administration has cancelled or frozen about $11 billion at a handful of institutions. Former President Barack Obama, in a statement today, praised Harvard's response and called the administration's moves an \"unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom.\" The threat of removing tax exemption While the loss of grants and contracts for research in a wide range of fields is alarming, many college leaders have said they were deeply worried that the administration might move beyond that, notably by threatening their tax-exempt status. Trump's comments today confirmed those fears. \"The catalog of horrors is a thick one,\" Mitchell said. \"There are plenty of things that the administration can seek to do that would throw institutions off kilter. And tax-exempt status is certainly one of them.\" Nearly all colleges and universities are tax-exempt organizations. They are given nonprofit status along with charities, religious institutions and some political organizations. Some elite institutions have amassed huge endowments – Harvard's is the largest, at about $50 billion. Republicans have long sought to curb the tax exemptions in higher education. In 2017, Congresspassed a 1.4 percent tax on university endowments, which affected many of the nation's elite institutions. Mitchell and other experts said they believe some of the administration's demands, and its threats to pull funding, are unlawful. Already, legal challenges have begun, including a lawsuitfiled late last week by Harvard faculty– along with the American Association of University Professors – challenging the administration's demands for changes in order to maintain funding levels. Among those demands are that Harvard eliminate DEI programs, screen international students who are \"supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism\" and ensure \"viewpoint diversity\" in its hiring.

    "title": "U.S. Army libraries target books with a focus on DEI or 'gender ideology' for removal",
    "article_text": "Tom Bowman Army Corp of Cadets march on the field before the Army/Navy game on Dec. 14, 2024 in Landover, Md.Patrick Smith/Getty Imageshide caption A senior Army official ordered Army libraries, including West Point, to remove all books \"with the explicit and sole purpose of directly and overtly promoting DEI, gender ideology, and critical race theory in a manner that subverts meritocracy and unity,\" according to a memo sent last week by acting Assistant Secretary of the Army Derrick Anderson. It says the list of documents should be provided to the Army's chief librarian by April 16th. The memo, dated April 9th, was viewed by NPR. The memo was sent to the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, U.S. Army Special Operations Command, the Army's Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, the U.S. Military Academy and the Army War College. \"West Point is completing the directed review with the utmost professionalism and efficiency,\" West Point spokesman Col. Terence Kelley said in an email to NPR. Since the memo was sent by Assistant Secretary Anderson, however, all Army libraries were told this week to only \"flag\" rather than remove any books, said a U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly, adding that a final decision for removing books will be made by top Army officials. The official said at this point no books have been removed from the West Point library, and the \"flag\" order extends to all Army libraries. The move by West Point comes after the U.S. Naval Academy removed nearly 400 books from the Nimitz Library over similar concerns from Trump Administration officials. The books included Maya Angelou'sI Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,White Supremacy Groups, edited by Mitchell Young andThe Second Coming of the KKK: The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s and the American Political Traditionby Linda Gordon. Also, the works includedPolice Violence and Race: The effects of Racial Focusing Events on Attitudes About Race Relations,\" written in 2016 by Midshipman Gavin D. Jernigan. Five days before the memo was sent out by the Army, two lawmakers said they had \"grave concern\" about the books removed from the Naval Academy in a letter to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll. \"We are interested in understanding if similar actions are occurring at West Point,\" wrote Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, the top Democrat on the Military Personnel Subcommittee. \"Moreover, this reported book ban — or any similar efforts that may be ongoing at the United States Military Academy — displays an alarming return to McCarthy era censorship.\" Another letter about the book removals was sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has vowed to remove DEI material from the Pentagon, saying at a Pentagon town hall meeting in February that the term \"diversity is our strength,\" is \"the single dumbest phrase in military history.\" \"The decision of the Naval Academy to strip the Nimitz Library of diverse voices and viewpoints, especially those written by and/or about Black and LGBTQ people, constitutes unconstitutional censorship of politically disfavored ideas in direct conflict with a functioning democracy\" wrote Jin Hee Lee, with the Legal Defense Fund, and Jennifer C. Pizer with the Lamda Legal Defense Fund ina lettersent Tuesday to Hegseth and Naval Academy superintendent Yvette M. Davids. \"Such censorship is especially dangerous in an educational setting, where critical inquiry, intellectual diversity, and exposure to a wide array of perspectives are necessary to educate future citizen-leaders. While the Naval Academy is tasked with educating and cultivating cadets to be leaders of a pluralistic nation, it has done a disservice to cadets by preventing access to critical information.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "When an earthquake struck San Diego, these elephants formed an 'alert circle'",
    "article_text": "By Rebecca Rosman Elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, Calif., quickly formed an \"alert circle\" to protect their young following Monday's 5.2 magnitude earthquake.Ken Bohn/San Diego Zoo Safari Parkhide caption When a 5.2 magnitude earthquake hit Southern California on Monday, humans followed the usual drill: drop, cover and hold on. But one herd of elephants at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, Calif. had their own plan — circle up and stand together. Security footage from the park shows the moment clearly. One minute the elephants were basking in the sun; the next, they were reacting as the ground began to shake. The three adult females scanned their surroundings and quickly banded together, forming a tight circle around two 7-year-old calves named Zuli and Mkhaya, according to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. Experts call this behavior an \"alert circle,\" a response matriarch elephants display when they perceive a threat. \"Elephants are highly social, they take care of each other,\" says Joshua Plotnik, an associate professor of psychology at Hunter College in New York who studies elephant behavior. Plotnik says this instinct to protect one another is at the core of the alert circle, a strategy for banding together when danger is near. A post shared by San Diego Zoo Safari Park (@sdzsafaripark) \"They bunch together, the adults on the outside facing out, and then they'll push the younger individuals into the middle,\" he says. Elephants can sense seismic vibrations through their feet and ears, Plotnik says, alerting them to potential danger. And earthquakes aren't the only thing they can detect: Something similar happened during the 2006 Boxing Day Tsunami in southeast Asia, he recalls. \"I've heard anecdotes … of elephants responding prior to the large tsunami waves reaching the shores of Thailand, for instance, of elephants retreating up to higher ground with other elephants.\" These fast, coordinated responses reveal the complex social nature of elephants, Plotnik says. But he warns that elephants' survival in today's world requires more than just instinct; there's still much we don't understand about how they interpret threats. Learning more, he says, is key to protecting these endangered animals. \"The Asian and African elephants are in imminent danger of going extinct, and it's crucially important that we continue to learn more about their behavior and cognition if we're going to come up with ways to protect them and conserve them in the wild,\" Plotnik says.

    "title": "A colossal squid is filmed in its natural habitat for the first time",
    "article_text": "By Ayana Archie This is the first confirmed live observation of the colossal squid,Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni, in its natural habitat. The team on Schmidt Ocean Institute's Research Vessel Falkor captured footage of the nearly one foot squid at a depth of 1,968 feet, using their remotely operated vehicle \"SuBastian\" on March 9, during an Ocean Census flagship expedition searching for new marine life.ROV SuBastian/Schmidt Ocean Institutehide caption A colossal squid has been captured on camera in its natural habitat for the first time in the 100 years since its discovery — and it's a baby. The squid, measuring about one foot in length, was seen nearly 2,000 feet below the surface in March, in the South Atlantic Ocean, the Schmidt Ocean Institute said in a statement. The footage was recorded by an underwater vehicle operated remotely by a crewfrom the organization. \"It's exciting to see the firstin situ[on site] footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,\" said Dr. Kat Bolstad, an associate professor at the Auckland University of Technology who helped verify the footage. \"For 100 years, we have mainly encountered them as prey remains in whale and seabird stomachs, and as predators of harvested toothfish.\" Bolstad explained to NPR that reason colossal squids have likely not been caught on camera until now is due to their large, sensitive eyes, which probably cause them to avoid research equipment that can be bright and loud. Sometimes, squids may respond to threats by holding as still as possible, hoping to go unnoticed. Because of their elusive nature, researchers still know little about their diet, lifespan or reproductive traits. Much of what is known has been learned from similar species. But Bolstad said with this new footage, scientists may gather more information about how colossal squids behave early in their lives. The juvenile squid displayed had pearly eyes and organs and was transparent, typical for members of theCranchiidaefamily, also known as \"glass squids.\" As it matures, it will likely become more opaque as its muscles thicken, Bolstad said. Thom Linleyhelps develop technology for deep sea research and is a curator of Fishes at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. He was on board the ship gathering his notes to prepare for leading a dive for the first time. Then he caught a glimpse of the squid out of the corner of his eye. Linley, an expert in deep-sea fish, had begun to learn about squids from Bolstad. \"Oh no. This might be important,\" he thought to himself. He quickly sent a low-resolution image of the invertebrate to Bolstad, which he later described as \"incredibly cruel\" since it was not detailed enough for identification. While colossal squids grow to be quite large, their defining characteristics can be quite subtle, so Bolstad needed a more substantial image to confirm its identity. \"She's climbing the walls like, 'Give me the high res! Give me the high res!' \" Linley recalled. Aaron Evans,an independent scientist and glass squid expertviewed the low-resolution image of the squid and was readily able to identify it as a type of glass squid, a species he has studied for a decade. But he became particularly excited when he heard it was captured near Antarctica, where colossal squid exclusively reside. He and Bolstad identified key characteristics of the colossal squid, such as hooks on its tentacles. \"We got very excited, and we started hyperventilating. I mean, I can't speak for Kat. I started hyperventilating,\" Evans said. Colossal squids live in the deep sea near Antarctica. They can reach lengths of 23 feet and weigh at least 1,100 pounds, making them the heaviest known invertebrates. Their tentacles feature hooks that help them catch prey and defend themselves against predators, such as sperm whales.

    "title": "Autism rate rises slightly; RFK Jr. claims he’ll “have answers by September“",
    "article_text": "The slight rise is due to better access to tests in underserved communities. The rate of autism in a group of 8-year-olds in the US rose from 2.76 percent (1 in 36) in 2020 to 3.22 percent (1 in 31) in 2022, according toa study out Tuesday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report's authors—researchers at the CDC and academic institutions across the country— suggest that the slight uptick is likely due to improved access to evaluations in underserved groups, including Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities. The data comes from the CDC-funded Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The national network has been tracking the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 8-year-olds at a handful of sites since 2000, publishing estimates every two years. In 2000, ASD prevalence was 1 in 150, with white children from high-income communities having the highest rates of the developmental disability. In 2020, when the rate hit 1 in 36, it was the first year in which higher ASD rates were seen in underserved communities. That year, researchers also noted that the link between ASD and socioeconomic status evaporated in most of the network. In the new data, prevalence continued to be higher in underserved communities compared with white children. Prevalence among white children was 27.7 per 1,000, which is lower than prevalence among multiracial (31.9), Hispanic (33.0), Black (36.6), American Indian or Alaska Native (37.5), or Asian or Pacific Islander children (38.2). And, overall, prevalence was higher among children from low-income neighborhoods. \"The reversal of these patterns in prevalence by race and ethnicity and SES [socioeconomic status] is consistent with increased access to and provision of identification services among previously underserved groups,\" the researchers conclude. A look forward also shows trends toward more and earlier access to services. While monitoring has focused on 8-year-olds because children are more likely to have a diagnosis by that age, the researchers also examined autism evaluations and rates among children who were 4 years old in 2022. Researchers found that the younger children, born in 2018, had more evaluations in the same age window as the children who were born in 2014. This year, the ADDM included 16 sites across the country—in many past years, there were 11 sites. It's important to highlight that although the prevalence rates from these sites are often seen as national estimates of ASD prevalence, they are not. These 16 sites are not nationally representative. The populations within ADDM \"do not generate nationally representative ASD prevalence estimates,\" the authors caution. Among the sites, there were large differences. Prevalence ranged from 9.7 per 1,000 children who were 8 years old in Texas (Laredo) to 53.1 in California. These differences are likely due to \"differences in availability of services for early detection and evaluation and diagnostic practices,\" the CDC and network researchers wrote. For instance, California—the site with the highest prevalence among 8-year-olds and also 4-year-olds—has a local initiative called the Get SET Early model. \"As part of the initiative, hundreds of local pediatricians have been trained to screen and refer children for assessment as early as possible, which could result in higher identification of ASD, especially at early ages,\" the authors write. \"In addition, California has regional centers throughout the state that provide evaluations and service coordination for persons with disabilities and their families.\" On the other hand, the low ASD rates at the network's two Texas sites could \"suggest lack of access or barriers to accessing identification services,\" the authors say. The two Texas sites included primarily Hispanic and lower-income communities. The newly revealed higher rates in some of the network's underserved communities could link ASD prevalence to social determinants of health, such as low income and housing and food insecurity, the authors say. Other factors, such as higher rates of preterm birth, which is linked to neurodevelopmental disabilities, as well as lead poisoning and traumatic brain injuries, may also contribute to disparities. The detailed, data-heavy report stands in contrast to the position of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine advocate who promotes the false and thoroughly debunked claim that autism is caused by vaccines. Last month, Kennedy hired thediscredited anti-vaccine advocate David Geierto lead a federal study examining whether vaccines cause autism, despite numerous high-quality studies already finding no link between the two. Geier, who has no medical or scientific background, has long worked with his father, Mark Geier, to promote the idea that vaccines cause autism. In 2011, Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license for allegedly mistreating children with autism, and David Geier was fined for practicing medicine without a license. In a media statement Tuesday in response to the new report, Kennedy called autism an \"epidemic\" that is \"running rampant.\" He appeared to reference his planned study with Geier, saying: \"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google adds Veo 2 video generation to Gemini app",
    "article_text": "Video generation starts rolling out today for Gemini Advanced subscribers. Google has announced that yet another AI model is coming to Gemini, but this time, it's more than a chatbot. The company's Veo 2 video generator is rolling out to the Gemini app and website, giving paying customers a chance to create short video clips with Google's allegedly state-of-the-art video model. Veo 2 works like other video generators, includingOpenAI's Sora—you input text describing the video you want, and a Google data center churns through tokens until it has an animation.Google claimsthat Veo 2 was designed to have a solid grasp of real-world physics, particularly the way humans move. Google's examples do look good, but presumably that's why they were chosen. Prompt: Aerial shot of a grassy cliff onto a sandy beach where waves crash against the shore, a prominent sea stack rises from the ocean near the beach, bathed in the warm, golden light of either sunrise or sunset, capturing the serene beauty of the Pacific coastline. Veo 2 will be available in the model drop-down, but Google does note it's still considering ways to integrate this feature and that the location could therefore change. However, it's probably not there at all just yet. Google is starting the rollout today, but it could take several weeks before all Gemini Advanced subscribers get access to Veo 2. Gemini features can take a surprisingly long time to arrive for the bulk of users—for example, it took about a month for Google to make Gemini Live video available to everyone after announcing its release. When Veo 2 does pop up in your Gemini app, you can provide it with as much detail as you want, which Google says will ensure you have fine control over the eventual video. Veo 2 is currently limited to 8 seconds of 720p video, which you can download as a standard MP4 file. Video generation uses even more processing than your average generative AI feature, so Google has implemented a monthly limit. However, it hasn't confirmed what that limit is, saying only that users will be notified as they approach it. Prompt: An animated shot of a tiny mouse with oversized glasses, reading a book by the light of a glowing mushroom in a cozy forest den. If you don't want to wait for Veo 2 in the Gemini app, there's a way you can play with it early. Google's new video generator has also been added to Whisk, a Google Labs experiment announced late last year. Whisk allows you to generate images using both text prompts and example images. Starting today,Whiskhas an \"animate\" option, which uses Veo 2 to turn your still creations into 8-second video clips. Interestingly, Google lists a 100-video monthly limit for Whisk, which could mean the same ceiling on Veo 2 usage in Gemini. Even with the ability to refine the starting image and style, we haven't been overly impressed with Veo 2. So you might run through that allotment in search of what you want. The video above was supposed to show a mysterious stone monolith on Mars, the rendering of which seems good enough. But we asked to see the Martian moon Phobos crash down on the monolith and turn it to dust. The \"moon\" just bounces past and goes poof to reveal the same monolith. At least insofar as planetary bodies go, Veo 2's understanding of physics could stand to improve. Google says it worked hard to ensure Veo 2 is safe and won't generate anything illegal or inflammatory. The generated videos are also marked with aSynthID digital watermarkto label them as AI-generated. Although Veo 2 probably isn't at the point that its output will be confused with reality just yet.

    "title": "White House calls NPR and PBS a “grift,” will ask Congress to rescind funding",
    "article_text": "Markey: Cutting NPR and PBS \"is not budget discipline, it's cultural sabotage.\" The Trump White House is proposing to eliminate most federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and issued astatementyesterday alleging that NPR and PBS \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\" \"The NPR, PBS grift has ripped us off for too long,\" the White House statement said. White House budget director Russ Vought drafted a memo for a rescission plan that would eliminate funding already approved by Congress, according to multiple news reports. This includes $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), or about two years' worth of funding for the nonprofit group that provides money to public broadcasting stations. The Vought memo accused CPB of a \"lengthy history of anti-conservative bias,\"according to The New York Post. The memo also reportedly proposes an $8.3 billion cut for USAID. The $1.1 billion accounts for most of the federal money that goes to CPB. \"The Trump administration isn't planning to ask Congress to claw back about $100 million allocated for emergency communications,\" The New York Timeswrote. The NYT wrote that CPB \"is 'forward-funded' two years to insulate it from political maneuvering, and a sizable chunk of the money for 2025 has already been paid out to public broadcasters in the United States.\" In March, Trump said in a Truth Socialpostthat NPR and PBS are \"two horrible and completely biased platforms\" that \"should be DEFUNDED by Congress, IMMEDIATELY.\" In a statement provided to Ars today, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said that \"the effort underway to get Congress to rescind public media funding would disrupt the essential service PBS and local member stations provide to the American people. There's nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress... Without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.\" We also contacted the CPB and NPR today and will update this article if they provide any comments. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.)blastedthe Trump plan, calling it \"an outrageous and reckless attack on one of our most trusted civic institutions... From 'PBS NewsHour' to 'Sesame Street,' public television has set the gold standard for programming that empowers viewers, particularly young minds. Cutting off this lifeline is not budget discipline, it's cultural sabotage.\" Citing an anonymous source, Bloombergreportedthat the White House \"plans to send the package to Congress when lawmakers return from their Easter recess on April 28... That would start a 45-day period during which the administration can legally withhold the funding. If Congress votes down the plan or does nothing, the administration must release the money back to the intended recipients.\" The rarely used rescission maneuver can be approved by the Senate with a simple majority, as it is not subject to a filibuster. \"Presidents have used the rescission procedure just twice since 1979—most recently for a $15 billion spending cut package by Trump in 2018. That effort failed in the Senate,\" Bloomberg wrote. CPB expensesin fiscal-year 2025 are $545 million, of which 66.9 percent goes to TV programming. Another 22.3 percent goes to radio programming, while the rest is for administration and support. NPR and PBS have additional sources of funding. Corporate sponsorships are thetop contributor to NPR, accounting for 36 percent of revenue between 2020 and 2024. NPR gets another 30 percent of its funding in fees from member stations. Federal funding indirectly contributes to that category because the CPB provides annual grants to public radio stations that pay NPR for programming. PBS reportedthat its total expenses were $689 million in fiscal-year 2024 and that it had $348.5 million in net assets at the end of the year. NPR and PBS are also facing pressure from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, who opened an investigation in January and called on Congress to defund the organizations. Carrallegedthat NPR and PBS violated a federal law prohibiting noncommercial educational broadcast stations from running commercial advertisements. NPR and PBS both said their underwriting spots comply with the law. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The physics of bowling strike after strike",
    "article_text": "New model uses 6 differential equations relating to a rotating rigid body for best strike conditions. More than 45 million people in the US are fans of bowling, with national competitions awarding millions of dollars. Bowlers usually rely on instinct and experience, earned through lots and lots of practice, to boost their strike percentage. A team of physicists has come up with a mathematical model to better predict ball trajectories, outlined in anew paperpublished in the journal AIP Advances. The resulting equations take into account such factors as the composition and resulting pattern of the oil used on bowling lanes, as well as the inevitable asymmetries of bowling balls and player variability. The authors already had a strong interest in bowling. Three are regular bowlers and quite skilled at the sport; a fourth, Curtis Hooper of Longborough University in the UK, is a coach for Team England at the European Youth Championships. Hooper has been studying the physics of bowling for several years, includingan analysisof the 2017 Weber Cup, as well as papers devising mathematical models for theapplication of lane conditionersandoil patternsin bowling. The calculations involved in such research are very complicated because there are so many variables that can affect a ball's trajectory after being thrown. Case in point: the thin layer of oil that is applied to bowling lanes, which Hooper found can vary widely in volume and shape among different venues, plus the lack of uniformity in applying the layer, which creates an uneven friction surface. Per the authors, most research to date has relied on statistically analyzing empirical data, such as a2018 reportby the US Bowling Congress that looked at data generated by 37 bowlers. (Hooper relied on ball-tracking data for his 2017 Weber Cup analysis.) A2009 analysisshowed that the optimal location for the ball to strike the headpin is about 6 centimeters off-center, while the optimal entry angle for the ball to hit is about 6 degrees. However, such an approach struggles to account for the inevitable player variability. No bowler hits their target 100 percent of the time, and per Hooper et al., while the best professionals can come within 0.1 degrees from the optimal launch angle, this slight variation can nonetheless result in a difference of several centimeters down-lane. With this latest paper, Hooper and his co-authors have built on that prior work to create a simulation for successful target strategies bowlers might use to increase their strike percentage. Their resulting model takes into account starting position, ball speed, axis rotation, axis tilt, angular velocity, and yes, the effects of that pesky oil layer on the lanes. \"Predicting the motion of the pins (and thus strike chance) after the initial impact between the ball and head pin accurately is a very difficult problem due to many features, such as the shape of the pin, differences in the properties of the pins (center of gravity, base radius, mass, etc.), and differences in the position of the pins when each full set of pins is initially set,\" Hooper told Ars. \"Whilst this would be an interesting problem to study, we decided in this work to couple the results of our model with data collected from a laboratory test that investigated the effect of entry angle and impact position on strike percentage.\" The resulting model uses a set of six differential equations relating to a rotating rigid body to show the best conditions for a strike. For instance, there are two phases of the ball's motion: a sliding phase, where friction is low, which accounts for most of the ball's travel; and a pure rolling phase, where no more torque is applied and the ball travels in a straight line toward the pins. The model can take all the relevant inputs that affect a bowling ball's motion and accurately calculate the trajectory to determine the ideal path for a strike. As for player variability, it turns out there is an area that has the highest chance of a strike, and this is where the oil pattern can have an impact, thanks to varying friction between the center of the lane and the gutter. \"If the bowler misses slightly to the right, the higher friction near the gutter would accelerate the ball to the left,\" the authors wrote. \"Similarly, the lower friction in the center means that a shot that misses slightly to the left will not hook early.\" Experienced bowlers may already know this, but the model should be helpful to those relatively new to the game seeking to make adjustments to improve their strike percentage. Hooper et al. hope to further improve the accuracy of their model to take into account such factors as uneven bowling lanes. \"Talking to the elite level bowlers about this work will help us to understand what shape of ball paths they are looking for when they compete, and if what our model predicts is close to where they would bowl on a given oil pattern in a competitive setting,\" said Hooper. \"The model would also be helpful to illustrate to bowlers (of all levels) what happens when they miss their intended shot, not only in terms of direction, but by an increase/decrease in axis rotation or speed.\" AIP Advances, 2025.

    "article_text": "Early info is unreliable, but the site has been mostly unavailable for hours. Infamous Internet imageboard and wretched hive of scum and villainy 4chan was apparently hacked at some point Monday evening and remains mostly unreachable as of this writing. DownDetectorshowed reports of outagesspiking at about 10:07 pm Eastern time on Monday, and they've remained elevated since. Posters at Soyjack Party, a rival imageboard that began as a 4chan offshoot, claimed responsibility for the hack. But as with all posts on these intensely insular boards, it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. The thread shows screenshots of what appear to be 4chan's PHP admin interface, among other screenshots, that suggest extensive access to 4chan's databases of posts and users.

Ars staffers pointed to the presence of long-deprecated and removed functions likemysql_real_escape_stringin the screenshots as possible signs of an old, unpatched PHP version.

    "title": "Netflix plans to bring streaming into the $1 trillion club by 2030",
    "article_text": "Netflix aims to double its revenue over the next five years, WSJ reports. Netflix plans to reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion by 2030,The Wall Street Journal(WSJ) reported this week, citing anonymous people who attended an “annual business review meeting” that Netflix held in March. Netflix's current market capitalization is nearly $400 billion. Netflix is reportedly partnering its market cap goals with plans to double revenue within the same time frame. For 2024, Netflix reported $39 billion in revenue, meaning the company aims to raise its annual revenue to $78 billion in five years. Compared to the prior five years, Netflix’s revenue grew 93.5 percent from 2019 ($20.16 billion) to 2024. However, that time period represented a different market, one where streaming subscriber counts were rising rapidly, and Netflix faced less competition than it does today. However, Netflix's 2030 revenue goals are also dependent on its advertising business, something Netflix lacked in 2019. WSJ, citing anonymous people who attended Netflix’s March meeting, reported that Netflix plans to make $9 billion in ad sales by 2030. Netflix hasn’t disclosed ad revenue sincelaunching its ad subscription tierin November 2022. However, eMarketerhas estimatedthat Netflix will make over $2 billion in US ad revenue this year. Netflix will try growing its ad business by getting more people to subscribe to its ad tier, which is its cheapest subscription option. But additional methods for growing ad revenue will also be critical over the next five years, including showingmore live events. Live events force all viewers, including those with ad-free subscriptions, to watch commercials. Netflix will also look to take more control over ad revenue tied to its platform by using proprietary ad technology. Since launching its ad tier, Netflix has largely relied on Microsoft for ad tech. Netflix issupposed to releaseits own technology, a supply-side platform and ad server called The Netflix Ads Suite, this month. The company has discussed potentially introducing new ad formats, like pause ads, while keeping ad loads at four minutes per hour with its tech. However, US President Donald Trump'swavering tariff planshave stirred uncertainty for advertisers and are expected to hurt the ad market in the coming months and years. Netflix doesn’t plan to disclose subscriber counts anymore, but one of WSJ’s anonymous sources said that the streaming leader wants to have 410 million subscribers by 2030. That would require Netflix to add 108.4 million more subscribers than it reported at the end of 2024, or about 21.7 million per year, and expand its global reach. In 2024, Netflix added 41.36 million subscribers, including a record number of new subscribers in Q4 2024. Netflix plans to release its Q1 2025 earnings report on April 17. Should Netflix achieve its reported goals, it would be the first to join the $1 trillion club solely through streaming-related business. The club is currently populatedmostly by tech brands, including two companies that own Netflix rivals: Apple and Amazon. Netflix is, by far, the most likely streaming candidate to potentially enter the lucrative club. It’scurrently beatingall other video-streaming providers, including Amazon Prime Video and Disney+, in terms of revenue and profits. Some streaming businesses, including Apple TV+ and Peacock, still aren’t profitable yet. Netflix's reported striving for a $1 trillion market cap exemplifies the meteoric rise of streaming since Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007. As linear TV keeps shrinking, and streaming companies continue learning how to mimic the ads, live TV, andcontent strategies of their predecessors, the door is open for streaming firms to evolve into some of the world's most highly valued media entities. The potential for Netflix to have a trillion-dollar market cap also has notable implications for rivals Apple and Amazon, which both earned membership into the $1 trillion club without their streaming services. Whether Netflix will reach the goals reported by WSJ is not guaranteed, but it will be interesting to watch how Netflix's strategy for reaching that lofty goal affects subscribers. Further, with streaming set to be more central to the viewing of TV shows, movies, and live events by 2030, efforts around things like ads,pricing, and content libraries could impact media consumption as we head toward 2030.

    "title": "Here’s how a satellite ended up as a ghostly apparition on Google Earth",
    "article_text": "Zoom in over rural North Texas for a spacey surprise. Dig deep on Google Earth and you'll inevitably find a surprise or two. Maybe you're looking at far-flung islands in the middle of an ocean or checking in on something closer to home. A few years ago, online sleuths found animage of a B-2 stealth bomberin flight over Missouri. The aircraft is smeared in the image because it was in motion, while the farm fields below appear as crisp as any other view on Google Earth. There's something else that now appears on Google Earth. Zoom in over rural North Texas, and you'll find a satellite. It appears five times in different colors, each projected over wooded bottomlands in a remote wildlife refuge about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Dallas. Satellites in low-Earth orbit soar up to 40 times higher than a B-2 bomber and travel about 30 times faster. But there are more than 9,300 active satellites currently in orbit, and thousands more space debris objects, compared to 19 operational B-2 bombers in the Air Force's inventory. Someonefirst sharedGoogle Earth's satellite capture last week on Reddit. The identity of the satellite hasn't been confirmed, but its appearance is similar to that of a SpaceX Starlink satellite, specifically a Starlink V2 Mini, with two solar panels spanning some 100 feet (30 meters) end to end. There are more than 7,000 Starlink satellites in space today, more than all other satellite constellations combined, so it wouldn't be surprising that the first Google Earth capture of another spacecraft in orbit would show a Starlink. Google Earth data indicates that the image was taken on November 30, 2024, by a high-resolution Pleiades observation satellite owned by Airbus. AnotherReddit user suggestedthe satellite could be a Chinese Earth-imaging spacecraft named Ziyuan 3-02, which was flying in the same area as the Pleiades satellite at the time. Regardless of the identity of the satellite, this image is remarkable for several reasons. First, despite so many satellites flying in space, it's still rare to see a real picture—not just an artist's illustration—of what one actually looks like in orbit. For example, SpaceX has released photos of Starlink satellites in launch configuration, where dozens of the spacecraft are stacked together to fit inside the payload compartment of the Falcon 9 rocket. But there are fewer well-resolved views of a satellite in its operational environment, with solar arrays extended like the wings of a bird. This is changing as commercial companies place more and more imaging satellites in orbit. Several companies provide \"non-Earth imaging\" services by repurposing Earth observation cameras to view other objects in space. These views can reveal information that can be useful in military or corporate espionage. Secondly, the Google Earth capture offers a tangible depiction of a satellite's speed. An object in low-Earth orbit must travel at more than 17,000 mph (more than 27,000 km per hour) to keep from falling back into the atmosphere. While the B-2's motion caused it to appear a little smeared in the Google Earth image a few years ago, the satellite's velocity created a different artifact. The satellite appears five times in different colors, which tells us something about how the image was made. Airbus' Pleiades satellites take pictures in multiple spectral bands: blue, green, red, panchromatic, and near-infrared. At lower left, the black outline of the satellite is the near-infrared capture. Moving up, you can see the satellite in red, blue, and green, followed by the panchromatic, or black-and-white, snapshot with the sharpest resolution. Typically, the Pleiades satellites record these images a split-second apart and combine the colors to generate an accurate representation of what the human eye might see. But this doesn't work so well for a target moving at nearly 5 miles per second. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Nvidia nudges mainstream gaming PCs forward with RTX 5060 series, starting at $299",
    "article_text": "RTX 5060 includes 8GB for $299; RTX 5060 Ti has 8GB or 16GB for $379 and $429. Nvidia is rounding out its GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards today with the official announcement of the mainstream RTX 5060 series. The company is announcing three new GPUs today: The 5060 Ti will launch on April 16 in both 8GB and 16GB variations, for $379 and $429, respectively. The regular RTX 5060 will follow at some point in May for the same $299 MSRP as the last-generation RTX 4060. It is also sticking with 8GB of RAM. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether the company and its partners can actually stock these cards at these prices. GPUs from the top-tierRTX 5090to the mainstreamRTX 5070have been difficult to impossible to buy at their announced MSRPs. And it's not just Nvidia's problem or a high-end problem—AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPUshave also been hard to buy, as haveIntel's Arc B580andB570cards. The new graphics cards' specs essentially match numbers that have been floating around for a couple of months now. Both models include modest increases in the number of CUDA cores compared to the last-generation 4060 and 4060 Ti models, with the same amount of RAM and the same 128-bit memory interface. But an upgrade to GDDR7 instead of GDDR6 provides a healthy bump to memory bandwidth and is probably also partially responsible for an increase in peak power consumption. The 4060 Ti in particular was memory bandwidth-constrained at higher resolutions, so hopefully some extra bandwidth will make it a better choice for a decent 1440p gaming PC. Nvidia's xx60 tier generally ends up being its most popular, going off of the statistics provided by the Steam Hardware Survey; mobile and desktop xx60 models from various generations account for seven of Steam's 10 most-used GPUs, led by the RTX 3060 and 4060. That means that new xx60 GPUs are an important baseline for PC gaming performance. As with its other 50-series announcements, Nvidia is leaning on its DLSS Multi-Frame Generation technology to make lofty performance claims—the GPUs can insert up to three AI-interpolated frames in between each pair of frames that the GPU actually renders. The 40 series could only generate a single frame, and 30-series and older GPUs don't support DLSS Frame Generation at all. This makes apples-to-apples performance comparisons difficult. Generally, the company says the 5060 Ti and 5060 offer double the performance of the 4060 Ti and 4060, but all of its benchmarks are made using the \"max Frame Gen level supported by each GPU.\" The small snippets of native performance information we do have—Hogwarts Legacyruns on a 5060 Ti at 61 FPS 1440p, compared to 34 FPS for the 3060 Ti—suggests that it's slightly less than twice as fast as that two-generation-old card. This would still be reasonably impressive, given the underwhelming 4060 Ti refresh. But we'll need to wait for third-party testing before we really have a good idea of how performance will stack up without Frame Generation enabled. As we and others have observed since the launch of the 40-series a few years ago, Frame Generation gives the best results when your base frame rate is already reasonably high; the technology is best used to make a good frame rate better and is less useful if you're trying to make a bad frame rate good. That's even more relevant for the slower 50-series than for the other GPUs in the lineup, which makes Nvidia's reticence to provide native performance comparisons especially frustrating. Rumors from earlier this year that correctly reported the specs of the 5060 series also indicated that Nvidia wasplanning to launch a low-end RTX 5050 GPUat some point, its first new entry-level GPU since launching the RTX 3050 in January 2022. The 5050 could still be coming, but if it is, it wasn't part of Nvidia's announcements today. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump Administration puts $2.2 billion of Harvard’s research money on hold",
    "article_text": "Harvard won't give government a say in faculty hiring; Trump threatens its tax status. The Trump administration has beenusing federal research funding as a cudgel. The government has blocked billions of dollars in research funds and threatened to put a hold on even more in order to compel universities to adopt what it presents as essential reforms. In the case of Columbia University, that includes changes in the leadership of individual academic departments. On Friday, the government sent a list of demands that it presented as necessary to \"maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.\" On Monday, Harvard responded that accepting these demands would \"allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.\" The university also changed its home page into an extensive tribute to the research that would be eliminated if the funds were withheld. The reprisals against Harvard began almost immediately. By the end of Monday, the Trump administrationput $2.2 billion of Harvard's research funding on hold. And on Tuesday, Trump himselfmade threatsagainst the university's tax exempt status. Harvard postedthe letter it receivedfrom federal officials, listing their demands. Some of it is what you expect, given the Trump administration's interests. The admissions and hiring departments would be required to drop all diversity efforts, with data on faculty and students to be handed over to the federal government for auditing. As at other institutions, there are also some demands presented as efforts against antisemitism, such as the defunding of pro-Palestinian groups. More generally, it demands that university officials \"prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions.\" There are also a bunch of basic culture war items, such as a demand for a mask ban, and a ban on \"de-platforming\" speakers on campus. In addition, the government wants the university to screen all faculty hires for plagiarism issues, which is what causedHarvard's former president to resignafter she gave testimony to Congress. Any violation of these updated conduct codes by a non-citizen would require an immediate report to the Department of Homeland Security and State Department, presumably so they can prepare to deport them. However, the most striking aspect of the letter is the complete shift in tone about diversity. After having presented Harvard's existing diversity efforts as the antithesis of a merit-based approach, it suddenly demands that the university enforce what it terms viewpoint diversity. It never defines what this term means—perhaps alchemy in the chemistry department? But the implications are that it amounts to affirmative action for conservatives. Harvard is directed to \"audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint diverse.\" Any department that fails the audit would be required to start hiring new faculty until it can pass the undefined standards demanded by the feds. Again, all this is being presented as necessary for Harvard to continue receiving research funds. The university has decided these demands force it to fight, and it's attacking on two fronts. The first is public-facing; Harvard has turned itshomepageinto a tribute to its researchers and the work they pursue. Although it starts with a huge banner article as shown here, links to 30 individual articles on research fill the entire page. I have a fairly high-resolution screen, and it took hitting page-down nine times to finally reach the bottom, where a handful of links to the rest of the university finally appear. The message is clear: The research that's under threat matters, and humanity will be worse off if its funding is cut. Separately, Harvard'slegal response, which it made public today, is basically: nope. After detailing the steps the university has already taken to address antisemitism, it gets to the crux of the issue: \"your letter disregards Harvard’s efforts and instead presents demands that, in contravention of the First Amendment, invade university freedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court.\" The harms these demands are meant to address, the letter alleges, haven't actually been demonstrated through processes that are required by law. It continues by essentially calling the government's demands the equivalent of a hostile takeover: The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights. Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government’s terms as an agreement in principle. Let's be clear: There is a good chance that Harvard is risking a catastrophic loss of funding, resulting in entire research programs being shut down, layoffs, and grad students with no way to pursue their thesis projects. It could well be a crisis that requires generations of new faculty hires to recover from. And the $2.2 billion dollar hit it has already taken is something that even a university with Harvard's resources will find challenging to manage. (Loss of its tax exempt status, while potentially catastrophic, is a legally dubious threat.) At the same time, Harvard saw one of its peers, Columbia University, accede to a somewhat more limited set of demands and have its funding put on hold anyway. Given that, the decision to prepare to gain public support and fight it out in court doesn't seem unreasonable.

    "title": "Android phones will soon reboot themselves after sitting unused for 3 days",
    "article_text": "The latest Google update will make your phone more secure if you don't touch it A silent update rolling out to virtually all Android devices will make your phone more secure, and all you have to do is not touch it for a few days. The new feature implements auto-restart of a locked device, which will make your personal data harder to extract. It's coming as part of a Google Play Services update, though, so there's nothing you can do to speed along the process. Google is preparing to release anew update to Play Services(v25.14), which brings a raft of tweaks and improvements. Firstspottedby 9to5Google, the update was officially released on April 14, but as with all Play Services updates, it could take a week or more to reach all devices. When 25.14 arrives, Android devices will see a few minor improvements, including prettier settings screens, improved connection with cars and watches, and content previews when using Quick Share. Most importantly, Play Services 25.14 adds a feature that Google describes thusly: \"With this feature, your device automatically restarts if locked for 3 consecutive days.\" This is similar to a feature known as Inactivity Reboot that Apple added to the iPhone iniOS 18.1. This actually caused some annoyance among law enforcement officials who believed they had suspects' phones stored in a readable state, only to find they were rebooting and becoming harder to access due to this feature. Like Apple's devices, Android phones are most secure when they've been freshly rebooted. In this \"Before First Unlock\" (BFU) state, biometrics and location-based unlocking won't work. The only way to access the device is to use the passcode or PIN. Additionally, all the data stored on the phone is encrypted in the BFU state, making retrieval and snooping much more difficult, even for law enforcement groups that have access to advanced data recovery tools. Rather than leave your phone, which is a vast repository of personal data, sitting unencrypted indefinitely, the new Play Services will limit that exposure to three days, even if it's plugged in. The early sluggishness of Android system updates prompted Google to begin moving parts of the OS to Google Play Services. This collection of background services and libraries can be updated by Google automatically in the background as long as your phone is certified for Google services (which almost all are). That's why the inactivity reboot will just show up on your phone in the coming weeks with no notification. There are definitelyreasons to be waryof the control Google has over Android with elements like Play Services, but it does pay off when the company can enhance everyone's security without delay.

    "title": "ISPs and robocallers love the FCC plan to “delete” as many rules as possible",
    "article_text": "FCC's \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" docket is filled with requests to eliminate rules. Industry groups have submitted deregulatory wishlists for the Federal Communications Commission's \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" initiative that aims to eliminate as many regulations as possible. Broadband providers that want fewer telecom regulations and debt collectors opposed to robocall rules were among those submitting comments to the FCC in response to Chairman Brendan Carr's request for public input. The Carr-led FCC last month issued apublic noticeasking for help with \"identifying FCC rules for the purpose of alleviating unnecessary regulatory burdens.\" The FCC said it opened the official proceeding—which is titled \"Delete, Delete, Delete\"—because \"President Trump has called on administrative agencies to unleash prosperity through deregulation and ensure that they are efficiently delivering great results for the American people.\" Initial comments were due on Friday, and there is an April 28 deadline for reply comments. Thedockethas comments submitted by AT&T, Verizon, and the top lobbying groups for the cable, telecom, and mobile broadband industries. Starlink-owner SpaceX and Amazon's Kuiper submitted wishlists for satellite deregulation. The FCC also received deregulatory requests from prison phone company Securus, TV broadcasters, and multiple groups that want less strict robocall rules. Carr has long been an advocate for removing broadband and telecom regulations, so rule-cutting requests submitted by Internet providers and their lobby groups probably have a good chance of being implemented. But Carr isn't against regulations of all types: he has controversially sought to increase enforcement of content policies against news stations accused of bias against conservatives and Trump and has supported many actions against robocallers. Carr has already started making it easier for telcos to turn off old copper phone and DSL networks, as wereported last month. AT&T and Verizon want additional rule-cutting when it comes tomaintaining old networks, and it appears that Delete, Delete, Delete could achieve that and a lot more. The urgency to delete regulations may have increased since Carr opened the proceeding because Trump last week issued anexecutive orderdirecting agency heads to quickly identify regulations for removal. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB)submitteda longshot request for the FCC to eliminate its news-distortion policy. As weexplained in a feature article, Carr is invoking this rarely enforced policy to probe broadcast news decisions, such as how CBS edited an interview with Kamala Harris. Carr's aggressive use of the news-distortion policy has drawn condemnations from both liberal and conservative advocacy groups. The NAB said that \"the news distortion policy does not pass legal and constitutional muster... the policy is not based on any explicit statutory mandate, and therefore it is questionable whether the FCC has authority to enforce it.\" The NAB further said the policy \"is contrary to the public interest and the First Amendment... impermissibly chills speech and discourages coverage of important public issues, ... places the Commission into the intrusive and constitutionally suspect role of scrutinizing program content and the editorial choices of broadcasters.\" Carr's elimination of the policy would be an abrupt change of course. That doesn't mean the NAB will get nothing out of Delete, Delete, Delete, as the group also asked for various other changes. For example, the NAB said the FCC should eliminate rules limiting ownership of broadcast television stations and other rules related to broadcast licensing. The conservative broadcast company Sinclair submitted a filing withsimilar requeststo eliminate or relax ownership and licensing rules. AT&T's commentsask the FCC to halt enforcement proceedings that could result in financial penalties, saying that a Supreme Court ruling \"calls into serious question the constitutionality\" of the FCC's enforcement regime. AT&T was referring to the Supreme Court's June 2024rulinginSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy, which held that \"when the SEC seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the Seventh Amendment entitles the defendant to a jury trial.\" \"Under the Court's clear reasoning inJarkesy, the Commission's practice of imposing monetary 'forfeitures' without affording targets the right to a jury trial violates the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution. The Commission should eliminate rules that impose such unlawful financial penalties,\" AT&T said. As wereported in November, AT&T and Verizon used this same argument in court to claim that the FCC cannot issue fines against the carriers for selling user location data. AT&T's new filing asks the FCC to \"close long-pending investigations and other open proceedings that exceed the Commission's authority.\" AT&T also asked the FCC to eliminate several roaming obligations that apply to wireless carriers. ACA International, a trade group for the debt collection industry,asked the FCCto revoke the \"revoke all\" rule that makes it easier for consumers to opt out of unwanted communications. ACA International said that under the revoke all rule, \"a request to revoke consent by whatever channel requires cessation of all contact by any other communication channel that requires prior consent.\" \"Per the revoke all rule, callers must stop all future contacts for which consent is required in response to a single revocation request. Thus, if a consumer replies to a text message requesting that the caller stop future texts, the caller must also stop future calls if consent is required,\" the group said. Additionally, a \"request to stop a telemarketing call stops all informational robocalls or robotexts.\" ACA International claimed the rule harms customers who have overdue payments on several accounts. The \"revoke all\" rule \"puts consumers in jeopardy because they may be deprived of the opportunity to resolve outstanding debts, leaving them exposed to litigation or worsening of the consumer's credit rating,\" the group said. ACA International also asked the FCC to allow robocalls when there is an \"established business relationship\" between the customer and business. In 2012, the FCCdecidedto require telemarketers to obtain prior consent from users even when there is an established business relationship. ACA International complained that its members must follow \"a dizzying array of restrictions that require callers to expend enormous resources to ensure compliance\" and said the FCC should \"eliminate the 2012 rule barring use of the [established business relationship] for calls and texts and restore the exemption.\" Anotherrobocall requestcame from the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. The group said that under current rules, a consumer opting out from appointment reminders \"would also revoke the business's consent to send marketing messages and other informational messages related to prescriptions or other health alerts, potentially harming consumers, even though the consumer signed up for each program separately.\" \"Rather than treating a consumer's revocation message as a universal opt-out to all types of nonexempt messages, we urge the FCC to adopt a presumption that a revocation message is limited to the specific message program to which the consumer replies,\" the group said. Verizon asked the FCCto eliminate a rule that requires it to unlock mobile phones so that they can be used on other networks. \"The rule applies only to a minority of wireless providers (mainly Verizon), creating an unlevel playing field in a critical US industry,\" Verizon said. Verizon was referring toopen access requirementsin C Block 700 MHz wireless spectrum. Verizon agreed to follow the spectrum-specific rules when itpurchased licensesto use the C Block in 2008. The rule \"requires Verizon (and not other major wireless providers) to unlock mobile devices within 60 days,\" Verizon said. \"This short period contrasts with an industry standard for prepaid service of at least six months and for postpaid service a requirement that the device is first paid in full. This has made Verizon a prime target of international criminal rings who obtain heavily subsidized devices in the US through illicit means and then sell them at a significant profit in other parts of the world.\" The FCC in 2019 granted Verizon apartial waiverallowing the 60-day locking period to fight fraud, but Verizon says the exemption isn't enough. \"For example, even with a 60-day locking period, Verizon estimates that it lost 784,703 devices to fraud in 2023 alone, which resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars lost, and this occurs annually,\" Verizon said. Under the Biden administration, the FCCproposeda 60-day unlocking requirement that would apply to all wireless providers. That would help put Verizon on equal regulatory footing with the other major carriers, but the proposal is still pending. AT&T's comments asked the FCC to close this handset unlocking proceeding without adopting new rules. Verizon also asked the FCC to ditch some rules related to submitting broadband mapping data. For example, Verizon wants the FCC to end a requirement to create in-vehicle coverage maps. \"Requiring both stationary and in-vehicle maps doubles the number of maps wireless providers must create,\" Verizon said, arguing that rules of this type \"impose costs that far exceed the marginal benefits of the data they provide.\" A filing from cable lobby groupNCTA-The Internet & Television Associationdiscussed last year'sSupreme Court decisionthat eliminated theChevronprecedent under which agencies were given broad leeway to interpret ambiguous laws. \"In the oldChevronworld, rules were adopted that extended statutory provisions beyond their scope,\" the NCTA said. \"Many of these Commission interpretations were then upheld on review based on the now-repudiated premise that courts were required to defer to an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute.\" The NCTA acknowledged that the Supreme Court did not overturn prior cases that relied onChevrondeference but said the court \"did not foreclose the ability of an agency to revisit its own prior orders and to eliminate or modify existing rules that exceed its statutory authority.\" In the NCTA's view, one such rule that should be eliminated requires cable and satellite TV providers to specify the \"all-in\" price of services in ads and promotional materials. The rule wasadopted last yearto stop the TV-provider practice ofusing hidden fees, like Broadcast TV and Regional Sports Network charges, to conceal the full cost of video service. \"Adoption of the rule is a prime example of the Commission exceeding the bounds of the authority delegated to it by Congress,\" the NCTA argued. The FCC rule goes beyond what Congress required in a 2019 law that said video providers must disclose the all-in price at the point of sale and in writing within 24 hours of a customer obtaining service, the NCTA said. Carr is likely to listen closely to this argument—hedissentedfrom last year's rulemaking, saying the order \"strays markedly from our statutory authority\" and that \"Congress considered and ultimately rejected extending the law to advertisements.\" The FCC received other rule-elimination requests fromUSTelecomand the wireless industry groupCTIA. The FCC also heard from a group called the 21st Century Privacy Coalition—which was created by telecom industry members to lobby against strict privacy rules. The group hassaidits members include AT&T, CenturyLink, Comcast, Cox, CTIA, NCTA, T-Mobile, USTelecom, and Verizon. The 21st Century Privacy Coalitiontold the FCCthat a number of its rules on Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) \"exceed the Commission's statutory authority, are substantially outdated, and impose unnecessary and burdensome costs on telecommunications carriers without providing consumers with corresponding benefits.\" SpaceXasked the FCC to relax space station and earth station licensing procedures to make it easier to deploy low-Earth satellite networks like Starlink. SpaceX also said the FCC should \"modernize outdated protections for legacy GSO [geostationary orbit] systems.\" Amazon's Kuiper Systemssaidthat numerous regulations are \"ripe for deleting or streamlining\" in order to \"reduce regulatory burdens on the satellite industry.\" Prison phone company Securus, meanwhile,wants a do-overof a 2024 order thatlowered the pricesof prison phone calls. The company said the FCC should reassess a prohibition \"on the use of regulated revenue to fund critical safety and security measures, including recording, storage, and live monitoring, which is creating havoc for many law enforcement agencies.\" Securus also wants the FCC to lift a ban on \"ancillary\" charges that drive up the prices paid by prisoners and their families. Carr generallysupported that 2024 orderbut expressed some concerns about the rate structure chosen by the FCC. Decisions to eliminate rules can be challenged in court. TechFreedom, a libertarian-leaning think tank, supported the goals of \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" butcautioned the FCCto move deliberately so that its actions don't get overturned by judges. \"The FCC should be wary of overreach, as it may not survive appellate scrutiny under theMajor Questions Doctrine,\" the group said. AT&T wants the FCC to move as fast as possible, as it urged the agency to overhaul its enforcement regime \"without the delay imposed by notice-and-comment proceeding.\" AT&T pointed to a Trumpmemorandumthat said \"agencies shall immediately take steps to effectuate the repeal of any regulation, or the portion of any regulation, that clearly exceeds the agency's statutory authority or is otherwise unlawful.\" But TechFreedom said that US law \"generally requires notice and comment rulemakings for changes to substantive rules.\" There is a \"good cause\" exemption, but courts have only recognized this exemption \"in limited circumstances, such as emergencies or where prior notice would subvert the statutory scheme.\" \"When in doubt, the agency should seek public comments to ensure that it accounts for potential reliance interests upon the existing rule,\" TechFreedom said. Anna Gomez, a Democratic commissioner at the FCC, has urged a measured approach. \"We want to take a scalpel, not a chainsaw, to the rules of protecting consumers and promoting competition,\" she said at a conference last week,according to Light Reading. Carr seems eager to push ahead with rule deletions. \"Under President Trump's leadership, the Administration is unleashing a new wave of economic opportunity by ending the regulatory onslaught from Washington,\" Carrsaidwhen he announced the plan. \"For too long, administrative agencies have added new regulatory requirements in excess of their authority or kept lawful regulations in place long after their shelf life had expired... The FCC is committed to ending all of the rules and regulations that are no longer necessary.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "FCC head Brendan Carr tells Europe to get on board with Starlink",
    "article_text": "Author of Project 2025 chapter says EU regulators have “bias” against US tech firms. One of President Donald Trump’s top officials has warned European allies hesitant about working with Elon Musk’s satellite Internet company that they needed to choose between US and Chinese technology. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr told the Financial Times that “allied western democracies” needed to “focus on the real long-term bogey: the rise of the Chinese Communist party.” His comments come as European governments and some European companies consider whether Starlink—which is owned by Musk’s SpaceX and provides satellite broadband and limited mobile services—is a reliable partner after Washington threatened to switch off its services in Ukraine. Carr, a longtime ally of Musk who Trump tapped to run the agency after his re-election as president, said it was “unfortunate” that politics appeared to be influencing long-term decisions. “If you’re concerned about Starlink, just wait for the CCP’s version, then you’ll be really worried,” he said. UK telecoms companies BT and Virgin Media 02 are among the companies trialling Starlink’s technology for mobile or broadband services—although neither has yet signed a full agreement with the provider. Carr has previously argued in favor of Musk’s businesses in the US, claiming they had been targets of “regulatory harassment” ever since the billionaire took over Twitter in 2022. He has also repeatedly suggested that Joe Biden’s administration discriminated against Starlink by denying it US government subsidies for rural broadband. Carr told the FT that he believed Europe was “caught” between Washington and Beijing and warned of a “great divide” opening up between “CCP-aligned countries and others” in artificial intelligence and satellite technology. The FCC chair—who authored a chapter of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a Republican presidency published by the rightwing Heritage Foundation—said European regulators had a “bias” against US technological companies. He also accused the European Commission of “protectionism” and an “anti-American” attitude. “If Europe has its own satellite constellation then great, I think the more the better. But more broadly, I think Europe is caught a little bit between the US and China. And it’s sort of time for choosing,” he said. The European Commission said it had “always enforced and would continue to enforce laws fairly and without discrimination to all companies operating in the EU, in full compliance with global rules.” Shares in European satellite providers such as Eutelsat and SES soared in recent weeks despite the companies’ heavy debts, in response to the commission saying that Brussels “should fund Ukrainian [military] access to services that can be provided by EU-based commercial providers.” Industry experts warned that despite the positivity, no single European network could yet compete with Starlink’s offering. Carr said that European telecoms companies Nokia and Ericsson should move more of their manufacturing to the US as both face being hit with Trump’s import tariffs. The two companies are the largest vendors of mobile network infrastructure equipment in the US. Carr said there had been a historic “mistake” in US industrial policy, which meant there was no significant American company competing in the telecom vendor market. “I don’t love that current situation we’re in,” he said. Carr added that he would “look at” granting the companies faster regulatory clearances on new technology if they moved to the US. Last month, Ericsson chief executive Börje Ekholm told the FT the company would consider expanding manufacturing in the US depending on how potential tariffs affected it. The Swedish telecoms equipment maker first opened an American factory in Lewisville, Texas, in 2020. “We’ve been ramping up [production in the US] already. Do we need bigger changes? We will have to see,” Ekholm added. Nokia said that the US was the company’s “second home.” “Around 90 percent of all US communications utilizes Nokia equipment at some point. We have five manufacturing sites and five R&D hubs in the US including Nokia Bell Labs,” they added. Ericsson declined to comment. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.

At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. Was the James Webb Space Telescope worth it? Well, $10 billion isa lotof money. Even when spread over a couple of decades, that's still a huge chunk of NASA's annual science budget. (And given the recentTrump administration attackon NASA's science budget, money is about to get a whole lot tighter.) However, it is difficult to put a price on advancing our species' understanding of the natural world and the wide Universe we're swimming in. And Webb is doing an amazing job of that. In 2009, NASA launched the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, mission to make infrared observations. This was the latest in a line of space-based infrared observatories, and it cost about 3 percent as much as the Webb telescope. Today's photo concerns the planetary nebula NGC 1514. In 2010, using the WISE telescope, NASA project scientist Mike Ressler discovered \"rings\" around the planetary nebula. Now, thanks to Webb, the rings—which are likely composed of small dust grains, heated by ultraviolet light from a white dwarf star—can be seen clearly. And, oh my, they're spectacular. The clarity in the Webb photo, compared to what came before, is remarkable. So, is seeing the Universe in a new light worth $10 billion? I certainly think so, but I'm writing a weekly story called the Tuesday Telescope, so it's safe to say I am biased.

    "title": "The Handmaid’s Tale Showrunner on Bringing More Backstory to One of Its Most Complicated Characters",
    "article_text": "WatchingThe Handmaid’s Talefor the first time, the inevitable question soon rises: how did a place as oppressive and cruel as Gilead come to be? Over six seasons, we’ve learned the Gilead origin story through flashbacks sprinkled into the main narrativeâsomething that feels increasingly likea cautionary talefor American viewers in 2025âand the Hulu show has also filled in blanks for its main players. But in a recent episode, it gave us another fresh glance into one character’s life “before.” We’ve long been fascinated withSerena Joy Waterford, deftly played by Yvonne Strahovski as a woman who backed Gilead’s right-wing Christian agenda from the start and married Fred Waterford, who became the powerful Commander Waterford once the United States underwent its forced transformation. Though Serena was once a popular author and political speaker, she willingly put her career aside and became a dutiful wifeâfor a time. AsThe Handmaid’s Talehas progressed, we’ve learned Serena is far from a one-note zealot. Her desire to become a mother guided some of her most odious actions, but she eventually proved she wasn’t too rigid to realize her failings as a human beingâand began to feel deep regret about her part in turning the world upside down. In episode two, “Exile,” viewers got to meet Serena’s father for the first time. (Her mother, who lives in Gilead, made an unpleasant impression back in season three and hasn’t been seen since.) There are two flashbacks in the episode, which in the show’s present day follows Serena’s decision to return to Gileadâspecifically, the more reformed New Bethlehem region, where she thinks she’ll be able to ease her guilt and get back on the path God has envisioned for her. Her relationship with her father, a pastor, is a part of the Serena puzzle the show’s been wanting to explore, according toThe Handmaid’s Talecreator Bruce Miller. Speaking tothe Wrap, he explained, “Weâve learned about her, but this is really interesting, because itâs not about a relationship she chose, like with Fred … Here, youâre like, how did you become the woman you are? I think thatâs the really interesting question now, because youâve plumbed the depths of Serena to know whatâs there, you know the woman thatâs there. So when you get to season six, youâre asking the question of, what was her father like? And I donât think you are at the beginning, because I think she has a million relationships in her life, but that one gets much more interesting when you realize how much steel she has.” The two scenes with Serena’s father unfold a few years apart; in the first one, she’s just met Fred and her father is congratulating her on her book tour. In the second, her fatherâwho is much older and more frail-lookingâlistens as she excitedly tells him “Weâre about to change the country!” At that point she thinks she’s making good on her father’s earlier urgings to be a beacon for the movementâbut of course we know her marriage to Fred will be filled with misery, and the “changes” she helped spearhead will bring horror and tragedy, not “a new Garden of Eden” as she envisions. Perhaps she’s hoping New Bethlehem will be that instead? You can never predict what Serena will do, but she does have an amazing way of always landing on her feet.

    "title": "Apple Faces Serious Tariff Troubles, But Amazon Is Crushing The Price of The Renewed iPhone 13 to a Record Low",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Smartphone buyers are increasingly looking to“renewed”phones for excellent value and Amazon’s renewed program is leading the way. One product is currently very popular on the leading marketplace:the renewed iPhone 13. This phone has becomeAmazon’s #1 best-seller in the entire smartphone category, even beating out some brand-new phones. It’s no wonder as it offers top-of-the-line Apple quality at a fraction of the cost:Priced today at just $290, that is arecord lowfor the model and a stunning deal in comparison to the iPhone 16 which is running 3 or 4 times the cost. See at Amazon The iPhone 13 remains a very powerful phone even to this day in 2025: It features Apple’s A15 Bionic chip which still runs iOS 16 smoothly and loads all the newest apps and updates. Its 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display boasts great imagery with rich colors and it is perfect for anything from video streaming to photo editing. Its twin 12MP cameras deliver quality images and video like such features as Night Mode and 4K video capture. For most users, those specs are plenty enough for everyday usage and you don’t have to waste more money for a premium phone. What makes this Amazon deal even more interesting is the value that it represents compared to purchasing new. The iPhone 16 may boast upgrades like the A18 chip and a higher-resolution camera, but for many users, these improvements are incremental rather than truly essential. The core experience (performance, battery life and access to Appleâs ecosystem) remains largely unchanged between the iPhone 13 and its newer counterparts. Amazon’s renewed initiative ensures these phones meet high standards of quality.Each phone is thoroughly inspected, tested, and cleaned by quality suppliersto make it as good as new. While it will not arrive in Apple’s original packaging or include certified accessories, it will haveno apparent cosmetic defectswhen viewed at arm’s length. In addition,Amazon offers a 90-day replacement or refund policy for added peace of mind. The price is where this deal get very popular: At $290, this refurbished iPhone 13 is less expensive than most mid-range Android phones and yet offers the quality build and performance Apple fans expect. Compared to the iPhone 16’s premium price of $800 or higher, this deal is fantastic and allows you to enjoy flagship capabilities at a tiny fraction of the cost. This kind of bargain is difficult to find in the current market, especially given inflation and tariffs pushing prices in technology higher.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Customs fees are reclassifying the manner in which we purchase electronics. Over the last few days, even brand labels we trusted like Anker raised their prices by roughly 20%, and under current global tensions still running extremely high, there is every motive to believe such price increases might continue. If you’d like to gear up your equipment, the pursuit of genuine deals has never been more important. That’s what makes this offer now listed on the KYY 15.6-inch portable monitor on Amazon so attractive. Atjust $69 down from its regular $129 price (46% off), the KYY portable monitor is quite possibly one of the best tech bargains out there right now. See at Amazon Its15.6-inch IPS display delivers crisp Full HD 1080p resolutionand offers an immersive viewing experience whether youâre working, gaming or streaming your favorite shows. The panelâs178-degree wide viewing angleensures that colors remain accurate and vivid from almost any position, which makes it ideal for sharing content or collaborating on the go. HDR support also enhances contrast and color depth. What makes this monitor so unique is that it has been designed for life on the go. Itmeasures a thin 0.3 inches thick and weighs a mere 1.7 poundswhich makes it so simple to pack into a backpack or laptop bag to transform any location into a productive workspace (or entertainment center). There’s a smart cover which is included and doubles as both a case and a durable stand. Two standard USB-C connectors and a mini-HDMI connector are all this KYY monitor requires to cooperate with almost every deviceâlaptops, Macs, tablets, smartphones, game consoles like the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and yes, even tablets. And with devices that include support for Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C 3.1, you have a one-cable affair for power and video, simpler to manage and very easy to set up. For older devices, the mini-HDMI port ensures youâre never left without options. The monitor also features a 3.5mm audio jack and two built-in stereo speakers which is okay for casual gaming. What’s more, the screenâs blue light reduction and flicker-free technology help minimize eye strain during long workdays or late-night gaming marathons. The matte finish also cuts down on glare so you can work in comfort in any lighting condition. We also like the menu wheel’s ergonomic design which lets you switch settings like brightness, contrast and color temperature with ease. If you’rereally frustrated by the limited scope of one (small) laptop screen, the KYY portable monitor is a true lifesaver. It’s perfect for expanding your workspace, giving presentations, photo editing, gaming, or even simply enjoying an improved view of your favorite content. Also remember that with tariffs pending to push prices still higher, this is the best time to put your money in a great – and discounted – device that will boost your productivity.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. With the price of tech rising higher and higher with the news tariffs, it’s getting harder and harder to find a good deal on even the most basic gadgets. Accessories that were once within reach are now inching up in price, and there’s (sadly) no reason to believe this trend won’t keep going into the coming months. Which is also why it just feels like a stroke of good fortune to run into an actual bargain today…particularly on something as important as a portable charger. Right now, the INIU portable charger(which is a 10,000mAh power bank) is selling for $15 on Amazon which is a 36% discount from its initial $24 list price. This is a very limited quantity offer, and we really recommend you to get is while the supply lasts. It could run out of stock within a few minutes. See at Amazon The INIU power bank is a great compact and portable charger for people who wants portability and performance. Measuring only half an inch in thickness,it’s one of the thinnest 10,000mAh power banks available on the market, and it slips super easily into a pocket, or bag without bulk. It packs plenty of punch to fully chargemost smartphones two to three timesso you’ll be connected while traveling and commuting. Perhaps most impressive of all is that this INUI charger sold on Amazonsupports high-speed charging. The USB-C port is also supported, as is the USB-A port, and the power bank also boasts a 5V/3A output that makes it able to supply fast, efficient charging to a gigantic range of devices. No matter whether you havethe newest iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy, a Google Pixel, or even an iPad, you can rely on instant power delivery that keeps downtime to a minimum. The USB-C port is both input and output, meaning you can charge the power bank itself quickly and share the same cable with your devices. What you’ll also like is the scratch-resistance matte finish which resists fingerprint marks and scratches and keeps the portable charger clean and fresh-looking even after multiple months of heavy use. A built-in LED indicator enables you to see the amount of battery remaining so you’re never caught off guard with an empty power bank.

In a recent interview with theHollywood Reporter, showrunner Tony Gilroy discussed how the real world and some “budgetary issues” required some adjusting to the show’s season two plans. Some episodes “changed dramatically” because of this, he said, and in the case of at least one legacy character from the beginning ofRogue Oneâas well as “a couple people in we wanted to have in Yavin”âthat undisclosed role will be played by a different actor. Bringing back returning characters with their original actors can be a “really tricky” feat to pull off, he explained.

    "title": "Tesla Stock Price Reaches ‘Death Cross’ Status",
    "article_text": "If you haven’t been keeping tabs on Tesla’s stock price (understandable, it’s like the 1,025th most interesting thing that is happening in a world plagued by chaos), you’ve missed a whole lot of volatility. Crucially, you may have also missed its index displaying the dreaded “death cross,” a historical indicator of a likely downturn for the company. Business Insider called out the event, which has been hitting the stock indexes of some major players over the last couple of weeks as tariff trouble has hit just about everyone. Tesla is just the latest to see the symbol of bearishness, which occurs when a company’s 50-day moving average crosses and drops below the 200-day average. The “death cross” showing itself for Tesla shouldn’t come as a huge shock, just given how wild a ride the electric vehicle manufacturer’s value has undergone in the last few months, spurred in large part by the fact that its CEO seems to be more interested inplaying wrecking ball to the federal governmentthan actually running the company. Tesla has seen more than a third of its value wiped off the board since the start of the year, despite some spikes along the way when it seemed like Musk might be able to eke out some preferential treatment from the Trump administration. He did get afree advertisement for the company in front of the White House, but that only came afterwidespread protests against the companyput a dent in its reputation and future prospects. Tesla is far from alone in flashing the “death cross.” The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100both showed it as wellon Monday, as the indexes continue to fluctuate in wild and somewhat unpredictable ways thanks to the endless uncertainty that the Trump administration has introduced to the market through its blanket tariffs and “will they, won’t they” exceptions that keepgetting tacked onandtaken off. Seeing that Tesla got hit with the death cross might provide a little thrill in aTim Walz laughing at Tesla’s declining stock pricekinda way. But I have to be honest, as someone who is not fully immersed in the financial markets, the chart pattern reading kinda strikes me as astrology for guys in suits. Like, because theline displays a pendant shape, that means it’s primed to break out? What does that even mean? You might as well say it’s a good time to buy because Mercury is in retrograde. Anyway, analysts apparently don’t think death crosses are as reliable of an indicator as they are sometimes described by chart readers.According to Reuters, about half the time that a death cross appears, it marks the worst point for the index rather than a harbinger of a steeper decline.

    "title": "Sixth Nurse Diagnosed With Brain Tumor in Possible Cluster at Massachusetts Hospital",
    "article_text": "Something strange could be happening at a Massachusetts hospital. At least six employees working on the same floor of the Newton-Wellesley Hospital have recently developed benign brain tumors. The latest brain tumor case was disclosed this week by the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) at Mass General Brigham, the parent system of Newton-Wellesley. The affected employees are nurses who have worked on the fifth floor maternity unit. The hospital says its investigation has not yet identified any “environmental risk” linking the cases, though the Massachusetts Nurses Association is still looking into the matter. The potential tumor cluster wasfirst reportedby local media outlet WBZ in early April, while the hospital’s investigation had begun in December. Prior to this week, five employees at Newton-Wellesley were known to have developed brain tumors. On Monday, the Boston Heraldreportedthat the OHS sent a letter to patients and families revealing a sixth case. âTo date, through their employee interview process, OHS has identified six staff members who have worked for varying durations on the fifth floor and report developing benign (non-cancerous) brain tumors,â Ellen Moloney, president and COO of Mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital, wrote in the letter, according to the Herald. Cancer or tumor clusters are sometimes caused byenvironmental contaminants, such as carcinogenic toxins that end up in the same drinking water. But the OHS says it has yet to find any potential shared cause at the hospital for these cases. âWhile the OHS investigation is ongoing, we have found no evidence that these medical conditions were caused by the work environment,” Moloney said in the letter. The employees themselves aren’t convinced, however. And at least some believe that other recent illnesses among their staff could be connected to the workplace. “We want reassurance, because this has not been a reassuring past few months for a lot of the staff members,” one nurse diagnosed with a tumor, who was granted anonymity,toldWBZ. “We want to feel safe, the same way we want to make our patients feel safe.” The Massachusetts Nurse Association, a union representing nurses at MGH, is also conducting its own investigation. The Associationpreviously toldthe Herald in early April that the hospital’s investigation was “not comprehensive.” And for now, it’s still not closing the book on something being wrong at Newton-Wellesley Hospital. âWe are glad to see the hospital is continuing to look into this situation,â a Massachusetts Nurses Association spokesperson said in a statement to the Herald. âOur investigation is ongoing, and we will share the results when our health and safety division completes its review of the diagnoses reported to the MNA.â The union’s findings are expected to be released to the public by the end of the month.

Twins who got tattoos had a higher risk of being diagnosed with skin cancer and lymphoma. New research suggests that frequent blood donation can trigger genetic changes that might protect certain stem cells from becoming cancerous. Recent research throws into question whether GLP-1 drugs increase the risk of certain types of thyroid cancer.

Notion Mail was announcedlast fallwith the beta. We had an inkling it was coming after Notion acquired another email app called Skiff inFebruary 2024, which had privacy and security at the forefront. (Notion Mail says it’s SOC2 certified and HIPAA compliant.) This is also how Notion’s second app,Notion Calendar, came to be, (after the acquisition of the calendar appCronin early 2024). Notion Mail seems more focused on touting its ability to untangle the mess that is email. From the get-go, the app bills itself as “the inbox that organizes itself,” which sounds promising to someone like me who desperately seeks help via a third-party entity. Notion Mail uses AI tricks to help you get started toward the path of inbox liberation. Its marquee feature lets you describe what you’re attempting to organize rather than asking you to set up a formulaic rule. My inbox is still a damn mess, but I’ve already been able to organize like Substack newsletters and updates from my kid’s school district into individual bookmarks using Notion Mail’s AI-based auto labeler. All I had to do was describe the content I was looking to have grouped, though I had to be specific if I wanted more than one email address or source to be included in the label. For instance, when I set out to make the label for my child’s school, I used “school notifications and emails from Class Dojo and my child’s teacher, [teacher’s name]”. When I just used “school notifications,” it fetched me only the emails that specifically mentioned the elementary school. Notion Mail is free to use, but it’s limited to Gmail right now. There’s also only an app for the Mac, with the company promising Notion Mail will have an iOS app coming soon and an Android one later this year. You can use the app to manage multiple emails, but only if they’re Google accounts. Andrew Milich, one of the founders of Skiff and now at Notion Mail, couldn’t offer a date toThe Vergefor Outlook and other account support. Other special features of Notion Mail include custom views, a built-in meeting scheduler, and the tried-and-true Notion writing environment. I’m barely two hours into using this email suite and still figuring out how to add sources after making labels. But if I can get a clearer view of what’s happening in my Gmail, it may make Notion Mail another app I integrate into my workflow. emailGmailNotion Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Nanoleaf’s Combo Pegboard and Lamp Is Only Attractive to Moths and Gamers",
    "article_text": "If I wereany more of a moth than I am, I would be butting my head relentlessly against Nanoleafâs latest gamer smart light that brings a bare ounce of practicality to the normally goofy gamer ambiance. The companyâs new$60 Pegboard Desk Dockis a combination RGB gamer lamp, charging dock, and pegboard with hooks to hang up your controllers, headsets, handhelds, or other accessories. It could help me and other RGB-obsessed insects declutter our desks. Nanoleafâs latest device is your typical RGB color-changing light fixture with 32 LEDs per side and a total of 64 color zones offering a glow both toward the user and against the wall. One side features the light without a cover, while the other is concealed with the cheese grater-like pegboard. The neat thing about this device is you can take it off and flip the light around if all you want for the moment is to bathe in lava lamp light. You can control lighting settings through the Nanoleaf app, where you can also set it to different color effects like âcandlelightâ or âfireplace.â If you connect it through the desktop app and enable Music Sync, it will adjust colors depending on what youâre listening to. While you need to plug the dock base into its own power source, the device includes two USB-C and a single USB-A port for power passthrough for charging a wireless mouse or controller at a respectable 15W. The Pegboard Desk Dock comes with two sets of arms and given there are only 10 inches of pegboard space you’ll likely only be able to fit two items at a time on it. That might not seem like a lot, but it should allow you to stick your Steam Deck or other handheld PC on it and finally free up some space on your workstation. For handheld gaming, youâd still want HDMI passthrough as well for the sake of treating your desktop monitor as a second screen. In that case, you may still be better off getting a dedicated handheld dock. If you want one with RGB lights, you could check out theRazer Handheld Dock Chroma. The Pegboard Desk Dock is better for when you need to grab your headset and controller without needing to stretch out an arm or leave your desk. Plus, it’s more gamer chic than anyindustrial-sized desk peripheralor Ikea product. Because of my job, Iâm constantly surrounded by at least two pairs of headphones, not to mention controllers. I can imagine the device would only save me a few inches of space that I would immediately fill with a mess of papers and peripherals. The company does sell a 2-pack for $100 instead of $120, so maybe all I need to do is buy multiples, then surround myself with Pegboard Desk Docks like Iâm conducting an arcane ritual to summon tech Cthulhu. Or else, Iâll just bathe in the sauna of my ever-glowing RGB-filled desk space. NanoleafRazer Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "One of the most exciting things about the X-Men’s Krakoa era was theannual Hellfire Gala. Thelooks, thevotingfor new team members, the big events! Sure, the last one ended with a lot ofdead Krakoansand the island under attack, but before that, the Gala was pretty rad. Now that the mutants are in their From the Ashes period, Marvel’s giving the event the send-off it never got to have. Come July, the X-Men are reuniting for theHellfire VigilÂspecialfrom nearly all the creative teams handling the current X-books. (So writers Gail Simone, Jed Mackay, Murewa Ayodele, and artists Javier GarrÃ³n, Sara Pichelli, Netho Diaz, and plenty more.) To commemorate the one-year, in-universe anniversary of Krakoa’s fall, the mutants will reflect on their mutant nation and look forward amid a night of “joyous celebration, delicious drama, and, of course, super hero high fashion!” And of course, it’ll help set the stage for the next phase of the “Ashes” era that’ll continue into 2026. According to executive editor Tom Breevort, this has been in the works for a year, and will hopefully give fans interactions they’d wanted since the characters went their various separate ways. “If youâve been wondering when somebody was going to encounter somebody else, the answer is right here in this book,” he said. It’s an interesting time for the Hellfire Gala, which recently became a map forMarvel RivalsÂand is now considered part of X-Men lore. TheÂHellfire VigilÂspecial releases on July 2.

    "title": "Beijing Responds to Tariffs by Outing Alleged NSA Hackers by Name",
    "article_text": "China has named three individuals working at the National Security Agency it claims hacked computer systems for the Asian Winter Games earlier this year. The country rarely publishes the names of alleged nation-backed hackers, even though the United States routinely outs actors linked to China. On Tuesday, police in Harbin, where the games took place, named three alleged NSA agents as culprits in the hackâKatheryn A. Wilson, Robert J. Snelling, and Stephen W. Johnson. It claims the group also targeted Huawei, one of China’s leading telecommunications companies that was the target of trade restrictions imposed by the United States. It is well known that the United States, like most major powers, participates in global espionage and hacking operations. The NSA famously hoovers up and analyzes information from telecommunications and internet systems around the globe, a practice made famous by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Countries conduct surveillance for many reasons including combating terrorism and gaining an advantage over foreign military activities. But China does not typically name suspected foreign hackers targeting its domestic infrastructure, perhaps because the country tries to clamp down on any signals of weakness. Experts toldBloombergthat the change in strategy is likely in retaliation to ongoing tariffs. By signaling that it can identify the perpetrators of intrusions, China is telegraphing that the United States is not as covert in its operations as it might think, and will need to change strategy to continue effective intelligence-gathering operations. This might be referred to as “simple sabotage,” a concept coined by the CIA that in any war with a foreign adversary, small interference can disrupt enemy efforts and create inefficiencies. Attacks onundersea cables and other infrastructureâlike train linesâare another form of simple sabotage. It is less about significant physical attack and more so displaying minor aggression, and is just one pillar in broader geopolitical maneuvering. Hacking operations can also be used as a stick in negotiations, telling countries like the United States that they should be careful not to stoke the bear, as an adversary could respond through means like knocking out infrastructure. Bloombergreports that China has been ramping up its efforts to call out hacking efforts: The identification of the alleged NSA operatives followeda reportreleased on April 3 by Chinaâs CVERC, which said that the country had faced more than 270,000 cyberattacks during the winter games, the majority coming from computers located in the US. The report was illustrated by an image of a man typing on a keyboard dressed in an Uncle Sam outfit, with crosshairs fixed on his head. âMost of Beijingâs reprisal for the trade war wonât come with tariffs,” said Isaac Stone Fish, chief executive officer of Strategy Risk, in an interview with the outlet. “It will come with actions that seemingly have very little to do with trade tensions,â he added. âThe outing of alleged NSA hackers fits very neatly into the pattern of how Beijing likes to operate on these issues.â China has taken other steps to retaliate against tariffs, including pausing orders on Boeing aircraft andwalking back distribution of Hollywood movies. President Trump, for his part, has flip-flopped on tariffs in response to market moves. Electronics including semiconductors and iPhones are temporarily exempted from the highest tariffs, but President Trump has suggested they will come back soon. While many Americansthink manufacturing should returnto the United States, and China is a bad actor in many ways, few Americans want to work in factories. And global trade has been a boon for the economy as U.S. businesses export many services abroad. President Trump, however, is operating under a false belief that any imbalance in tradeâwith the U.S. buying from some countries more than they send the other wayâmeans that Americans are losers. Some companies like Apple are focused on moving their manufacturing to other Asian countries, like Vietnam and India, rather than building factories in the United States.

    "title": "Disturbing Cryotherapy Incident Leaves Woman Dead and Another Injured",
    "article_text": "A malfunctioning cryotherapy machine seems to have led to the tragic death of a 29-year-old woman in Paris, France, this week. The unusual deathoccurredMonday evening at the On Air gym in east-central Paris, according to local law enforcement. The woman, a gym employee, appears to have died due to a nitrogen leak from the cryotherapy machine. A second woman, age 34, was critically injured and is currently in intensive care. Cryotherapy, or cryostimulation, is an emerging practice. One trendy form of it, whole-body cryotherapy, requires people to be completely exposed to extremely cold temperatures for several minutes at a time. Some researchhas suggestedcryotherapy can possibly relieve certain kinds of pain and inflammation, and it might have other health benefits, such asimproving sleep. Cryotherapy machines often use chilled liquid nitrogen to produce these temperatures. In this case, temperatures may have reached as low as -148 degrees Fahrenheit (-100 degrees Celsius), according to theAFP. But when it’s a gas, nitrogen is both odorless and colorless. As a result, the European Industrial Gases Association (EIGA) haswarnedthat improperly designed or maintained machines can be a safety hazard. If too much nitrogen gas seeps out into the cryo-cabin or surrounding space, it can quickly displace oxygen without notice, which can then asphyxiate people. That seems to be the case here. Both women were in cardiac arrest by the time emergency services arrived. Three other people who attempted to revive the women were also taken to the hospital, while around 150 people were evacuated from the building. According to police, the machine was supposedly repaired earlier in the dayâa repair that might have gone tragically wrong. But authorities say that they are still conducting an investigation into the matter. âAn autopsy and toxicology analysis will be carried out to determine the precise cause of death,â a spokesperson for the Paris prosecutorâs officetoldThe Guardian. Cryotherapy-related deaths are rare, but not unheard of. In 2015, for instance, a spa employee in Las Vegasdied accidentally of suffocationfrom using a cryotherapy machine. cryostimulationcryotherapyWeird medicine Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "OpenAI Is Reportedly Building Its Own Social Media Platform",
    "article_text": "OpenAI is reportedly developing its own social media platform. The Verge, which hasbroken the news, describes the project as “X-like” in nature. Little is known about the new site beyond the fact that it exists. The Verge writes that the company is working on an “internal prototype” that involves a “feed” feature and may be built around the company’s image-generation capabilities. There doesn’t appear to be a name for the platform, and it’s also unclear whether it would be separate from ChatGPT or would be integrated into the company’s existing automation service. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has been quietly inviting feedback on the project, sources who spoke with the outlet communicated. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for more information. The move has largely been interpreted as a way to stay competitive with Meta and xAI, Elon Musk’s AI business (which is integrated with Musk’s social media platform, X). Given the description of the new platform prototype as being “X-like,” it stands to reason that this news was designed to ruin Musk’s day. Musk and Altman were previously business partners at OpenAI butMusk left the organizationand the two have been bitter rivals ever since. Musk previously attempted to buy OpenAI, though Altman turned him down flat. Why would we need another social media platform? And what are the potential benefits of a social media platform operated by the world’s most valuable artificial intelligence business? The Verge writes: One idea behind the OpenAI social prototype…is to have AI help people share better content. âThe Grok integration with X has made everyone jealous,â says someone working at another big AI lab. âEspecially how people create viral tweets by getting it to say something stupid.â Critics and social scientists alike have noted that AI is destined tomake humans exponentially stupider. The problem is “cognitive offloading,” which describes the process whereby a person may rely on AI to conduct critical thinking tasks for which they were previously responsible. There’s no telling what OpenAI’s new project might look like (if it even comes to fruition), but it’s safe to say that if it is designed to help users post “better content,” I think we may have already reached the bottom of the “cognitive offloading” barrel.

    "title": "Tony Gilroy and Diego Luna on the Joy of Knowing Andor‘s Inevitable End",
    "article_text": "Last nightAndorseason two had its Hollywood premiere with a house full of fans and the creative teams behind the hitDisney+Star Warsseries. io9 was in attendance (withmy dad, who introduced me toStar Wars,in tow) for the momentous occasion. After a screening of a season one sizzle reel and the first act ofAndorseason two, creator Tony Gilroy and star Diego Luna led a conversation with the cast about the making of the series and their reaction to the success of its first season. Gilroy admitted they weren’t ready for the near-instant outpouring of support. “We had no idea. We made the whole [first] season under a blanket … there’s no test screenings or focus groups because it’sStar Wars. Everything’s secret. We finished and were like, ‘Wow, I think it might be okay.’ We started dribbling it out and by week three it was Christmas every week for us. It was very affirming.” Luna jumped in. “When we premieredRogue Onein Mexico, I was there with my two kids. It [was] fantastic, it was beautiful, but after 20 minutes my daughter was asleep,” he said. But things changed when it came toAndor.“The first season she watched it all and said, ‘Oh, I love it, dad.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, that’s it.’ I did it for them and to connect withStar Warsthe way I connected when I was their age.” Sitting there with my own dad while hearing that really hit home. I wouldn’t be working this job if not for his love ofStar Wars,Âwhich he watched at cinemas during his youth in Mexico City, where he and Luna are both from. AsAndordraws to a close catching up to the events ofRogue One, Luna also shared how performing as Cassian Andor one last time was so emotionally charged. “Every promise he makes, it means one thing for him, and for me as an actor it means another. It’s fully charged on the emotion, but I needed to give Cassian this feeling of awakening… life is starting for him,” he said. It was a particularly intriguing task, diving into a character who doesn’t know what’s to comeâwhile Luna has already played the final act of Andor’s life inRogue One. InAndor, he has “something to fight for, that there’s family, there’s belonging, that he can build something. He has to have those dreams in order for this second season to exist. But there I am as an actor knowing, ‘Oh, shit.’ And that’s what makes this second season, I think, so exciting because we know the ending, you know, which makes this whole project very special becausewe know the ending.Therefore, there’s complete freedom to go backwards.” For Gilroy, the final season ofAndorpresented a unique opportunity. “We have four blocks of three episodes, and we need four years to cover. How about if we did one year every block and jumped a year?” he said, referring to changing the show’s original plans for a five-season run. “It sort of was just sitting there. It really was like: it was a problem and there was the answer. And then when we started to sketch on it and figure it out, it was like, ‘Oh my God, what if we come back for three days each time? Could you do that? Could you have all this negative space?’ And it turns out that it’s a really exciting thing to work on. And then it’s not just exciting to work on, but it propels the story. And it lets the actors do all kinds of interesting things to fill in the negative space.” “It was really energizing,” Gilroy said. “It went from being a desperate fear to being something we were really excited about. And I don’t know how many writers have had a chance to work in a format like that. We couldn’t find a comp for it. I don’t know if anybody’s done it before, but it was really providential for us. It was a really big gift of the gods for that, for that answer to come up for us.” The change was a welcome one for Luna. “It was gonna be two years and a half to do one seasonâit would have been more than a decade of you know, firing blasters. Like, no one will buy it, a 55-year-old guy going like, ‘Oh, no!’ And [be] the guy [he] was 20 years ago. It’s also a prequel of a prequel. It’s just like, you know, it’s simply impossible. And we had an amazing idea because at the end of it, this is a homage to cinema, to the genesis ofStar Wars, because it’s four blocks [of television] that last the time of a film. Gilroy added, “We think we made eight movies in five years.” The end result has been a meaningful experience for Luna, who thanked the fans in attendance and then turned to his leader and co-stars. “Tony said to me, let’s do a story where we can see how revolutions erupt, how revolutions happen, how this rebellion is possible, what needs to happen, what is the social climate, the political climate,” he said. “And I have to say that this was a revolution for me in every possible way. And revolutions are about community. And this community we created, I’m going to keep forever. It’s been six years of being exactly where I want to be. And I want to thank you all for that.” Andorseason two premieres April 22 on Disney+. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Internet Cesspool 4chan Is Down After Alleged Hack, Rival Forum Users Claim Credit",
    "article_text": "4chan has apparently fallen. The notorious image board that has been the origin of some of the best and absolute worst things that the internet has to offer allegedly fell victim to a hack that has left the site inaccessible since late Monday night through Tuesday morning,according to data from DownDetector. Shortly after reports of the site being down started circulating, a user on a rival image board, soyjack.party, claimed credit for the hack. According to the Soyjack user, who is trying very hard to have a Machiavelli-meets-shitposter thing going, a hacker managed to get into 4chan’s system over a year ago and laid low to carry out the attack. Through their alleged access, the hacker apparently reopened /qa/, a board that had been shut down for being a unique brand of awful, as well as exposed personal information of 4chan staff and leaked code from the image board. “Tonight has been a very special night for many of us at the soyjak party. Today, April 14, 2025, a hacker, who has been in 4cuck’s system for over a year, executed the true operation soyclipse,” the soyjack.party user who was allegedly aware of the hacksaidover on the competing imageboard. Through the thread about the hack on Soyjack Party, users shared screenshots that purport to show admin access on 4chan, conversations that took place on private message boards that were only available to moderators, and internal tools that moderators had access to that show the location, host, and IP address of 4chan users. Allegedly, 4chan moderators took the site’s servers offline to try to regain control.The Daily Dot reportedthat it was able to access a list of supposed contact information of 218 4chan moderators, managers, and janitors. Though Gizmodo has seen the list that’s circulating online, there’s no way to verify its authenticity. Soyjack posters also claimed that there was a “flood of refugees” from 4chan joining Soyjack Party after the hack, but they are “not adjusting well to the culture.” That last bit might be the key to the “why” of the hack. Soyjack Party is a 4chan spinoff that is built in large part around thewojack meme, which is frankly a bit old hat at this point. The site was launched in 2020, announced in the 4chan /qa/ board that was ostensibly a “Questions and Answers” forum but was hijacked by users posting wojack and soyjack memes. The /qa/ board was banned by 4chan, in part because it was a board that became a battleground for different factions that used the site. Soyjack Party users seemed to find 4chan’s moderation tactics to be too oppressive and the site to have gone soft, just to give you a sense of what kind of content you might come across on the splinter site. Soyjack Party users seem to have a history of raiding 4chan-related forums, as Reddit users in the 4chan ecosystem have noted Soyjack Party usersflooding different subreddits and forcing them to go private. But the alleged hack seems to be the coup de grÃ¢ce for the group. 4chan mods, understandably, seem a bit worried about their information getting leaked. Over on a Discord server where parts of the4chan staff allegedly chat, there are a lot of concerns about the alleged hack and users encouraging each other to take precautions to secure their accounts. Hyperfixed host and longtime tech journalistAlex Goldman pointed outthat there is seemingly unconfirmed buzz that some mod emails had .gov domains, which fits into the narrative that 4chan is a honeypot for federal law enforcementâa meme that ispopular among Soyjack users. For what it’s worth, there are lots of people claiming that moderators and janitors have .gov emails, or claiming that most of their IP addresses are in the Washington, D.C. area, but very little that would amount to proof of that. People are happily posting screenshots of the hack, but when it comes to the claims that there are government agents on the site, for whatever reason, no one seems interested in posting evidence.

    "title": "Prehistoric Hearths Reveal Ice Age Hunter-Gatherers Were Masters of the Flame",
    "article_text": "Scholars generally agree that fire was crucial to human survival during the most recent Ice Ageâyet in Europe, there is surprisingly little evidence of hearths from its coldest years, between 26,500 and 19,000 years ago. By studying three prehistoric hearths in Ukraine, a team of researchers has gained new insight into how fire was used during the Ice Age’s harshest period. As detailed in astudypublished earlier this month in the journal Geoarchaeology, the bygone fires reveal hints of sophisticated pyrotechnology, including the potential use of bones and fat for fuel. “Fire was not just about keeping warm; it was also essential for cooking, making tools and for social gatherings,” Philip R. Nigst, one of the lead authors of the study and an archaeologist at the University of Vienna, said in a universitystatement. Although the archaeological record confirms that hunter-gatherers in Europe built fires throughout the Upper Paleolithic period (45,000 to 10,000 years ago), there is a roughly 7,500-year gap that coincides with the Ice Age’s coldest years. “We know that fire was widespread before and after this period, but there is little evidence from the height of the Ice Age,” said William Murphree, another lead author and a geoarchaeologist at the University of Algarve. Now, new evidence from Ukraine is helping to fill that gap. Researchers have investigated three ancient hearths dating back to the heart of the Last Glacial Maximum. The ancient hearths, excavated in 2013 at the Korman’ 9 archaeological site, date to between 23,000 and 21,000 years ago, and offer a rare glimpse into how Ice Age peoples used fire when it was needed most. The scientists used geoarchaeological methods such asmicrostratigraphic analysis(a technique to study geographical layers in high resolution),micromorphology(the study of soil and sediment at the microscopic level) andcolorimetric analysis(a technique to detect chemical compounds). The analyses revealed that the fires reached over 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius), suggesting that European hunter-gatherers had a deep knowledge of fire building (hotter flames indicatemore efficient combustion). While all three fires were open and flat, the researchers suggest they were intentionally built and used differently depending on the season. For example, one hearth was larger and thickerâlikely the one that reached the highest temperatures. “People perfectly controlled the fire and knew how to use it in different ways, depending on the purpose of the fire. But our results also show that these hunter-gatherers used the same place at different times of the year during their annual migrations,” Nigst explained. While the researchers’ work indicates that the fires were mostly fueled by spruce wood, “some of the animal bones found at the site were burnt in a fire with a temperature of over 650 degrees Celsius,” explained Marjolein D. Bosch, a study co-author and zooarchaeologist at the University of Vienna. If confirmed, the use of animal bones and fats as fuel would suggest an even higher level of pyrotechnic expertise than previously assumed. “We are currently investigating whether they were used as fuel or just accidentally burned,” Bosch added. The research sheds light on one of the first and most important technologies humans ever developed. Three prehistoric hearths, however, are not enough to close the vexing gap in the archaeological record, and so the mystery of pyrotechnology during the Ice Age’s peak remains unsolved.

    "title": "J&J Plans $400 Million in Extra Tariff Costs Even Before Trump’s Drug Tariffs Begin",
    "article_text": "Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest pharmaceutical and medical device companies in the world, says it’s planning for about $400 million in additional costs related to President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which seem to change by the hour. Incredibly, those additional costs don’t even include plans yet for Trump’s tariffs on pharmaceutical products, which the president has repeatedly said he’s going to impose soon. Johnson & Johnson beat revenue expectations, up 2.4% to $21.89 billion according to earnings reportedTuesday, with profit of $11 billion in the first quarter, up from $3.26 billion a year earlier. But the company told analysts on a conference call Tuesday that tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with tariffs on steel and aluminum, must be planned for. The tariffs will be felt “broadly,” rather than in just one area of the company’s portfolio, according toCNBC, with some of the biggest impacts felt on products actually getting shipped from the U.S. to China, which has imposed reciprocal tariffs. Executives at Johnson & Johnson are very publicly signaling to Trump that they want lower taxes to help offset the costs of the tariffs, with CFO Joseph Wolk appearing onCNBCTuesday to argue that tax cuts are great for business. Asked by CNBC host Joe Kernen, a supporter of Donald Trump, whether the president’s policies had inspired Wolk to invest more in the U.S., the CFO credited Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. CEO Joaquin Duato said something similar during his call with analysts Tuesday, according to theWall Street Journal. âIf what you want is to build manufacturing capacity in the U.S., both in medtech and in pharmaceuticals, the most effective answer is not tariffs, but tax policy,” Duato said. Trump is trying to usher in an extension of the 2017 tax cuts and the Republican budget blueprint passed the Houselast week. But there are still some conservative Republicans who don’t think the budget cuts enough in vital services. Even if the U.S. goes into recession thanks to Trump’s policies, Johnson & Johnson says it’s well positioned to weather rough times since the healthcare industry is more “recession-proof,” according to the Journal. After all, nobody really wants to get sick. And given the fundamentally broken nature of the U.S. healthcare system, there’s not much in the way of consumer choice. Pay up or die. And just to add more chaos to the mix, Trump has said he wants tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S., something that he believes will bring more manufacturing jobs to American shores. There’s also the national security argument that being too reliant on foreign supply chains makes the U.S. vulnerable, something that’s not altogether wrong since Trump is turning all of America’s traditional geopolitical friends into enemies. The Secretary of Commercefiled a noticeon Monday saying that a Section 232 investigation was underway to examine whether drug imports posed any risk to national security. Trump has previously used Section 232, a provision of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to slap tariffs on lumber and cars under the guise of national security. The “national security” threat, as it were, is supposedly the U.S. trade deficit with other countries. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Trump’s FDA commissioner during his first term, explained onCNBCthat generic drugs will actually be the hardest hit by tariffs, and given the slimmer margins on such drugs, many companies will likely pull out of manufacturing for those medications, leading to potential shortages. “When it comes to the generic medicines, they don’t have a lot of cushion. And I think a lot of these generic manufacturers are going to get out of these markets if tariffs are imposed on them. And then we’re going to have drug shortages here,” Gottlieb said. “So the very problem they’re trying to solve, which is the national security issue related to this 232 provision that they’re trying to use, is the one that’s going to be the least amenable to using this tool.” Many of the drugs the U.S. imports are actually coming from Ireland, where large manufacturers have set up thanks to tax incentives. But Gottlieb, who also sits on the board of Pfizer, said that there are substantial benefits to moving out of Europe which has better protections for workers and higher energy costs. Especially when it’s production of higher margin “branded” drugs as opposed to generics. “When you look at the branded companies that are manufacturing these high-margin products over in Ireland, they would be willing to bring a lot of that manufacturing back to the U.S.” Gottlieb said. “And in fact, you’ve seen Lilly and Novartis make announcements in recent weeks that they’re bringing a substantial portion of that manufacturing back because quite frankly the tax advantage of manufacturing in Ireland isn’t that substantial relative to bringing your manufacturing back to the U.S. and having more control over it.” Gottlieb noted that it’s much easier to hire labor in the U.S., without explaining that one of those reasons is that workers in other wealthy countries like Ireland aren’t working “at will” meaning they can be fired at any time for any reason. “It’s easier to hire labor here,” Gottlieb continued. “The two biggest inputs in manufacturing are the labor costs and the energy costs. Energy is cheaper here. So the increased benefit they get from moving it to Ireland because of the tax treatment, it isn’t fully offset by those other advantages, but it’s offset enough that they’d be willing to do it.” For its part, Big Pharma is lobbying the Trump regime to either phase in any pharmaceutical tariffs slowly or create exemptions for certain types of products, according to theNew York Times. And while it’s possible that some drug companies will just temporarily eat some of the costs of tariffs given the existing contracts that have already been signed, there are signals that those same companies would just pull back on medical research budgets in the U.S. to make up for it, as David Ricks, the CEO of Eli Lily, told theBBCearlier this month. “We can’t breach those agreements so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,” Ricks said. “Typically that will be in reduction of staff or research and development (R&D)and I predict R&D will come first. That’s a disappointing outcome.” big pharmaDonald TrumpJohnson & JohnsonpharmaceuticalsTariffs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Throughout the first season ofÂAndor,ÂCassian (Diego Luna) was unknowingly pursued by ISB supervisorDedra Meero(Denise Gough) and deputy inspector Syril Karn (Kyle Soller). The two were on his trail for separate (and in Karn’s case, personal) reasons, but when they met in the Narkina 5 arc, things gotinteresting. What was a simple debrief and a warning for Karn to quit using ISB assets to find Cassian escalated into Karn finding where Meero worked, grabbing her arm, andtelling her they’re not so different, he and her. That led to people shipping them, a fire that only grew when he saved her life during thechaotic finale. Since then, folks have been wondering just what the hell is about to happen with this duo in season two. A clip recently provided to KTLA offers some interesting crumbs for what might be in store for them. In it, we see the two enter a nondescript building by themselves. Meero had him followed on the way here, and it’s somewhere out of the prying eyes of the Empire, who are watching Karn’s childhood apartment. “How long can I stay?” Karn asks, to which Meero says, “an hour.” Music stirs as she tells him to turn the lights off, the second time being more forceful: “Turn out the lights.” A first clip from#Andorseason 2!

    "title": "Google’s Powerful AI Video Generator Veo 2 Just Got a Lot More Accessible",
    "article_text": "If you’ve watched a lot of those horrible AI movie trailers and other weird and disturbing but occasionally cool AI videos than you might already befamiliar with Veo 2. The video model from Google is shockingly capable of creating realistic video clips from practically nothing. It’s been available to use for months via Google Cloud’s enterprise-focused (and priced) Vertex AI platform.Now its coming to Gemini Advanced subscribers. Gemini Advanced is Google’s answer to ChatGPT Plus and Claude Pro. It’s a $20 a month subscription that gives you access to most of Google’s AI models. Adding Veo 2 immediately gives Gemini Advanced near parity with ChatGPT Plus, which added access to OpenAI’s Sora video model back in December. Now two AI companies give you easy access to make creepy video content for $20 a month! What a deal! There are some limitations though. Videos are only available at 720p resolution and they can only be 8 seconds long (Sora can do 10 seconds). They’ll arrive in 16:9 landscape format in an MP4 file. So they should be relatively easy to upload to make your friends cringe at the dreamlike horrors your mind can conjure. And given Veo 2 is trained on Google’s enormous library of video content (that’s the beauty of owning YouTube too) it’s one of the better models for creating dreamlike horrors. But it still has its limitations. The clips Google provided to showcase Veo 2’s power are all visually impressive with few of the creepy hallmarks of AI video, but they also look a lot like3D animation. Crochet wildlife and cartoon cats aren’t anywhere close to the uncanny valley-like videos featuring realistic-looking humans. Google’s PR strategy here reminds me of the early days of CGI animationâwhen companies would avoid the uncanny valley at all costs to keep from terrifying moviegoers. In addition to that news, Google is also launching Whisk Animate for Google One AI Premium subscribers. Whisk Animate is meant to make using prompt windows to create eldritch AI horrors easier. You should be able to get it to create new images and then animate those images using the Veo 2 model. Google One AI Premium includes a Gemini Advanced subscription plus Google One goodies like more cloud storage for the exact same $20 as Gemini Advanced. So it might be the better option for most people. Now the standard generative AI disclaimer. As useful and fun as these tools will be for subscribers they will also make creating misinformation easierâprovided you can get around Google’s guardrails. All videos generated by Veo 2 will be marked withGoogle’s SynthID, a digital watermark intended to mark videos as AI (and thus “fake”.) Google also says it’s done extensive red teaming to try and get ahead of the horrors our minds will attempt to conjure with Veo 2 too. But if there’s one thing that separates humans from AI, it’s our ability to really fuck with AI and make it do super weird stuff. Veo 2 rolls out to Gemini Advanced subscribers starting today, so you can expect to see more visual horrors on your social media feeds by this evening.

    "article_text": "\"The videogame business is successful by itself. It doesn’t need this outlet,\" says the CEO of Microsoft Gaming. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every year more and more games are adapted into TV shows, and hardly a day goes by without a new adaptation deal being announced, froma second Resident Evil movie rebootto a film based onSplit Fictionto the Just Cause movie—announced way back in 2011—once again gettinga new writer and director. It's easy to see why. All those previous Resident Evil movies grossed over a billion dollars combined, The Super Mario Bros. Movie took in over $1.3 billion in 2023, and each of the three Sonic movies did in the neighborhood of half a billion each. No wonder Hollywood loves games these days. But according to Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, games don't need Hollywood. \"The videogame business is successful by itself. It doesn’t need this outlet,\" Spencer toldVariety, adding \"let’s never turn this into something where it has to get done, every franchise has to have a game or a movie or a TV show, and it becomes more like licensing.\" Of course, that's easy for him to say as A Minecraft Movie cruises past $500 million at the box office, asequel has already been greenlit, and Minecraft TV show is in the works at Netflix. Not to mention, the Fallout TV series (Microsoft owns Bethesda now, remember) was a critical hit and a second season is currently in production. Even Halo, despite not being very good, was still given two seasons on Paramount Plus. Microsoft even took it in the other direction last year, with its videogame adaptation of a movie series: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. And despite suggesting that games really don't need to be turned into movies and TV shows, Spencer teased that there are more adaptations of Microsoft properties in the works—though he wouldn't spill any details. \"We learned from doing Halo, we learn from doing Fallout. All of these build on themselves and we’ll have, obviously, a couple that miss, it’s just kind of part of it,\" he said. \"But I think what I’d say to the community that likes this work is, you’re going to see more [adaptations], because we’re gaining confidence, and we’re learning through this. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"That’s why it’s hard for me to tease any specific thing, because while I know all of these things that are in the creative process, I want to give them time, and I don’t want to put any undue pressure on them,\" Spencer said. \"There’s just a lot of interest from traditional media and we’re happy about that.\" Chris started playing PC games in the 1980s, started writing about them in the early 2000s, and (finally) started getting paid to write about them in the late 2000s.

    "title": "I can't believe I'm saying this but Skull and Bones Year 2 is real, and it's live now",
    "article_text": "What an unexpected turn of events. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I had a lot of fun over the years withSkull and Bones—all before it came out, that is. It grew from a simple idea—Assassin's Creed: Black Flag's naval battles made multiplayer—into a bona fide white whale forUbisoft, which struggled so mightily to get it released. And when it finally showed up, seven years after it was first announced, it wasfine, and quickly forgotten by most of us. But Skull and Bones is still floating, people are still playing it, and yes, the rumored second year of content is nowofficially underway. New features in Skull and Bones year 2 season 1 include Item Ascension, which enables players to upgrade their gear with base damage boosts and unique modifiers, as well as the addition of a new world tier, with greater challenges and better reward drops. Endgame content is being expanded with a new Helm Upgrade Tree featuring new perks and upgrades, and players will be able to produce their own crafting materials in \"manufactories.\" There's also a new team-based PvP mode called Death Tides on the way, with rewards and XP that will carry over to the main game, although it's not slated to go live until later in the season. Ubisoft also shared a look at its plans for subsequent seasons in year 2, which include the introduction of the Frigate, an escalation of the war between the French and the Dutch—and yes, you will have to pick a side eventually—and, most notably, the introduction of land combat, which is slated to arrive in season 3. More information on that will be shared as the third season gets closer. It bears mentioning, as we didin December, thatsomepeople are playing Skull and Bones, but seemingly not a lot of them. We don't have the full picture because it's also available on the Epic Games Store, the Microsoft Store, and consoles, but the concurrent player count on Steam right now (viaSteamDB) is a little over 400—and that's a big jump over the sub-200 numbers Skull and Bones has put up through most of 2025 so far. That's a far cry from other multiplayer games from Ubisoft like For Honor and The Division 2, both of which are much older but still rumbling on with a few thousand people playing simultaneously at any given moment, and it doesn't seem sustainable to me: Ubisoft might be hoping that Skull and Bones' move onto Steam, which only happenedin August 2024, could eventually lift those numbers like a rising tide, but if it doesn't then I rather strongly suspect we won't see a year 3. For now, though, I'm actually very pleased that Skull and Bones year 2 is happening. It's not a bad game—PC Gamer's Shaun Prescott said in his68% reviewthat it's \"great within the claustrophobic parameters of what market forces allow it to be\"—and given the number of modestly successful live service games thatcome to a premature endbecause they don't immediately meet whatever arbitrary goal is set for them, it's nice to see Skull and Bones getting the chance to do its thing for at least one more year. And if it does somehow manage to turn things around and become a For Honor-style low-key earner, that'd be even better. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And if it doesn't work out, well, we had some good times, didn't we? I promise not to use this headline format again, unless Skull and Bones actually gets a year 3, in which case all bets are off.

This mod doesn’t add any creatures that look like your friends, but it does allow monsters to copy voice clips and repeat them back to the group. If it’s a Trudge waiting behind the next door and it imitates a friend, then good luck. If you want something thatlookslike other players, then scroll down to the next suggestion. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Download fromThunderstoreIf you’ve run into every horror from REPO’s monster list and don’t want reskins only, then Wesleys Enemies should do the trick. The upgrade adds four new monsters to REPO—The Gusher, Roaster, Droid, and Destroyer. Those first two are pretty freaky lookin’, but it’s the Droid that keeps me on high alert. It’s easy to confuse for a friend in multiplayer, as the little Semibot lookalike waddles around like a regular player, but it is most certainlynota friend. It’s another Mimic-like enemy, but it doesn’t copy player voices. That’s enabled by eth9n’s mod above. Download fromThunderstoreFew things give me more anxiety than the moon with a face from Majora's Mask, and now that I think about it, the Zelda moon is totally a distant cousin of the REPO Taxman. It fits right in. Termina's torturer also comes with a few neat details outside of its nasty expression, like Majora's Mask audio replacements and differing idle and chase animations. Download fromThunderstoreRemember that era of Lethal Company when we all downloaded goofy things for the Hoarding Bug to say? Well, we’re doing it again in REPO. I don’t know why, but I’m tired of the quack now and the Yippee! Duck just hits different. Download fromThunderstoreSome of REPO's colors just aren't distinct enough, sometimes making the frantic scramble to work together a little more frustrating. The REPO Custom Color mod gives you way more to work with by adding RGB sliders for new hues. Finally, I can make my Semibot the incredibly specific shade of green I wanted it to be. Download fromThunderstoreIf the custom colors aren't enough, try adding a little fashion. The MoreHead REPO mod adds masks, stickers, glasses, and even familiar looks from Minecraft. Toss in add-ons likeEvenMoreHeadandMoreCosmeticsso you’ll wind up with a closet full of new Semibot looks. Download fromThunderstoreModding gets a little cumbersome when some require opening a sea of config files in Notepad to toggle settings. The REPO Config mod cuts out all that annoying launching and relaunching the game between edits, allowing you to tweak mod settings straight from the game's main menu. Download fromThunderstoreREPO doesn't offer official ultrawide support, but of course there's a fan fix for that. The black bars don't always bother me, but in a horror game where I'm frantically on the lookout for knife-wielding frogs, I want the extra visual space. This was the first thing I installed, so it's a gimme for the best mod list. Download fromThunderstoreA shaky flashlight is certainly more realistic, but it makes me queasy. REPO has a few built-in settings to help with motion sickness, but none to adjust the swaying, choppy flashlight. Linkoid's fix makes things much more manageable for folks like me, easily made motion sick by all of the frantic movement and focus. We can do this the hard way or the easy way, but I've made too many messes manually installing game mods, so now I live and die by mod management tools. Some of that just comes down to preference, but I usually default to r2modman if it's an option. I'll briefly explain both that and the Thunderstore App. ⚙️R2modman |Download fromThunderstoreby selecting Manual Download They're both quite similar, but think of R2modman as Thunderstore lite. Its user interface is stripped down and doesn't use Overwolf, but it's not the official app for using Thunderstore, though it navigates them all the same. ⚙️The Thunderstore Mod Manager |Download fromOverwolf Thunderstore's official mod manager requires an Overwolf install. It's not a big deal if you're already using other gaming tools through the app, but it may be a bit excessive if this is just for REPO mods. 📝Modding requirements and tips First things first: open your chosen mod manager, search for \"REPO,\" then select a profile.Selecting Default is fine, but creating another profile gives you the option to save specific configurations and share them with friends.

One of my favorite things about Souls games is that sometimes the best method for dealing with tragic, corrupted knights and primordial horrors is simply hitting them very hard with a large object. It's an ideal embodied by the Raider, the subject of Bandai Namco's latestElden Ring: Nightreign character reveal trailer, who seems just as comfortable using himself as a bludgeoning implement as anything else. At first blush, the Raider looks a bit like someone's Skyrim character wandered out of Nord country and into Limgrave. For all youElden Ringbuffs, he's Godfrey-coded—or maybe Hoarah Loux-coded is more accurate: He's a burly, bearded, viking-looking gent, who starts the trailer cracking his knuckles as though he's not particularly interested in the massive axe he's got strapped to his back. If I was the kind of person who would casually deliver an uppercut to a dragon like the Raider does just a few seconds later, I'd probably be pretty ambivalent about my own great axe, too. It's unclear if the Raider's brawling abilities are unique, or if they can be found as Ashes of War for any Nightreign character to use. But still, he has a clear passion for pugilism. He socks wyrms in the mouth. He headbutts knights wearing full plate armor. And if engaging FromSoft enemies in fisticuffs wasn't enough to charm you, we get a shot of him enjoying a cold one. (It's important to treat yourself between bouts of dragon boxing.) At the end of the trailer, we get a look at what seems like the Raider's ultimate ability. He stomps the ground, causing a damaging eruption of sharp rocks as a large stone slab bursts from the ground and lifts him into the air. The slab provides some interesting utility. It can elevate you and your teammates above the reach of enemy attacks, and even provides a safe shooting position for someone likeIroneye, Nightreign's archer character, to fire down at targets without risk. And best of all, the slab serves as a platform you can leap off of for a timely plunging attack, which as we all know is the coolest form of attack anyone can do. Bandai Namco has followed up previous Nightreign reveals with longer videos providing more details about the character's abilities, so if you're keen to learn more about the Raider's whole deal, keep an eye on the publisher'sYouTube channel.

    "article_text": "Want to see what Arc Raiders is all about? Here's your chance. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The extraction shooter discourse has been dominated in recent days byMarathon, Bungie's upcoming kick at the can, but there's another game in the mix with the potential to steal its thunder:Arc Raiders, which PC Gamer's Jake Tucker said in 2024 \"could be the extraction shooter that finally brings the genre to the masses.\" Whether or not that happens remains to be seen, but we'll all move one step closer to figuring it out on April 30, which will mark the kickoff of anew Arc Raiders tech test, its largest playtest thus far. To get into the test, you'll have to request access onSteamor, if you're on console or want to use the Epic Games Store, atarcraiders.com. You'll be notified via email if you're granted access, unless you were in the previous Arc Raiders playtest on Steam, in which case you're in automatically but won't get any notification about it. Developer Embark Studios said access to the tech test will be granted randomly, and invitations will be shared throughout the test so even if you don't get in on the first day, you might be asked to join later. This will also be the first Arc Raiders test that isn't confidential, so testers can stream it, talk about it, post about it on social media or wherever: It's still a work in progress but here will be \"many tweaks, changes, and additions before launch,\" but Embark is clearly confident enough in what it's got that it's ready to give us all a look. And maybe—hopefully—there's good reason for that. Our man Jake spent a few hours with that earlier closed beta andcame away suitably impressed, declaring \"Arc Raiders could be something very special indeed, a more accessible extraction shooter with a friendlier aesthetic that can still deliver the pulse-pounding spectacle Tarkov players crave.\" A release date hasn't been set but it's expected to be out sometime in 2025. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "The 20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection is available now, and until the end of April you can pick it up really cheap. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Somehow, the fantasy MMOGuild Warsis 20 years old: It launched in 2005 and it's still ticking over today. That's an impressive accomplishment by any measure, and ArenaNet isn't letting the anniversary pass unnoticed. The studio has rolled out a new content update that makes a range of previously-inaccessible promotional items from the early days of Guild Wars available to everyone, and there's also a new edition of the game that includes, well,everything, that's on sale until the end of April. The new-to-you items in Guild Wars' newest content update were previously \"only obtainable as pre-order and territorial bonuses from the mid-2000s,\" ArenaNet said, and I think finally putting them in the game for one and all is a cool move: I can see why some people might want to hold onto the \"I was there when the world was born\" exclusivity of these things, but really, you've had two decades—it's time to give sharing a chance, and what better time to do it than the 20thanniversary? Ah, but there's a catch. Those items will only be available as rare drops from high-level enemies, so if you want them, you're going to have to work for them. If that doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, you'll also be able to snag a selection of limited-release miniatures as non-tradeable items from Merrise in Embark Beach—but only until May 6. New upgrades for main-hand weapons are also being added as rare drops: \"These 'of the Profession' modifiers will set the level of the named profession’s primary attribute to as much as 5, even if you wouldn’t normally have access to that attribute, granting new build possibilities to established characters,\" ArenaNet explained. Importantly, weapons bearing the modifiers will also have groovy glowing streaks when you wave them around. If all this sounds like the sort of action you want to get into, the20th Anniversary Masterpiece Collection of Guild Warsis the way to go. It includes all previously released Guild Wars content—the Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall campaigns, plus the Eye of the North expansion and the Bonus Mission Pack—along with bonus items, weapons, and a combat ally, and eight character slots for new players. It's currently on sale for $8, 80% off the regular price—\"the biggest discount in Guild Wars' history,\" ArenaNet said. That same discount is being offered on other editions of Guild Wars onSteam, so just snag a bit of this-and-that if you'd rather. \"It’s very rare for any game to reach 20 years of operation,\" Guild Wars Game Director Stephen Clarke-Willson said. \"It’s a testament to the support and love from players across the decades that we’re still able to add new updates and content to the game. We are incredibly proud that Guild Wars has stood the test of time and reached this amazing milestone.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "RuneScape: Dragonwilds' build mode is easily the best I've played since Valheim",
    "article_text": "Survivalcraft homemakers have beautiful tools right at launch, for once. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are two types of survival crafting players in every friend group: the 'go kill things in a cave to supply the crew' people and the 'build the aesthetically pleasing base for everyone to live in' people. Because I am one of the latter, the first thing I have noticed about RuneScape: Dragonwilds as it surprise-launched today is that it isincrediblygood for us base-building little gremlins. Every survival game begins with erecting a barebones wooden box to call your own, but Dragonwilds makes even that feel pretty slick right from the jump. Not only do pieces just snap together nicely, but they rotate around the vertical axis easily so you can build your little house facing just about any direction you please, not only in four cardinal directions. After that you'll notice that you can hold Ctrl to raise and lower pieces at will or turn off snapping mode altogether. It's shockingly smooth. I built a tiny little loft nook in my very first little home just by raising up a floor platform piece above the foundation I'd built, slapping some stairs on the side of it, and enclosing it with walls I lowered manually. That's already so much more stylish than what 99% of other survival crafting games allow. When you build yourself a proper crafting table, the real artistry begins. I'm just going to rattle off a little list of building pieces here that will mean nothing to the 'fight stuff in caves' friends but will make my fellow building freaks salivate: I know it sounds niche, but roof valley pieces for joining two perpendicular gabled roofs is the most overlooked but fundamentally important part of a building system. It even includes three different roof section lengths and small triangular wall pieces so that you don't have to conform to the old laws of 'is this an even tiles or odd tiles build system' problem. It's both—spot me mixing a two-wide loft with a three-wide main structure in my first build. Dragonwilds just gets me. Early access survival crafting games are a micro genre unto themselves at this point and one thing you can usually expect is for the provided building tiles to be the minimum viable set needed to construct a box with a roof on it. The niceties of pretty bases are more of a future roadmap feature, more often than not. Dragonwilds clearly didn't forget about me and my building freaks though; I haven't eaten this good as a base-building player since Valheim. That's another feature Dragonwilds has folded in, by the by: a structural integrity system reminiscent of Valheim's. I'm only a couple hours in at the moment, so I've not yet stretched the limits of building safety but even my modest little roof cap has a yellow warning as I snap it into place letting me know that it could really use some supports. I'll be digging into that pillars and beams category of the build system next. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As things get more complicated I'm looking forward to digging into the edge cases of what Dragonwilds allows. It even supports my building needs with its magical skills system. After just a bit of work I've unlocked a skill that allows me to fly around free-cam style while building to snap pieces into those tough-to-reach spots without actually having to scale the roof of my structure and risk falling off. RuneScape: Dragonwildssurprise-launched into early access today. Between the dragon fights it promises for my combat-focused friends and the obviously excellent initial building mode for us homemakers, I don't think I'm going to struggle to lure my usual survivalcraft crew into this one.

    "title": "Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 8 added a busted new spell that gives Fighters better smites than Paladins—and it's only a cantrip",
    "article_text": "Now is the age of Booming Blade. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Baldur's Gate 3'sPatch 8 arrived today, and Larian's last major update risks sending us all back into a fresh Faerun frenzy more than a year and a half after release. Its flashiest additions are the suite of new subclasses, but there's one new spell that promises to become a fast favorite for any melee character. Let me introduce you to Booming Blade. You're going to get along very well. A new cantrip that can be picked up at Level 1 by spellcasting classes, Booming Blade is a weapon attack that slaps a debuff on enemies, which causes them to take 1d8 Thunder damage when they move. Booming Blade really shines at higher character levels, when it first adds 1d8 and then 2d8 Thunder damage to the initial weapon attack. In tabletop D&D, casting Booming Blade eats your turn's entire action. As our Ted Litchfieldwrote back in January, however, what makes Booming Blade so spectacular in Baldur's Gate 3 is its compatibility with any melee class's Extra Attack feature. It's essentially a Paladin smite that, as a cantrip, doesn't burn spell slots—and it's not hard to see whyBG3 theorycrafterswere convinced it wastoo goodduring the Patch 8 stress tests. As an illustration, imagine you're a Fighter with access to Booming Blade either through the Eldritch Knight subclass or from investing a level in a spellcasting class. With Booming Blade, you can hammer an enemy with extra Thunder damage on an initial attack, and follow up with two more hits from your Improved Extra Attack feature. Then, because Booming Blade is only a cantrip, you're free to Action Surge for another heavy Thunder hit and two more extra attacks. And if you've got a spellcaster to hit you with Haste, you can drop Booming Blade and your extra attacks athirdtime. That's a total of nine attacks in one turn, one third of which are getting a hefty damage boost. As someone who started out Baldur's Gate 3 as an Eldritch Knight Fighter and found it lackluster enough that I ended up grudgingly switching to Paladin to get the big, magic weapon hits I was hoping for, I'll admit I feel a certain amount of glee from seeing Fighters upstaging fantasy supercops and their hallmark Smites. But while Booming Blade seemed primed to turn Eldritch Knight from underdog to demigod, the subclass still can't catch a break. During the Patch 8 stress test, it looked like Booming Blade might trigger the Eldritch Knight's War Magic feature, which gives a free weapon attack after casting a cantrip—potentially addingyet anotherattack to the Fighter's thunder damage onslaught. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Based on some quick testing I did after the patch dropped today, however, it doesn't seem like casting Booming Blade successfully activates War Magic. I'm not a true BG3 sicko, so I might be overlooking something, but sadly it seems like Eldritch Knight is staying on the bench. Fighters hoping to make the most of Booming Blade are probably better off going with the Champion or Battle Master subclasses after grabbing a level in a spellcaster class to pick up the cantrip. If you end up going that route, you can't go wrong with aHexblade dip.

    "title": "Surprise! RuneScape: Dragonwilds has launched into early access only two weeks after its first trailer was released",
    "article_text": "Surprise, surprise! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Jagex has launched its open world survival crafting game,RuneScape: Dragonwilds, into early access, even though it was only shown for the first time on March 31. Ahead of its release, a developer update livestream was scheduled to share some more details on the game, including its coveted release date, but little did we know that release date would be right now. Prior to the release of its official teaser trailer which was shared only two weeks ago, Dragonwilds was technically first introduced in 2022 before being brought back to our attention in October 2024, when Jagex put out the feelers for some testers for a \"new survival game set in the RuneScape universe.\" Despite those brief mentions and the information on the Steam page, we haven't been given a lot to go off when it comes to what to expect from the game. What we did know for sure though, is that even though Dragonwilds isn't the typical RuneScape experience we know and love, it's still marketed as \"RuneScape at its core.\" That means you can expect plenty of quests to keep you on your toes, and a mass of lore to sink your teeth into. But there's also a lot going on to help it become its own unique addition to the RuneScape universe. Jagex's executive producer, Jesse America, stated that \"We’ve been working hard to develop an entirely new type of RuneScape experience that ignites fans’ passion, creativity and love for questing, and provide them with an all-new RuneScape adventure to discover. And this is just the start of our development journey. \"Throughout Early Access, we’ll be updating the game regularly with new content and features, while listening closely to the community to deliver an iconic open world survival crafting game that is loved equally by our biggest RuneScape fans and new players alike.\" While making your way around Ashenfall, you'll be able to do all the key elements of survival crafting games like gathering resources, foraging, and working your way through plenty of skill trees. So don't worry, you've now got an entirely new opportunity to get your runecrafting and woodcutting skills to 99. As you work your way through, you'll unlock a plethora of new skills you'll need while facing off with some of the new foes being added too. In typical RuneScape fashion you'll also be able to farm runes and use magic to take down enemies and hone your powers. More importantly, though, you'll be able to use these magical abilities to make your new life as a survivalist easier. Dragonwilds gives you the all-important opportunity tocut down multiple trees at once, for example, and we couldn't be more excited about that in particular. I imagine there are plenty of other useful ways to utilise your magical abilities, but come on. Cutting down multiple trees at once with the click of a button is huge for survival crafting games. I can't be the only one who is thrilled about this. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

It's done away with the standard matches in favour of a best-of-seven rounds type deal with smaller objective points, maps, and timings, so matches really don't take too long. But the best part of this new mode by far has to be the absolutely wacky builds you can make. At first, all the ability items and powers can seem a tad overwhelming. There's an entire page for weapon, ability, and survival items and an extra one for all the powers available to buff up your character. You can have up to six items, with common ones costing 1,000-1,500 points, the rare ones costing 3,750-5,000 points, and epic ones costing 9,000-11,000 points. It doesn't lock you into this choice either, as you can sell items and get back your points to spend on more powerful options later on in the match. Then, every odd round, you get to choose one power from 12 options. These are like super buffs, giving your hero one really cool ability. These are what you can focus your builds around. So for Moira, there's an example build called the \"Orb Doctor\" which I've actually found really helpful, as this focuses all your strength around your Biotic Orb ability, with the Multiball power launching two additional orbs with 85% reduced effectiveness and the Cross-Orbal power which launches an additional Biotic Orb of the other type with 50% reduced capacity. Alongside items like Cybervenom, Extendrils, Champion's Kit, Nano Cola, Energised Bracers, and Multi-Tool, you can launch four Biotic Orbs at 100% ability optimisation, which can kill any nearby enemy with under 300 HP. It's pretty busted, that's for sure. Other cool builds include a burn build for Ashe, which puts all of her strength into her Dynamite ability, an attack speed build for Reaper, giving him the ability to tear through Tanks at a rapid pace, and roll-stun build for Cassidy, which makes both his abilities super powerful. But my favourite out of everything I've tested so far has to be Soldier 76 and his Helix Rocket build. Like every hero, there are a couple of different ways to approach a Soldier 76 build. You could focus on healing and survivability, and pick items and powers that improve your Biotic Field, you can focus on attack speed and transform Soldier 76's rifle into a rapid fire machine gun, or you can buff his Helix Rockets: my personal favourite. To do this, I always pick the Super Visor power straight away, as this means that every time you use a Helix Rocket, you'll get 0.75 seconds of Tactical Visor afterwards (basically auto aim). Therefore, after I land a hit on a Support or DPS hero, I can usually finish them off with this ability as they're running away. And as the match progresses, the stronger I make my Helix Rockets, the more lethal this ability becomes. But if you're not as confident in landing Helix Rocket shots, then you can also choose to buff your rifle instead, but it's not nearly as fun. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's a pretty scary build, but one that I absolutely love using. Other items I pick to buff my Helix Rockets include Endgame Equaliser, Bomb Diffusal Boots, Nano Cola, Iridescent Iris, and Custom Stock. I'll also pick powers like On Me!, which lets your Biotic Field move with you while granting you 20% increased Max Life when active to help boost survivability. Then I'll go for Double Helix, which grants you a second homing Helix Rocket that deals 70% reduced damage, and Cratered or Peripheral Pulse, which grants an increased explosion radius for Helix Rockets or lets you shoot at one additional enemy at 50% damage, respectively. I've found that this build for Soldier 76 in particular can begin to snowball as the match goes on, becoming increasingly harder for the enemy team to deal with, especially if you have a sturdy frontline. It's a pretty scary build, but one that I absolutely love using. But I'm sure this is only the beginning of players finding completely busted builds for Overwatch 2 Stadium. From what I've seen so far, Moira, Reinhardt, Junker Queen, and Juno all seem pretty strong, and while the devs will probably implement a couple of little hero patches, it's actually a lot of fun just relishing in the chaos right now.

Saber and Focus promised in March that the announcement of Space Marine 3 did not spellthe end of Space Marine 2, and that in fact \"more awesome content\" for Space Marine 2 is still in the works. And here we are, as promised: TheTrygon Update, with a new PvE mission, boss fight, and more Space Marinestuff, is now live. The \"Exfiltration\" mission is the centerpiece of the update: A Tech-Priest on Avarax is refusing an order to withdraw from an Adeptus Mechanicus facility, Captain Acheran has authorised Magos Galeo to pull her out, and you're going to help. Complicating matters is the addition of a new Terminus Enemy—a boss, basically—called a Trygon, a massive, tunnelling tyranid that erupts from the surface to cause all sorts of up-close-and-personal grief with powerful claws and \"bio-electric attacks.\" In case that's not enough, the tunnels left in the Trygon's wake form passageways that can be used by other tyranids, so you can expect to see more of them on your trip to Avarax too. On the happier news front, Space Marines will have access to the new Inferno Pistol in both PvE and PvP gameplay, a pair of new default colors and customization options are available, and of course there are a range of fixes, tweaks, and gameplay changes: Private lobbies are now available in PvP mode, which is a pretty big deal, prestige ranks are now unlockable in PvE, weapon class restrictions have been loosened so classes have access to more firepower, there's a \"massive rebalancing and rework of weapon perks\" in PvE that means \"all weapons received buffs one way or another,\" and all sorts more. This is indeed a big update. There's also some new season pass content, including a Space Wolves Chapter Pack and Imperial Fists Champion Pack.

    "title": "As games become ever more multithreaded, Intel's hybrid CPU design might start to lag behind AMD's simpler but more effective architecture",
    "article_text": "E-cores and the loss of hyperthreading aren't helping Intel win any future gaming crowns. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD and Intel have taken very different approaches to increasing the core counts of their processors. In the case of Team Red and itsRyzenCPUs, it went down a chiplet route, putting a block of cores and cache into one tiny chip, that can be easily doubled or more to get extra cores. Intel, on the other hand, decided that it would stuff two different types of cores into its chips and, even though it now uses a tiled/chiplet approach for its latest processors, the 'hybrid' architecture shows no sign of changing. In fact, it's become even more hybrid than it was for the original design inAlder Lakethat appeared in 2021. Arrow Lakeushered in some radical changesfrom Intel's usual layout and features, with hyperthreading (aka simultaneous multithreading) being dropped, and the P- and E-cores being mixed together within the die, rather than being separate blocks of cores. From the very start of this hybrid approach, games have required an extra helping hand, either from Windows or Intel software (IAO,Intel Application Optimization), to make sure that crucial threads are processed by the P-cores only. However, in the past few years, the number of threads games rely on has increased substantially and with the loss of hyperthreading in Arrow Lake, E-cores are now coming into play a lot more. To show you what I mean, I've sampled the CPU usage of two high-end PCs in five different games. One rig is a CyberPowerPC, with aRyzen 7 9800X3DCPU andRTX 5080graphics card. The other is aCore Ultra 7 265Ksetup, with anRTX 4080 Superhandling all the pixels. Sure, they're far from being equivalent platforms, and it's unfair to pitch the $4779800X3Dagainst the $323 265K. However, I'm not looking at performance here; I'm just looking at how the CPU's cores are getting used. Of course, CPU utilization graphs in Task Manager tell you absolutely nothing about how 'hard' those cores are being used and if one is showing 100% utilization, it doesn't mean that it can't be used further. In the videos below, you'll see core utilization for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D on the left, and the same again for the Core Ultra 7 265K on the right. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Let's start with a classic,Cyberpunk 2077. As a massive open-world game, replete with hundreds of objects and characters constantly moving about, you'd expect it to be very heavy on the CPU. To a certain extent, it is, but once you crank up the graphics settings, that central processor takes a back foot to the GPU. I've recorded the usage with CP2077 at 4K and maximum graphics settings (i.e. path tracing), along with DLSS Quality and frame generation enabled. You can clearly see that none of the cores in the Ryzen 9800X3D are being significantly utilized, bar the first and third cores. Task Managers display logical processors in order of core 1 (thread 1, thread 2), through to core 8 going from left to right, top to bottom. Since the Core Ultra 7 265K doesn't support simultaneous multithreading, the logical processors are the actual cores. For all Arrow Lake chips, Task Manager goes P-core 1, P-core 2, then E-cores 1 to 4, followed by P-cores 3 to 6, then E-cores 5 to 12, and finishes with the last two P-cores (7 and 8) Cyberpunk 2077 is coded to push threads onto P-cores in hybrid CPUs and you can see this quite clearly, with P-1 and P-5 under the most utilization, followed by all of the other P-cores being worked roughly the same. The E-cores are doing something but it's nothing very heavy, it seems. HWInfo64 shows the clock speeds for the various cores (note that it starts at core 0, which is how it's technically measured out) and for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, it also shows which are the 'preferred' cores—these are the ones that Windows will direct threads to as a preference. As you can see, cores 0 and 3 are being utilized a little more than the others, but it's a stark contrast to the 265K. Stalker 2uses Unreal Engine 5 for everything and it can churn quite a few threads, mostly for handling the parallel issuing of command lists for the graphics. Just like CP2077, Stalker 2 is a massive open-world game and its CPU workload is clearly higher than Cyberpunk's. Both the 9800X3D and 265K are being worked hard here at 4K, maximum settings, with DLSS Quality and frame generation, but the Arrow Lake chip's P-cores are once again taking the brunt of the processing. Where the 9800X3D has plenty of capacity to absorb an increase in CPU utilization, the 265K is somewhat limited by the fact that it only has eight P-cores for eight threads. Another open-world game, another engine, but it's a similar story inAssassin's Creed Shadows. However, note that some of 265K's E-cores are being utilized almost as much as the P-cores, though again we can see that P-1 and P-5 are the favoured cores for the game's primary threads. After the 40-second mark in the video, the CPU utilization settles down and both chips have spare capacity; more on the Ryzen than the Core Ultra, but it doesn't seem like the use of the E-cores in Shadows causes any problems. While the three games we've seen so far haven't been especially heavily multithreaded, that all changes withThe Last of Us Part 2. It has multiple threads for handling its asset streaming system, which leverages DirectStorage to reduce the CPU overhead, along with more threads for conducting background shader compilation. Three of the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's cores are significantly loaded up, with a further two not that much less. The remaining three cores (don't forget that two graphs in Task Manager here represent two threads on one core) operate between 40% and 50% utilization, which is notably more than what we've seen so far. The E-cores in the 265K are also being tasked more than in the other games, though the first four aren't doing a great deal, but once again, it's those two P-cores that are being loaded right up. I've saved the best to last!Flight Simulator 2024throws a wall of threads at the CPU and it's an absolute torrent in the first 30 seconds of the flight. Asset streaming, netcode handling for world downloads, and complex flight dynamics all want a sizeable share of the processor's capabilities. Things eventually settle down and both chips have all their cores utilized by around 40% or more, and in the case of the 265K's P-cores, it's considerably more. To the point that if the game asked more of them, it's possible that they wouldn't have the capacity and the slower E-cores would feel the squeeze. Yes, this is just a handful of examples, and it's certainly not a scientifically-balanced comparison, but I have examined other games and there's a definite trend towards heavier multithreading. I'm sure some of you will be thinking \"About time!\" because we've had eight-core, 16-thread chips for years now. All of this has got me wondering about Intel's hybrid CPU architecture, especially now it's all hyperthreading-free. The E-cores in Arrow Lake are certainly very capable but it comes down to one simple question: Is it better to have one core handle two game threads or two different cores handle them instead? The former is a simpler approach and it's one that Windows PCs and consoles have been designed around for many years. We're far off ever needing a CPU with support for more than 16 threads, but in the case of AMD, its main gaming chips process every thread with near-equal levels of capability. Not so in the case of Intel where you ideally want the P-cores to be doingeverything. However, you're only getting eight of them, for eight threads, and once they're loaded up to the hilt, the slower E-cores have to get used. In the case of The Last of Us Part 2 and Flight Simulator 2024, they're getting used regardless of core preference. I think it's fair to assume that Intel will retain its hybrid design for many years to come; likewise, it's safe to assume that E-cores will always be less capable than P-cores (otherwise they'd just be classed the same). That means in the not-too-distant future, games that generate more than eight heavy threads are potentially going to run slower on Intel chips than AMD ones. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Or are they? After all, two threads on one core have to share resources (cache, logic units, etc), so they're not necessarily processed at the same rate. It's possible that two threads on a Ryzen core get churned out at roughly the same rate as two threads on an Intel P- and E-core. It would need significantly more investigating to know this for sure. If I were a game developer, I doubt I would have the time to do this properly so I'd have to rely on AMD and Intel's engineers to ensure that their processors all behave as expected. Predictability helps save time in fine-tuning performance and it's perhaps one aspect of why Microsoft and Sony used AMD CPUs in their consoles. With rumours pointing toAMD sticking 12 cores in each CCD(Core Complex Die) for Zen 6, rather than the current eight, Intel's hybrid approach might just find itself lagging ever further behind the simpler but clearly effective design. How Team Blue responds to this, if it comes to pass, will be interesting to see.

    "article_text": "But really, will we see these cards at MSRP in the wild anyway? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Normally the launch of a new graphics card would be a wholly joyous affair, especially a more affordable one like the RTX 5060 Ti—GPUs for the masses and whatnot. This time, however, despite the siren song of affordable graphics cards, the rocks we're heading towards have'may or may not be actually available at MSRP'indelibly printed on them. This was the case even before the Trump tariffs, but the uncertainty surrounding the administration's tariffs and whether they apply to computer parts now or in the future, certainly doesn't help. Nvidia has said that the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti GPU MSRPs are \"not inclusive of regional VAT or any tariff.\" This means should a tariff be put on PC parts, Nvidia is at least for now washing its hands of the whole pricing debacle that would surely follow. In fact, Nvidia's GeForce product manager Justin Walker says there's \"not a whole lot we can do about tariffs.\" There's at least an attempt at reassurance: \"We can work with our partners to get these out at reasonable prices, which we are doing.\" Credit where credit's due, I'd rather this honesty than hands-over-ears *la la la tariffs what tariffs?*But it still stings, as reality often does. TheRTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti were announced todayand will start at $299 for the RTX 5060, $379 for the 8 GB RTX 5060 Ti, and $429 for the 16 GB RTX 5060 Ti. The sweet spot will likely be that $379 model. But it'll only be sweet if that'sactuallythe price we find the 8 GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards retailing for. Currently, while the UK is faring a little better, in the US it's difficult to find RTX 50-series cards for anything close to their MSRPs, and that's been the tale ever since their respective launches. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Throw the new US tariffs into the mix, too, and I'm not filled with confidence. It's not as if we're getting a clear picture of what these tariffs will be, either, since there's a lot of seeming flip-flopping going on. The latest is that computer parts and semiconductors have been made exempt from tariffs, according to a White House press release, which had already been watered down, though there is still a threat of further tariffs to come on, according to Donald Trump onTruth Social. Likely in response to growing pressure on US businesses to build things in the US Nvidia hasannounced plans to build AI chips and supercomputers in the USfor the first time. Some chips are already in production at TSMC's Arizona plant, but there are plans for new plants in Texas in collaboration with Foxconn and Wistron. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. Though whether Nvidia feels the pressure to change its MSRPs due to tariffs isn't the main threat to PC gamers' purse strings. The card partners building and shipping these cards across the globe might be sweating over their bottom line and considering price increases. For now, any immediate price rises might be eased by the ongoing exemption, but if that changes or prices rise, the customer will bear the brunt of it. Let's not end on that note. Maybe the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti will be the return of reasonable pricing in 2025—it's notimpossible, I suppose, and they are expected to be available in even higher volume than theRTX 5070thanks to that ickle GB206 GPU. And there's always the RX 9060 and RX 9060 XT to consider, with the latest rumours having the latterseeming like an RX 9070 XT cut in two. Judging by AMD's initial announcement, these cheaper RDNA 4 cards should be launching relatively soon, and if theRX 9070 XT giving it to the RTX 5070 Tiis anything to go by, they might offer some decent competition against the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti. Then again, it's hard to find RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT cards in stock at MSRPs, too… Damn, and there was me not wanting to finish on a sour note.

    "title": "All Schedule 1 employees and how they work",
    "article_text": "Hire workers to get a helping hand with your operations. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the best ways to improve your income inSchedule 1is to hireemployees. These workers can be assigned to various tasks, which they'll handle on your behalf. You'll have to pay them a wage, unfortunately, but it's worth it in the long run. When you first unlock employees, you won't want to immediately go on a hiring spree. Workers aren't cheap, and you don't have much room in the sweatshop or bungalow to fit everyone anyhow. Get a proper understanding of what each employee does first so you can prioritise your initial hires. This is a guide for Schedule 1, a satirical videogame about the drug trade, and does not contain any real information about illicit drugs. Do not try anything in this guide. (Except in the videogame Schedule 1, then it's fine.) There are four types of employees in Schedule 1, each filling a different role in your operation. While you can perform each of these tasks yourself, hiring a worker to do it for you saves a great deal of time, letting you make product faster and turn them in for cash. Employee Price Role Cleaner $1,000 hiring fee + $100 per day Picks up trash and empties bins Botanist $1,500 hiring fee + $200 per day Plants, maintains, and harvests crops Handler $1,500 hiring fee + $200 per day Packages drugs and moves items between locations within a building Chemist $2,000 hiring fee + $300 per day Mixes ingredients and cooks meth You'll need to head to theoffice in the warehouse to hire employees. Here you'll find Manny behind the counter, who'll give you the different options available to you. Select an employee type to hire them, and you'll be prompted to select a location. Before you can put your employees to work, you'll first need tobuy them a bedto settle in. You can purchase beds from Oscar in the warehouse for $150 each. Once placed, use themanagement clipboardon the employee and select to edit the \"bed\" section at the top of their list. Then, walk up to an empty bed to assign it to them. You'll see their name and coloured bedsheets depending on their role suddenly appear, as well as ablack box at the foot of the bed where you'll put their salary. If you don't pay their wages, they won't work and will awkwardly stand outside staring at you every time you walk by. They'll never quit, though, so there's technically nothing wrong with not paying their wages when they're not needed, which is likely to happen early on when you're getting production lines set up. It's worth pointing out thatyoucan't move or relocate workers once hired. You'll have to hire more workers each time you move to a new location, though you don't need to fire the old ones. They'll hang around in case you want two operations on the go, not costing you a dime unless you put money in their box. Below you'll find more details about each worker, including how to assign them and some tricks I've picked up over the many hours I've spent expanding my enterprise. Cleaners are the most easily ignored workers, simply because they don't add value to your business like the other employees do. Cleaners tidy up after you or your employees. They drain your money more than they'll ever pay you back for it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Rubbish quickly piles up in your buildings if you're not keeping things clean, and it's an absolute pain trying to keep on top of it yourself. Sure, the cleaner won't recycle the rubbish for cash like you can if you do it yourself, but it means you don't have to run around with a litter picker all day and can instead focus your efforts entirely on production and dealing. To assign a cleaner, all you need to do is place up to three bins and use the management clipboard on the worker to select the areas you want them to cover. Bins don't have a massive radius, so you'll need a few for effective coverage. Botanists are the lifeblood of your business, responsible for planting, maintaining, and harvesting any crops they're assigned to. They're not too expensive either, and they'll quickly recover their cost once your production ramps up. A single botanist can be assigned up to a maximum of eight crops, though you'll quickly find out that even this can be a lot of work if you're adding extra steps (like additives) to the mix. To assign a botanist, use the management clipboard on them and select their stations, then walk up to any pots you want them to work on and click to assign them. Importantly, additives are not assigned to the botanist directly, but with the pots instead. To do this, use the management clipboard on their assigned pots, where you can specify seeds and up to three additives that will be added. You'll also want to assign a botanist a shelf, where you can conveniently stock all their items like soil, seeds, and additives, so they can automatically use them. Use the management clipboard on them once again, and select a shelving unit as a source. Able to move items around your building automatically, handlers are neck and neck with botanists to be the most valuable workers. Having someone move items might sound simple, but taking you out of the equation is crucial when it comes to establishing a proper production line. Think about it: you don't have to put the increasingly important additives into mixers anymore, and you don't need to package your drugs for distribution either. Because of their versatility, handlers are also the most complicated workers to assign. Starting simple, you can assign handlers to packaging stations (using the management clipboard) where they will take any drugs already moved to the station and put them in bags for you to sell. For this to work, you'll either need to use a handler to move the product to the station, or set the output of a mixer to a packaging station, which will cause a chemist to move it once they've finished mixing it. It becomes much more complicated when you take advantage of the handler's ability to follow routes. Using the management clipboard, select a handler and click on one of the empty boxes under the \"routes\" section. Then, you can select almost any type of station as either an input or an output, including shelves. A handler can have a maximum of five instructions, which you can quickly fill. For example, I set a handler to collect mixing items from a shelf I stock up regularly and move them to four different mixers. I then hired two more handlers to work exclusively on packaging stations, with two simple instructions: grab bags from a nearby small shelf to stock their station, and move finished product from a mixer to their own station. Chemists are great for convenience; able to handle the arduous task of making meth (including combining the ingredients and baking them) and using mixing stations. You can assign a single chemist to a maximum of four stations, which is pretty generous. You could have one chemist making two batches of meth at once, while another singlehandedly mans four mixers. It's a real time saver as your operation expands. You can also assign chemists to stations using the management clipboard. Unlike handlers, they don't require any extra commands. However, they won't automatically grab necessary ingredients from shelves (and these can't be set as inputs through the specific stations they work at), so you'll either have to do this yourself or use a handler. The one workaround to this is mixers, which have an output slot. If you're mixing drugs multiple times—which you should be for maximum profit—you can actually daisychain mixers by selecting another mixer as the destination for mixed drugs. The chemist will take the mixed drugs and move them to the next mixer, where they'll mix them again if you supply the stations with additives.

    "article_text": "The first one rhymes with mulk. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thenew team-up abilitiesforMarvel Rivals Season 2mean there are a bunch of fresh terrors roaming around the competitive scene. So now you don't just have to look out for Spider-Man or Iron Fist—there are new overpowered characters on the block. If you manage to place in Diamond or above, then you'll gain access to hero bans when you play competitively. This can be a real asset, especially if you hate playing against one character in particular or if there's one hero that is just too powerful in the current meta. Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles But you don't just get to ban one hero inMarvel Rivals—your team has the chance to ban up to two heroes, and if the other team bans two different heroes, that means four heroes will be unplayable for that match. You also effectively vote on which hero to ban—the more players that pick the same hero, the higher the chance there is for them to get banned. So, unfortunately, even if five out of six players choose the same hero, there's still a tiny percentage chance they won't be the hero to get banned, and the hero that the one player picked will get chosen. It's all a bit complicated, but it's not something you need to spend a lot of time worrying about. In Season 0, the so-called \"server admin\" (a hero so powerful they controlled the outcome of a game) was Hela, which meant she was the first candidate to get banned. But other strong heroes included Hulk, Hawkeye, and Bucky. This trend sort of carried over into Season 1 with the addition of Wolverine, as he was such a pain for Vanguards to play against. Other characters that are just annoying to play against, like flankers such as Spider-Man or Iron Fist or Strategists with a ridiculous healing output like Luna Snow or Cloak and Dagger, are also good picks depending on what you despise the most. But with Season 2, the best way to determine who you should ban (other than having a deep disdain for certain characters) is by their team-up ability. Some characters like Luna Snow and Jeff the Land Shark, who share the Chilling Charisma ability, don't have very good team-up abilities—it isn't bad, but it's not game-changing. On the other hand, team-ups like Arcane Order, Gamma Charge, and Mental Projection are too powerful to leave unchecked. But you only need to ban one hero to dismantle these team-ups. Without Scarlet Witch enabling Arcane Order, Doctor Strange is pretty useless right now. Emma Frost is just generally quite strong now, so banning her is a good idea, and it'll also weaken Psylocke and Magneto. And lastly, banning Hulk stops Doctor Strange and Namor from getting a gamma buff (which gives Namor the most annoying squids known to man) and will also dramatically reduce the amount of punches to the face you'll take while in a game, which is nice. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Despite there being some overpowered heroes this season, bans are mostly determined by personal experience and who's the most dangerous character in your rank. With this in mind, my top priorities for bans would be Hulk, Iron Fist, Emma Frost, and Cloak and Dagger. After that, I just try to take into account team-up abilities or heroes that I hate playing against. Bans probably won't solve all your issues, but they'll go a long way to helping make competitive matches slightly more bearable.

    "title": "This tabletop RPG is like Cyberpunk 2077 but with gods and mythology running rampant—and we've created an exclusive character you can play as",
    "article_text": "In :Otherscape, shiny new technology collides with ancient magic. But don't worry, we've made just the guy to sort it all out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In the setting of tabletop RPG:Otherscape, sci-fi dystopia and mythology collide. Imagine a world like Cyberpunk 2077's, but with old stories, gods, and monsters creeping in at the edges, offering strange powers. You might see a tooled-up mercenary wielding a reborn Excalibur, Japanese yokai haunting virtual reality, or a ruthless criminal gang taking over the streets with the help of Baba Yaga's magic. It's a killer concept, and publisherSon of Oakhas a great track record with its hugely successful noir superhero RPGCity of Mist. I've beenfollowing its upcoming fantasy game Legend in the Mist with great interest, too. So with the Kickstarter campaign starting this week for :Otherscape's new expansion,Cairo:Otherscape—offering a dive into a futuristic version of the city, where Ancient Egyptian myth and magic is reawakening—it seemed like the perfect time to get to know the game myself. There's few better ways of doing that, I think, than making a character in the system. So when Son of Oak founder Amit Moshe offered to guide me through the process personally, I couldn't say no. The result is a new official pregenerated character for :Otherscape, that you can download and play yourself. Download our exclusive :Otherscape pregen, Percy Gainer aka Byline—a digital herald, gaming addict, and truth seeker whose VR headset is really the winged helmet of Hermes. Let me take you through the process of how we built the character—and what makes :Otherscape a really interesting tabletop RPG to plug into. Creating an :Otherscape character can take just a matter of minutes. Pre-made \"tropes\" let you pick a package of abilities like choosing a class in something like D&D, whether you want to be a High-Tech Shinobi, Sorcerous Gunslinger, or Noise-Terrorist Shaman. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But one of the great things about the system is that you can also go completely the other direction, creating a fully custom character exactly as you imagine them. To really dig into the system, I knew that was the direction I wanted to go. So I needed to start with a concept. Forgive my ego, but I immediately thought about some form of futuristic journalist, perhaps pushing his stories out through cyberspace. But I wanted to lean into the mythology of the setting too. With the Egyptian gods already covered in the new book, I looked elsewhere—and figured, who could be a better ally in delivering your message to the people than Hermes, the herald of the Ancient Greek pantheon? In :Otherscape, the Mythos—that is, the supernatural—is often found merged in some way with modern technology or ideas, as it tries to infiltrate mundane society. So what modern form could Hermes come in? When I think of Hermes, I always think of his iconic winged helmet—so what if that was combined with a VR headset? There we go—a cyberspace journalist with a mystical VR headset. A pretty basic sketch of a character at this stage, but that's all we need to get started and move on to the next step. Each character in :Otherscape is built from four themes, which each fall into one of three categories: What combination of these you choose immediately helps show what kind of character you're making. The important thing is, this isn't about optimising a build. \"Do you want to be a character that combines all three elements? Or do you want to be a cyborg, just combining human and technology?\" says Moshe. \"Or what we call the transhuman, which is purely Mythos and tech? How do you envision the character?\" The important thing is, this isn't about optimising a build—whatever combination you choose, you won't be any less capable or able to engage with the game. \"We've had characters start with all Self themes, just a normal person,\" says Moshe. \"And it's just as powerful as all the other character types in the game.\" For this character, however, I knew I wanted a mix, and we already had some elements in place. Hermes' Winged Helmetwas an easy fit for a Mythos theme. And if you'll forgive me indulging in the classic journalist ideal, I decided his Self theme should beDesperate For the Truth, giving him a noble quest to root out the facts wherever they may be found. But that headset definitely also called for some major technological influence, so I decided to go for two Noise themes. The first isVR Herald, covering the ways he pushes out his message through cyberspace. But VR isn't just for business, it's for other pursuits too, so I give him aGamified Reality Overlayfor the second. Chasing the truth is its own reward, but what if you could also watch numbers going up in the corner of your vision while you were doing it? This is about the point where the name \"Percy Gainer\" popped into my head and just wouldn't go away. Too on-the-nose? Perhaps—but hey, cyberpunk's never been about subtlety. The meat of any :Otherscape character is their tags. When you make a roll to try and make something happen, you don't add attribute numbers or skill values or anything like that—instead, you see what tags from your sheet could narratively apply to the situation, and those add directly to the power of your roll. The names of each of your themes are themselves tags—so Percy could already invoke Desperate For the Truth when rolling to, say, overcome a firewall on a protected data server, or tail a person of interest to their secret rendezvous. But each theme also starts with a couple of tags within it that help flesh out specific abilities they might give you. \"You start the game with 12 tags total,\" says Moshe. \"That's basically your utility in the game… What do you want to be good at?\" A chase is a fight. A dialogue is a fight, a magical ritual is a fight. So which fights do you want your character to be really good at? But we have to be careful—focusing too much on one thing could make us a one-trick pony. \"Sometimes people go super specialized, like, out of 12 tags, they will take six or seven that are for shooting or attacking,\" says Moshe. \"And then you become really bad at everything else. So you can shoot really well, but as soon as we go into negotiations, as soon as we go into stealth, as soon as we get into magic, you're basically dead meat.\" The key is that all different kinds of conflicts in :Otherscape follow the same core set of rules—a tense negotiation carries just as much weight as a gunfight, and if you're not prepared, can leave you with just as many lasting consequences. \"A chase is a fight. A dialogue is a fight, a magical ritual is a fight,\" says Moshe. \"So which fights do you want your character to be really good at?\" My first draft of Percy fell right into the trap Moshe described. His hyper-focus on discovering information made him too one-note—I needed to diversify a bit. Take Desperate For the Truth, for example. An easy first tag wasSee What Others Don't, letting him spot the hidden clues and conspiracies. But if I made that second tag something like \"Expert Researcher\" or \"Fact Hunter\", even though it would fit narratively, it's too much overlap. Instead, I went forDogged Determination—that reflects his drive to find the truth, but could also be used in all sorts of situations that See What Others Don't couldn't, like powering through on no sleep, wearing down an interviewee, or taking a beating. The result is a brilliantly creative exercise for players. You want tags to be clear and fairly specific (\"Good at Everything\" would not be a good tag, for example), but within those constraints, you really can make them anything you like. Combine that with :Otherscape's really broad and permissive world—not only could basically any technology or body modification you can think of exist, but you've also got the supernatural to take things in even more directions—and the result is a brilliantly creative exercise for players who want to take that step. And if that seems intimidating or too time-consuming, you can just pick up a pregen or a trope package, maybe tweak them a bit to your preferences, and get going immediately instead. Ultimately I went for a mix of fairly straightforward tags—such as aWeakspot Highlighterfor Percy's Gamified Reality Overlay, like a real-world VATS from Fallout—and ones that are a little more abstract that I could get creative with in play—likeGet Where I'm Neededfor Hermes' Winged Helmet, which could be used in all sorts of ways to help with almost any obstacle, as long as the destination is truly where he needs to be. Themes aren't purely about power—they have their downsides and restrictions too. To start with, each one has a weakness. These are like anti-tags—they describe something bad or unreliable about that theme, and when they apply to a roll, they make you less likely to succeed. But using them is also how you work towards upgrading a theme, so even though they can make your life more difficult, you want them to be a part of the game. Making them really unlikely to come up or easy to avoid is only shooting yourself in the foot long-term. Being prone to shooting yourself in the foot might be a good weakness, actually… For Hermes' Winged Helmet, I wanted a weakness that felt like a mystical oath.Malfunctions When I Liesets the stage for some consequences if this dedicated truth-teller strays from his divine mission. For Gamified Reality Overlay, though, something more directly related to using the technology made sense—Overwhelming Readoutsreflects how disorienting being bombarded with so much data can be, and might start to hit Percy hard in situations where too many variables are popping up at once. It gives the game's tech an inherently insidious quality that makes it feel oddly alive. Each theme also needs a \"motivation\", and these are different for each type. They're statements that reflect how you interact with that theme, and if you want to hold onto that theme, you need to act in harmony with them. If you instead deny them or act against them, that theme starts to \"decay\", until it disappears entirely to be replaced with a brand new theme—perfect for if you feel they've changed and evolved into something new during their adventures. For Self themes, the motivation is an Identity—a defining element of your character's personality. For Desperate For the Truth, that was easy—\"I Need To Find Something Real\"reflects his goal, and if he stops living by that statement, he'll certainly be letting that part of himself go. Mythos themes instead have a Ritual—something you have to do to hold onto your connection with them, such as regularly returning to a place of power or pursuing a divine mission. That was easy for Hermes' Winged Helmet—\"I Must Deliver the Truth to Anyone Who Needs To Hear It\"pushes Percy to take on that role as a mystic messenger if he wants to keep the helmet's powers. But my favourite are Itches, the motivations of Noise themes. These ask \"What is it your tech makes you want to do?\", as Moshe puts it—which couldn't feel more relevant a question for all of us in 2025... It gives the game's tech an inherently insidious quality that makes it feel oddly alive, like it's always tugging at you to do more of the thing it makes you good at. So, of course, Percy's Gamified Reality Overlay has the Itch\"Keep the Numbers Climbing\"—you'd probably lose track of this man for a week if he ever discovered Cookie Clicker. There are also unlockable tags for each theme to earn as you play, building out the character. Finally, there are just a few last bits to sort out. For one, you have to pick some gear—tags you can swap in and out for each mission, representing your weapons and gadgets. And of course you need a name. Now, while Percy had stuck as my character's civilian name, it's not exactly a cool cyberpunk code name for when he's out on missions. In the end, I thoughtBylinewas a fitting moniker—one last indulgence for the journalist in me. And becauseByline is available as a pregenerated characterfor you to play yourself in :Otherscape, I went a little further—the sheet also includes handy extras such as example actions he might want to do and which tags apply to them, whether you're trying toHack a Broadcastor justWork All Night. There are also unlockable tags for each theme to earn as you play, building out the character—and a special move you can get for each too. What I can't take credit for is the gorgeous visuals of the sheet—Son of Oak very kindly handled all that, and worked withIsago Fukuda of Isa Artworkswho created that excellent portrait inspired by PC Gamer's own signature colours. Bit more stylish than my usual scrappy character sheet written out in illegible handwriting. Even if you're not jumping into a campaign just yet, it's well worth taking a look—each :Otherscape pregen also includes a streamlined version of the core rules, so just by reading half a page you can get a great sense of how the game plays. If that's piqued your interest in :Otherscape, take a look atthe new Kickstarter, which is crowdfunding right now, orSon of Oak's info page for the game. You can also try it for free with the Kickstarter'snew demo kit. Just promise me you'll bring Byline along with you on your next mission, yeah?

The game has suffered a minor delay and is now set to arrive three weeks later, on June 10. \"Dune: Awakening is a beast of a game,\" Funcom wrote. \"This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we’re making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing.\" The delay comes amidst an ongoing \"persistent closed beta,\" which Funcom said has been providing \"invaluable\" feedback from testers over the weeks leading up to the game—and drove the decision to delay it a few weeks. \"We have a very active Discord going with our beta testers where our developers can interact directly with them to ensure we collaboratively make Dune: Awakening a better game,\" Funcom wrote. \"Thanks to this process, we’ve concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers.\" The postponement to June 10 means the five-day \"head start\" period offered in the deluxe and ultimate editions set for June 5. On the upside, Funcom said the June release will enable it to hold a \"large-scale beta weekend\" sometime in May, offering even more players the opportunity to check it out ahead of release.

    "title": "'This is it. Our final major game patch for Baldur’s Gate 3': The colossal Patch 8 is finally here, marking the end of (non-bug fix) updates for Larian's triumphant RPG",
    "article_text": "I'm getting all misty-eyed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, folks, we're finally here—at the end of a long and weary campaign. Baldur's Gate 3 has received its last major patch (apart from bug fixes and stuff), and it's the doozy to end all doozies. It really is also the last big update this time, so I hopefully won't have to endurefurther finger-waggles from Larian. \"This is it. Our final major game patch for Baldur’s Gate 3,\" read the introductorypatch notes. \"You’ve helped us make BG3 a bigger success than any of us could’ve ever hoped for, and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time. But then we’d never be able to create something new.\" The update, which you can download now, is utterly chocka with new features. Cross-play, for one, allows us to join our console and mac brethren using something called the \"Larian Network\"—you can even use mods, provided everyone has compatible ones installed. Photo mode is also stupidly exciting—it can be accessed by hitting F9 or clicking the icon on the mini map. If you're playing BG3 with a controller like some sort of heathen, you can also click both control sticks in on your pad. The only real limitation is that you can't change your party's position or camera angle during cutscenes, though you can still throw some filters on there if you want to make Astarion look #slay while he's going through some emotional turmoil. The mode'll come packed with over 300 stickers, which seems like alot.Also, modders'll be able to add some, and I shudder to think of the dark and grim pandoras box that Larian has just unlocked. The real gameplay meat and potatoes, however, are the 12 new subclasses which, in case you need a reminder, are the: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There are somesupremely powerful multiclassoptions here. Special mention goes out to the Hexblade Warlock, with a one-level dip that's pretty much a no-brainer on almost every single Charisma-based class that might want to hit something with a sword or wield a shield at some point. With new subclasses come some vitally important spells, too, such as the long-awaited blade cantrips: Gishes rejoice,the age of Booming Bladeis finally here. There's another pleasant surprise also coming to Baldur's Gate 3 in the form of \"partial level editing\" for modders. Level editing is something that's already been jailbroken, withnew tech being discovered every day, but this official support to add little gubbins into the world of the Forgotten Realms should make doing so a lot easier for folks. As Larian explains: \"Whether you fancy creating your own NPC, dropping a metric ton of carrots across every existing level just for the sake of it, pledging your undying love to Shadowheart by turning all wolves into bunny rabbits or by moving them to the House of Hope, you’ll now be able to use the Toolkit to add or override certain template types in existing levels. \"Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain. You can, however, create your own interactive objects like a chest that teleports away every time you get close to it—no one will touch your belongings ever again! Including you. Or you could make a salami statue that you can put in your pocket. The world truly is yours.\" Larian has also worked with themodder Dmjron some improvements to UI-dependent mods: \"While the ImpUI mod isn’t currently being maintained, to help keep things running smoothly and to support the creative passion of those in the modding community, we’ve introduced minor changes to how some functionalities are handled in the Toolkit. Now, mod authors will be able to make changes directly for mods that rely on UI tweaks during Character Creation.\" And, naturally, there's gameplay and bug fixes. Reams and reams of them. Yesterday, I wondered whether the 48 pages of notes would be the biggest patch in terms of raw wordage, a title that was previously bequeathed to Patch 3 at 23,576 words. Patch 8 doesn't compete, but it is stillmighty,with 16,753 words to its name. A little ways off my guestimate of 19,000-20,000 words—but not by much. As such, there's far too much for me to post here. Instead, I'll share my highlights in no particular order of importance: All in all, Patch 8 is a very, very good excuse to boot up Baldur's Gate 3 again—now if you'll excuse me, I need to go and smite my way across the Forgotten Realms with myfreshly-made Sorcadin.

The X2 is an outstandingly beautiful chassis, wrapped in a combination of glass, steel, and brushed finishes. It's affordable too, quite tall, and with some impressive design features packed into it that really set it apart from the crowd. Yet, it's not perfect; cable management could use some work, and the cooling setup is incredibly limited and potentially stifling if built incorrectly. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. It's quite stunning how the case market has shifted in the last few years. With so many good chassis out there to choose from, it's an incredibly difficult arena to break into. It's not enough anymore to just update a black rectangular box with some RGB lighting, a few design tweaks and call it a day. You need something bold. Something audacious. Product lines that once were community icons, PC building staples, have had to be rebuilt from the ground up to even stand a chance. That's something Phanteks has clearly taken to heart here with the Evolv X2. With thick aluminum panels, a chunky mid-tower design, strong cooling support, and a real premium feel, the Evolv line has long been a cornerstone of Phanteks' arsenal. It didn't matter whether it was the original from way back in 2015, the TG, or theX; its shape and design were remarkably consistent generation on generation. In many ways incredibly similar to what Corsair has done with its 4000 series or NZXT has with itsH7 Flowline. There was a familiarity to it for the longest time, and until the Evolv X2 rocked up, it felt like that was always going to be the case. But, oh boy, does this thing radically reimagine the feel of its namesake. Long gone are those drive bays and hidden USB panels, sheets of thick aluminum, and angry, jutting, angular edges. And instead, we're graced with this. Glass. Everywhere. There's been a complete shift in the overall styling, of course inspired by the fishbowl trend currently gripping the community, with the likes ofLian Li's O11 Vision Compactand others following in Hyte's footsteps. The cooling solution has also radically changed. Not only has Phanteks ditched the traditional front and side intakes entirely, opting for an absolute chimney design (with intakes in the floor and exhausts in the roof), but there's radically deep radiator support here too, capable of supporting even the thickest of AIOs. It's remarkably different from anything that's come before it and a bold decision to make.

Pricing is a little all over the place at the moment, dependent on where you're picking this thing up. On the UK side, we're talking about a relatively affordable£134. However, jump over the pond to the US, and it's currently sitting pretty at$180, not including shipping (which seems to be a flat fee of $30 on top, no matter where you buy, potentially a slight tariff-dodging tactic), although do be aware, stock is limited right now, and the next batch may potentially be hit with some sort of a tariff hike anyway. On first inspection there's a lot to like here, even ignoring the wild and radical design Phanteks has leaned into. Yes, you do get three-sided glass panels and that monolithic stance that really sets it apart from its competition, but there's more to it than that. A quick glance inside and you'll notice a full-sized motherboard tray door to hide your unsightly cable management. There are intuitive Velcro straps lining the rear of the case, allowing you to easily tie everything down where you need to. It also has motherboard back connector support if you're running one of those newfangled \"cable-less\" board setups, and there's subtle integrated RGB lighting as well, all controlled via the motherboard headers. There's no fan controller or anything along those lines, and the material quality is generally very good. It's mostly steel, glass, and plastic (stylized to look like brushed aluminum), but the overall feel of the thing is top-tier. Cooling support is in a lot of ways quite antithetical. You've got that chimney-esque design, really leaning on convection and taking advantage of that, with your three intake fans situated above that PSU cover, plus the three in the roof as well acting as exhaust, and the additional 120 mm in the rear. The radiator bracket on top is relatively seamless to install and gives you this really clean look with all of your fans and radiators perfectly hidden by the paneling. Plus there's a huge base and rise on the Evolv X2 as well, meaning even chucking this thing on a carpet, it's going to have consistent access to cool air. Yet it's remarkably limited in what you can do with that cooling and entirely stipulated around a 360 mm AIO. For example, it's got support for seven fans, but they all have to be 120 mm. You've got a really deep radiator and AIO cavity, but there's only really support for a single 360 mm rad in the roof. There's no fan controller by design, and those three intakes, despite leveraging the potency of convection, still have to pull air through a PSU shroud that'll no doubt have an arsenal of cables stuck down there, plus your power supply and potentially hard drives as well. It's an impressive design and a beautiful concept, but it just needs a little bit more refinement and logic applied to it. Having the case slightly wider and slightly longer would potentially have allowed Phanteks to fit three 140 mm fans in the floor or offset those 120 mm intakes to the side so they have better access to cool air. Include a plastic bracket there too, and bam, you've got support for both 120 and 140 mm variants. Test platform CPU:Intel Core Ultra 7 265K |RAM:32 GB (2x16 GB) Corsair Dominator Titanium DDR5 @ 7200 C34 |SSD:4TB Samsung 9100 Pro M.2 PCIe 5.0 SSD |GPU:Nvidia GeForceRTX 5080|Motherboard:Asus ROG Maximus Z890 Hero |CPU Cooler:NZXT Kraken Elite 360 RGB |PSU:850W Phanteks Amp GH 80+ Gold Moving onto cable management, and well, I broke the case on my first build, notably with that motherboard tray door. Ham-fisted perhaps, but it's secured only by a small plastic tab or clip situated in the middle of the chassis right near the cable run for the 24-pin. Even with my best attempt at cable management, trying to shut the door fully wasn't possible, and the plastic clip eventually snapped off entirely. There's no other method of securing that metal door either, no magnets or anything of that ilk, so I had to push it in, then attach the glass panel, securing it in place with that instead. Cable management is generally quite tight back there; there's not a huge amount of depth to it, and there's limited support when it comes to the CPU power runs too. ✅ You want a beautiful hardware showcase:An outstanding design that sets it apart from the crowd. Chuck one of Phanteks angled GPU brackets in here, and the X2 looks beyond phenomenal. ❌ You want a more expansive cooling setup:Cooling is on the right path, but potentially obstructed airflow, and limited setup configurations means this is better suited to AIOs, and a dominant positive air pressure build. Despite its flaws, this is one of the most beautiful cases I've ever had the pleasure of working in. I paired it with one of Phanteks Premium Vertical PCIe 4.0 Brackets, complete with RGB that allows you to tilt the GPU by up to 30 degrees (it's not cheap, an additional extra at £85 / $110), but it just really completes the look. If I were building in it again, I'd opt for an AIO that lacked a breakout cable in the radiator itself and install a reverse blade 120 mm fan in that rear acting as an intake, just for peace of mind. To be clear, the Evolv X2 is an absolute oddity. On the surface it looks remarkable. Complete a build in it, and you'll have this megalomaniacal monolith of a system. It just looks otherworldly. It stands out from the crowd in an incredible way, but it's not without its flaws. That cooling needs to be taken into consideration; you need to think heavily about your cable management and how you best take advantage of it, be willing to invest extra in brackets and fans, and be prepared to adjust your expectations on what reasonable temperatures should be for your system. If you can do that and can get by with that mild \"form-over-function\" vibe, then the X2 is an outstanding PC case and one you'll be overjoyed with for many years to come. Now excuse me while I go transfer my system into it. The X2 is an outstandingly beautiful chassis, wrapped in a combination of glass, steel, and brushed finishes. It's affordable too, quite tall, and with some impressive design features packed into it that really set it apart from the crowd. Yet, it's not perfect; cable management could use some work, and the cooling setup is incredibly limited and potentially stifling if built incorrectly.

    "title": "How to use the brick press in Schedule 1",
    "article_text": "Squish your products into convenient chunks. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Making heaps of product inSchedule 1is only half the battle–you'll also need to sell it, which generally means stocking up your dealers. The problem is that their inventories are incredibly small, only able to carry five different items at once. Using thebrick presslets you bypass this limit somewhat, squashing stacks of drugs down to make your dealers more efficient. The brick press is similar to the jar, which also lets you stack items into a single item slot. Bricks are much better than jars, though it's not immediately obvious how you actually use the brick press. If you're relying on jars and hoping for an upgrade, you'll unlock the brick press when you reach Bagman V, though this will take you quite a while—around 15 hours for me, and I've been progressing quickly. Once you've unlocked the brick press, you can buy it from Oscar in the warehouse for $800 in cash. This is a guide for Schedule 1, a satirical videogame about the drug trade, and does not contain any real information about illicit drugs. Do not try anything in this guide. (Except in the videogame Schedule 1, then it's fine.) The brick presstakes unpackaged drugs and turns them into bricks, so you don't need to use bags to package your product at a packing station anymore. This is especially important if you're using handlers to package your goods, as you'll need to assign them to a press instead of a packaging station for them to use it. This press can turn up to 20 of the same drug (in other words, a standard full stack) and press it into a single brick, which also stacks to 20. That means you can nowsqueeze 400 of the same drug into one inventory space instead of 20 bags. It's a massive improvement and you won't need to restock your dealers quite so often. As you'd imagine, it's also good for storage. To use the brick press, place it in your building and do the following: It's pretty quick to sort out yourself, but it's still an unnecessary job to have on your plate once your operation has grown. I recommend assigning a handler to make bricks for you. Using themanagement clipboard, simply assign a handler to a brick press, and they'll press the product for you. Just remember to set the mixers' output to head to the press instead of the packaging stations, like you'll be used to so far. You could even use a handler to move the product directly from the mixer to the press if you're pushing for more automation.

    "title": "All drones in REPO and what they do",
    "article_text": "Your guide to every drone available in the game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. REPOhas a bounty of items for you to get acquainted with, anddronesare one of the many tools designed to make your extractions slightly easier to manage. They can be pretty expensive items to purchase, especially early on in the game, but are well worth the money once you know how to use them correctly. There are five different types of drones currently available in REPO. For the most part, they can be attached to items to make things lighter and easier to carry, but there are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, the Roll Drone will make anything it's attached to easier to roll, which is particularly helpful when it comes to evading larger enemies. You never know what quirks REPO will pack into its tools, either, so here's what you need to know about drones in particular. Drones can bebought from the shop you visit between levels in REPO. What stock the shop will have is completely random each time, though. So if you're looking for a particular drone, there's only a slim chance it'll crop up. It'll be the drive you need to go through the next level and make it out alive, at least. Each drone differs in price too, depending on how useful it will be in your run. Each drone has its own unique feature in REPO. You'll want to know the ins and outs of each before you spend any money on one. To make your life easier, and to save you from splashing the cash on a drone that won't be of much use to you just to test it, I've broken everything down into the table below so you can easily see what each drone does, alongside how much they cost. Drone name Price What it does Feather Drone $15k $18k Attaches to items and makes them lighter, so you don't need strength upgrades to pick them up. Recharge Drone $4k Charges your items without needing to revisit the truck and use energy crystals. Roll Drone $9k - $11k Makes whatever it attaches to easy to roll, including enemies and items. Zero Gravity Drone $25k Reduces the gravity of whatever it's attached to, including the player. Indestructible Drone $24k - $30k Exactly what it sounds like. Makes any item it's attached to absolutely indestructible. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on players though. Having tools on hand which are designed to make objects lighter and easier to carry will save you a lot of money in the long run, especially with each strength upgrade costing around $16k. I'd advise spending the money on the feather drone before any other items or weapons since it's beneficial for every member of the team, or even more so if you're playing on your own. As is the way with any item, if everymember of your teamdies in a level, you won't get it back and you'll have to save up for a replacement. If you drop it during a round but make it out alive, the drone will respawn in the van at the next level at least.

    "title": "The Oblivion remaster is real: Doubters in shambles as developer Virtuos accidentally leaves the door open to trailer screenshots and assets",
    "article_text": "I have seen the gates of Oblivion, beyond which no waking eye may see. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, I'll be. Usually when big, conspiracy-level fusses around something as obviously bait-y as 'there's an Oblivion remaster in the works' are doing the rounds, my first response is to doubt. I have been proven well and truly wrong, and will henceforth be wearing a tinfoil clown wig for my foolishness. Therumoured Oblivion remasteris very much real. As spied by an eagle-eyed frequenter of ther/gamingleaksandrumours subreddit,Virtuos Games, a studio that co-develops with a wide variety of studios—for example, it worked on theBeyond Good & Evil remasterwithUbisoft—left the door open and swinging in the wind to theuploads sectionof its website. As I started writing this article, access became forbidden, but not before a swarm of eager gamers took an hour or so to plunder its depths and pull out heaps of screenshots. It's a veritable dragon's hoard of information: Trailer screenshots, covers, a deluxe edition, graphics comparisons. I want to emphasise in sharing these that I'm not passing on the ill-gotten gains of some internet hackers; these were simply available by looking at the content page of Virtuos' site. The cat isn't just out of the bag, it's clawed through the bag and is now doing zoomies around the living room and peeing on the upholstery. This marks the final end to a theory of leaks thatstarted in 2023when The Verge shared a four-year release schedule from Bethesda. Not every leak in that presentation came to fruition, mind—a sequel to Dishonoured with a release date for 2024 didn't arrive, for example. The rumour mill recently began to kick up again, primarily through whispers and hearsay from proclaimed industry insiders. As PC Gamer's ownJoshua Wolenswrote: \"We've got baseless confidence that the remaster is coming, baseless confidence that it isn't, fear, madness, obsessive augur-reading, a complete descent into conspiratorial thinking, and this guy who says it was actually released yesterday.\" But this is about as legit of a confirmation as you can reasonably get—a trusted videogame developer's website, with a bunch of assets, accidentally posted online through a publicly-accessible image directory for long enough that absolutely no-one can argue with the truth.

    "title": "Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 announced, starting from $299: 'We can work with our partners to get these out at reasonable prices, which we are doing'",
    "article_text": "Here's hoping Nvidia's new entry-level GPUs can stick to MSRP. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you've been staring po-faced at overpriced graphics cards on the internet all year and now wondering when you might be able to upgrade your ageing GTX card, here's your first opportunity of the year. Nvidia has just announced the RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060, starting from $299. Emphasis on \"starting\" there, for a few reasons. The RTX 5060 will launch with an MSRP at $299. Then there's the RTX 5060 Ti with 8 GB of VRAM at $379 (£349), and above that the RTX 5060 Ti with 16 GB of VRAM at $429(£399). If you're not au fait with the original RTX 40-series pricing, the RTX 4060 was $299 at launch, theRTX 4060 Ti 8 GBwas $399, and the RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB was pointless. I mean, $499. So, generally, the new RTX 50-series looks a better deal that the last lot. Though there is another dynamic at play, and that's whether we'll see any of the above pricing actually come to fruition on launch day. Or thereafter. The positive spin is that, in the UK anyways, there are some RTX 50-series cards already available at MSRP, or in one rare case, less than MSRP. The negative spin is this is not the case in the US right now. Right now, US tariffs exclude computer parts and semiconductors, but on that question specifically, Nvidia said: \"'These [prices] are not going to be inclusive of tariffs, there's not much we can do about that.\" But what it can do is talk to its graphics card partners about the prices they're charging. \"We can work with our partners to get these out at reasonable prices, which we are doing,\" says Nvidia. Though how much impact that will have is going to be something that will only come to light when the cards are launched. The RTX 5060 Ti, in both 16 GB and 8 GB, is set to launch April 16 (yep, tomorrow). The RTX 5060 won't show up until next month. There's no exact date for that launch yet, which I presume is intended to offer Nvidia some leeway in case AMD tries to spoil the party with itsentry-level RX 9060-series cards, which are on their way sometime before June is up. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's also no Founders Edition for either card, which leaves it up to board partners to decide the prices. So, here are the specifications. Or should I say specification? Nvidia has only released info on the RTX 5060 Ti, which lands with us first, but the whole entry-level line-up uses the same GPU, codename GB206, powered by theBlackwellRTX architecture. Compared to the RTX 4060 Ti, there's been a small increase across the GPU on the RTX 5060 Ti. Two more Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) amount to a few more CUDA cores at 4608, two more RT cores, and eight more Tensor cores. Otherwise, the largest improvements come from the improvements baked into the Blackwell architecture and the faster GDDR7 memory on-board. That memory will make a difference. At 28 Gbps, this GDDR7 is a lot faster than the GDDR6 found on entry-level RTX 40-series cards. As such, the memory bandwidth on the RTX 5060 Ti is 55% higher than the RTX 4060 Ti at 448 GB/s. There's also your choice of 16 GB or 8 GB of it, as I previously mentioned. Nvidia says it made the decision to stick with 8 GB on two of three of the cards to \"optimised for price and performance\". \"Could you put more memory on this? Sure, but what does it get you?\" says Nvidia GeForce product manager Justin Walker of the decision. RTX 5060 Ti RTX 5060 (*unconfirmed) GPU GB206 GB206 TFLOPs 24 19 CUDA cores 4608 *3840 SMs 36 *30 RT cores (4th Gen) 36 *30 Tensor cores (5th Gen) 144 *120 Memory 16 GB / 8 GB GDDR7 8 GB GDDR7 Memory bus 128-bit 128-bit Memory speed 28 Gbps *28 Gbps Price $429 (16 GB) / $379 (8 GB) $299 Release date April 16 May Since we've got the rough TFLOPs for the RTX 5060 and the rest of the info for the RTX 5060 Ti, it's not too difficult to work out where the RTX 5060 lies either. I've thrown those figures in, too, though note they're notofficiallyofficial. We do have some performance figures to go off for both cards at least. As you might expect, Nvidia rolled out Multi Frame Generation, its latest frame increasing feature, for most of its own figures. We'll have more to share of our own soon, but in the meantime, here's what Nvidia says. I was told we can expect around a 20% improvement in regular rasterised gameplay from the RTX 5060 Ti and around 20 to 25% with the RTX 5060. Check the slides for game-by-game figures with Multi Frame Generation enabled, largely in 4X mode (which is an RTX 50-series/DLSS 4 exclusive feature), which obviously bumps those numbers up a lot compared to older cards. That's what Nvidia says it's targeting with this launch, too: older cards, maybe even of a 'GTX' variety. It's hoping that it might sway some GTX 10-series or 16-series users to buying these cards, which is certainly possible, providing the price is right and you can actually buy one. If past RTX 50-series launches are anything to go on, it might take a while for these cards to really hit the market at their intended prices. Who can say when that'll happen, but these cards are intended to sell at volume to a large number of people, which presumably means Nvidia will be shipping absolutely tons of them.

That's according to Gaider himself, who is currently going off onBlueskyabout his long career arc that took him from joining BioWare in 1999 to co-founding his own studio, Summerfall, in 2017. Between those two things, Gaider was enlisted by Beamdog founder Trent Oster to serve as creative director at the studio, which you probably know for its enhanced editions of the original Baldur's Gate games and Planescape: Torment. \"[Oster] told me Beamdog was starting to do their own projects,\" said Gaider. \"They were finishing Siege of Dragonspear, an expansion for BG1, but more importantly they were also up to something else: a sequel to Planescape: Torment, for which they had [PS:T lead designer] Chris Avellone on board as a consultant. Now THAT caught my interest.\" The original Torment was set in (surprise!) Planescape, a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons that chucked out the familiar Tolkienian fantasy stuff you got in BG1 and 2 in favour of dimension-hopping, trope-defying weirdness. Attracted by the potential to \"break all the 'standard' rules of CRPGs,\" Gaider signed up. Gaider and his team \"put together a plan for what ended up being called Planescape: Unraveled, where you played as one of three aspects of Ravel Puzzlewell racing against time to solve the mystery of your own existence.\" Which sounds like it could have been pretty damn cool, if you ask me. Ravel Puzzlewell was a key figure in the original Planescape: Torment—she's the incredibly powerful witch who originally stripped the game's protagonist of his mortality, and ended up confined to an interplanar prison by the enigmaticLady of Painfor, uh, attempting to free the Lady of Pain. It's a weird setting. Gaider was hot to trot. \"It was sharp, it had great NPC's, WotC was so excited about it they were willing to move up their plans for 3rd edition Planescape and include some of the characters and seismic events from the game in the setting reboot.\" All the stars seemed to have aligned to get a Planescape sequel onto store shelves. And then, well, money. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"The problem? Funding. WotC wasn't in a place to do more than give a stamp of approval, and the publishers we met... well, Trent knows more than I do, but I think there was a perception that Planescape wasn't very successful or commercial. Or maybe they just didn't have confidence in Beamdog, or me.\" Beamdog never found a publisher willing to put money where Gaider's mouth was, so \"by the end of 2016, we had to put Planescape: Unraveled on the shelf and start something new.\" That new thing was an \"Old West exorcist game\" that Gaider had tried to get off the ground back at BioWare. Alas, that one didn't entice publishers either, and it wasn't long before it too ended up shelved and Gaider departed Beamdog for new pastures. It's a real shame, because the notion of playing as Ravel is an interesting one, but maybe it's not too surprising. The full list of videogames set specifically in D&D's Planescape setting consists of Torment and… no, actually that's it. The closest we ever got to a sequel to the game, in spite of its enduring popularity and acclaim, was inXile's Torment: Tides of Numenera, which jettisoned D&D entirely in favour of Monte Cook's Numenera tabletop setting. Giventhatgame is now self-published (after being originally published by Techland), I think it's fair to say that 'cerebral, narrative-heavy RPG that's mostly text' is just a tough one to get publishers excited about, even when they're direct sequels to one of the best games of all time. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

    "title": "How to prepare for the Wonderland Whimsy update in Disney Dreamlight Valley",
    "article_text": "Get ready for something curious. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even thoughDisney Dreamlight Valleyis a fairly relaxed game, there's always something more to prepare for the launch of a big update.Wonderland Whimsy is the nextto join the pack, and before it releases on April 23, there are some things you should consider doing so you have a head start in Wonderland.There's nothingyou needto doin order to unlock this update, just to clarify. Your game should immediately update itself on April 23, and these tips are just things I'll be doing ahead of time to make the process of unlocking Alice and the Cheshire Cat a little easier. Here's how you can prepare for the update too. As we know, this update unlocks the Alice in Wonderland realm in the Dream Castle, so you'll need to get some Dreamlight together to be able to open this door. We don't know how much this will cost, but the Aladdin realm from the Tales of Agrabah update set us back a whopping 15,000 Dreamlight, so I imagine unlocking Wonderland will be in the same ballpark. The best way to quickly gather Dreamlight is by completing your Dreamlight Duties. These change every day, and you'll have an endless number of them to complete while you play. Each duty can reward anything from 50 to 500 Dreamlight, so as long as you're frequently hitting them, you should be able to stock up relatively fast. Converting Dream Shards is also a good way of getting a quick boost, but you need 10 shards to get 250 Dreamlight so it can be a lengthy process. I'd advise prioritizing Dreamlight Duties over this. Each villager comes with their own house, so I can't imagine Alice and the Cheshire Cat will be an exception to this rule. If you've got an area in mind for where you want to place their homes, it's worth clearing that now so you don't have to worry about it as you're tasked with placing them later down the line. We know the Cheshire Cat's house will be his signature signposted tree, so you might want to pick up any items lying around the Forest of Valor or Glade of Trust. As for Alice, we don't know what her home will look like yet, but I imagine it'll suit the vibe of these biomes too. With the addition of floating islands now, there's more space than ever to work with and decorate. The Garden of Whimsy Star Path which is also part of this update will provide plenty of opportunity to get ahold of some Wonderland-themed furniture, so if you're feeling particularly creative you could always turn one of these floating islands into your own little Wonderland. Even though we don't know the full details of what Alice and the Cheshire Cat's friendship quests will entail, I feel like the tea party idea will be utilised wherever possible. After all, when Disney Dreamlight Valley has an opportunity to get you to create some quest-specific recipes, it'll jump at the chance. I'd suggest saving up your Star Coins for the expensive ingredients in Remy's Restaurant like milk, cheese, and eggs, alongside making sure you've got a decent stash of crops at the ready. Things like wheat and rice are good to grow in advance, alongside foraging whatever herbs and spices you can from around the valley. Crops that take a lot longer to grow, such as pumpkins, okra, and onions are worth planting as soon as possible too. There's no guarantee you'll need them, but it saves the stress of having to wait around when you're in the middle of the quest.

    "title": "A Minecraft Movie makes $550 million globally with no signs of slowing down, putting it inches behind dethroning Mario from his box office kingdom",
    "article_text": "Money on my mine 'n' craftin' mind. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The movie \"A Minecraft Movie\" (the movie specifically for Minecraft) has continued to haul in some absurd cash—hitting $150 million in its first opening weekend, and inspiring a wave ofproblematic popcorn-hurling behaviouras it takes the box office by storm. It's shown no signs of slowing down—itsworldwide haulis now at $552 million, putting it on pace to, potentially, dethrone the 2023 Super Mario Bros movie as the highest-earning videogame adaptation of all time. It's a little hard to get the week-by-week play-by-play for worldwide ticket sales, since different countries report their returns at different times. However, if we go off domestic cash? A Minecraft Movie is certainly in with a chance of beating everyone's favourite plumber. After 10 days at the Box Office, The Super Mario Bros Movie had raked in $283,480,285 at the domestic box office. Meanwhile, A Minecraft Movie is breathing down its neck, with $278,864,857 earned in the US. Whether or not A Minecraft Movie will keep enough momentum to overtake Super Mario Bros is another question entirely: Here's the daily domestic play-by-play courtesy ofboxofficemojo.com. As you can see, A Minecraft Movie had a sharper domestic falloff during weekdays, whereas the Super Mario Bros movie was still pulling numbers throughout. Mario also had the advantage of his cinematic debut falling on Easter Sunday, whereas Minecraft won't enjoy that box office boom until this weekend. Part of me wonders if that's due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The US wouldn't declare an end to it until May 2023, but restrictions were still winding down at that point. In theory, that means the Super Mario Bros. benefitted from a bigger pool of theatre-goers caught in the venn diagram of 'I've got time to kill, because I'm either unemployed or furloughed' and restrictions that were already winding down. It really is going to be a fascinating race. It's easy to forget that, in the face of Minecraft's worldwide presence (and the movie's made-in-a-lab marketability), this is still a game that started out as a little indie survival number. I remember an age when it was still spreading through word-of-mouth with popular youtubers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Be Quiet's created the quietest mechanical gaming keyboards I've ever used, offering the striking benefit of not annoying everyone in a five meter radius",
    "article_text": "The hardware team agrees these quiet keebs are worth shouting about. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A lot of us love a mechanical keyboard that offers a good, cacophonous clack—but a lot of us share either office or living space with those who do not share our enthusiasm for typing that sounds like a drum roll. That in mind, it's heartening then that purveyor of slightly less percussive hardware, Be Quiet!, is turning its attention to peripherals. Among Be Quiet's initial foray into peripherals is not one, buttwofull-size keyboards, called Light Mount and Dark Mount. These are joined by a lightweight esports mouse called Dark Perk, which itself is available with either a symmetrical or ergonomic shape. I got to grips with each bit of kit at an announcement event in Hamburg earlier this year—and trust me, there's more to say beyond how well the keyboards' naming convention lends itself to a particularly overplayed Always Sunny reference. Both Light Mount (uh-ah-AH!), and Dark Mount gaming keyboards not only utilise three sound dampening layers, but also deploy Be Quiet's very own whispery mechanical switches. Having scooped up a number of the demo products to test them in a quiet-ish corner of the event space myself, I can say these mechanical keyboards offer a much more understated clack—even the space bar is downright subtle. Be Quiet's switches and stabilizers are both factory-lubricated, aiming to minimise key wobble even for the most percussive email exchange. These switches are available in two flavours—linear (orange) or tactile (black)—though these aren't your only option; both the Light Mount and Dark Mount keyboards are hot-swappable with similar 5-pin MX style switches. The hardware team are no strangers to these stewards of silence; most recently, our Jacob spoke highly of theShadow Base 800 FX PC case in his review, while Antony was positive about both theLight Loop 360 MM liquid coolerandDark Rock 5 air cooler. Be Quiet's move into peripherals has been a long time coming—at least sincetheir parent company, Listan Group, scooped up Mountain back in 2022. As a result, the Light Mount and Dark Mount do come with a vague sense of keeb fiend deja vu, though mercifully these boards are unburdened by Mountain's Base Camp software. Instead, to get all of your key actuations and lighting profiles just how you like them, you're looking at a new program called IO Center. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. However, rather than saddling you with yet another peripheral-specific download, IO Center offers the option of a web-based app. Corsair recently made a similar move with itsfirmware updater website. In Be Quiet's case, the web-based version of IO Center is pitched as a solution for folks wanting to add a bit of RGB-flair to their otherwise tightly controlled corporate desktop setup, but I'm sure my rig would thank me if it could for one less program haranguing it at start-up. Once you're aware of the Mountain connection, it's hard to look past the summit. For instance, the Dark Mount keyboard offers an intriguing modular design decidedly reminiscent of theMountain Everest Max gaming keyboard. While both of Be Quiet's wireless gaming keyboards come with media controls and a full-size number pad, the Dark Mount offers hot-swappable placement; you can attach the number pad to either the left or right side of the keeb, attach the media dock along the keyboard's top edge, or detach both for a more compact form factor. In this TKL form, it's hard not to be reminded of theMountain Everest 60 gaming keyboard. The Dark Mount will debut April 17 at $255/£240/€260, while the Light Mount will release the same day for $170/£170/€170. Though not modular, the Light Mount is still a snazzy wireless gaming keyboard with per-key ARGB lighting. This mechanical keyboard also has light strips along its top and sides for an underglow effect that make me feel like I'm a confused hacker drifting out of a forgotten Fast and Furious spin-off. Don't worry, I wasn't going to let the mouse squeak by. Weighing 55g, the Dark Perk wireless gaming mouse is exceptionally lightweight and glides gracefully over mouse mats. It's so airy that it even feels a little suspect in the hand, but I've been assured it's packing some heavy duty capabilities under the hood. This includes an up to 8,000 Hz polling rate, and the PixArt PAW3950 sensor, which offers up to 32,000 DPI. On top of that, it's also got optical Omron switches for whispery but responsive clicks. With a MSRP of $140/£130/€130, you'll have to wait a little longer to get your mitts on Be Quiet's mouse, as it's set for a May release date.

    "article_text": "It's like fight club but with chickens and popcorn. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A Minecraft Moviehas been plagued by the chicken jockey trend ever since the film entered cinemas. It sees movie-goers erupt in chaotic celebrations as soon as they hear Jack Black utter the sacred words \"chicken jockey\" towards the end of the movie. The trend has garnered some conflicting viewpoints, as some people think it's disrespectful, while others, likethe director Jared Hess, seem to love it, and now we have Black himself joining in. Jack Black randomly turned up at A Minecraft Movieviewing, and as he was walking in, he started to lay out the rules for this showing: \"For today's presentation of A Minecraft Movie, please, no throwing popcorn, and also no lapis lazuli, and also absolutely no chicken jockeys!\" Cuerabid screaming and perhaps the best reaction to someone unexpectedly seeing Jack Black in the wild—one kid who just screeched \"NO!\" Minecraft update: What's new?Minecraft potions: Recipes and brewing guideMinecraft enchantments: Magical reference listMinecraft villagers: All the jobs and tradesMinecraft realms: How to start your own server Black then proceeded to hold up an iron pickaxe and ask, \"Are you ready to rock?\" and then run around the cinema holding the pickaxe over his head as crowds of teenagers collectively lost their minds, with one kid screaming, \"No! Come Back!\" as Black frolicked out of the cinema. Some people seem to think that Black was trying to stop the chicken jockey trend by warding off popcorn throwing and a general freak out, but if that was his goal, I'm not sure he succeeded. I think Black managed to rile up a whole cinema of teenagers who were probably already hyped right before the movie started. While I will say that the chicken jockey trend must suck for anyone who works at a cinema and actually has to clean everything up after the riots, it seems like the party line from the cast and crew is that it's pretty funny. \"It’s weird when you’re having too much fun and the cops get called,” director Jared Hess says in an interview withEntertainment Weekly. “It’s funny because I think it’s just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. Yeah, it’s hilarious. I’ve seen so many funny videos. It’s great, especially when people are climbing on their friends’ shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments.

    "article_text": "The Silver Lake investment firm portfolio companies deliver $252 billion of revenue annually. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel has entered a dealto offload 51% of its stake in Altera, a specialised chipmaker focusing on programmable logic devices, to Silver Lake investment firm. Before it was owned by Intel, Altera and Intel worked together on several projects often using each other's technologies. It wasn't until 2015 when Intel acquired Altera for $16.7 billion. Since then, Altera has been seen as a division of Intel and one that's responsible for FPGA's or field programmable gate arrays with bespoke semiconductor solutions. The trade values Altera at $8.75 billion, which seems like a bit of a step down from that 2015 price. Still, I wouldn't be shaking my head at approximately four billion dollars for half a company, and Intel isn't exactly giving it away. The company is making sure to retain the 49% share so it can continue to have a say in the development of the company. The official statement claims Intel has made the sale to focus more on its core business. We don't yet know exactly what the figures will be for this sale, but it's looking to be one of Silver Lake's bigger investments in recent years. The firm itself is no stranger to pouring money into tech. A few of its more recent investments include tech and software companies, as well as some sports ones. Good to back both the nerds and jocks of the future. Other notable investments include Twitter and AirBnB both scoring $1 billion each back in 2020. The similarity between Silver Lake and Intel's chip naming scheme also appears to be an innocent coincidence. For a second I thought the firm might turn out to be a child company of Intel's, but the two do seem sadly unrelated. Still, Silver feels like a bit of a misnomer given the company boasts over $104 billion in investments which results in a portfolio of companies that turn over $252 billion of revenue annually. I could buy one millionRTX 5090cards at inflated pricies and still have change for that. Imagine how fast I'd becracking malware... The sale comes only a week after Intel announced Raghib Hussain, the former president of Products and Technologies at Marvell, was to replace Sandra Rivera as chief executive officer of Altera. This split of shares will also make Altera the largest technically independent company of its kind. Though time will tell how independent it ends up, and how much control Intel will still want to exercise with its remaining shares.

    "title": "Disney Dreamlight Valley Wonderland Whimsy update: Everything you need to know",
    "article_text": "New content has been announced for Disney Dreamlight Valley. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The anticipated Alice in Wonderland update,Wonderland Whimsy, has finally been announced forDisney Dreamlight Valleyand is rolling out before the end of April. As is the way with these significant Dreamlight Valley updates, this will bring new characters and a realm to unlock alongside numerous other features to look forward to. Although we don't know the full details about our new friends and their realm, such as how much Dreamlight we have to save up to unlock it or what friendship quests we'll have to complete, there's still a lot of information for us to dissect. Here's what you need to know about the newest drop. The Wonderland Whimsy updatewill roll out on April 23. Usually, updates like this don't release at midnight, but instead usuallyaround 9:00 AM EST (2:00 BST). This applies to all platforms, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your chance to visit Wonderland. The major addition the Wonderland Whimsy update is making to Disney Dreamlight Valley is adding the Alice in Wonderland realm to the Dream Castle. This will unlock the ability to invite Alice and the Cheshire Cat to live in your valley, but not before completing some friendship quests first. We don't know the details of these, but the trailer for the update did state that the Cheshire Cat's quests would fall over the \"next few weeks.\" Outside of these characters, we know that the update will add a new Star Path filled with Alice in Wonderland and Disney Fairies themed items, called Garden of Whimsy. These items include things like giant flowers and mushrooms to decorate the valley with, so you'll be able to bring that sense of wonderland to your own valley. As always, a new animal companion matching the theme of the update will be available too, and this time around it's an Absolom butterfly. One of the most interesting additions to the game as part of the Wonderland Whimsy update though is the introduction of the Uncrafting Machine. Going off the update video, it looks like this item will be something either rewarded to you by the Cheshire Cat, or something you'll have to craft for him as part of a quest. This machine takes items you've already crafted, like furniture and decor, and turns them back into their original crafting materials. So, if you've got any items around your valley you no longer need, then this is your best chance to turn them back into something useful. Outside of Wonderland, the update will also feature a handful of quality-of-life updates. These include an improved placement grid for tables and flat surfaces, giving you more space to decorate. In addition, you'll also be able to use Dreamlight to buy more slots for small and medium chests, which is a needed improvement. Storage is always hard to come by in Disney Dreamlight Valley, and you can't litter your valley with various chests and coolers. Having more opportunities to use the chests that you've already made is exciting enough without all the other features of this anticipated update.

I don't know if there's anything better than a person in power mispronouncing a word. Better yet if it's an important word, and if their mispronunciation implies a lack of understanding around the basics of said word. It can get even juicier if you might have some reason to already disrespect this person, so this repeated slip of the tongue offers some justification of your held beliefs. Well, today I give you an especially tasty combination where Trump's Secretary of Education repeatedly calls AI, \"A one\" in this video. The video was shared onBlueSkywhere it gained some popularity, but features watermarks pointing to apolitically charged Instagramthat shares similar content as its origin. It shows a snippet of the United States' Secretary of Education Linda McMahon speech discussing the implementation of technologies in early learning at ASU+GSV Summit in San Diego. We’re doomed.[image or embed] In the video McMahon appears to be trying to spread the good word about the potential uses for AI powered teaching, but almost entirely deflates her argument by repeatedly referring to it as \"A one\" instead. \"Not that long ago we were going to have internet in our schools. Whoop. Okay, now let's see A one and how that can be helpful,\" says McMahon, to the brow furrows of everyone. It's a shame, because as little faith as I have in the former professional wrestling promoter's knowledge of early education or AI, what she's talking about certainly does hold some water. We'd just want to be pretty careful about it. AI's pretty new, even it'sprecursor is barely a teenager. After a lot of training and testing, AI could have excellent uses in school solutions by adapting quickly to the different needs of individual students. It could potentially help to bridge the gap in one-on-one time we currently have with shortages of teachers too. Alternatively, paying teachers and supporting them might help there too, but yeah, AI could genuinely be a force for good in schools. Most current AI's or large language models we're currently familiar with are trained mostly on stolen data and not in any specific ways. They're also prone to bias and just as equally prone to hallucinations, so it'd probably be a terrible idea to have something like ChatGPT or DeepSeek teaching our kids.Hell, they can't even build a decent gaming PC. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. A purpose built, trained, tested, monitored tool to help bolster teachers sounds like a positive AI. To be honest, \"A One\" could even be a good name for it, after all most of the plumbers in my directory seem to think so, and it's unlikely to be any more biassed than our current school systems.

    "title": "Microsoft pulls out of two big data centre deals because it reportedly doesn't want to support more OpenAI training workloads",
    "article_text": "Though still notes it's committed to further $80 billion investment in AI infrastructure, saying: 'We will continue to grow strongly in all regions.' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoft has pulled out of deals to lease its data centres for additional training of OpenAI's language model ChatGPT. This news seems surprising given the perceived popularity of the model, but the field of AI technology is a contentious one, for a lot of good reasons. The combination of high running cost, relatively low returns, and increasing competition—plus working on it's own sickeningAI-made Quake 2 demo—have proven enough reason for Microsoft to bow out of two gigawatt worth of projects across the US and Europe. Sometimes AI can refer to clever machine learning that helps researchers findplastic eating enzymes, orteach robot dogs how to walk using its own nervous system. However, more often than not AI refers topower guzzlinglanguage models and image generators, usually trained on stolen uncredited data to provide shonky results. ChatGPT falls into the latter of these categories, and according toReuters, a large portion of Microsoft's cut down on leasing is due to its decision to not support additional training workloads specifically for its creator, OpenAI. Models such as ChatGPT require huge data centres, usually leased by tech giants like Microsoft, to train and function. Using these data centres doesn't come cheap from both a financial and power perspective, especially with the current boom. Plus, companies could be leasing these centres to other uses that may have greater payoffs. While large language models like ChatGPTcanabsolutely be useful when used correctly, and not overly relied on, there's greater hidden costs the end users don't necessarily see. Microsoft, as well as its investors, have witnessed this relatively slow payoff alongside the rise of competitor models such as China's DeepSeek. Comparatively, DeepSeek is a much more cost effective AI that's garnering more favour, including the attention of formerIntel CEO's faith based tech company. So Microsoft stepping back from leasing its data centres isn't too surprising in the grand scheme of things. In the United States Facebook's Meta has stepped up in leasing its data centres to fill the gap left by Microsoft, and Google's parent company Alphabet has done the same in Europe. Reuters also states Alphabet has committed to a $75 billion spend on its AI buildout this year, which is a 29% hike over Wall Street's expectations. Meta, is set to spend up to $65 billion on AI. All three companies, including Microsoft, have defended AI spending as necessary to keep up with competition from the likes of DeepSeek. Despite pulling out of hosting further data centre training for ChatGPT, Microsoft says its still on track to meet it's own pledged $80 billion investment into AI infrastructure for the year. The company says while it may \"strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions\".

    "title": "How to tumble launch in REPO",
    "article_text": "Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you can't quite afford a weapon between levels inREPO, learninghow to tumble launchis your next best bet. It's your key to quickly avoiding monsters, and if timed right, you can also use this move to cause damage to your enemies. But one wrong move in REPO can result in instant death depending onwhich monster you're facing, so the tumble launch can be a risky move to pull off sometimes. Luckily, as you make your way through each level, you'll be able to get upgrades for your tumble launch which will increase your launch distance and get you out of harm's way even faster. If you're yet to master the art of the tumble launch, here's what you need to do. To tumble launch, you need to berunning, then jump with space and hit Qto tumble. This will shrink your body down and fling your robot self in the direction you're travelling, which is hopefully away from any danger. You'll be able to tumble launch from the very beginning of the game, so youdon't need to save up to unlock anything or get to a specific levelbefore you can start using them to defend yourself. With that said, you'll want tomake sure you've got a fair bit of staminabefore you attempt to tumble launch, so a few upgrades in this department definitely help. If you run out of stamina before you've thrown yourself into the air, the chances are you'll just come crashing back down to the ground. It's best to hide in an area where you can restore your stamina if you're avoiding a monster, like under a table or chair or even in a corner, before attempting to fly past them.Before any tumble launch upgrades, you can still get a fair bit of distance with this move. If you find yourself relying on this mechanic to avoid monsters and want to go further to guarantee your safety, upgrades are well worth investing in. Theseupgrades are available in the shop between levels and cost between $4k and $5k,depending on how far into the game you are. This'll feel like a significant cost early on, but when you consider how expensive both strength upgrades are, sometimes defensive seems like a more sustainable way to play.

    "title": "The new Asus ROG NUC is a mini PC with an Arrow Lake CPU and RTX 5080 laptop GPU, and is going to be very, very, VERY expensive",
    "article_text": "We're expecting at least $3,500 USD for these little babies and googling the potential Aussie price made me cry like one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Being a PC gamer on the cutting edge has never been a particularly cheap hobby, and it doesn't look like it's getting better any time soon. Almost everything is overpriced or understocked, or more likely some wonderful combination of the two. When newGPUs fly off shelves within 5 minutesof being stocked, and Trump tariff's wreaking havoc on the price of tech for new users, it's a tough time out there for the wallets of PC gamers. It's why the new ROG NUC mini gaming PC fromAsushas me disappointed, but by no means surprised by its hefty price tag.VideoCardzspotted the Chinese announcement for the new tiny rig, which gives a base price of 24,399 RMB. A direct conversion to United States Dollars puts that at around $3300, and that's without any additionalTrump tariffs added. I also did the conversion to Australian dollars for my own curiosity but, if you'll excuse me, I will now be crying in the corner. The new and compact ROG NUC 2025 does boast some pretty cool specs to inch towards justifying those prices.We first got a look at these early this year, and it doesn't look like much has changed. Inside the 28 x 19 x 6 cm, three liter case is an Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU, paired with Nvidia'sRTX 5080 laptop GPU. This makes it compatible with Nvidia's AI scaling tool, DLSS4,which can have huge gains for gaming. Memory starts at 16 GB of DDR4, 6400 MHz but can be upgraded to 96 GB, though surely a middleground can be found there. Then you also get the choice between a 1 or 2 TB SSD all packed in a box that weighs just a little over 3.12 kg. There's also a fair few ports on this beastie, including a Thunderbolt 4 Type-C, two DP2.1, two HDMI 2.1, one USB Type-C, and six total USB Type-A ports across the front and back. There's some RGB control and even a little stand to sit it on. I guess, when you've got a PC this thin, it's not quite as stable as the regular sized fellas. These specs make the ROG NUC a really nice gaming laptop. Only it's not, it's a mini PC. At those price points it's a hard sell, because the main thing you're paying for is the tiny size. Most of ourtop gaming laptopssit somewhat cheaper than what you're likely to see this go for, and have the potential to be a fair bit more versatile with little extra bulk. After all, they include a screen and keyboard, too. Similarly, the same money could be allocated to a very capable full-sized gaming rig... as long as you can find the parts you want. We're slated to see ASUS release the ROG NUC 2025 series sometime this month. We're already at the halfway mark so I'd expect to see more on these mini PCs soon. Hopefully there'll be some miracle and these won't come in at the $3,500 price point we've been expecting, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Whether you need a littleWordlehelp, a lot of Wordle help, or just a few quick tips, we've got everything you need right here. Go straight for today's answer if you like the idea of winning in a flash, or take it easy and muddle through, knowing our clue for the April 15 (1396) game is here if you need it. Finding a decent spread of clues wasn't the issue today—the problem was working out what the heck to do with them afterwards. Nothing seemed to fit, no clever idea wanted to work out. Persistence was the only thing that paid off, eventually leading me to Tuesday's winning word. On its own this is a dull light grey colour. If someone's face looks like today's answer then they're either very ill or have received terrible, shocking news. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Here's that word you've been looking for. The answer to the April 15 (1396) Wordle isASHEN. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "To justify Medicaid cuts, House Speaker Mike Johnson says the healthcare program leads to \"able-bodied young men\" playing videogames instead of working. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Medicaid is a US health insurance program for people with low incomes. It's funded by states and the federal government, and like most government programs that help people in some way, it's one of the Trump administration's targets for cuts. Why? Videogames, of course. More specifically, part of the plan is to implement work requirements for Medicaid eligibility—this is currently only a feature of the program in Georgia—and to justify adding this administrative hurdle for patients and states, Republicans are claiming that access to taxpayer-funded healthcare is causing young men to waste all their time playing videogames instead of working. \"No one has talked about cutting one benefit in Medicaid to anyone who's duly owed—what we've talked about is returning work requirements, so, for example, you don't have able-bodied young men on a program that's designed for single mothers and the elderly and disabled. They're draining resources from people,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson last week. \"So if you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money, and you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing videogames all day.\" The picture Johnson paints of Medicaid enrollees stealing from mothers and disabled people so they can sit around playing Call of Duty may be an effective emotional appeal—the call to return \"dignity\" to American men is a nice touch—but it makes little sense on its face. Mike Johnson on Medicaid: \"What we've talked about is returning work requirements ... you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day. We have a lot of fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicaid.\" pic.twitter.com/2ZjaLrh2bgApril 10, 2025 In February,healthcare researcher KFF reportedthat the majority of people who use Medicaid do work. 64% of Medicaid recipients under the age of 65 work full or part-time, according to the organization's analysis, and most of those who are not working have an illness or disability, are caregivers, or are in school. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And if being able to see a doctor while unemployed makes people lazy, I'm not sure why US politicians spend so much time fretting over China's growing economy, because its universal healthcare programcovers over 95% of its population. The US is an odd duck when it comes to providing healthcare services for its people, as some effort at universal healthcare is available in dozens of countries around the world. China has it. US neighbors Canada, Mexico, and Cuba have it. The countries of Europe have it. Russia has it. The US does not. At his confirmation hearing in January,it wasn't clearthat new US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr knew the difference between Medicaid and Medicare, two distinct programs. He also suggested using AI to improve Medicaid. Speaking of AI, new education secretary Linda McMahonseems to think that it's \"A1,\"like the steak sauce, so things aren't going much better over there. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call \"boomer shooters\" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!). Tyler joined PC Gamer in 2011, and today he's focused on the site's news coverage. His hobbies include amateur boxing and adding to his 1,200-plus hours in Rocket League.

    "article_text": "\"I sent him the video of the score, going, like, screw you. Yeah, I got it!\" said Playstack's Wout van Halderen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you conquer a tough challenge in a videogame, who do you tell first? Maybe you message a friend who is playing the same game to do a bit of gloating, perhaps post on a subreddit or Discord channel in hopes of some celebratory emojis for your accomplishment, or maybe you just boast proudly about it on social media. If you're Wout van Halderen, communications director at Balatro's publisher, Playstack, you've got someone in particular to tell when you utterly thrash Balatro: the game's creator, LocalThunk. I got to talk to van Halderen at GDC last month, and while trying to wheedle information out of him about thenew jokers in the Balatro 1.1 update, he told me he was eager to see some new jokers because as the rest of us. \"I can't wait,\" van Halderen said. \"I can't wait to play more myself. I'm gold stakes at every level. So I need a challenge again, LocalThunk. Get on it.\" After admitting I haven't advanced further than purple stakes myself, van Halderen explained the unique position he was in during the early days of Balatro's release. \"I was in a competition with LocalThunk himself, so when I beat the first gold stakes, I sent him a message, and he's like, 'How did you do it already?'\" van Halderen said. \"I'm not sure if you tried the Jokerless challenge, that is brutal,\" he said, referencing the unthinkably difficult feat of beating the final boss blind without ever using even a single joker (and no, I have not tried it). Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I have the benefit that I can actually message him,\" he said. \"So when I beat that challenge, I sent him the video of the score, going, like, screw you. Yeah, I got it! And he was mad at me, like, 'How did you do this so fast?'\" It's only recently that LocalThunk himself matched van Halderen's accomplishment: earlier this month he reported that he finallybeat his own game on gold stakes, inviting fans to roast him for his strategy (he appears to stick mostly with two pair and the Hanging Chad joker, valid) and stating he still wants to 100% his own game someday. Hopefully he's not spending so much time playing Balatro that it's stopping him from working on it: we're all eager to see some new jokers, including his own publisher.

    "article_text": "Bose sound, long battery, low price, and a really cool case When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Skullcandy has just unveiled its latest earbuds, and they're a mashup with Bose that I think looks like incredibly good value for their $99 / £99 / AU$189.99 launch price – though in the US, that's just an initial introductory price, and will rise to $119 officially. The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC buds are true wireless buds that come in a really cool slide-out case with an O-ring to connect to your backpack or cool skate clothes (the press images seem to emphasize the skating vibe). The design of the buds themselves bears more than a passing resemblance to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, but with Skullcandy-like funky color options. They have fins for a super-secure fit, and apparently this is \"licensed technology from Bose [to] help ensure a perfect fit and block out unwanted sound\". There are different-sized fins and eartips to help get the most secure fit for your ear shape. Speaking of blocking out the sound, they have active noise cancellation, with adjustable modes via Skullcandy's app and a 'Stay-Aware' passthrough mode. Four mics power the ANC, and given the tech involved, it seems that Bose has had its hand in here as well – these could rank among thebest noise-cancelingearbudson a budget. Impressively, the battery life with ANC turned on is nine hours from the earbuds, with another 23 hours from the case. That's way above most of the competition from even thebest earbuds. With the ANC off, you get 11 hours from the buds and a further 29 from the case. Now, you might assume (as I did) from the '360' name that there's some kind of spatial audio here. Well, there isn't. Which is fine given the budget, I have no complaint about that – but it feels like Skullcandy already blew the perfectly good name it could've given the next-gen version where itdidadd this feature. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There's multi-point pairing,GoogleFast Pair support, and Bluetooth 5.3 includingBluetooth LE Audiosupport, so they're somewhat future-proof. There's no mention ofBluetooth Auracastsupport, but the version of Bluetooth here supports it, so it might be possible in the future. It's also a shame there's no Find My support, but I can live without that. There's very little to complain about otherwise – even little things that are often left out of budget buds are here, including IPX4 sweat resistance and auto-pausing wear detection when you take them off. The color options are especially good. They are, in order of how awesome they sound: Plasma, Leopard, Bone, Primer, and Black. They are, in order of how cool they look: Leopard, Plasma, Primer, Black, and Bone. If these have sound quality and ANC to match the Bose partnership, and the comfort we expect from Skullcandy, these look like they've hit a real value sweet spot, and may rank among thebest budget earbuds. We've already had our hands on them, and will bring you some first impressions once we've had a chance to make some early judgments. They're available to buy from today.

    "title": "Google’s new AI model could someday let you understand and talk to dolphins",
    "article_text": "Decades of dolphin gossip might finally get translated on your Pixel When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For most of human history, our relationship with dolphins has been a one-sided conversation: we talk, they squeak, and we nod like we understand each other before tossing them a fish. But now,Googlehas a plan to use AI to bridge that divide. Working with Georgia Tech and the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP), Google has created DolphinGemma, a new AI model trained to understand and even generate dolphin chatter. The WDP has been collecting data on a specific group of wild Atlantic spotted dolphins since 1985. The Bahamas-based pod has provided huge amounts of audio, video, and behavioral notes as the researchers have observed them, documenting every squawk and buzz and trying to piece together what it all means. This treasure trove of audio is now being fed into DolphinGemma, which is based on Google’s open Gemma family of models. DolphinGemma takes dolphin sounds as input, processes them using audio tokenizers like SoundStream, and predicts what vocalization might come next. Imagine autocomplete, but for dolphins. The model is very slim and can run on a Google Pixel. WDP is already deploying DolphinGemma in the field this summer, using Pixel 9s in waterproof rigs. These models will be listening in, identifying vocal patterns, and helping researchers flag meaningful sequences in real time. But the ultimate goal here isn’t just passive listening. WDP and Georgia Tech are also working on a system called CHAT (short for Cetacean Hearing Augmentation Telemetry), which is essentially a two-way communication system for humans and dolphins. CHAT lets researchers assign synthetic whistles to objects dolphins like, including seagrass and floating scarves, and then waits to see if the dolphins mimic those sounds to request them. It’s kind of like inventing a shared language, except with underwater microphones instead of flashcards. DolphinGemma doesn’t just analyze dolphin sounds after the fact; it helps anticipate what sounds might be coming, enabling faster response times and smoother interactions. In essence, it’s like a predictive keyboard for dolphins. The whole project is still in an early stage, but Google plans to open-source DolphinGemma later this year to accelerate progress. The initial model is trained on the vocalizations of Atlantic spotted dolphins, but it could theoretically be adapted to other species with some tuning. The idea is to hand other researchers the keys to the AI so they can apply it to their own acoustic datasets. Of course, this is still a long way from chatting with dolphins about philosophy or their favorite snacks. There’s no guarantee that dolphin vocalizations map neatly to human-like language. But DolphinGemma will help sift through years of audio for meaningful patterns. Dolphins aren't the only animals humans may use AI to communicate with. Another group of scientists developed an AI algorithm to decode pigs' emotions based on their grunts, squeals, and snuffles to help farmers understand their emotional and physical health. Dolphins are undeniably more charismatic, though. Who knows, maybe someday you'll be able to ask a dolphin for directions while you're sailing, at least if you don't drop your phone in the water.

    "title": "Intel sells majority of its FPGA business to Silver Lake for just under $4.5 billion - here's what you need know",
    "article_text": "Altera is currently valued at $8.75 billion, but Intel paid a lot more for it in 2015 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel, now under the leadership ofnew CEO Lip-Bu Tan, has been facing a number of challenges in recent years, to the point where it was rumored the tech giant could sell off its chip-design and marketing business orspin off its chip plants. Whether that will happen in the future remains to be seen, but Intel says it has signed a definitive agreement to sell 51% of its Altera business to Silver Lake for $4.46 billion. This values the company at $8.75 billion, which is quite a drop from nearly $17 billion Intel paid for it in 2015. Altera has been active in FPGA (field programmable gate array) development for over four decades, providing programmable semiconductor solutions for use in industries like communications, aerospace, government, data centers, and industrial automation. The sale gives Altera operational independence and establishes it as the largest pure-play FPGA semiconductor company in the world. Intel will keep a 49% stake, allowing it to remain involved while shifting its focus more squarely to its core operations. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, pending customary closing conditions. Once finalized, Intel plans to deconsolidate Altera’s financials. In 2024, Altera reported $1.54 billion in revenue, a GAAP operating loss of $615 million, and non-GAAP operating income of $35 million. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Raghib Hussain, previously president of Products and Technologies at Marvell, will succeed Sandra Rivera as CEO of Altera on May 5, 2025. “This investment represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in a scale leader in advanced semiconductors,” said Kenneth Hao, chairman and managing partner of Silver Lake. “Together with Raghib, we will be focused on strengthening Altera’s technology leadership position and investing in emerging AI-driven markets such as edge computing and robotics. We look forward to working closely with Intel as a strategic partner who will continue to provide U.S.-based foundry services and complementary engagement with customers.” Lip-Bu Tan described the agreement as a strategic step forward. “Today’s announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,” he said. “Altera continues to make progress repositioning its product portfolio to participate in the fastest growing and most profitable segments of the FPGA market. We are grateful for Sandra’s strong leadership and lasting impact throughout her 25-year Intel career and wish her continued success as she begins a new chapter. Raghib is a superb executive we selected to lead the business forward based on his vast industry experience and proven track record of success. We look forward to partnering with Silver Lake upon closing of the transaction, as their industry expertise will help to accelerate Altera's efforts and unlock additional economic value for Intel.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "title": "OpenAI might build its own social network, and we think we know why",
    "article_text": "Grok envy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In what we can only assume is a potential thumb in the eye of Elon Musk, Sam Altman'sOpen AIis reportedly considering building a social network, possibly insideChatGPT. This comes via a new report fromThe Verge,which claims this week that the social network possibly being built on top of OpenAI's AI services is only in the \"early stages.\" Still, it could set up ChatGPT and other OpenAI platforms for a head-to-head battle with Grok, a generative AI platform built on top of Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). There are essentially no details about what this social platform might look like, and OpenAI has little experience with shareable content outside of what its models can generate and what you can see inSora(the video generation system) of other people's creations. The fact that this rumor is out there might have little to do with behind-the-scenes development and more to do with Altman's ongoing battle with former partner Musk. The pair founded OpenAI together before Musk walked away in 2018. He has since criticized andsued OpenAIfor, among other things, becoming, in part at least, a for-profit entity (see OpenAI's partnership withMicrosoftand the rise ofCopilot). Let's assume for a moment, though, that this is real. Why would OpenAI want to build a social network? In a word: data. If millions flock to the platform and then start, I guess, sharing AI-generated memes on it, they'll be dropping a ton of rich data into the OpenAI system. If users allow it, future versions of the GPT model could be trained on it. Real data and activities that show how real people think, talk, act, create, etc, can be invaluable to a young generative model. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I wonder if this might've made more sense a year or two ago when Musk took over Twitter, transformed it into X, removed many of the protective content guardrails, and turned it into a social media hellscape. It was in that moment that Meta'sThreadsfirst rushed in. It was followed in notoriety byBluesky. Both of them are distributed social networks, meaning no one owns your identity or your data. Their growth has been remarkable, and it stands in contrast to X's fortunes. Depending on who you talk to, active user growth isstagnant or shrinking. But that doesn't mean the public's appetite for more alternative platforms is growing.Threads'growth has slowed, andBluesky is relatively smallcompared to X and Threads. The action is mostly on image and video-based social platforms like Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram Reels, andYouTubeShorts. The Verge report does not mention video, which leads us to assume this could be another micro-blogging-style network – something no one necessarily needs or, perhaps, wants. Even so, as an opportunity to cause Elon Musk a little more agita, it's probably a worthy trial balloon from Altman.

    "article_text": "Trump is taking credit for Nvidia's move When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidiahas announced it will manufacture its AI supercomputers entirely in the United States. The company revealed plans to produce $500 billion worth of AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years, building and testing chips in Arizona and assembling AI supercomputers in Texas. More than a million square feet of new manufacturing space is being developed to support this expansion. Production of Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips has begun at TSMC’s facilities in Phoenix. In Texas, Foxconn and Wistron will handle supercomputer manufacturing in Houston and Dallas, with mass production expected to scale up within 12 to 15 months. Nvidia is also working with Amkor and SPIL in Arizona to package and test its chips. Together, these facilities form a new supply chain based entirely in the US, something the company has never done before. Will this make a huge difference? Probably not. According to the The White House, this move is part of a broader trend driven by efforts to bring key tech manufacturing back to American soil. “It’s the Trump Effect in action,”a White House statement said. “President Donald J. Trump has made U.S.-based chips manufacturing a priority as part of his relentless pursuit of an American manufacturing renaissance, and it’s paying off - with trillions of dollars in new investments secured in the tech sector alone.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Earlier in 2025, President Trump announced a $500 billion private investment in AI infrastructure led byOpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, calledStargate. Applealso announced a $500 billion investment, while TSMC committed $100 billion toward domestic chipmaking. The White House noted that onshoring these industries supports American workers, strengthens the economy, and improves national security. “The engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States for the first time,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Adding American manufacturing helps us better meet the incredible and growing demand for AI chips and supercomputers, strengthens our supply chain and boosts our resiliency.” Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

    "article_text": "The first HPC chip built on TSMC’s 2nm process node will arrive in 2026 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMDhas announced it has successfully produced the first 2nm-class silicon for its next-generation EPYC processor, codenamed \"Venice\" which is expected to launch in 2026 as part of AMD’s 6th Generation EPYC lineup. The core complex die (CCD) is the first high-performance computing product to be taped out and brought up using TSMC’s advanced N2 process technology. The Venice CPU, built on the Zen 6 architecture, brings AMD one step closer to delivering on its data center roadmap and will target HPC workloads when it launches. With the move to the 2nm node, AMD expects to offer better power efficiency, performance, and silicon yields. “TSMC has been a key partner for many years and our deep collaboration with their R&D and manufacturing teams has enabled AMD to consistently deliver leadership products that push the limits of high-performance computing,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Being a lead HPC customer for TSMC’s N2 process and for TSMC Arizona Fab 21 are great examples of how we are working closely together to drive innovation and deliver the advanced technologies that will power the future of computing,” Dr. Su added. TSMC CEO Dr. C.C. Wei, who posed alongside Dr. Su with the CCD for the photo above, echoed the sentiment, saying, “We are proud to have AMD be a lead HPC customer for our advanced 2nm (N2) process technology and TSMC Arizona fab. By working together, we are driving significant technology scaling resulting in better performance, power efficiency and yields for high-performance silicon.

    "article_text": "Americans warned about Tax Day scams When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Scammers are increasingly observed using artificial intelligence to fuel malicious activities, with many opting for AI-generated voice scams and deepfakes to impersonatetaxpreparers, accountants or IRS officials. With American citizens partaking in Tax Day, the surge in voice phishing (vishing) attacks means we’re seeing cybercriminals exploiting stolen personal details to convincingly fake identities and scam taxpayers into sharing sensitive financial documents and details. While consumers have long been familiar with the signs of email phishing, this new attack vector is catching more victims off guard. With American citizens partaking in Tax Day on April 15, a newMicrosoftThreat Intelligencereporthopes to educate users about how they can better protect their data. Some easy fixes include implementing multi-factor authentication on online accounts and verifying the authenticity of URLs – by re-typing URLs themselves, users can avoid potential scams such as the use of an upper case ‘i’, which is often used in place of a lower case ‘L’ in attacks. Moreover, citizens should familiarize themselves with verified communication methods – for example, the IRS does not initiate contact via email, text or social media for personal or financial information, so a message like this should immediately sound alarm bells. Generative AI has allowed scammers to scale their attacks and create highly believable phishing communications, including realistic emails, voice calls and videos.

    "title": "Sophisticated new ResolverRAT malware targeting healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors",
    "article_text": "Multiple healthcare businesses targeted by new Remote Access Trojan When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There is a brand new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) making rounds on the internet, infecting organizations around the world working in healthcare and pharmacy. Cybersecurity researchers Morphisec Labs named it ResolverRAT, and while it comes with advanced obfuscation and stealth evasion techniques, its distribution is rather ordinary. The attack starts with the usual phishing email, scaring the victim into making a rash, reckless decision. The attackers localize the emails, in an attempt to improve infection rates, but are still casting a relatively wide net. With that in mind, the researchers found phishing emails in Hindi, Italian, Czech, Turkish, Portuguese, and Indonesian.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The attachment is being deployed via side-loaded DLL files which, if triggered, drop a loader directly into the memory. The loader, in turn, deploys the finalmalwarepayload - also only in memory. But that’s not the only way ResolverRAT tries to fly under the radar. It uses both encryption and compression and goes the extra mile to persist on the target endpoints. \"The ResolverRAT's initialization sequence reveals a sophisticated, multi-stage bootstrapping process engineered for stealth and resilience,\" the researchers said, adding that it \"implements multiple redundant persistence methods\" through Windows Registry. Ultimately, ResolverRAT installs itself in different locations across the computer.

Other notable features include using certificate-based authentication to bypass root authorities, an IP rotation system to connect to different C2 servers, certificate pinning, source code obfuscation, and more. \"This advanced C2 infrastructure demonstrates the advanced capabilities of the threat actor, combining secure communications, fallback mechanisms, and evasion techniques designed to maintain persistent access while evading detection by security monitoring systems,\" Morphisec said. The last time the campaign was observed in the wild was in mid-March this year, which could suggest that it’s still ongoing. The threat actors deploying ResolverRAT could be the same ones dropping Lumma and Rhadamanthys, since the same deployment mechanisms were seen in all cases. It could also mean that the groups were simply using the same phishing kit. ViaThe Hacker News Sead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 colors: every rumored and predicted shade",
    "article_text": "Expect a wide range of bright shades When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7will probably land in July, and when it does, you’ll likely have quite a few colors to choose between, asSamsung’s Z Flip phones are usually sold in a wide variety of shades. Exactly what shades will be offered this year is uncertain, but through a combination of leaks and Samsung's past form, we have at least some idea of what to expect. Below then, you’ll find the colors that we think are most likely to be offered on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. The onlypossible Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 color that we’ve actually seen so far is blue, with the shade that you can see above having appeared in leaked renders. It’s a pale blue that looks very similar to a blue shade you can already get theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6in. We’d take this with a pinch of salt since it’s not clear whether the source of the renders has heard there will be a blue shade or is just using an existing shade for the renders. But either way, we’d think blue is a likely color, as it’s one Samsung has frequently turned to with the Galaxy Z Flip line. Coral Red is a color we’ve heard mentionedas a possible shade for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, and while we haven’t seen pictures of it in this color, there is a Coral Red version of theSamsung Galaxy S25, which you can see above. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This is a pale, pinkish red that would probably fit the Z Flip 7 nicely since Samsung tends to offer Z Flips in quite colorful shades. This would however be a color we haven’t seen offered before on a Z Flip phone, so we’d still take this with a pinch of salt. So far only the shades above have actually been tipped, but we reckon there’s a good chance Samsung will sell the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in yellow, because there have been yellow versions of the last few models. You can see the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in yellow above, so we might see something similar to that, though it’s possible a different shade of yellow would be offered instead – or that Samsung will give yellow a break. Some version of silver or gray is also likely to be offered, because the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is sold in Silver Shadow (which is a silvery gray), theGalaxy Z Flip 5in Gray, the Z Flip 4 in Graphite (which is approaching black but still with a gray edge), the Z Flip 3 in Gray, and the Z Flip 5G in Mystic Gray. So, Samsung really has a thing for gray when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip line, and there’s no reason to think it would give up on gray this year. Samsung typically offers either a white or cream shade for its handsets - or in some cases, both - so although we haven't heard of a white or cream Galaxy Z Flip 7, this shade seems like a safe bet. So, either a white or a near-white cream color is quite likely for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, especially as even outside the Z Flip line, white is a very common and popular smartphone color choice. While we will likely see some or perhaps even all of the shades above, there’s a high chance the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be sold in other shades too. After all, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 is available in seven different colors. What the other shades might be is uncertain, but other colors Samsung has used in recent years include Black, Mint, Peach, Lavender, and Green, so we might see one or more of those, or Samsung might show us something new. Note though that some of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 colors will almost certainly be exclusive to Samsung’s online store, as that’s the company’s typical practice.

    "title": "Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti confirmed for April 16 launch - and while the price looks good, availability certainly doesn't",
    "article_text": "A strong showing from Nvidia, but will you be able to get one? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia's long-awaited budget (or perhaps I should say 'budget') RTX 5000 GPUs are finally here, with a last-minute announcement that the RTX 5060 Ti will be dropping on April 16 - yes, that's tomorrow. The pricing is naturally what most people have been waiting to see, and I can confirm that the RTX 5060 Ti will start at a very reasonable $379 / £349 (around AU$595) - although that's for the 8GB model, with the 16GB model setting you back $429 / £399 (around AU$675) at MSRP. The good news is that's a generational price cut against the RTX 4060 Ti, for both models. Even better, an RTX 5060 (non-Ti) is coming sometime in May, with a $299 price point (other regional prices to be confirmed), and RTX 5060-series laptops will also start dropping in May. The bad news is that availability is likely to be rough, if the recent carnage in the GPU market is anything to go off. Betweenludicrous price inflation,horrendously low stock levels,tariff-related nonsense, andmissing ROPs on some cards, it's been a perfect storm that has been borderline disastrous for the other RTX 5000 launches, and there's nothing to indicate this one will be any better. Hell, you know what? I might go so far as to say that I expect availability to beeven worsethis time around. Announcing the cardvia a blog post24 hours before the launch is practically approaching a stealth drop, and while I don't exactly expect the same fanfare we saw for theRTX 5090, this feels almost like Nvidia has kicked it out the door like a problem child on its 18th birthday. I noted recently that renowned hardware leakerMoore's Law Is Dead(MLID) onYouTubereported on a source claiming that the RTX 5060 Ti launch would be among the worst seen in recent memory. Basically, you're going to struggle to get your hands on one of these cards. On the bright side, this launch is (availability aside) bringing the boosted performance of Nvidia's Blackwell GPU architecture and DLSS 4 support to PC gamers with smaller budgets, something that has become desperately needed; after all, it's no secret that many recent triple-A PC releases have struggled performance-wise without modern resolution upscaling solutions like DLSS and the increasingly divisive frame-gen. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There's one more stumbling block for Nvidia's newest GPU to overcome, too: the potential for a'motherboard tax'caused by the upgrade to PCIe 5.0. This is an issue that could sting budget buyers more than anyone who can drop multiple thousands on a high-end card. Personally? I think I'll be keeping an eye onAMD's RX 9060 XTinstead...

    "title": "Big Tesla update brings 5 new features to its EVs, but not everyone will get them",
    "article_text": "Adaptive headlights and more camera options incoming! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tesla often likes to bundle a number of big software updates into one, with its popular ‘Holiday Update’ typically introducing a series of choice tech upgrades to existing customers. The latest over-the-air update, dubbed the ‘Spring Update’, sees a number of new features added across the line-up, with perhaps the most notable of all being Adaptive Headlights for cars in North American and Canada. Both the Model S and Model X have also been catered for with a new blind spot camera video feed in the instrument cluster and an overall upgrade to the Dashcam and Sentry Mode camera coverage will benefit all owners, especially those worried about theprospect of anti-Musk protests. Here are those Tesla updates and who's getting them... Available on Tesla models that feature matrix headlights, the software update will introduce high beams that automatically adapt to avoid blinding oncoming road users. It works by dimming individual pixels, illuminating the parts of the road drivers need without inconveniencing others. The technology and required software has been available in Europe for some time now, but the update, which can be toggled on and off in the Lights setting menu, comes to North American and Canadian customers thanks to recent changes in legislation that now allow for it. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That said, adaptive high beam headlights have been commonplace on models from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and many more for over ten years now, so it’s not exactly a mind-blowing addition to the Tesla tech arsenal. Tesla’s route-planning is largely excellent, arguably among the best in the EV business, but it has just got better thanks to clearer choices for multiple route-planning options. There’s now an option labelled ‘Fastest’ that keeps travel (and charge time) time to the bare minimum, while a ‘Best amenities’ option prioritizes Supercharger stops near top-rated restaurants, shops and restrooms, according to aTesla post on X. Users can also manually toggle an option to avoid highways for more scenic drives. Finally, there’s a ‘Fewer Stops’ that aims to reduce the number of charging stops by taking the most direct and efficient routes. Plus, when scrolling through the various Tesla Supercharger stations, the infotainment system will offer details on any nearby attractions it deems worth visiting. For the Model S, 3, X and Y with the latest hardware, Tesla has added footage from the side cameras (mounted in the b-pillars) to both Dashcam and Sentry Mode recordings. This means that the captured camera angles now jump from four to six, which will see pretty much all of the car covered, both when driving and when parked. On top of this, the Dashcam Viewer app has been redesigned with a grid layout option, showing a selection of camera angles on one screen. Users can now more easily navigate the captured footage thanks to quick-swipe video review tools, as well as easily toggle between the various angles captured by all six cameras. One subtle feature has been added that allows users to continue using USB ports and phone chargers after exiting and locking the car. The system will keep charging accessories so long as the vehicle’s battery level is above 20%, to ensure there’s enough charge remaining to get drivers to a nearby charging station. It’s a nice addition, but many rival manufacturers deliberately offer accessory outlets in the trunk and/or frunk for this exact purpose. Rather than having to look down to the central touchscreen when indicating to change lanes, a live feed from the blind spot cameras now appears in the driver display… but there’s a catch. This update is only available on the refreshed Model S and Model X, which encompasses vehicles made between 2021 and now. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft.

    "title": "Florida wants an encryption backdoor – in the name of children’s safety",
    "article_text": "\"This would likely lead to companies not offering E2E to minors at all, making them less safe online,\" warn experts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Florida is considering a bill that could force all social media platforms that allow accounts for minors to provide an encryption backdoor for law enforcement. The bill will also prevent minors from using or accessing ephemeral messaging features, meaning messages that disappear after viewing, including WhatsApp'sview once.Social media providers will also be required togive the minors' parents or guardians access to all messages posted by their children. Known as the \"Social Media Use By Minors\" bill (SB 868/HB 743), the proposal is the latest legal effort to protect children's safety online. Yet, privacy experts warn that such requirements will make young people less safe instead. As digital rights experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)wrote, \"The bill is not only privacy-invasive, it’s also asking for the impossible.\" Encryption is used by thebest VPNandencrypted messaging appsto keep users' online activities private. WhatsApp and Signal employ end-to-end encryption to scramble data into an unreadable form to ensure only your intended recipients can read your messages. As per their own words, Florida's lawmakers want to force \"social media platforms to provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena.\" Cryptographers and other experts, however, have long warned that what's known as anencryption backdoorcannot be implemented without undermining the whole system's security. That's because, besides the possibility of authorities misuse, malicious actors will end up being able to exploit this entry point. Florida wants to introduce such requirements specifically for providers that allow minors to open an account in a bid to improve children's safety online. Yet, EFF experts believe it will acheieve exactly the opposite result. \"This would likely lead to companies not offering end-to-end encryption to minors at all, making themlesssafe online,\" they said. Florida’s “Social Media Use by Minors” bill is an ill-advised attempt to backdoor end-to-end encryption that asks the impossible. It should not be allowed to move forward. https://t.co/AXIKwX0Hj7April 13, 2025 Another contentious point is the plan of \"prohibiting minor account holders from using or accessing messages that are designed to disappear or self destruct.\" Again, according to EFF experts, targeting this feature would solely end up harming the privacy of everyone instead, without achieving anything to protect children. Even ephemeral messages can be saved and reported if needed. The \"Social Media Use By Minors\" bill seeks to expand the reach of Florida's Social Media Law (HB 3), which came into force at the beginning of the year. Among other things, the law introduced mandatory age verification checks for accessing material deemed harmful to minors and a ban for opening a social media account to children younger than 14. The HB 3 law was hit by acomplaintback in October, raising concerns around free speech implications. The lawsuit is still ongoing at the time of writing. For EFF expert is a no-brainer – lawmakers should reject the bill and focus on alternative protections, like better consumer privacy laws and digital literarcy at school. \"Minors, as well as those around them, deserve the right to speak privately without law enforcement listening in.\" Florida is only the latest government pushing to get law enforcement greater access to encrypted data. The UK, EU, and evenSwitzerland– once believed to be a privacy paradise – are considering some form of encryption backdoor at the time of writing. The tech industry doesn't look willing to weaken the security of their systems, though. Apple decided tokill its iCloud E2E featurein the UK for not building a backdoor and is now challenging the UK in court.

    "title": "These 8 photos made me believe the Polaroid Flip is the best analog instant camera on the market",
    "article_text": "A new, more affordable take on a classic When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Polaroid is not in the business of perfection. Its photographs, going back many decades, have a somewhat indescribable look, a graininess and rough-hewn quality so iconic that Instagram copied it (along with the logo) when it launched almost 15 years ago. That legacy of imperfection continues with thePolaroid Flip,the company’s most accomplished and accessible instant camera, which finally delivers the imagery and usability goods at a “yes, I can afford this” price. Where the $599 / £500 i-2 was a pro-level shooter for those who knew the ins and outs of exposure and focus, the Flip is simpler and does that work for you and might deliver better images because of it. In some ways, the Polaroid Flip, which I had a chance to play with, is a throwback. The instant camera – available in black or white – features a fold-up flash that might remind people of the once ultra-popular 600 series. However, this one is better integrated into the smooth body design and offers far more throw power (up to 15 feet). Where thei-2has a three-element lens system, the Polaroid Flip features four lenses. They’re housed in an internal dial that automatically chooses the right lens for a shot. The camera does this thanks to another critical choice Polaroid made for the Flip: it uses sonar instead of LiDAR for focus and lens selection. Sonar, which uses sound waves, is accurate and more forgiving than LiDAR. Polaroid memorably used sonar with its first analog instant camera, theSX-70. In that attachment, though, the circular sonar screen was giant. It’s thumb-tip-sized on the Flip. The company focused on ease of use for this consumer-friendly but full-sized Polaroid print camera. There are minimal buttons and controls, with just enough visual feedback to keep photographers engaged instead of confused. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Aside from the shutter button, there is another large button on the side to eject the film cartridge (the camera uses Polaroid I-film cartridges, which do not include a battery), a large red shutter button on the face, a flash control button, and a small settings button to control shot style. You can shoot on a timer or even do a double exposure. On the back of the flash housing is a small, monochrome LED screen that shows the number of pictures remaining in the cartridge and your other camera settings. While there isn't a lot of feedback on how to frame or light your photos, the Flip does include a tiny red LED light in the rangefinder that lights up when you're too close to a subject or the image exposure is poorly lit (too dark and you need the flash or maybe too backlit). It's child's play getting started with the Flip, which employs a familiar press-and-hold to set exposure and focus and then a full press to take the shot. The photos slide out of the front and still take about 15 minutes to develop fully. There are 8 shots per cartridge, and a pack of two can cost $36. The Flip’s internal battery supports shooting up to 15 packs. You can connect the camera to the Polaroid app, though I think the controls are limited and there is no direct way to get the images from the camera to your phone, but then why would you want to? Polaroid reps handed me a Flip at a pre-launch event, and I quickly noticed that while I liked the curved and familiar-feeling body, it was a bit heavier than even thePolaroid i-2. It wasn’t bad, though, and I was soon shooting still-life images, people, selfies, and trippy double exposures. In other words, I was in my happy place. The camera is fast and fun to use, and my resulting photos were sharply focused on the subjects (you can get as close as about 46 cm) with impressive bokeh behind them. The results still look like Polaroid camera photos, never as sharp, clear, or deeply colorful as what you might get with yourbest iPhone, but that’s not the point of a Polaroid instant analog camera. I have all these photos on my desk. I can hold them, share them, let people leave with them, and tack them on their walls. I guarantee these are the kinds of images that will make people feel something. And now, they can do it for $199.99 / £199.99. That’s a great starting price, and it even ships with a strap. The film will cost you, so that’s a concern, but you won’t shoot as much as you do with your smartphone and will likely consider each of these prints somewhat precious. It’s a special camera, for special times. At least, that’s my opinion.

    "title": "Don't just lock your door: MFA alone is not enough in today's cybersecurity climate",
    "article_text": "MFA alone is not enough in today's cybersecurity climate When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thecybersecuritylandscape is evolving with serious pace, and organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats from attackers who are constantly finding new ways to bypass traditional defenses. For years, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been heralded as a cornerstone of modernsecuritypractices, providing an additional layer of protection beyond passwords. However, as threat actors sharpen their tools and exploit vulnerabilities, it has become clear that MFA alone is no longer sufficient to safeguard sensitive information. To truly protect against today’s advanced threats, organizations must embrace a layered security approach that goes far beyond MFA. Microsoft Security Solutions Architect at Advania. The concept of MFA is simple yet effective: requiring multiple forms of verification—such as apasswordand a one-time code sent to a mobile device—adds an extra layer of security. It could be seen as locking your door with two different locks instead of just one. This has been especially valuable in combating password-based attacks, as it makes it significantly harder for attackers to gain access with stolen credentials. Yet, despite its strengths, MFA is far from infallible. Sophisticated attackers have developed numerous methods to bypass MFA protections. Phishing remains one of the most common tactics, where users are tricked into revealing their MFA credentials on fake websites or through deceptive communications. Man-in-the-middle attacks intercept session tokens during transmission, rendering MFA useless in certain scenarios. MFA fatigue attacks—where users are inundated with repeated authentication requests until they approve one out of frustration or confusion—are becoming alarmingly frequent. SIM swapping allows attackers to hijack phone numbers used for SMS-based authentication, while session hijacking enables them to bypass MFA altogether by stealing authenticated tokens. These techniques demonstrate that while MFA is necessary, it is insufficient as a standalone solution. The rise ofAI-driven cyberattacks and the proliferation of SaaS applications further complicate the picture. As businesses increasingly rely on interconnected systems and cloud-based platforms, managing identities—both human and non-human—has become more challenging than ever. Attackers exploit these complexities to target vulnerabilities in identity management systems, leading to a surge in identity-driven breaches. To address these challenges, organizations must adopt a layered security strategy that incorporates multiple defenses working together to protect against threats. This approach, often referred to as “defense in depth,” recognizes that no single security measure can provide complete protection. Instead, overlapping layers create redundancies that ensure if one layer fails, others remain effective. A foundational element of this strategy is the implementation of zero trust architecture. Zero trust operates on the principle of “never trust, always verify,” meaning that every user and device must be continuously authenticated and authorized before accessing sensitive resources. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security models—which assume that everything inside thenetworkis safe—zero trust assumes that threats can exist anywhere and requires constant vigilance. Zero trust builds upon MFA by incorporating additional checks and balances into the authentication process. For example, adaptive authentication uses AI and machine learning to assess risk factors such as user behavior, device type, location, and login patterns before granting access. Biometricauthenticationmethods like fingerprint scanning or facial recognition add another layer of security while improving user experience by eliminating reliance on passwords or codes. Endpoint protection is another critical component of a layered security strategy. Devices such aslaptops, smartphones, and tablets are often the first line of defense against attacks—and also the most vulnerable entry points for attackers seeking access to an organization's network. Advanced Endpoint Detection & Response can detect and prevent malware infections, unauthorized access attempts, and other threats targeting devices. Implementing robust endpoint security measures involves not only deploying software solutions but also ensuring that devices are regularly updated and patched. This includes maintaining strongidentityand access management (IAM) practices to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data from these devices. Network segmentation further enhances security by dividing an organization's network into smaller segments or zones based on sensitivity levels. This limits the spread of potential breaches and ensures that attackers cannot move laterally across the entire network even if attackers gain access to one segment. Comprehensive monitoring and detection systems play a vital role in identifying and responding to threats in real time. Centralized monitoring solutions can analyze vast amounts of data from across the organization's infrastructure to detect anomalies or suspicious activity. When combined with automated response mechanisms, these systems enable rapid remediation before threats escalate into full-blown breaches. The future of cybersecurity lies in embracing a holistic approach that combines technology with proactive strategies. Organizations must invest not only in advanced tools but also in employee training programs to raise awareness about phishing attacks and other social engineering tactics. Security policies should be regularly updated to reflect emerging threats and technological advancements. It’s clear that the cybersecurity landscape will continue to evolve at breakneck speed. Threat actors are becoming more sophisticated by leveraging AI-driven techniques and exploiting gaps in traditional defenses like MFA. Organizations must remain agile and adaptable—constantly reassessing their security strategies—to stay ahead of these evolving threats. While MFA remains an important piece of the puzzle, it is no longer enough on its own. A robust layered security approach ensures that if one defense fails, others remain effective in protecting sensitive information from compromise. The days when locking your door once or twice was enough are long gone; today’s threat landscape demands multiple layers of protection working together seamlessly. Only by embracing this mindset can organizations hope to safeguard their assets in an increasingly interconnected digital world where attackers are always one step ahead—and where cybersecurity must evolve just as rapidly as the threats it seeks to counteract.

    "title": "‘Euro-Nazism’ is being revived – Moscow",
    "article_text": "The Russian Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said Tuesday that the EU’s attempts to pressure candidate states not to attend the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II in Moscow are tantamount to a revival of Nazism. On Monday, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned the leaders of EU members and candidate states against taking part in the event in the Russian capital on May 9. The British daily The Telegraph later wrote that candidate states, such as Serbia, could be barred from joining the bloc if their leaders choose to attend the Victory Day celebrations. “If this is true, then Euro-Nazism is being reborn before our eyes,”Zakharova wrote on Telegram, citing the article. “This is how the fascists 80 years ago forced those they considered ‘second-class people’ to renounce their homeland, ethnicity, and faith,”the spokeswoman added. The Telegraph wrote that EU officials warned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has indicated that he would attend the May 9 parade, that the visit would derail his country’s accession to the bloc. Vucic’s presence at the event would“come at a cost,”the secretary-general of Estonia’s Foreign Ministry, Jonatan Vseviov, said, according to the newspaper.“The consequence is them not joining the European Union.” “For us this will be an important litmus test. Basically what we look at is whether or not they are on our side or playing on the other team,”he reportedly said. Speaking at a press conference in Luxembourg on Monday, Kallas warned that“any participation in the May 9th parades – or celebrations – in Moscow will not [be] taken lightly on the European side.” Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, the only EU member state leader to have indicated he would attend, slammed her statement as“disrespectful”and potentially a form of blackmail. “Is Ms. Kallas’s warning a form of blackmail or a signal that I will be punished upon my return from Moscow? I don’t know. But I do know that the year is 2025, not 1939,”he wrote on X. Fico stressed that his attendance is a matter of national sovereignty.“I will go to Moscow to pay tribute to the thousands of Red Army soldiers who died liberating Slovakia, as well as to the millions of other victims of Nazi terror,”he added. Russia annual Victory Day celebration honors the 1945 triumph of the USSR over Nazi Germany as well as the estimated 26.6 million Soviet lives lost in the conflict.",

    "article_text": "Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has firmly rejected recent warnings by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas to European leaders against attending Victory Day celebrations in Moscow on May 9, asserting that“the year is 2025, not 1939.” Kallas stated on Monday that any participation by EU leaders in the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the Russian capital“will not be taken lightly”by Brussels. “WARNING AND THREAT BY MS. KALLAS ARE DISRESPECTFUL AND I STRONGLY OBJECT TO THEM,”Ficowroteon X on Tuesday. The Slovak leader confirmed his intention to participate in the commemorations, stating,“I will go to Moscow on May 9th.” Fico questioned the nature of Kallas’ remarks, suggesting they may imply punitive consequences for attending. “Is Ms. Kallas’s warning a form of blackmail or a signal that I will be punished upon my return from Moscow? I don’t know. But I do know that the year is 2025, not 1939,”he said, in an apparent reference to the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia that year. The prime minister argued that Kallas’ comments confirm the need to reflect on internal democratic values within the EU. He referenced recent elections in Romania and France, where top presidential candidates were banned from running. Fico also called for discussions“about the ‘Maidans’ organized by the West in Georgia and Serbia, and how the abuse of criminal law against the opposition in Slovakia has been ignored.” Fico emphasized that his travel plans are a matter of national sovereignty. “Ms. Kallas, I would like to inform you that I am the legitimate Prime Minister of Slovakia – a sovereign country. No one can dictate to me where I can or cannot travel,”he said. Explaining his motives for attending the event, he added,“I will go to Moscow to pay tribute to the thousands of Red Army soldiers who died liberating Slovakia, as well as to the millions of other victims of Nazi terror.”He also pointed out that he has attended other commemorations honoring the victims of World War II",

    "title": "China orders its airlines to dump Boeing – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "China has ordered its airlines to stop accepting Boeing jets as the trade war with the US continues to escalate, Bloomberg wrote on Tuesday, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter. This development follows a series of reciprocal tariff hikes between the two nations. Last week, Washington increased tariffs on Chinese imports to a total of 145%. In response, Beijing imposed 125% tariffs on American imports and restricted exports of minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. Beijing has also asked Chinese airlines to stop any purchases of parts or aircraft-related equipment from US companies, according to Bloomberg. The reported order came after China’s announcement of retaliatory tariffs, which have more than doubled the cost of American aircraft and parts, making their continued use impractical for Chinese companies, Bloomberg cited its sources as saying. In addition, the Chinese government is exploring measures to support airlines leasing Boeing jets that are now facing increased costs, the sources told the outlet. China’s top three airlines – Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines – had plans to receive 45, 53 and 81 planes from the US aerospace giant, respectively, over the next two years, according to Reuters China is one of the biggest markets for aircraft, and has in the past accounted for up to a quarter of Boeing’s output. US President Donald Trump seemingly slammed the decision in a Truth Social post on Tuesday. Beijing“just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft,”the president wrote. Earlier in April, Trump announced a sweeping wave of tariffs on nations with whom he claimed the US had an unfair trade deficit with. The tariffs prompted retaliation from a number of countries. Beijing has slammed the US tariffs as“unilateral bullying.” “China will insist on shaking hands rather than shaking fists, tearing down walls instead of building barriers, connecting instead of decoupling,”a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told a press briefing on Tuesday. It comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping began a set of visits to build ties with neighboring Asian countries similarly facing massive US tariffs.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration has reportedly refused to back a G7 statement condemning Russia’s recent missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed firing two Iskander-M missiles the day before, targeting a gathering of Ukrainian and Western command staff, killing at least 60 senior servicemen. The Ukrainian authorities, however, have claimed that the Russian missiles struck a military awards ceremony, leaving 35 civilians dead and 129 others injured. Following the attack, Ukraine and a number of its international backers accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians and undermining peace talks. According to Bloomberg, the G7, which is being presided over by Canada this year, has drafted a joint statement denouncing the strike on Sumy but has not released it due to a lack of US support. In a draft of the statement seen by the outlet, the group said that the attack was proof that Russia was determined to continue the hostilities. Bloomberg reported that Trump’s team had told the group that it couldn’t sign the statement because it is“working to preserve the space to negotiate peace.” Since taking office in January, Trump has pushed to get both Moscow and Kiev to the negotiating table and has resumed direct contacts with Russia in order to facilitate a peace deal. Throughout the Ukraine conflict, Moscow has maintained that it never targets civilian infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov recently emphasized that Russia only strikes military targets. Russian officials have also stated that Moscow remains open to a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict but have stressed that any settlement must address its root causes. Moscow has demanded that Kiev demilitarize, denazify, give up its NATO ambitions, and adhere to a position of neutrality, and recognize the territorial“realities on the ground.”",

    "title": "Details of Iran’s nuclear demands revealed – media",
    "article_text": "Iran is ready to provide assurances that it is not seeking to weaponize its nuclear program in exchange for US sanctions relief, the country’s top diplomat has said, as quoted by the Tehran Times. Seyed Abbas Araghchi headed the Iranian delegation during indirect talks with US envoy Steve Witkoff in the Omani capital, Muscat on Saturday. The meeting was the first diplomatic engagement between Washington and Tehran in years, with discussions focusing on Iran’s nuclear program and the potential easing of US sanctions. According to the news outlet, Araghchi stated that Iran wants a“win-win agreement”and“would not, under any circumstances, agree to dismantle its nuclear program.” He said, however, that the country is“willing to take steps to provide assurances against the militarization of its nuclear activities.”This would include allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency access to the country’s nuclear sites. In return, Tehran wants US sanctions on several sectors to be removed without the possibility of being brought back“under other pretexts,”according to the Tehran Times. The publication said it learned that Witkoff acknowledged that the US needs to make concessions. During the talks, the envoy reportedly did not mention the potential dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear program, nor did he reference the original deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which US President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018 during his first term in office. In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Witkoff stopped short of calling for Tehran to dismantle its nuclear program, despite demands from other US officials, including White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. “The conversation with the Iranians will be much about two critical points,”Witkoff said. The first is the verification of uranium enrichment,“and ultimately verification on weaponization, that includes missiles, type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb.” The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), however, has since insisted that Iran’s military capabilities are off limits. “National security and defense, and military power are among the red lines of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which cannot be discussed or negotiated under any circumstances,”IRGC spokesman Ali Mohammad Naini said on Tuesday, as cited by various media outlets. The next round of talks between Iran and the US is expected to take place on April 19.",

    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a permanent peace and a legally binding settlement to the Ukraine conflict, US special envoy Steve Witkoff has told Fox News. Witkoff, tasked by US President Donald Trump to lead negotiations with Moscow, met with Putin and two of his senior advisers on Friday. The US envoy shared details of the talks in an interview on Monday, describing the nearly five-hour meeting with Putin as“compelling”and saying it brought the Ukraine peace process to“the verge”of a breakthrough. According to Witkoff, Putin is pursuing a lasting solution.“So beyond just a ceasefire, we got an answer to that,”the envoy said, adding it“took a while for us to get to this place.” A key part of any deal, Witkoff said, would be the recognition that Crimea, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions are part of Russia. However, he emphasized that the proposed agreement goes beyond territorial issues. “There’re security protocols, NATO Article 5 [on collective security] … a lot of detail attached to it. It’s a complicated situation,”he said. Still, Witkoff said he believed the two sides“might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large.” Friday’s meeting was Witkoff’s third with the Russian president since February. Trump has repeatedly said he aims to end the hostilities in Ukraine as quickly as possible. Russia has maintained it is open to peace talks, provided its key security demands are addressed. Moscow opposes any NATO presence on Ukrainian soil and has demanded that Kiev demilitarize, denazify, adhere to a position of neutrality, and recognize the territorial“realities on the ground.” The Russian government has insisted it will not accept a freeze of the conflict, which it maintains will only lead to renewed hostilities later on. Moscow has cited Ukraine’s violations of a US-proposed moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure as proof of Kiev’s untrustworthiness. Commenting on Putin’s meeting with Witkoff, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday there were“no clear outlines of any agreement yet,”but that there was the political will to move forward. Moscow, he added, values the“constructive and substantive”contact with the US side.",

    "title": "EU ‘working to prolong war’ – Kremlin",
    "article_text": "The EU is working to prolong the Ukraine conflict while Russia and the US are attempting to end it through their“intense”diplomatic contacts, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. Western European defense chiefs met last week to discuss the idea of sending a so-called“reassurance”force to Ukraine, which is being actively pushed by the UK and France despite escalation warnings from Moscow. In March, the European Commission proposed an $840 billion rearmament plan for the bloc, supposedly to deter Russia and to continue military aid to Kiev. Peskov told journalists on Tuesday that“we must understand that at the moment there is intense work going on between Moscow and Washington. And it is happening in the name of peace. And against this background, the European countries continue to work in the name of war.” European NATO members“declare in every way their intention to keep supporting Ukraine and the Kiev regime in its desire to continue the war,”he added. At the same time,“there is a direct exchange of information”going on between Moscow and Washington, the spokesman said, referring to talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff in St. Petersburg last week. The visit was already Witkoff’s third to Russia since Washington and Moscow moved toward normalizing relations. Other channels of communication between the two countries are also being used, Peskov added. However, the Kremlin spokesman stressed that finding a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict“is so complex that it is hardly possible to expect immediate results.” On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov condemned plans by Western European nations to deploy their troops to Ukraine, accusing them of trying to strengthen their anti-Russian foothold in the country instead of seeking a real settlement. Western servicemen will protect“the same regime”in Kiev, Lavrov said, adding that even if European NATO members agree to allow a new election in Ukraine, they will make every effort to ensure that the political landscape remains the same and find“some new half-Fuhrer”to take the place of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky.",

    "article_text": "Poland intends to profit from future aid to Ukraine, including from post-conflict reconstruction, and will not“naively”help Kiev at its own expense while others make money, Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said. Speaking at the European Forum for New Ideas (EFNI) on Tuesday, Tusk stressed that Poland would prioritize its domestic economy in commitments to Kiev. “We will brutally guard our interests and Polish companies,”Tusk declared. “We will help [Ukraine] – Poland is in solidarity, we are a symbol of solidarity – but never again in a naive way,”he said.“It won’t be the case that Poland will express solidarity while others profit, for example, on the reconstruction of Ukraine. We will be in solidarity and we will make money on it.” Tusk cited a potential logistics hub in the south of the country, run by Polish companies as a point from which materials could be exported to Ukraine from the EU. “This is a difficult time for the world, but the best possible time for Poland… In this increasingly ruthless competition of egoists on world markets and on front lines, Poland will not be a naive actor,”Tusk stated, pledging to act“ruthlessly when necessary.” Poland has been among Ukraine’s main supporters since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, providing more than €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid, over 70% of which was military, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute. The country has also received a large number of Ukrainian refugees, although public attitudes have reportedly cooled amid the influx of arrivals. Warsaw is also part of the so-called“coalition of the willing,”a group of European countries pushing to maintain military support for Ukraine and proposing to send troops, purportedly in a post-conflict peacekeeping role. Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Poland was ready to become the“largest beneficiary”of Ukraine’s reconstruction. Reconstructing Ukraine will cost some $500 billion over the next decade, according to the World Bank. Some EU members, including Poland, have advocated using frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance rebuilding efforts. Others, however, have warned that doing so without legal grounds could create a dangerous precedent and deter global investors. Moscow has condemned the freezing of its assets and warned that seizure would amount to“theft,”which would be followed by retaliatory measures targeting Western investments in Russia. Moscow has also repeatedly warned that Western aid will not alter the outcome of the conflict, only prolong it.",

The press release by the global health authority stated that earlier this month more than 15 countries took part in Exercise Polaris, which“simulated an outbreak of a fictional virus spreading across the world,”aiming to test readiness for a new pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned earlier this month that a new pandemic“could happen in 20 years or more, or it could happen tomorrow,”describing it as an“epidemiological certainty.” The exercise reportedly simulated an outbreak of“Mammothpox,”a fictional virus similar to smallpox, a disease with a 30% mortality rate that was eradicated in 1980, and mpox, a dangerous variant of which is currently surging across central Africa. According to the scenario, the virus was released after a team of scientists and documentary filmmakers excavated the remains of a woolly mammoth in the Arctic. Within weeks, intensive care units across the world were“overwhelmed”and health systems were struggling to cope. Although the countries involved in the exercise were able to contain the fictional virus, a real outbreak would prove much more complicated, the WHO acknowledged. The agency’s briefing document reportedly stated that“ancient viruses can remain viable in permafrost for thousands of years,”and the thawing of the permafrost in the Arctic due to climate change may cause a“release of pathogens previously unknown to modern medicine.” Taking advantage of the warmer temperatures, scientists and ivory hunters are digging for ancient remains in the Arctic, including those of woolly mammoths, The Telegraph noted. Many ivory hunters reportedly carry out the excavations without taking adequate health precautions. Scientists have also been studying ancient samples, with researchers working on bringing to life“zombie viruses”found alongside frozen animal remains, which could potentially be deadly to humans. A virus revived by French scientist Jean-Michel Claverie in 2023 was 48,500 years old, based on radiocarbon dating.",

    "title": "EU delays Russian energy withdrawal plan – FT",
    "article_text": "The EU will once again delay plans to eliminate its dependence on Russian energy, amid ongoing debates within the bloc over the future of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines, the Financial Times has reported. Nord Stream 1, which once delivered Russian natural gas to Germany, and Nord Stream 2 were damaged in a sabotage attack in 2022. However, one string of Nord Stream 2 remains intact. Talks of potentially reviving the pipelines have resurfaced amid recent joint efforts by Russia and the US to end the Ukraine conflict. Originally slated for release in February, a roadmap detailing steps for cutting the EU’s energy reliance on Russia by 2027 was first put off until March and is now expected to be unveiled in May, the outlet said on Tuesday. Uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs has also reportedly contributed to the postponement, as the energy trade could become a key issue in EU-US negotiations. “It’s a mess,”an EU diplomat told the FT.“How does the US fit in all this? How do we diversify?’‘ Brussels is also reportedly seeking legal mechanisms that could enable EU companies to break long-term Russian gas contracts without facing hefty penalties from Moscow. There are also concerns that any resulting legislation could be vetoed by Hungary and Slovakia, which are now receiving the bulk of the remaining Russian pipeline gas delivered to the EU. The EU declared its intention of weaning itself off Russian energy following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Supplies of US gas have replaced much of the cheaper pipeline gas previously delivered by Russia. Although Russian pipeline gas supplies to the EU have plummeted since 2022, the bloc ramped up imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the sanctioned country last year. In 2024, Russia still accounted for around 19% of the bloc’s total gas and LNG supply, according to various estimates. Brussels has yet to specify the measures it intends to propose to speed up the phasing-out of Russian energy. Some experts have reportedly suggested imposing tariffs on its gas imports as one possible tool. The development comes as EU industry leaders have suggested a resumption of gas purchases from Russia. According to Reuters, Germany’s chemical industry is facing a“severe crisis”and urgently needs a return to affordable Russian gas. French energy giants Engie and Total also said they could envision resuming Russian energy imports.",

    "title": "Vance blasts Zelensky for ‘absurd’ claim",
    "article_text": "US Vice President J.D. Vance has accused Vladimir Zelensky of making“absurd”statements, after the Ukrainian leader suggested that Washington is on Russia’s side in the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, Zelensky claimed that“Russian narratives are prevailing in the US”and that Moscow has“enormous influence”on the administration of US President Donald Trump and its policies. Responding in a conversation with the UnHerd outlet published on Tuesday, Vance described Zelensky’s remarks as“certainly not productive.” “I think it is sort of absurd for Zelensky to tell the [US] government, which is currently keeping his entire government and war effort together, that we are somehow on the side of the Russians,”he stressed. “If you want to end the conflict, you have to try to understand where both the Russians and the Ukrainians see their strategic objectives,”Vance added. “That does not mean you morally support the Russian cause, or that you support the full-scale invasion, but you do have to try to understand what are their strategic red lines, in the same way that you have to try to understand what the Ukrainians are trying to get out of the conflict,”he said. Members of the Trump administration“are not on anybody’s side. We are on America’s side,”Vance insisted. Trump and Vance publicly clashed with Zelensky during his visit to the White House in late February, accusing the Ukrainian leader of disrespect toward the US, failing to appreciate American aid, and not being interested in achieving peace with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the Kommersant newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday that Moscow appreciates that“the Trump administration is trying to get to the bottom of the issue and, most importantly, understand the root cause”of the Ukraine conflict. Lavrov also noted that Trump“has repeatedly said that the colossal mistake which led to the current events in Ukraine was the Biden administration’s decision to drag Ukraine into NATO.” Ukrainian neutrality remains one of Moscow’s key demands for a settlement of the conflict, along with the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine and recognition by Kiev that Crimea, the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions are part of Russia.",

    "title": "Washington ‘frustrated’ with European leaders – Vance",
    "article_text": "Washington is“frustrated”by the reluctance of its European allies to respond to their voters on critical issues such as immigration, US Vice President J.D. Vance has stated. In an interview with the British website UnHerd published on Tuesday, he said this sentiment is shared by the entire administration of President Donald Trump. “European populations keep on crying out for more sensible economic and migration policies, and the leaders of Europe keep on going through these elections, and keep on offering the European peoples the opposite of what they seem to have voted for,”Vance explained. He warned that politicians who disregard the will of the people risk ruining“the entire democratic project of the West.” In February, Vance sent shockwaves through the West by criticizing America’s European allies for what he characterized asbackslidingon the democratic values they share with the US. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, he warned that if this continues, Washington could conclude that these nations are not worth protecting as NATO members. Vance criticized politicians who shun parties such as the anti-migration Alternative for Germany (AfD). Last week, the AfD surpassed the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) to become the most popular party in Germany, receiving 25% of support in a hypothetical election. The CDU has engaged incoalitionnegotiations with the Social Democrats (SPD), excluding the AfD from the discussions entirely. In the UnHerd interview, Vance said his criticism stems from a deep love for Europeans and the shared cultural heritage underpinning Western civilization. He alsourgedNATO members in Europe to bolster their militaries instead of relying on security“subsidized by the United States of America.” Tensions between the US and its European allies have grown since Trump took office in January. This is in part due to Washington’s refusal to provide further military aid to Ukraine, the US president’s stated goal of claiming Greenland (an autonomous territory of Denmark) for America, and his attempt at rebalancing international trade through tariffs and deals with individual states.",

    "title": "Trump freezes over $2bn in Harvard funding over ‘non-compliance’",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump has announced it is freezing more than more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard University, after the Ivy League school rejected a list of demands from the White House. A major clash between the administration and some of the country’s top universities has been unfolding in response to how the pro-Palestinian student protests that erupted on campuses last year were handled. Since taking office, Trump has stepped up pressure on universities to address anti-Semitism and dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices. Last week, the White House sent Harvard an“updated and expanded list of demands”it claimed were aimed at combating anti-Semitism on campus. It also issued a warning that the university“must comply”in order to maintain its“financial relationship”with the government. The proposals included changes to the university’s governance, hiring practices, and admissions policies. It also demanded that it eliminate its DEI policies and programs. Harvard rejected the demands on Monday, accusing the White House of attempting to“control”its community. “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,”Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter to the community. He argued that the university took its responsibility to combat anti-Semitism seriously, but accused the government of overstepping its authority. Hours later, the government announced it was freezing billions in federal funding for Harvard, claiming that“the disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable.” “The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,”the statement from the Education Department added. The federal task force earlier cut $400 million in funding for Columbia University and threatened to withhold billions more unless it complied with a list of demands from the Trump administration. Columbia agreed to many of the proposed changes, earning praise from Jewish organizations, while sparking criticism from free-speech advocates who view the move as federal overreach. The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern.",

    "article_text": "Europe cannot remain a“permanent security vassal”of the US, Vice President J.D. Vance has said, stressing that this arrangement is not beneficial for either side. His comments come at time of geopolitical tensions between the US and Europe on a number of issues, including the Ukraine conflict, while the administration of US President Donald Trump demands that other NATO members drastically increase their defense spending. In an interview with UnHerd on Monday, Vance voiced frustration over Europe’s approach to security, arguing that the topic has long been a blind spot for the region.“The reality is – it’s blunt to say it, but it’s also true – that Europe’s entire security infrastructure, for my entire life, has been subsidized by the United States of America.” At present, he continued, only three European nations – the UK, France, and Poland – have self-sustained militaries.“In some ways, they’re the exceptions that prove the rule, that European leaders have radically underinvested in security, and that has to change.” I certainly recognize, that it’s not in Europe’s interest, and it’s not in America’s interest, for Europe to be a permanent security vassal of the United States. The Trump administration has been pushing European nations to invest more in their militaries since Trump’s first term, arguing that the US is shouldering the main burden. In 2014, NATO members pledged to increase their defense spending to 2% of GDP, though some are still struggling to reach this. In February, Trump suggested that NATO members should consider spending as much as 5% of GDP on defense, later warning that“if they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them.” NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte agreed that Trump is right to demand that European members step up defense spending amid tensions with Russia. Numerous Western officials have speculated that Russia could attack European NATO members within a few years. Moscow has dismissed the claim as“nonsense,”saying it has no interest in doing so.",

    "title": "EU state amends constitution to ban gay parades",
    "article_text": "The Hungarian parliament has approved a constitutional amendment that upholds a ban on public LGBTQ+ events earlier introduced in the country. Hungarian MPs voted in legislation last month prohibiting gay parades and allowing the authorities to use facial recognition technology to identify their participants and issue fines of $500. The law was introduced by the ruling Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has declared his government“illiberal”and has vowed to protect the country’s children from“the international gender network”and“woke ideology.” On Monday, MPs adopted an amendment to Hungary’s principal law that codifies the ban, with 140 votes in favor and 21 against. Ahead of the vote, pro-EU opposition politicians and LGBTQ+ activists attempted to block the entrance to the parliamentary parking garage to prevent Fidesz lawmakers from entering the building. Police intervened to remove the protesters, who used zip ties to bind themselves together. Several arrests were reported. Opposition lawmakers used air horns in an attempt to disrupt the proceedings inside the parliament, although the National Assembly speaker continued with the vote despite the disturbance. An MP for the opposition Momentum party, David Bedo, claimed that over the past 15 years Orban and Fidesz“have been dismantling democracy and the rule of law and in the past two or three months, we see that this process has been sped up.” The new amendment declares that children’s rights to moral, physical, and spiritual development supersede any right other than the right to life, including the right to a peaceful assembly. The constitution now states that Hungary protects the right of children to self-identify in accordance with the sex assigned at birth and ensures a system of values based on the country’s Christian culture. It also identifies the institution of marriage as a voluntary“union of one man and one woman”and the family as the basis of the survival of the nation. Hungary outlawed LGBTQ+“propaganda”to minors in 2021, which led to the European Commission launching legal action against Budapest and freezing billions in EU funds over alleged violations of fundamental rights. Orban praised the passing of the amendment in a post on X on Monday, saying that“we are protecting children’s development, affirming that a person is born either male or female, and standing firm against drugs and foreign interference. In Hungary, common sense matters.”",

    "title": "Trump aides clash on trusting Moscow – WSJ",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s senior advisers disagree on whether Moscow genuinely wants a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing anonymous sources. A group led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg are urging greater skepticism, the report said. Trump, however, is siding with diplomatic aide Steve Witkoff, who is said to be more trusting of Moscow. Last week, Witkoff met with President Vladimir Putin, after the two already held talks in March. Moscow maintains that it has always been willing to achieve its core objectives in the conflict through diplomatic means, while Kiev and its Western backers have advocated for escalation. The Russian government, however, has said it will not accept a freeze of the conflict, which will only lead to renewed hostilities later on, citing Ukraine’s violations of a US-proposed moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure as proof of Kiev’s untrustworthiness. As an example of Trump siding with Witkoff, the WSJ cited a missilestrikeon the city of Sumy on Sunday, in which Kiev claimed that Moscow deliberately targeted civilians, killing 34. Trump, however, referred to the incident as a“mistake,”while Rubio’s State Department called it“horrifying”and Kellogg said it crossed“any line of decency.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovsaidthe missiles were launched at“another meeting of Ukrainian military leaders with their Western colleagues”masquerading as mercenaries. The Defense Ministry estimated that the strike killed around 60 troops, claiming that Kiev used civilians as human shields for the gathering. Ukraine’s Vladimir ZelenskytoldCBS News on Sunday that Trump’s criticisms of his leadership indicate that“Russian narratives are winning in the US.” Senior Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev expressed concern about American vulnerability to foreign lobbying after meeting with senior US officials earlier this month, accusing the Western media of waging a coordinated campaign to undermine the normalization of relations. ”We see attempts to misinterpret Russian messages, mischaracterize Russia and its leaders. This happens every day,”he stated, adding that“direct dialogue is the best way to defeat this disinformation.” In an interview on Monday with Fox News, Witkoff said his almost five-hour meeting with Putin was“compelling”and put the Ukraine peace process“on the verge”of a breakthrough.",

    "article_text": "The EU has advised staff traveling to the US to use only basic gadgets and IT devices to reduce the risk of espionage, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing sources. The updates to travel guidance come amid escalating trade tensions between Brussels and Washington over US tariff hikes. Sources said the European Commission issued the new rules for staff heading to upcoming meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Officials have reportedly been instructed to travel with burner phones – prepaid devices not linked to their identity – and stripped-down laptops containing minimal data. They have also reportedly been told to turn off devices and place them in anti-surveillance sleeves upon arrival in the US. The new measures mirror those used for travel to Ukraine and China amid concerns over Russian or Chinese surveillance, the sources claimed. “They are worried about the US getting into the Commission systems,”one source said.“The transatlantic alliance is over,”another added. The European Commission confirmed to the FT it had updated travel guidance but did not specify the changes. Luuk van Middelaar, chief of the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics think tank, told the FT that the guidance reflects a pragmatic shift.“It’s an acceptance of reality by the Commission,”he said, recalling the Obama-erascandawhen WikiLeaks revealed US surveillance of then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her aides. “Washington is not Beijing or Moscow, but it is an adversary that is prone to use extra-legal methods to further its interests and power,”he added. The move follows US President Donald Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcement earlier this month, when he imposed 20% reciprocal duties on EU imports on top of existing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminum, accusing the bloc of“ripping America off”with a 39% duty on US goods. Although Trump later paused the hikes for 90 days, a 10% baseline import duty remains in place. The EU denounced the move and agreed to impose its own duties on US products, but has also paused the move, seeking negotiations and a new trade deal with Washington. The bloc has warned, however, that it could retaliate with tariffs on major US tech firms such as Meta and Google if talks fail. EU-US tensions extend beyond trade. Trump’s threats to withdraw US security guarantees unless the bloc boosts NATO funding prompted an EU-wide militarization push last month. Brussels has also been frustrated over being sidelined in US-Russia talks on Ukraine and the broader thaw in Moscow-Washington relations.",

    "article_text": "The Associated Press has reported that its journalist and photographer were barred from US President Donald Trump’s press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office on Monday. The White House excluded the AP news team despite a court order restoring their access. In February, Trump barred AP from most presidential events after the news agency refused to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the ‘Gulf of America’ in its reporting. Trump officially renamed the gulf in January. “As a global news agency that disseminates information worldwide, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,”the outlet said at the time. Last week, a federal court in Washington, DC ruled that the ban violates the First Amendment.“Under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists –be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere –it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints,”Judge Trevor N. McFadden wrote. The White House is appealing the ruling. According to AP, its reporters remain barred from the Oval Office and Air Force One but receive“sporadic access”to other locations, including briefings by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Trump has frequently attacked what he calls“the lying media,”accusing journalists of spreading“fake news”about him and his administration. Last month, Leavitt criticized an AP reporter for asking what she called an“insulting”question about Trump’s tariff policy.",

    "article_text": "Daniel Sazonov, the son of Russian immigrants, has been elected the next mayor of Helsinki, according to Finnish national broadcaster Yle, citing the results of the municipal election on Monday. Although both the conservative National Coalition Party and their main rivals, the Social Democrats, secured 21 seats each on the city council, the conservatives will appoint the new mayor after winning a larger share of the popular vote. Born in Helsinki in 1993, Sazonov holds a law degree. According to his own website, his parents are Ingrian Finns who emigrated from Russia. The historical region of Ingria spans from Lake Ladoga to the Karelian Isthmus, encompassing the area around present-day St. Petersburg. Sazonov became a Finnish citizen at the age of nine. He was first elected to the Helsinki City Council in 2017 and was appointed deputy mayor for social affairs and health in 2021. According to Yle, Sazonov previously wrote columns for the now-defunct Russian-language newspaper Spektr and its successor, Finskaya Gazeta. He reportedly severed ties with the publication in 2022 due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. “I don’t want to have any dealings with parties that support Russia’s position… In light of the current information, writing for the newspaper was a mistake,”he wrote on X in February.“I haven’t been to Russia in years and have no ties there.” During the Cold War, Finland maintained relatively friendly relations with the Soviet Union. The close ties continued for decades after the collapse of the bloc. Since 2022, however, Finland has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Moscow. In 2023, the Nordic country abandoned its longstanding policy of non-alignment and officially joined NATO.",

    "title": "California attorney general declines to join Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI",
    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 10, 2025. REUTERS/Nathan Howard/File Photo SAN FRANCISCO :     The California attorney general's office declined to join a lawsuit by Elon Musk against OpenAI, the agency wrote in a letter made public on Tuesday, saying that the office did not see how Musk's action serves the public interest of the state. Musk, a co-founder of the ChatGPT maker, is now in a feud with his co-founder Sam Altman, the current OpenAI chief executive over the firm's future. OpenAI wants to remove its nonprofit board as its controlling power in exchange for a valuable equity stake. Musk's suit argues that this would threaten the nonprofit's mission and he had asked the state to join the lawsuit. In the letter dated Monday, the attorney general said Musk had not adequately shown that doing so would benefit the public and  that Musk appeared to want to use OpenAI's charitable assets for his own purposes. In February, a Musk-led consortium made an unsolicited $97 billion bid for control of OpenAI. The California attorney general's office would also need to approve OpenAI's proposed nonprofit transition because OpenAI is based in California. Entities including Meta and a group of philanthropic leaders have written to the attorney general urging it to stop OpenAI's transition. OpenAI has argued that it needs to remove the nonprofit's controlling role in order to raise funds from investors. To secure a $40 billion fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. The nonprofit will retain a stake in OpenAI that will become increasingly valuable as the company grows, providing resources to carry out its mission, the company argues. Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Last year, Musk, who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla, sued OpenAI and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission - to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations. The two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Musk also created his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, and Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Women Wellness Wellness People Living Living Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Obsessions Dining Experiences Dining Experiences Singapore Dining Travel Experiences Entertainment Entertainment A review of Betsy Arakawa's computer showed she was actively researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu-like symptoms between Feb 8 and the morning of Feb 12. FILE - Actor Gene Hackman arrives with his wife, Betsy Arakawa, for the 60th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif., Sunday, Jan. 19, 2003. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File) Authorities in New Mexico on Tuesday (Apr 15) released a lengthy investigation report detailing some of the last emails, phone calls and internet searches by Gene Hackman’s wife in the days before her death, indicating that she was scouring for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques. Betsy Arakawa died in February ofhantavirus pulmonary syndrome–a rare, rodent-borne disease that can led to a range of symptoms that include flu-like illness, headaches, dizziness and severe respiratory distress, investigators have said. Gene Hackman is believed to have died about a week later of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer’s disease. The partially mummified remains of Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 65, werefound in their Santa Fe homeon Feb 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. According to the report released Tuesday, a review of Arakawa's computer showed she was actively researching medical conditions related to COVID-19 and flu-like symptoms between Feb 8 and the morning of Feb 12. The searches included questions about whether COVID could cause dizziness or nosebleeds. She also had mentioned in an email to her masseuse that Hackman had woken up Feb 11 with flu or cold-like symptoms but that a COVID test was negative and she would have to reschedule her appointment for the next day “out of an abundance of caution”. Arakawa's search history also showed a query for a concierge medical service in Santa Fe the morning of Feb 12. A review of her phone records by investigators showed she had a call with the service that lasted less than 2 minutes and missed a return call later that afternoon. Investigators also reviewed a call history to the Hackmans' home phone along with voicemails and security footage from stores that Arakawa had visited on Feb 11. Authorities also are expected to release more redacted police body camera footage from inside the home as sheriff's deputies and investigators tried to piece together what had happened to the couple. The written report describes them going through rooms of the home and finding nothing out of the ordinary and no signs of forced entry. They found paper grocery bags on the floor of the pantry. Inside one bag was a Feb 11 copy of the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper. They also documented a bag of bagels that had been opened, with part of the contents missing. In the living room was a large piano and couches, according to the report. There were pillows on one couch as if someone had been sleeping there. Investigators also described a collection of art, puzzles and drawing supplies in the dining room, and medical supplies like bandages and tape in several kitchen drawers. The materials were being released as the result of a recent court order that mandated any depictions of the deceased couple would have to be blocked from view. All photos, video and documents from the investigation had been restricted from release by an earlier, temporary court order. The Hackman estate and family members had sought to keep the records sealed to protect the family’s constitutional right to privacy. A report by the New Mexico Department of Health showed an environmental assessment of the Hackman property found rodent faeces in several outbuildings and live traps on the property. The inside of the home was clean, with no evidence of rodent activity. Nestled among the piñon and juniper hills overlooking Santa Fe, the Hackman home is not unlike others in the area as mice are common within the surrounding landscape. One of the couple’s three dogs also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, while two other dogs were found alive. A state veterinary lab tied the dog’s death to dehydration and starvation. An attorney for the estate, Kurt Sommer, argued during a hearing last month that the couple had taken great pains to stay out of the public light during their lifetimes and that the right to control the use of their names and likenesses should extend to their estate in death. The Associated Press, CBS News and CBS Studios intervened in the matter, saying in court filings that they would not disseminate images of the couple’s bodies and would blur images to obscure them from other records.

    "title": "5.6-magnitude quake rattles southern Philippines",
    "article_text": "Asia Asia The flag of the Philippines seen in Cagayan De Oro, Philippines. (Photo: iStock) MANILA: A magnitude 5.6 earthquake struck off the southern Philippines on Wednesday (Apr 16), the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, with no immediate reports of damage or casualties. The quake off the coast of the island of Mindanao had a depth of 30km, the USGS added. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology placed the epicentre about 43km southwest of the town of Maitum, located in a mountainous and sparsely populated area. Local authorities told AFP early indications were that the quake had caused no significant damage. \"It was strong but didn't last long. We have checked but it was negative (for damage or casualties),\" said Gilbert Rolifor, a fire department official in Maitum. Quakes are a daily occurrence in the Philippines, which sits along the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", an arc of intense seismic and volcanic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. Most are too weak to be felt by humans, but strong and destructive quakes come at random with no technology available to predict when and where they will happen.

    "title": "Defeated Villa eager to go again in Champions League",
    "article_text": "Sport Sport BIRMINGHAM, England :Narrowly defeated by Paris St Germain at the Champions League quarter-final stage, Aston Villa are now focussed on getting straight back next year into Europe's top club competition. \"I am very proud of everything we did in the Champions League,\" Villa boss Unai Emery said as the dust settled from a pulsating clash with PSG whom they beat 3-2 in Tuesday's second leg but lost 3-1 to in the first game for an overall 5-4 defeat. Villa are seventh in the Premier League but only a point off fifth which would secure them a Champions League berth again. \"It is now most important to get Europe again. The most important competition is the Champions League. The challenge we have for the last six matches (of the Premier League) is to try and get Europe and the Champions League,\" Emery said. His pride at Villa's strong showing, after a four-decade absence from Europe's elite, was tinged with frustration at just failing to pull off a remarkable comeback as they came so close to scoring a fourth goal at Villa Park that would have levelled the tie on aggregate. \"We were close,\" he said, adding that he had to push his team on to achieve ever more. \"Still a little bit more to do better, to try to get it.\" Aston Villa captain John McGinn, who scored on Tuesday, echoed the sentiment. \"Obvious disappointment but I am proud of my teammates, proud of the club. We have come a long way. We were so, so close tonight. We just fell a little bit short,\" he said. \"We had chances to take the game to extra time but we've got to be proud about the way we came back against one of the best teams in the world, to fight to the end. We want more. We want to be back here next season and we will try our best to do that.\" McGinn said the players gave their all against a superb opponent. \"We never gave up. It was chaos, but we gave absolutely everything and I think every Aston Villa supporter will leave with a huge sense of pride,\" he said. \"I've never played against Real Madrid or Barcelona, but in my career they (PSG) are the best team I have faced. I'm getting old and I certainly wouldn't like to play against them every week.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "article_text": "There are signs of springtime all around us: birds chirping; flowers blooming;Jacob Elordicarrying two to-go beverages in one hand, as he iswont to do. During a coffee run in Los Angeles, the Australian actor dressed casually in a zipped-upWilly Chavarriatrack jacket, swishy gray track pants, and two conspicuous Bottega Veneta accessories: silvery Orbit sneakers and a woven Veneto shoulder bag. Elordi isa conspicuous brand ambassadorfor the Italian luxury house—in addition to starring in formally styled campaigns, Elordi is also often photographed carrying Bottega wares out in public—an extension of the label’s uncannily naturalistic, paparazzi-facilitated marketing strategy, for which they have also tappedthe oft-papped likes of A$AP Rocky and Kendall Jenner. (For example, when Elordi and his girlfriend, the influencer Olivia Jade,were photographed en route to the airportfollowing their heavily documented Italian family vacation last fall, the duo just so happened to be carrying threeintrecciato-woven bags between them.) But Elordi, areluctant trendsetterwhose casual outfits tend to inspire an outsized response among the menswear enthusiasts of TikTok, wore another notable accessory on his coffee run: a co-branded Los Angeles Dodgers cap from Kendrick Lamar’s mysterious creative agencypgLang, in the same classic style thatLamar himself frequently wears. (Funnily enough, the rapper also wore a very similar Willy Chavarria jacket inhis “Not Like Us” music video; Lamar and Chavarria also collaborated ona merch collectionfor KDot’s Super Bowl performance.) The hat choice, if you wanted to read intothis sort of thing, is especially interesting given that Drake is still an executive producer on HBO’sEuphoria, on which Elordi stars as the resolutely unpleasant Nate Jacobs. The actor is still on the books to shootthe show’s beleaguered third season.",

    "title": "The Most Expensive Rolex Watches",
    "article_text": "Investigating the most expensive Rolexes is a fascinating exercise because these are not watches that blow you away with massive six-figure pricetags at your local retailer. Of course, the Crown has its fair share of elusive off-catalog pieces that get up there, but many of the most expensive pieces are vintage ones that have skyrocketed in value thanks to provenance and scarcity. Think of the military veteran who bought a Daytona for $346 in the ‘70s andfound out it was worth over $700,000 today. That’s the beauty of the Crown. Where Rolex differs from many of the others is its breadth of price offerings. Their current lineup covers the entry-level Oyster Perpetual at $5,500 and then has an offering at almost every price bracket up to and beyond $100,000. This range lets Rolex stand toe-to-toe (in terms of price) with everyone from TAG Heuer to Patek Philippe. It’s on the secondary market where these pieces really soar. Many of Rolex's vintage pieces change hands well above their original retail price and, in many cases, trade above modern counterparts. Especially, if they’re rare, contain unique features, or gain notoriety among collectors. And let us not forget the grail pieces that find their way to the auction houses. These often-famous watches can fetch eye-watering amounts with the right backstory or famous former owner. Considering modern, vintage, and timepieces at auction, we have three different perspectives on the most expensive Rolex watches ever. The current Rolex collection offers watches in a variety of materials. Steel is the most popular and also the most affordable. For the most expensive Rolex watches we need to be looking at the precious metal variants, like gold and especially platinum. While gold might seem like the more opulent choice, platinum is actually rarer and more difficult to mine and work with. It also gives an exquisitely luxurious feel to any watch with its natural heft. Today, only a few Rolex lines have the honor of coming in platinum: the Daytona, Day-Date, 1908, and newly released Land Dweller collections. For those in the know, the easiest way to spot a platinum Rolex is often the dial color. Rolex reserves its ice blue color solely for platinum pieces to add an extra level of flexing to your expensive Rolex. The final cherry on top of the platinum models are variants that contain diamonds. These are most typically found on specific Daytona and Day-Date references. Beyond these watches, there is a special section of the Rolex lineup considered “off-catalog.” These are the pieces that you won’t find anywhere on the Rolex website but have probably seen on your Instagram feedor on the wrists of watch-collecting celebs. Rolex doesn't like to share the price of these off-catalog watches. I suspect it's one of those situations where if you have to ask the price, it’s probably not for you..However, a bit of digging and a rose gold Rainbow Daytona (ref. 116595RBOW), which contains 36 baguette sapphires matching the colours of the rainbow, will empty your bank account of roughly $97,000. These off-catalog pieces are highly limited and reserved only for the most loyal of collectors. For the general public, the most expensive current Rolex is the platinum Day-Date 40 (ref. 228396TBR). Costing $136,200, the number of gems across the bezel and dial, along with its platinum construction, are what make this watch the most expensive Rolex. Complete with a baguette-diamond bezel, diamond hour markers, a pavé diamond dial, and two blue sapphires for the 6 and 9 o’clock hour markers, it’s advisable to pair it with sunglasses. Vintage Rolex is one of the most collectable genres in the watch world, with many vintage models fetching considerably more than their original sales price and often more than the current collection. The hero models of vintage Rolexare the Daytona, Submariner, and GMT-Master. Within these three collections are specific references that are the most sought after among collectors. Some of the more prominent examples include theSubmariner reference 6538, which is known as the James Bond Sub because of its appearance on Sean Connery’s wrist in 1964’sGoldfinger, from the 1950s. Special variants of the 6530 can reach nearly half a milliondollars at auction. Another hit among collectors is the ref 5517 “MilSub” of the 1970s, which the British Ministry of Defense customized in the ‘70s. It’s distinguished by a small, encircled “T” on the dial, signaling the use of luminescent tritium and its sky-high prices. One version of the 5517 sold for over $600,000at auction in 2021. What makes these vintage models so expensive compared to other watches of the era is driven by a number of factors. Unlike the modern pieces, few of these factors include the number of diamonds on a piece or any involvement of precious metals. What’s most fascinating about these model’s often-extreme pricetags is that they almost always come in humble stainless steel. Instead, what’s pushing the price up are the unique features that make the watch special. Experts estimate that only 3,000 Comex-dial Submariners were made and none of them were ever offered for public sale. As for the 6536 Submariner, who wouldn’t want the original James Bond watch? References that mark the launch of a new model also drive collectors mad. The GMT-Master ref. 6542, launched in 1954, is the most desirable vintage GMT-Master because it was the first-ever of that now-historic line. The final jigsaw piece for an expensive vintage Rolex is rarity. The rarer it is, the higher the price. Rolex has been infamously tight-lipped on production numbers until just last yearwhen they released its first official bookSubmariner. For the first time, Rolex published production numbers for the Sub collection, which is sure to have an impact on vintage model prices moving forward. The most expensive vintage model:The Rolex Daytona 6239, known as the “Paul Newman,” This special reference from the ‘60s is a grail among collectors. With its black dial and art deco font on the subdials, it wasn’t a great seller when it was released so it was never made in huge quantities. Add to this the fact that actor and salad-dressing purveyor Paul Newman was a fan, a good-condition 6239 will set you back over $150,000. For an excellent condition with original papers you could be talking over a quarter of a million. The final take on the most expensive Rolex watches ever leads us to the auction results. What separates these watches from vintage is that these pieces tend to have famous pasts or previous owners that add a substantial premium over the regular models. Daytona are, once again, the favorites of the auction houses and tend to perform best. However, there are notable mentions that offer something a bit different. 5. Marlon Brando’s GMT-Master ($1.95 million) The watch was the exact one worn by Brando in the 1979 filmApocalypse Now. However, this GMT doesn’t have the model’s signature bi-color bezel thanks to some customization from Brando himself. The actor removed the piece himself after director Francis Ford Coppola complained that the character wouldn’t have worn such a watch. 4. The Rolex Antimagnetique ref. 4413 ($2.5 million) The Antimagnetique is a model you may not have heard of, but one went under the hammer at Phillips for $2.5 million in 2015. To this day, it is the only split-second chronograph Rolex has made and only 12 pieces were ever produced. 3. Rolex “Bao Dai” ref. 6062 ($5 million)\\ The name Bao Dai is in reference to the Emperor of Vietnam who was the watch's first owner. Whilst on a trip to Switzerland, the Emperor opted for some retail therapy to find the most precious Rolex he could get his hands on. The 6062—with its diamond hour markers, triple calendar, and moon phase—ticked all the boxes. This is the perfect alchemy for a Rolex on the auction scene: already an incredibly rare and expensive watch that becomes historically important thanks to its former owner. 2. Rolex Daytona ref. 6265 “Unicorn” ($5.9 million) Unlike the other entries on this list, the watch's price isn’t driven by celebrity or royal owners, instead, it’s a one-of-a-kind white gold Daytona. It is widely accepted that this is the only white gold vintage Daytona ever produced. Quite the claim to fame for its new owner. This watch also benefited from growing prices around Rolex and watches in general. The Unicorn sold only a year after the Bao Dai at Phillips. 1. Paul Newman’s Rolex Daytona ref. 6263 ($17.8 million) The most expensive Rolex watch ever sold at auctionis Paul Newman’s Daytona 6263. The 2017 Philipps auction closed with a final price of $ 17.8 million, over three times more than the 6265 Unicorn in second. The watch was a gift from Newman’s wife Joanne Woodward who had the watch engraved with the phrase “Drive Carefully Me,” a nod to her husband's love of motor racing. Owning a “Paul Newman” Daytona is a dream for many watch collectors, but to own Paul Newman’s Paul Newman, and the most expensive Rolex ever, is something special.",

    "title": "Best Shampoo for Curly Hair in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Thebest shampoofor curly hair differs from one guy to the next, since no two curl patterns are the same. There are a ton of variables that can influence and inform which shampoo you should use, from your scalp oil levels, strand density, and porosity to showering habits, which other hair products you use, and more. (And, when you add in environmental factors like humidity, things get even more hairy.) “That’s what makes curly hair so bomb!” says celebrity hairstylistAshley Streicher, anR+Cohair care ambassador. She explains that most curly-haired men have alldifferent kindsof curls on their heads. So, how do you go about finding the best shampoo for your specific mane? Because there are hundreds of products to choose from, and no two ofthoseare alike, either, we put together this short list of our favorite picks for the best curly hair shampoo for men, along with a few key pieces of advice. Sachajuan Sachajuan Key ingredients:Wheat protein and red algae extract provide fortification and prevent frizzing and split ends| Size(s):8.4 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Salon-favorite Sachajuan is among the most universal curl shampoos, providing strands of all densities with its signature “Ocean Silk Technology” composed of marine extracts and strand-strengthening proteins. It’s especially great for dry hair or if you just use shampoo in the shower—and reserve any conditioning efforts for a leave-in conditioner or a styling cream—since it’s one of the most nourishing, conditioning, and hydrating shampoos you’ll find. R+Co BLEU R+Co Key ingredients:Banana fruit extract, black seed oil, and vegan keratin combine for a strand-smoothing, curl-defining reset| Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Naturally curly fine hair strands need a shampoo that won’t cause dryness or drown your strands with too many conditioning agents. R+Co Bleu’s top-shelf curl wash will give thinner curls maximum buoyancy—the perfect warm-up for a leave-in conditioning spritz. American Crew Ulta Key ingredients:Panthenol floods strands with moisture| Size(s):15.2 fl. oz and 33.8 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Moisture, moisture, moisture—that’s what thick, coarse strands need. American Crew is a salon and barbershop staple for good reason: Their products, including this nourishing shampoo, work on a wide variety of styles. This moisture-preserving shampoo is great for strands of all curliness; if you have thick, coarse, or frizzy hair, then this formula will smooth out the cuticle and set you up for cooperative hair days on the regular. Davines Amazon Key ingredients:Plum “phytoceuticals” pump strands full of fortifying antioxidants| Size(s):8.4 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Davines’ curl-care lineupis a knockout assortment, including a dedicated shampoo that could have also taken the top spot on this list. However, this Replumping formula deserves attention for anyone with thinning or receding hair: It can reset hair of all curl patterns and strand densities, which helps to promote thicker hair growth and fuller expression after a rinse. Chase it with a targeted lightweight conditioner or curl cream for perfect definition every time. IGK Amazon Key ingredients:Spirulina protein nourishes strands while a blend of seven plant-based oils smoothes, calms, and fortifies hair| Size(s):8 fl. oz. and 33.9 fl. oz. Why it’s great:If you’ve never used the phrase “life-changing” to describe a shampoo, then here’s where that changes: IGK’s hair wash is the fastest U-turn for frizzy and damaged hair—and for keeping split ends and breakage at bay. Its oil-rich recipe is a super-smoother for even the coarsest strands, and the perfect foundation for thick- and straight-haired individuals, too. Frederick Benjamin Walmart Key ingredients:Natural oils from spearmint and clove stimulate the scalp while hemp seed calms inflammation or itching| Size(s):12 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Frederick Benjamin’s paraben-free shampoo is great in curls of any length, but it’s especially good for short styles of all textures. The invigorating recipe takes a scalp-centric approach, leaving your hair feeling tingly fresh thanks to its spearmint-powered recipe. If you want to use one shampoo until the end of time, then here’s your choice. (As an added bonus, it’s extremely cost-effective.) Prose Prose Key ingredients:Changes with each formula to target the needs of the customer| Size(s):8.5 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Prose switches up the formula based on everything from your strand density and scalp oil levels to your styling goals, hair dye, water hardness, and more. You’ll get a recipe that suits your specific needs—and curls. Carol's Daughter Walmart Key ingredients:Shea butter and panthenol provide nourishing, smoothing reset| Size(s):12 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Pro Tip: Don’t overwash your curls, even if you have oily hair. Too much shampoo could be overstripping that much-needed moisture they need for definition and bounce. So, every second (and maybe third) wash, swap in aco-wash—that is, a conditioning rinse, like Carol’s Daughter’s Hair Milk. It provides enough of a cleanse to keep your scalp refreshed while flooding strands with moisture and conditioning agents. It’s a perfect pick for the minimalist, as well as for the light-packing traveler who wants to lather on a hero hair care product while away from home. Bumble and Bumble Amazon The last thing you want when you have curly hair—or any type of hair, really—is a shampoo that's going to dry you out and overly strip your hair of its natural oils. This curl moisturizing shampoo works into a great lather, smells terrific, and leaves your hair feeling soft and supple. Davines Davines GQ's senior commerce editor Ian Burke loves this bottle from Davines. “It smells great and doesn't dry out my scalp at all,” he says. The ingredients in this bottle not only moisturize your hair, but also help boost the elasticity of your curls. Amazon Dermstore Sachajuan Yes, even Sachajuan's Moisturizing Shampoo—though not specifically designed for curls—is great for curly hair. We're huge fans of the brand's entire line of products, and this unbelievably good-smelling bottle will have you feeling like you're at a fancy hotel. Cécred Ulta This color-safe shampoo from Cécred is a great choice for all hair types and textures, and uses a blend of baobab, moringa, and black seed oils to leave your strands feeling hydrated and strong. (OneGQstaffer swears by this stuff.) Before you start adding anything with aloe and coconut oil into your Amazon cart, start by identifying your curl type and the texture of your curls, Streicher says. Most people will default to choosing a shampoo based on curl pattern (think: wavy hair, coily hair, etc.). However, that part factors in more when it comes to styling—instead, focus on your hair needs and whether you have fine, coarse, or thick hair. “For fine, thin texture, you’ll want a shampoo that’s hydrating but not too heavy,” Streicher explains. “For curls and hair textures that are a bit coarser and thicker, you will want something a bit [more moisturizing].” That same logic goes into straight hair shampoos, too—thicker and coarser hair usually requires more heft from nourishing ingredients, while fine strands can’t risk any weighing down. However, that doesn’t mean your search ends there: It’s possible to optimize your best hair routine even further by assessing everything from curl pattern and hair type to humidity levels, oil levels, dandruff, buildup, and more. For that, you may need to call in the help of a barber, stylist, skin care professional, or dermatologist who can help you work towards specific hair goals. Streicher says that finding a great hair routine and products that work with your particular needs is part of a hair-care professional’s responsibility and that you should take the opportunity to talk through it next time you’re at the barber or salon. Remember: Shampoo is only the start of any hair care regimen; think of it as clearing the canvas upon which you’ll apply a deep conditioner and/or styling products. (Read: If you only use shampoo, you’ll be much more susceptible tofrizz—ditto if you touch your curls throughout the day, Streicher says.) So, don’t rely solely on a clarifying shampoo to keep your curls defined and healthy; incorporate shampoo & conditioner along with other products in your regimen so you can keep your hair strong and style-ready every day. What is the best shampoo for curly hair​? The best overall shampoo for curly hair is, in our opinion,Sachajuan Curl Shampoo. What is the best dandruff shampoo for curly hair​? If you're dealing with dandruff, we recommend using ashampoo designed for dry scalpsand other dandruff-specific products. We especially love the scalp-soothing products fromCorpusand the anti-dandruff trio fromJupiter. What is the best clarifying shampoo for curly hair​?

    "title": "Is It Worth Going Into Debt for Coachella?",
    "article_text": "Last Monday, America watched in panic as the stock market plummeted in record time, but by Thursday, a deluge of dreamy photos with desert backdrops flooded social media, officially ushering in the first weekend ofCoachella. If these posts seemed like they were beamed in from an alternate reality where everyone can afford a luxury vacation without a care, it’s because they basically were. Much of the content coming out of Coachella is sponsored in one way or another, if not fully paid for by brands. They fly influencers into Palm Springs from all over the world, putting them up in massive estates with private chefs and a weekend’s worth of outfit changes and beauty products, plus party buses that shuttle guests to and from the grounds. Meanwhile, VIP or “artist passes” allow them unfettered access to the fenced-in areas where Kylie and Timmy hang out. In exchange, the invited few are required to post from the brand’s house and after-party, resulting in all of those shots featuring logoed floats and umbrellas around glowing blue pools, and selfies in mirrors that bear the brand’s name. I saw a TikTok last year that I will never forget, likeningCoachella houses to fraternity or sorority recruitment. It’s clear to anyone following along at home that most of the content coming out of the festival wasn’t about the music. Rather, it depicted a stark divide between the haves and the have nots: Those posting from branded events and influencer trips with gifted tickets and clothing, and, on the flip side, those complaining about poor festival organization, the astronomical cost of food and beverage on site (including$17 cups of regular, non-alcoholic lemonade and $11 slices of pizza), andreported 12-hour wait times to enter the campground, just to scratch the surface. VIP sections are nothing new, but what makes the new divide between the Coachella attendees so glaring is how expensive general admission tickets, like allconcerttickets, have become: GA passes started at $649 without transportation to the festival grounds this year, while VIP tickets for the first weekend were a whopping $1399. Areported60 percentof attendees used payment plansto buy their Coachella tickets in 2025; when Coachella first introduced installment plans in 2009, just18 percent of attendeesused them, but back then, a three-day pass only cost $269 before fees. Unfortunately, this development falls in line with a wider cultural trend that makes payment plans largely inescapable. (Just last month, DoorDash announced a partnership with Klarna, allowing you to order your burrito bowl now and pay for it in installments later.) In an ironic twist, one of the biggest headlines from the first weekend was thatBernie Sanderstook time out of his “Fighting the Oligarchy” tour to introduceClairo’sset on Saturday night. He warned the audience about their dire need to stand up and fight for economic and social justice, speaking to an inequality that, in a small way, was playing out in real time on the polo fields right in front of him. Sanders’s appearance felt remarkable because, over the past decade, Coachella has essentially devolved into a multi-million dollar marketing activation. (These events also lure non-influencers with gifting suites or free swag.) Aside from a masterful headline performance from Lady Gaga on Friday and Charli XCX’s reprise ofBrat Summeron Saturday, the brands made more noise than the lineup. Sponsored events that came across my timeline throughout the weekend include, but are not limited to: Tequila, celebrity skincare, influencer fashion, jeans, different jeans, music tech, celebrity wellness, a different wellness by the same celebrity, celebrity makeup, fast food chicken, canned vodka, celebrity canned vodka, canned tequila, and wellness soda. While celebrities are often quiet about the mechanics of paid appearances, influencers are not—so it’s becoming common knowledge that certain levels of talent (or those with a certain follower count) won’t attend Coachella or its surrounding events for less than a five or six-figure fee. This is a bummer across the board for Coachella attendees, no matter which camp they fall into: Young people, for whom music festivals are a rite of passage, spend an exorbitant sum to get stuck at an event that caters to influencers—and are treated accordingly. Celebrities, who once got to party undercover with their friends sectioned off from the general public, go viral on TikTok in stealth fan-captured footage, or have to fulfill yet another work obligation. If a celebrity isn't attending a brand’s party, they're likely there to promote their own; takeHailey Bieberand Kendall Jenner, for example, who went to the festival after hosting a collaborative event for their respective brands Rhode and 818 Tequila. Of course, it’s not all work and no play for those on the payroll: Charli XCX,party girl extraordinaire, masterfully split the difference between her artist and brand deal duties, making a surprise appearance at a meet-and-greet for her fans sponsored by Aperol Spritz, and bringing all of her friends along to her set. Her Saturday night mainstage crew rolled deep, with her muses Gabbriette and Alex Consani watching from the front of the pit, and her friends-slash-collaborators Lorde, Troye Sivan, and Billie Eilish making cameos on stage. Even the celebrity street style seemed to communicate “I’m just here to collect my check.” There was a much more minimalist approach to dressing for the festival than in years past, likely as a way to separate themselves from the influencer hopefuls who are gunning to have an outfit post go viral. Emma Chamberlain made a series of videos showing her shopping her own closet for this year’s festival, and Lorde took the stage for Charli XCX's set in a plain t-shirt. Kylie and Timmy flew under the radar dressed like a normie couple, with Jenner in a white t-shirt and camouflage hat,while her boyfriend was in baggy shorts, carrying a giant backpack. Gettingfully glammed for the festivalis no longer a flex for them. It often feels, these days, like becoming an influencer, celebrity, or brand founder is the ticket to upward mobility, and Coachella is the ultimate business convention for this sector of the economy. But is it worth going into debt for what essentially amounts to a sponsored activation? As with most things in America, it appears that only the very wealthy or connected can have a comfortable experience (unless you’re on the correct amount of drugs, probably). If you can watch the headliners live-streamed from your couch—where Lady Gaga, Charli XCX, Green Day, Post Malone, and Travis Scott broadcast part of their sets, andwhichGQheartily endorses—spending the thousands of dollars on literally anything else sounds much more appealing.",

    "article_text": "The newHarry Pottercast is taking shape, thirteen years after the final installment of the original film series. That's right—it's been almost a decade and a half sinceThe Deathly Hallows Pt. II, which is a pretty long time to go without a reboot for a franchise as huge asHarry Potter, not least in the age of rapacious IP exploitation. Yeah, sure, theFantastic Beastsmovies scratched an itch for the wannabe wizards of the world, and the triple-A video gameHogwarts Legacyprovided a veritable Floo Network for millions of Potterheads. But neither holds a magically floating candle to the O.G. films, right? So now comes an HBO TV series adapting the originalHarry Potternovels, which is expected to be epic in length, rolling out overthe course of a decade(or more). The film series made stars ofDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson andRupert Grint, and introduced a new generation of fans to beloved British and Irish character actors like Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon,Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane, and Imelda Staunton. There’s little doubt, then, that HBO’sHarry Potteris the hottest casting target for British talent this side ofGame of Thrones, even if enthusiasm for the project has been dampened byPottercreatorJ.K. Rowling's ongoing social-media crusade against trans rights. (HBO head Casey Bloys has described Rowling as “fairly involved” with the series’ development, while noting that her presence hasn't put anyone off signing up, perIndieWire.) Nevertheless, all involved have a formidable challenge on their hands. Can they live up to the beloved character portrayals that gave the movies their magic? We should know a year or so from now — the series is set to begin shooting this year with an anticipated debut on HBO Max in 2026. We also know that Harry, Ron and Hermione will be cast from a pool of unknown child actors, as was the case with the films. The latest big news for theHarry Pottercast? HBO have officially confirmed the four biggest adult parts in the Potterverse: it'll be John Lithgow as Dumbledore, Janet McTeer as McGonagall, Nick Frost as Hagrid, and Paapa Essiedu as Snape. Casting is well underway, then. But who should get the wands, robes, and magic motorbike? For this exercise, think ofGQas the sorting hat, as we pick through the most eligible British actors to join HBO’s new Potterverse. Actor/comedian Nick Frost, a mainstay of Edgar Wright'sCornetto Trilogy, is confirmed for Hagrid. It's the perfect marriage of role and actor, as far as we're concerned: Hogwarts' very own BFG will allow Frost to play a less immediately comic part than we'd usually associate him with, while his own comedic instincts will surely bring out Hagrid's funnier side. At one point,Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein was reportedly up for the role—which would have been a very different direction indeed. Nevertheless, HBO have confirmed that it'll be Frost on the magic motorbike. John Lithgow. Following months of speculation, HBO finally confirmed in mid-April that it'll be veteran actor John Lithgow as Dumbledore. Casting an American inPotter's second biggest role might come with its own dose of controversy for British fans, but lay down the torches for a moment. Nailing the British accent is nothing to an actor of Lithgow's caliber (recall his turn as Winston Churchill inThe Crown), and perhaps it's only fair that an American should take the role of one of modern fiction's most famous Englishmen for once, given how Britain's acting exports disproportionately dominate the small screen across the Atlantic. Besides which, Lithgow's many Emmys and Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Janet McTeer. It'll be Janet McTeer ofAlbert Nobbs,OzarkandThe Menuas McGonagall, the Hogwarts matriarch played by the late, great Maggie Smith in the films. Smith is another tough example to live up to, but McTeer certainly has the talent and look. HBO's confirmation came in mid-April after months of speculation; names previously circulated for the role included Sharon Horgan (ofBad Sisters). Paapa Essiedu. I May Destroy YouandThe Lazarus Project's Paapa Essiedu has been officially announced as the next Snape. His star has rapidly risen in recent years, with roles inGangs of London, Saoirse Ronan's filmThe Outrun, and a standout turn inBlack Mirrorserving to cement his screen bonafides. Expect hisHarry Potterpart to shoot him into the A-list stratosphere—andwe have no doubthe'll match up to the might of Alan Rickman. Screen newcomer Luke Thallon, the 29-year-old actor fresh off his acclaimed run as Hamlet for the Royal Shakespeare Company, has been cast as Professor Quirrell. Notably, it's his first major screen credit; could we see him take the reigns as Voldemort later down the line, too? Another astute casting comes in the form of British comedy legend Paul Whitehouse as Filch. TheFast Showstar might be a surprising pick for Filch, Hogwart's ill-tempered muggle cleaner, but maybe that's the point—HBO appears to be leaning into comedy with thisHarry Pottercast, and Whitehouse might help file off Filch's rough edges. Cillian Murphy. You need a serpentine, slippery fellow for He Who Must Not Be Named—the sort of actor whose very presence can feel terrifying. (It also helps if you can picture them taking on the look of Munch’s The Scream after a few hours of prosthetics and make-up.) The obvious pick, if his recent Oscar win hasn’t taken him out of the running, would beCillian Murphy, whose sharp, spooky angularity just feelsrightfor old Vold. In April, Warner Bros TV head Channing Dungey told Deadline “I have no comment, no comment, no comment” when asked if Murphy was in the running for Dumbledore, an answer that only stoked this fire. She did say that they were “still weighing a couple of different options there,” however. It should also be noted that Murphy is being “eyed up” to play Professor Quirrell according to insiderDanielRPK(viaGamingBible), the Defence Against the Dark Arts tutor who is essentially possessed by Voldemort inHarry Potter and the Philosopher Stone—you'll recall that the dark wizard takes up residency on the back of Quirrell's head, hidden under a headwrap. This would probably preclude Murphy from taking on Voldemort, but perhaps there is a creative way around such double-casting. For a younger pick, we'd suggest the HBOPotterbosses look no further thanStranger Things’Jamie Campbell Bower, whose villainous Vecna is as gross and spine-chillingly malignant as you’d ever want Voldemort to be. He did play the young version of another evil wizard, Grindelwald, in thePotterfilm universe. But does that really matter? Kit Harington. He's unhinged, erratic, and just a little bit disheveled—but, crucially, kind of endearing. The Sirius Black formula is a tough one to crack. Do you go the Gary Oldman route and recruit an actor you can reliably expect to perform to the back of the hall, or go for someone who will offer a subtler approach to Black's inner turmoil? Either way,Kit Haringtonwould be our first choice: he's a range-y performer who fits the age profile, can play to both Black's light and shade, and he just seems like he'd be a cool godfather. A word here, too, for fellowGame of ThronesalumnusRichard Madden, who carries many of the same qualities, though we'd expect a more introspective version of Black from him. Some fringe shouts could beBenedict Cumberbatch, although he's on the upper end of the likely age range. And could fellow MCU actorTom Hiddlestoninject Black with a little of Loki's mania? He certainly seems the right fit from the A-list Hollywood crop—and it's worth noting that, at 43, he's around the same age as Oldman when he shotPrisoner of Azkaban, give or take a few years. Mia Goth. The way that we imagine Bellatrix is so specific to Helena Bonham Carter that it'll be an uphill battle for anyone who is called upon to bring their own interpretation to the role—but such is the case for most of this cast. To our mind, the standout nominee would beMia Goth, the scream queen whose turn in 2022'sPearlwas considered Oscar-worthy enough for commentators to question why another performance in a horror film had been snubbed after she missed out on a nomination. Her knack for playing women on the edge would serve Bellatrix well. Phoebe Waller-Bridge. One of the hottest casting rumors around HBO'sPotterproject is thatPhoebe Waller-Bridgehas been offered the role of Harry's pompous Aunt Petunia, played by Irish acting legend Fiona Shaw in the original film series. (This tip also comes from the insiderDanielRPK.) At 39, Waller-Bridge is about the right age, and it should also be said that she has a similar look to Shaw. Plus, there was always a campy humor to Petunia—almost drag-like with her rich red lipstick, Marge Simpson pearls and cartoonish Thatcher scowl—that you could see theFleabagcreator tapping into with great success. But who might be her Vernon? Give it toMatt Berry, who would surely make the most delicious opera out of line reads like “No post on Sundays—ha!” This post originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "5 Best Beard Styles for Bald Guys, According to a Veteran Barber",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Whether by choice or chance, plenty of guys arebald. Having a lack oflocksis not only a signature look anymore; it's super common, and it can look great. Just look at Jason Statham,The Rock, or Samuel L. Jackson. Being bald isn't an outlier; it carries a sense of groomed ruggedness. But (if you can) growing abeardis a great way to balance a smooth dome with some personality and complement your look. \"Facial hair with a bald head adds style and texture,\" says David Connor, master barber and owner ofAnti-Gravity Salonin New Orleans. Of course, not every guy can grow every type of beard, and not all beards are the same—the best beard styles for a bald guy depends on your head shape. \"Just like guys with a full head of hair, it's important to choose your beard shape wisely, especially when you don't have hair on top,\" Connor explains. \"Ask yourself: What shape is my head? Where am I trying to lead people's eyes?\" At the end of the day, your hair or beard speaks to your uniqueness and vibe, and a beard is the best natural accessory for bald men. We consulted with Connor to break down the five best beard styles for bald guys—what they are, why they work, and how to achieve them. Stubble, or the classic 5 o’clock shadow, is that short, slightly grown-in layer of hair that emerges after a fresh shave. \"The name comes from the idea that if you shave in the morning, by the afternoon, you’ll have a light shadow,\" Connor explains. \"But really, this look can develop over two to three days of growth and still achieve the same effect.\" Why It Works: For bald men, this style is a game-changer. \"It works great because it addstextureto the head and prevents that ‘cue ball’ effect,\" Connor says. \"Since it's long enough to be outlined, it contours the face and creates a well-balanced, groomed but effortless look, especially when paired with a clean-shaved head.\" How to Achieve It: When visiting the barber, simply ask for the 5 o’clock shadow. \"Your barber will use clippers on your face, anywhere from an open taper arm to a 0.5 guard, to create the shadowed look,\" Connor advises. \"Technically, this isn’t a beard but a subtle shading of texture. Use a trimmer or razor for clean contouring.\" The anchored stache is a goatee-style beard that is disconnected from the mustache, with clean-shaven cheeks. \"This look extends outwards along the jawline, which can accentuate, shape, or strengthen the jaw,\" Connor explains. Why It Works: It’s a natural match for bald men. \"[It] works well with a shaved head because it draws attention to thelipsand jawline,\" Connor says. \"It’s also a great tool for enhancing facial structure.\" How to Achieve It: Connor advises showing your barber reference pictures. But if at home, \"start with #1.5 or 2 guard, though the length can be adjusted.\" Use the trimmer to clear the area above and below the cheekbone. \"You'll also want to outline slightly below and above the jaw.\" A trimmer works well for a defined outline when shaping the mustache, but scissors are best for longer mustaches.\" A circle beard is a combination of a mustache and goatee that connects around the mouth, though not all versions are perfectly circular. \"Some have sharp edges and actually form a square shape,\" Connor notes. Why It Works: This style works especially well with a shaved head as it \"it draws attention straight to the chin and lips,\" Connor explains. \"Even though it doesn’t touch the cheeks or jawline, it adds strength and structure to the face from the front. Depending on placement, it can also enhance the neck and jawline.\" How to Achieve It: “Ask your barber for a circle beard and decide on the shape, whether rounded or squared. A 1.5 guard is great for density while keeping things clean, but if you prefer a fuller look, go with a 2 or 3 guard. Use atrimmerto outline and shave down the cheeks and neck area for definition.” A short boxed beard is a full-beard style that extends from the sideburns, covering the jawline and top of the cheeks. \"It’s excellent for adding masculinity and contouring the face,\" Connor says. \"Defined edges make it sharp, but for a more organic look, soften them.\" Why It Works: For bald men, this beard creates an effective contrast. \"It pairs really well with a shaved head, but the key is tapering into the sideburns instead of leaving a harsh line,\" Connor advises. \"That transition adds aesthetic value and cohesion.\" How to Achieve It: If you’re shaping it at home, Connor recommends “outlining the beard with a trimmer along the roundest parts of your cheek and neck to add structure. Start with a 1.5 guard and work your way up to your ideal length, but don’t go beyond a #4 guard, or you risk creating an upside-down lightbulb shape, which throws off the symmetry. For a polished finish, taper down the guards as you move toward the shaved head.” An anchor beard is a goatee variation where the facial hair in the chin area extends outward toward the mustache but remains disconnected. \"It’s slightly wider at the chin than the mustache, forming an anchor-like shape,\" Connor explains. Why It Works: This style is particularly flattering for bald men as “it builds strength and presence in the jaw and chin area,\" Connor says. \"It’s a stylish, detailed look that naturally draws attention.\" How to Achieve It: When getting this beard, \"ask your barber to outline the shape using a trimmer and determine your ideal length with a clipper, typically between a #1 and #2 guard,\" Connor suggests. A short faded beard is fuller in the jaw area and gradually blends into shorter lengths toward the cheeks and sideburns. “It’s a versatile option that enhances facial definition without looking too heavy or unkempt.” Why It Works: \"This is probably my favorite beard for bald men,\" Connor states. \"It blends seamlessly into a shaved head while defining the face, jawline, and cheekbones.\" How to Achieve It: For the best results, \"ask your barber for a faded beard. Start with your desired length—anywhere up to a #3 or #4 guard—then gradually transition shorter as you move up the cheek and sideburn area, working down in guard sizes until you reach trimmer length. This ensures a seamless connection between the beard and the shaved head.\" Remington Amazon Walmart The five rotary heads of the Remington Balder Pro XR7000 give any stubbly dome a honeycomb hug for bump-free polishing, no matter how thick or curly your hair. And clean-up is as simple as a rinse under the faucet. Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart This model has the most muscle of any rotary device, mowing through even the curliest and thickest stubble. Even still, it manages to be gentle on sensitive skin despite its six rotary blades. It’s definitely a superior crossover device compared to any electric foil shaver. Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Philips Norelco’s Multigroom 9000 Series is, hands down, the best beard trimmer you can buy. And that’s before factoring in how much more it can do than just keep your facial hair in check than other electricrazorsthat are found in your everyday grooming kit. Hatteker Amazon Walmart This all-in-one kit covers every kind of hair-trimming task, from lineups to sideburns to beards, eyebrows, andbody hair. What's more, its a hair cutting machine for full beards and stubble alike with multiple plastic guards.

    "title": "9 Best Hair Clippers in 2025: Tested by GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. There's no shame in theDIY hair-cutting game, and the best hair clippers will serve you well, whether you're trying to cut corners and save cash on those barbershop visits (parents, I see you!) or don’t need anything fancy beyond a half-inch DIY buzz cut. Heck, some of us simply get sick of having long hair and want to do the ceremonial mowing down at home. I’ve been there a few times and relish in those memories. No matter how frequently you reach for them, the best hair clippers get the job done for you. But before I get into our picks, if you're looking for clipper inspiration, check out ourat-home buzz cut guide,the best celebrity buzz cuts, as well as the imperativebeard-to-hair ratio rules—so that you feel confident when it's time to take things into your own hand. And now, here are the best hair clippers for DIY use, plus a couple of professional picks and some pro advice on what to look for when buying hair clippers. Wahl Amazon Walmart Cutting lengths:0.5-25mm| Charge time:6 hours| Run time:2 hours| Zero gap:No| Warranty:5 years Why we love it:This tool makes things easy, gives the best DIY results, and costs much less than its competition. When it comes to at-home haircuts, I urge you to keep things simple. You do not need a lot of complexity from a device. If you're looking to do something wild—and I can't stress this enough—go to a barber. Otherwise, Wahl has got you. Its color-coded guard system helps you gauge how much you're taking off and what you'll wind up with. The bare-guard clip has an adjustable lever to give you slight variance in your base, which also makes it easy to do some fancy tapering at the perimeter (I know my mother would have loved that back in the day while buzzing her three boys). Between its 1/16” light green clip and the light blue, one-inch clip, the device has a terrific range of length options, with especially sturdy guards that do not have any “give,” meaning you always get consistent results. This newest model has a lithium-ion battery that holds for twice as long as the previous option (two hours versus one) and will keep its juice for nine months idly without draining. This trimmer is imperative to own for any parents who want to buzz their kids’ hair and save a fortune on frequent haircuts—especially since the kids can opt into so many different hair-cutting lengths and since it’s much easier to remember the length you used based on the color-coded system here. (“Dad always buzzes my hair on bright red,” for example.) BaByliss PRO Amazon Cutting lengths:0.5-19mm| Charge time:3 hours| Run time:3 hours| Zero gap:Yes| Warranty:2 years Why we love it:I feel like I’m holding an Oscar whenever I handle my gold BaBylissPRO and a high-powered motorized Oscar, at that. I got switched on to its awesomeness from a barber friend of mine—JoAnn Noriega,who cuts atHeadprint Studioin San Francisco. Since this is my pick for the best pro device, I’ll leave it to her professional opinion as to why: “This device has exceptional cutting performance, providing precise and effortless trims,” she says. “I can tackle any hair type orstyle, plus its long-lasting battery is a game changer in my busy day.” I’m not the only one who likes that trophy-esque plating, either: “Its sleek gold finish adds a touch of luxury to my toolkit, providing me both quality and style,” says Noriega. “All of my clients comment on how they want to get cut with my gold clippers.” Bevel Amazon Bevel Cutting lengths:0-10mm| Waterproof:No| Run time:4 hours| Zero gap:Yes| Warranty:1 year Why we love it:As much as we love the best Wahl hair trimmers, they don’t have muchcoolfactor. On the other hand, the Bevel Pro clippers definitely pass the vibes test. (They nabbed aGQGrooming Award in 2022.) These famous clippers have a sculptural, geometric body, an LED smart display, a sharp zero-gap blade, and an extra-powerful motor that’s strong enough for the barbershop. I’d even go so far as to call these clippers sexy. While they’re made specifically for textured hair, the zero-gap blade is also suitable for bald, coily, andshort-haired guys. You can use it to trim your beard, too. Yes, it’s pricey, but there’s nothing else like it in the grooming world. Normally, when you want to adjust a zero-gap clipper, you have to pop off the blade and manually adjust it with a tiny dial. Not so here—when you press one of the two buttons on the Bevel Pro, a second internal motor automatically opens/closes the graphite-coated stainless steel blade in 0.1mm increments. It’s so subtle you’ll have to look closely to see the difference, but every millimeter matters if you want clean lines and fades. With the included comb guards, you can trim hair from 0.0mm to 10mm. Not only are the guards sturdier than most, but they also pop on magnetically with a satisfying click. The Pro even comes with an extra-slim blade for touchups. Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Cutting lengths:2mm-16mm with hair clipper guards, 0.5mm-16mm overall| Charge time:3 hours| Run time:6 hours| Zero gap:No| Warranty:8 years Why we love it:So, you want a trimmer and hair clipper, but you don’t want to drop $250 on asalon-qualitytool. Enter the Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000, which has been our pick for thebest beard trimmerfor three years running. This waterproofgrooming toolhas incredible muscle and endurance—more than enough to mow through thick patches of head hair. Its self-sharpening blades eliminate the need for blade oil. The Multigroom 9000 is one of the only multitasking beard trimmer and hair clipper devices I’ll recommend, and it’s the right choice if you only occasionally need to touch up your hair at home. The same goes for guys who trim their beard more often than their dome. Wahl Professional Amazon Cutting lengths:0.5mm to 1 inch| Waterproof:No| Run time:2 hours| Zero gap:No| Warranty:2 years Why we love it:You’ll notice this guide to the best hair trimmers for men is dominated by a single brand: Wahl. Hair trimming is very much Wahl’s turf, and they make the best hair clippers for barbers and home touch-ups alike. And according to Wahl, this is the best-selling professional hair clipper in the world (and we believe them). The Magic Clip is part of Wahl’s 5 Star professional line of products for barbers, and I love the retro-tech vibes. I also love the powerful pro-level motor, which provides even trimming so you don’t have to do multiple passes on every patch of hair. The ubiquitous Wahl Color Pro trimmer I praised earlier is a smart choice for your first clipper (it was mine). But when you’re ready for something a bit more powerful, skip right past Wahl’s $50-$100 trimmers and pick up this tool instead. I’ve tried most of Wahl’s clippers made for home use, but the Color Pro is the only one I can really recommend. Sure, the Magic Clip is moderately pricey, but with an under-$200 price tag, it’s more affordable than other pro options from brands like Bevel. The Magic Clip comes with sturdy titanium-coated high-carbon steel blades, plus all the standard comb guards you’d find at your local barbershop. Panasonic Amazon Panasonic Cutting lengths:0.5-30mm| Waterproof:Yes| Charge time:1 hour |Run time:90 minutes| Zero gap:No| Warranty:2 years Why we love it:Back in 2021,GQcalled this versatile devicea God-tier groomer, and it’s only gotten better since then. The MultiShape comes with a cordless handle and swappable wet/dry heads and accessories, and you can use it as a beard trimmer, electric shaver, body groomer, hair clipper, electric toothbrush, nose hair trimmer, and facial brush. You can buy some limited sets at Amazon, but I recommend going toPanasonicand customizing your MultiShape to get all the attachments you need. The motor isn’t as powerful as professional trimmers from Wahl, BaByBlissPRO, or Bevel, but nothing comes close to matching the versatility. (There’s a reason it’s landed in our guides to thebest beard trimmers,electric razors, and now hair clippers.) Plus, while most trimmers max out at 0.8” to 1” cutting lengths, the MultiShape goes all the way up to about 1.2”, making it the best hair clipper for long hair. Still, I thinkshort-haired guyswill love it, too. This multitasking device can mow down everything to a stubble (if you so please), and then allows you to swap on that wide-set foil shaver, to take things down to a smooth finish. One device for buzz cuts, long hair, and bald guys—perfection. Andis Amazon Cutting lengths:0-3/8\"| Charge time:2.5 hours| Run time:2 hours| Zero gap:Yes| Warranty:1 year Why we love it:This is technically a trimmer, not a clipper, but it belongs on this roundup because of its superb ability to draw clean lines everywhere. It’s a barber favorite for those line ups, neckline cleanups, and its natural ability to trim at zero-gap length with minimal skin risk compared to other zero-gapping devices. If you regularly line yourself up at home, or if you want to draw clean cheek lines, necklines, sideburns, and beyond—then absolutely invest in the Andis’ Slimline Pro. Wahl Amazon Cutting lengths:0.5-13mm| Corded Use:Yes| Zero gap:No| Warranty:2 years Why we love it:While I’m the proud owner of a regular corded Wahl Peanut, I need to also call out the newly updatedcordless option, the Peanut Li. Normally, a product loses motor power when it goes cordless, but the new version actually has a stronger 7,000rpm motor. Either of these devices are perfect for traveling, given how petite the Peanut is (just 4 inches!). And I’d argue that the corded option (mine pictured here) is even better for the guy who forgets to charge up his devices since it’ll always have power. As much as I love going cordless, the regular Peanut has earned a cult following as a pro-level clipper for home use, it’s pretty cute too. Wahl Professional Amazon Cutting lengths:0.0-16mm| Waterproof:No |Run time:2.5 hours| Zero gap:Yes| Warranty:2 years Why we love it:Wahls been on a tear lately, releasing the cordlessPeanut Liand the5 Star Vapor. If you’re looking for a true zero-gap trimmer with the most powerful-possible motor, then this is the device you want. It’s so powerful my partner complained about the racket it made, and the 8,000rpm motor slices through even the thickest hair. Wahl calls this the first “adjustable balding blade,” and it was made for barbers working on bald cuts and fades. It has extra-sharp blades, a comfy ergonomic feel in your hand, and makes it easy to blend bald fades (at least, for professionals—YMMV). The blade looksrazor sharp, and for bald cuts, it includes dozens of fine ball-pointed teeth to reduce nicks and snags as it moves across your skin. In short, it’s another true barber-quality clipper from Wahl you can also use at home. Bevel Amazon Is this a bit of a splurge? Definitely—but if you're looking for barbershop quality in a compact, cordless package, this is a good option. Its four-hour rechargeable battery means you won't have to worry about it dying mid-cut, and the sleek design looks great on a shelf. BaBylissPRO Amazon With a powerful brushless motor and a built-in oil reservoir for constant lubrication, the FXONE LO-PROFX Hair Clipper is a great choice for barbers and DIY buzz-cutters alike. It comes with eight comb attachments and sports a two-year limited warranty, to boot. Andis Amazon Designed for “years of heavy use by barbers and stylists,” the Andis Master boasts adjustable, extra-sharp, carbon-steel blades along with a sleek, “indestructible” (their words) aluminum casing. Included is a blade guard and blade oil. Remington Amazon This uber-affordable tool is ideal if you're looking for a no-frills clipper that can double as a beard trimmer in a pinch. It's easy to clean, it's powerful, and it comes with a beard brush and styling comb—a nice touch. What you need from men’s hair clippers at home is much different from what barbers need in professional hair clippers. So I think the best place to start is to differentiate between the qualities that are important for the DIY hair cutter, as opposed to the barber clippers. For that advice, I got an assist from barber and STMNT Grooming Goods ambassadorJovan Figueroa. Here is his very excellent two cents on the most important qualities in a DIY hair cutter. And then there are a few less important qualities for at-home hair clippers. These factors aren’tasimportant for your at-home search, though they're still good things to consider. After more than a decade on the men’s grooming beat, I’ve spoken with dozens of barbers, stylists, and professional groomers about their go-to hair clippers and have tested countless products myself. Long before I started this venture in grooming journalism, I was the frugal shopper who wanted a device that allowed for consistent, easy buzzcuts. Would it shock you that, no matter how many devices I test, my favorite always remains the Wahl Color Pro? (My own mother used it on my brothers and me as a kid.) I remain open-minded to any device that comes along to dethrone it, but for now—in terms of what at-home consumers need from the best hair clippers—I compare everything against that intuitive, durable device. What is the best hair clipper for men, according toGQ? The best men’s hair clipper for most people is Wahl’s Color Pro Cordless for its intuitive use and low cost. As we say atGQ, most people shouldn’t be giving themselves a fancy haircut. So if you require more than a simple buzz, visit the pros. Beard trimmer vs. hair clippers: What’s the difference? While many devices can be used as both beard trimmers and hair clippers, these devices differ in their approach to hair cutting: Beard trimmers typically require less power (since facial hair tends to be less dense) but also more precision on the average device. Meanwhile, hair clippers require more muscle to mow through thicker patches of hair, and the pros will use additional detailing devices for any fancy edgework. Also, beard trimmers are often waterproof, while hair clippers are less likely to be so. What does zero gap mean with hair clippers? Think of zero gapping as the ability to get an actual skin-tight clip from your hair clippers. This is done by a slight realignment of the blades so that the hairs can reach right up to those teeth. It’s usually only found on professional clippers and should be left to the pros, given the risks of cutting your skin so close to the blade. (We repeat: Proceed with caution.) How do you fade your own hair? It’s best to let a professional barber or stylist fade your hair,howeverthe general logic behind fading is to steadily decrease the clipper length (starting with a low trim or bare shave at the perimeter). If you insist on doing this yourself, then readGQ’sguide tofading your own hair. Are hair clippers allowed on airplanes? Yes, your hair clippers are allowed on the airplane, but only in your carry-on hand baggage. Nothing with fixed batteries can be checked in the cargo.

The smooth, golden-brown suede panels on the uppers—a tribute tothe jacket Michael Jordan woreto accept his Rookie of the Year honors in 1985—paired especially well withdark denim, which helped make the shoes a must-have for style-minded sneaker collectors. To this day, the ‘Rookie of the Year’ high-tops remain highly coveted, with certain sizesfetching upwards of $1,000 on the secondary market. Now, right on schedule, the beloved colorway is returning—this time on the red-hot Air Jordan 1Lowsilhouette. For years, the Air Jordan 1 High was the only version of the sneaker that really mattered to collectors. It’sthe OG after all, the style that His Airness himself wore on the court, and any variations felt simply like pretenders to the throne. But while theAJ1 Mid still doesn’t fully receive the respect it deserves, the low-top version has fared far better in sneaker circles in recent years, thanks in part to its visual similarity to Nike classics like theDunk LowandAir Force 1. This week’s ‘Rookie of the Year’ drop marks just one of a slew of much-hyped Air Jordan 1 Low colorways due to release this year—including thetimeless ‘Chicago,’expected to hit during the holidays. The Air Jordan 1 OG Retro Low ‘Rookie of the Year’ was originally slated to release in early January, but it wound up being postponed until later this week. That’s somewhat fortuitous timing, as the NBA will likely announce the winner of the 2025 Rookie of the Year not long after—odds are on the Spurs’ Stephon Castle or the Hawks’ Zaccharie Risacher to take the crown. Whoever winds up winning, there’s one new sneaker they’re all but obligated to wear to the ceremony. You can cop a pair of your own on April 18 for $140 viaNike.com or the SNKRS app.",

    "title": "What Is Waxed Canvas? A 101 Guide to the Tough-as-Nails Spring Jacket Material",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. When that sunny spring day suddenly turns unbearably cold and wet, and thestandard-issue light jacketyou left the house in is no longer cutting it, there’s only one solution: waxed canvas. For generations, stylish folks have turned to the hardwearing fabric to keep them warm and dry in the face of foul weather. Waxed canvas jacketsage gracefully when properly cared for, taking life’s bumps and scrapes and turning them into a patina that stands as a visual hallmark of utility and quality. They work great whether you’re riding a motorcycle across the Pacific Northwest, hiking your way across the English countryside, or simply commuting to your office on a crappy April morning. Question is: What exactlyiswaxed canvas, anyway? How is it made, where does it come from, and how do you care for it? Let’s get into all that. There are two parts to it. Makers start with a sturdy canvas—that hefty, often tan material typically featured induffel bags, sails, orworkwear—and add a layer of wax as weatherproofing. The canvas is typically made of cotton, linen, or a blend of natural fibers, but most often a heavyweight cotton duck—a tightly woven plain-weave fabric known for its durability and smooth finish. Unlike looser weaves, cotton duck is dense enough to resist tearing while still allowing for a bit of breathability. The fabric’s strength comes from those tightly organized threads. Unlike flimsier textiles, it doesn’t rely on bulk to be strong, but weaves the durability right in. As the fabric breaks in, it becomes more flexible without ever feeling weaker, even as the wax applied to its surface breaks down and needs to be reapplied over the years. The wax element is typically paraffin- or oil-based, designed to be weather resistant and flexible, and applied to garments or items with heat during the manufacturing process. The oils seep into the spaces between the canvas threads and help repel water and block wind while allowing for some passage of air. LikeGore-Tex, however, it’s not a perfect system—waxed canvas is generally less suited to warmer, more humid environments as a result. Today’s waxed canvas is a departure from the previous process that British fishermen used to weatherproof gear in the late 1800s. “Back then, tar coated the bottom of fishing boats and the men would paint it on their smocks, too,” says Ian Bergin, head of menswear atBarbour, one of the first companies to recognize the marketability of the weatherproof material. “Tar is really effective, it’s a really good kind of waterproof agent, but it cracks when temperatures get low. So they started using a combination of oil and fish oil because it’s much more viscous, it sinks into cotton quite easily, but obviously it’s got a quite a strong smell.” It’s hard to pinpoint the catalyst for change—perhaps the stink, petrochemicals’ rise in popularity, or demand for a more lasting solution—but at the turn of the century, industry leaders started experimenting with alternatives. Three major mills in Scotland—British Millerain, Halley Stevenson and Dinsmore—began testing the effects of hydrocarbon and oil to waterproof cotton. That’s when wax cotton really took off. John Barbour initially set out to create industrial wear for the workforce of England’s North East. Fishing, agriculture, ship building, mining—they were all thriving and in need of gear that would protect them from the region’s elements. A lot of heavy rain, a lot of wind for most of the year. “People only used to own one coat, so it needed to do the job for lots of different things, really” says Bergin. “Today, we are very closely associated with a British country lifestyle, but our start was quite an industrial company.” Wax canvas was adopted shortly thereafter overseas by farmers and fishermen in Japan, and bushmen and motorcyclists in North America, all who recognized it for its utility. L.L. Bean’s catalogs in the 1920s began providing alternatives to the already standard British brands like Barbour and Belstaff, featuring their own hunting jackets and game bags in waxed cotton and reflecting the material’s global standing in the realm of utilitarian wear. By the 1950s, as makers pivoted production back away from military contracts to consumers, wax canvas also migrated from workwear to wardrobe essential.Queen Elizabeth IIwas often spotted wearing her Barbour jacket on royal walkabouts at Balmoral, and across the Atlantic, Steve McQueen brought it to the American fashion lexicon from the seat of a motorcycle. Fifty years later, as the birth of the Internet sent interest in and access to heritage menswear and Americana surging, blogs and brands brought wax canvas back to the mainstream. “Everyone wanted that perfect Barbour,” says Jeremy Smith, co-owner of Standard & Strange, a menswear shop known for high-quality, heritage-inspired goods. “We had just a shitload of clones… Everlane, Taylor Stitch, all those guys were just blasting out wax canvas clones of the classic Belstaff or Barbour. Everyone wanted that gritty, heritage look—but not everyone wanted to deal with the actual material.” Like the good-for-life material itself, the trend has stuck around. Daniel Craig’s Bond wore a Barbour Beacon jacket inSkyfall, characteristically blending British grit with modern tailoring, and more recentlyPedro Pascal displayed its apocalyptic steez inThe Last of Us. Tough stuff still deserves care, and in the case of waxed canvas, if you want it to last, there’s a process. “You can’t just chuck a waxed garment in the washing machine to clean it,” says Smith. “It’s almost like taking care of a pair of boots. You wouldn’t put a pair of nice boots in the washing machine.” All waxed canvas will dry and wear over time, leaving the surface looking dull or patchy. When that happens, consider rewaxing—either at home with a tin and some patience, or by taking it to a pro. “If you warm the wax up properly, it’s a little bit messy—you need to clear up after yourselves, but it’s not hard,” says Bergin. “Personally, I couldn’t be bothered. I just send it in.” Annual rewaxing may be called for if you’re wearing it a lot or putting it through the paces with extreme weather or physical work, but done right, this simple maintenance ritual can dramatically extend the life of a jacket. “If you take care of it, you rewax it regularly, you’ll have a jacket for life,” says Bergin. But perhaps the most beautiful thing about waxed canvas is that if you don’t care for it, that’s okay too. Some prefer to let the canvas go dry and develop a chalky, broken-in finish that shows its history. Waxed canvas is not perfect. It stiffens in the cold, requires maintenance or it’ll wear drastically, and will never, ever pack down into your carry on. But your great great grandfather wasn’t fussed about carrying on and didn’t need any tech fabric. He wanted to stay dry and warm and needed a coat that he could rely on day after day even after it got oily or muddy or frayed. And unless you’re working harder than he was, it’ll probably still work for you too. Time to start breaking in some waxed canvas of your own.

    "title": "Why Men Are So Obsessed With Morning Routines",
    "article_text": "It’s 3:30 a.m. Other than a few night-shift workers, insomniacs, and ravers, the world is asleep. But not Mark Wahlberg. His alarm has just gone off, jolting him awake for along morningof eating, praying, working out, and sitting in his cryo recovery chamber. Not far behind him isApple CEO Tim Cook, whose eyelids flicker open at3:45, so he can tackle some of the hundreds of customer feedback emails in his inbox before starting the meat of his day. At 3:52 exactly, the fitness coach and influencer Ashton Hall—whose elaborate,Patrick Bateman-esque morning routinerecently went viral—is up and at it, ready forseveral hours of fitness, dunking his face in iced Saratoga mineral water, and rubbing said face with banana peel. Now it’s 4 a.m., and the ranks of the successful and productive are really getting going. Robin Sharma, the self-help guru and author ofThe 5 a.m. Club, is up—“4 a.m. is the new 5 a.m.” hetoldGQrecently—for a “victory hour” of “meditation, visualization and prayer.” Disney CEO Bob Iger is ready to begin his morning workout. At 5, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel is centering himself for 45 minutes of meditation, JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon is flicking throughthe first of five newspapers, and Bryan Johnson, the tech entrepreneur turned longevity obsessive, is checking his inner ear temperature “toassessif anything is amiss,” heath-wise. On weekdays, I am usually up just after 8, when Hall is climbing out of the swimming pool. On weekends, I’m proud of myself if I’m up around 9, when Hall is on a work video call, saying, “So, looking at it, bro, we gotta go ahead and get in at least 10,000.”10,000 what? In aroutine videoposted after the original blew up, Hall slipped in a wry nod to that much-memed line: “You’ve made your first 10,000, congratulations—we gotta do at least 20, bro.” It indicates at least a degree of self-awareness regarding the mockery and endless parodies (my favorite: aguygetting up at 11:32 and gargling with the dregs of a Red Bull can) the original video was greeted with. But, as the extravagantly early wakeups of all those tech titans indicate, the obsessive morning routine is more than a joke. Online influencers popularized it, and non-celebrities have come to swear by it as a central plank of productivity and self-improvement. “Own your morning. Elevate your life,” Sharma writes inThe 5 a.m. Club. “Win the morning and you win the day,” says Tim Ferriss, another self-help mogul. Though a few notable women are on board—Michelle Obama gets up at 4;30; Jennifer Lopez, 4:45—the earliness and elaborateness of these routines has a distinctly macho sheen.Get up earlier. Do more journalling. Lift heavier weights.And on it goes. This is funny, given how, historically, a marker of male success was being able to afford to do as little as possible, especially before noon. Glamorous aristocrats and playboys were more likely to be in the casino than the gym in the early hours of the morning.Sprezzatura, the Italian concept of effortless, nonchalant grace, was coined in the 16thcentury and has been invoked ever since. So why has one masculine ideal, of effortlessness and indulgence, been overtaken another, of ceaseless hustle culture? In a word: anxiety. Anxiety hums in the background of all these morning routine videos. Even the hyper-precise time stamps and jerky editing instill a baseline level of tension. This new age of male anxiety comes from male success being a rarer beast than it once was. There are the universal factors that affect everyone, like unstable employment and a precarious economy. But men, particularly white men, now also face more competition than they’ve been accustomed to, as barriers to entry to various areas of society are knocked down. In 2022, three British women started collegefor every two men; 21-to-26-year-old women in the UK now have aslightly higher median incomethan men in the same age bracket. Gender parity being long overdue doesn’t make the shock to men any less bracing. And there have been aftershocks: the rise of the manosphere and incel culture, as chronicled inAdolescenceand elsewhere, as well as more widespread, mundane trends like a growing fitness obsession (after-work pints are out; after-work gym sessions are in). When your job is unstable, and everyday prices are at the mercy of tariffs and other geopolitical happenings, the one thing you can control is your squat routine—or indeed, the time you get up in the morning. The importance of ritual and routine to a good life is well-established, and we all uphold our own micro-traditions. On Saturday mornings, I like to water my spider plant and spritz my bedroom with room spray. (Look, it’s the little things.) But outlandish, performative routines like Hall’s swallow up your life entirely, and are sold with an almost existential urgency, as if unclenching from them for an instant will send you into an abyss of mediocrity. In an age where no one quite knows what it means to be a man—and those who purport to know offer little more than curdled chauvinism—losing yourself in 4 a.m. push-ups has an unsurprising appeal. “You can reinvent your entire life in one year,” Hall’s Instagram bio reads. It’s a line that’s meant to project a can-do optimism. Perhaps there’s a whisper of insecurity in there too.",

    "title": "13 Best Chinos for Men in 2025: For Work and the Weekend",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best chinos for men are more than just an office-appropriate alternative to jeans. As far back as World War II, stylish fellas have prized ‘em for their rugged durability and goes-with-everything sensibility. Few pants, after all, feel as at home covered in grease in a mechanic’s garage as they do at a garden party in Martha’s Vineyard. You can wear a pair of chinos with a beefy Oxford cloth button-down andslip-onsat home, a crispwhite T-shirtand scuffedsneakersto the bodega, or ablazerand loafers at your friend’s laid-back wedding upstate. Come to think of it, chinos are kind of like jeans—just way more versatile. There's never been a better time to refresh your chinos. After a decade or so of slim fits dominating the conversation, brands are shifting back towards straight-fit silhouettes that are more comfortable, wearable, and timeless. So when you’re sick of all the bonkers prints and voluminous cuts dominating the rest of your wardrobe, the unflappable pairs here—the verybestchinos on the market today—will be just the palate cleanser you need. J.Crew J.Crew Avidan is 5’11” and weighs about 155 lbs. Fit:Relaxed straight |Material:100% cotton |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Sizes:28-44 waist; 30-36 length As far as we’re concerned, J.Crew’s chinos stand alone in virtually every category. The fabric is crisp and dense, decidedly not flimsy yet feels lived in. The construction is on par with other chinos that cost more than double, and the silhouette is an unimpeachable classic straight-fit that’s roomy but tailored—noticeably more room than a pair of Levi’s 501 jeans, but distinctively less baggy than the brand’s viral Giant-fit chinos (which are also tremendous). They come in a grip of classic office-approved colors but you can expect to see some seasonal prints and fabrics throughout the year. For a hair under a hundred bones, they’re the best value for miles. J.Crew's wildly viral Giant-Fit chinos eliciteda whole lot of buzzwhen they debuted, saysGQsenior commerce editor Avidan Grossman. “But most of the menswear-pilled monsters I know prefer the more classic version,\" which comes sans cuff, and rendered in a hardy, broken-in cotton that's crisper than a welcome spring breeze. “The fabric alone is worth the price of admission,” Grossman notes, “but perfectly dialed fit and the attention to detail—peep the era-authentic flap pockets!—is part and parcel of the Crew'sBabenzian era.” Grossman spent months looking for chinos exactly like this in a tricky-to-find shade of washed gray, before hightailing it to the mall to end his journey for good. Save yourself the headache andstartthere first. Dickies Amazon Avidan is 5’11” and weighs about 155 lbs. Fit:Straight |Material:65% Polyester, 35% Cotton |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Sizes:28-52 waist; 28-36 length If you want to squeeze the most green out of your hard-earned dollars, the best budget chinos have to be a hardy pair of Dickies 874s. Are theytechnicallywork pants? Sure. Will most people be able to tell the difference? No, especially if you wear it with an untucked shirt or with a blazer. The iconic workwear label has been making its 874 pants for decades, outfitting jobsites for generations, but just because they’re made for hard manual labor doesn’t mean they can’t hold their own around an air-conditioned office. The pants have a mid-high rise with a slightly relaxed straight leg and a permanent center crease—all the makings for a solid dress pant. The Dickies 874 is a poly-cotton blend that’s stiff and a bit rough, but has a sheen that cleans up real nice. Not only are they affordable, they come in a ton of different colors so you can stock the rainbow if you really wanted to. For what it's worth, I think the Dickies 874 are one of his best-fitting pants, period. They’re damn-near perfect, and I’ve even worn them to formal events as a dress pant and they looked great. If you’re in a pinch and need some tailored pants fast, you could cop these at your local army surplus store or have them shipped quick with Prime shipping. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Avidan is 5’11” and weighs about 155 lbs. Fit:Relaxed |Material:100% cotton, Japanese selvedge twill |Fly:Button fly |Colors:Khaki, black, olive, white |Sizes:28-38 waist; 30-34 length J.Crew’s chinos are great for all the reasons we’ve already talked about. But if you want to upgrade your rig with better materials, an even better fit, and better construction, you should buy the Todd Snyder Relaxed Fit Chinos. They’re made with a medium weight Japanese selvedge twill that’s got a soft drape and peachy hand. The fit takes after mid-century chinos and khakis with a rise that reaches your natural waist and a wide leg that splits the difference between J.Crew’s classic chino and their Giant-fit chinos. Truth be told, I've amasseda small museum of chinos, and I love vintage chinos for their loose cut and superior quality, and these Todd's selvedge chinos are on par. Plus, you don’t have to spend hours digging through thrift stores. For about $300, they’re certainly an investment, one we think is worth it for the quality. But if that’s too rich for your blood, we also like Todd Snyder’srelaxed fit Favorite Chino, which runs at $188 and has the same fit and nearly identical details, minus the fancy Japanese fabric. Uniqlo Uniqlo Avidan is 5’11” and weighs about 155 lbs. Fit:Slim |Material:97% Cotton, 3% Spandex |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Sizes:27-40 waist; 34\" length The zeitgeist may be all about baggy, but the truth is the state of fashion is really more of an anything-goes situation. So if you’re still after a pair of slim-fit chinos in this Year of Our Lord 2025, there’s no shame in that. And we would suggest you get your legs into a pair of Uniqlo chinos. They’ve been best sellers for years for their tailored cut, solid and slightly stretchy twill fabric which uses the ever-durable and smooth gold-standard of cotton, Supima cotton. With a pair of loafers or some low-profile sneakers like the Adidas Samba, they look clean as a whistle. And because it’s Uniqlo, you’re getting a tremendous value for $50. Studio Nicholson Studio Nicholson SSENSE Avidan is 5’11” and weighs about 155 lbs. Fit:Wide-leg |Material:100% cotton twill |Fly:Zip |Colors:Khaki, black, white |Sizes:30-40 Shifting to the complete opposite end of the spectrum from Uniqlo Slim Chinos in almost every possible way, we present to you the ultimate capital-F Fashion chinos: the Studio Nicholson Sorte trousers. The cut is as wide as a California highway with a high rise, the Italian peached cotton fabric is miles away from most chinos you’ll encounter (in a good way), and the design is clean but far from boring thanks to its deep, deep pleats, rear patch pockets, and widened belt loops. The result is a pair of chinos that leans into formality and workwear in equal measure—the duality of man! While most chinos might be too dusty for the more experienced fashion guy, the Sorte trousers are ones that you’d definitely find in their closets, whether their style is quiet luxury, preppy, streetwear, or avant-garde. Alex Mill Alex Mill Fit:Relaxed-taper |Material:98% cotton, 2% elastane |Fly:Zip |Colors:Khaki, black, navy, oat milk |Sizes:28-38 waist; regular-long length If you’re after a pair of pleated chinos, Alex Mill’s Standard Pleated Pant are a shoe-in. Pleated chinos? In this fashion landscape? Yes. No do longer are pleated chinos sound terribly dusty. The long rise, relaxed thigh, tapered leg, and cropped hem are actually on par with some of the coolest silhouettes coming out of Japan. They feel like they honor the genre while updating it for the modern era of fashion enthusiasts. They may call them “standard,” but we would happily disagree. Oh, and if you think they’re a touch too short, they also offer them in a longer length. J.Crew J.Crew Like our overall winner, J.Crew's big-fit chinos are 100% cotton twill and come in a variety of colors.Unlikeour overall winner, they’re ultra-wide with a leg opening of 20.5”. But beware: If you're not a fan of pre-cuffed hems, you might want to bust out a seam ripper and an iron. Casatlantic Casatlantic Viral amongst the connoisseurs, Casatlantic built its label on high-rise, wide-legged trousers. Not only are they made to give you that 50s-era swag, the quality is top tier as well. Carthartt WIP Huckberry If you're on the hunt for a slim option, the Sid Pant is a cotton-blend twill pant that's tapered through the leg for a modern fit. It also has a wee bit of stretch for movement. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason’s aptitude for archive retrieval is top tier, and these chinos are loaded with vintage details from the olive drab herringbone twill fabric to the single-piece Hollywood waist band to the felled seams and more. Buzz Rickson Self Edge The diehard vintage guys already know that Buzz Rickson is elite when it comes to reproductions of classic militaria and workwear. These ‘40s-inspired chinos feature period-correct details like tin buttons, all-cotton sewing thread, and a silhouette that’s true to the era—high-waisted and very baggy. RRL Huckberry Brian Davis—the expert we consulted for this story—says that if you have the money to spend, these are a great option that hit a lot of vintage details right on the head. But beware, he says “they make a slim option—stay away.” NN07 Mr Porter NN07's Aden chino offers a classic straight leg fit cut in a modern cotton-blend twill that offers touch more comfortable stretch. Knickerbocker Knickerbocker Pleats have the unique ability to instantly turn a pair of pants from plain to fantastic. Just askDanny DeVito. Knickerbocker’s Canal pants are a prime example with deep, double reverse pleats done up in a rinsed cotton twill which toes the line between casual and classy. Brian Davis, owner of vintage storeWooden Sleepers, is among the most knowledgeable menswear guys in general, but also a huge nerd (complimentary) when it comes to chinos. “Chino’s have really been put through the cultural ringer. People need to be reminded that chino started out as workwear and military uniform. They were designed to be rugged.” Though chinos these days stray further and further away from its roots and have heaps of sacrilegious synthetics and non-iron treatments, there’s still hope in spite of it all. A classic pair of chinos is usually made from a mid-weight cotton twill fabric that fall smack dab in between a typical shirting fabric and your average pair of blue jeans. (For the nerds, that’s about 8-ounces). They’ll fit like a well-tailored trouser, with a mid- or high-rise and, generally, a darted rear waist to hug your bum in the most flattering way. Many higher-quality chinos will also include a curtained waistband, which is an extra piece of fabric fixed to the inside of the waistband. This helps reinforce the waist, prevent it from rolling, keeps the pockets lying flat, and covers the inner seam work (don’t worry, it’s really notnecessary). In terms of fabric, heavier is generally better. “The old military chinos were made of an 8-ounce cotton twill,” Davis says. “This feels substantial, well-made and softens overtime.” While lighter materials are great for the hotter seasons, he has his opinions on that. “Also, fabric that is too lightweight is no good - too clingy and wimpy.” Davis also says to try and avoid synthetic and stretchy materials when you can because they won’t age as well as natural fabrics. Fit is paramount, regardless of the garment, but chinos in particular. You want to make sure the fabric isn’t pulling anywhere, which would indicate the fit is too tight. But you also don’t want too much room in the crotch or seat lest you fall prey to dumpy butt or balloon lap. Today’s chino market has more silhouettes than any one person should really need to consider, but Davis lays it out simply. “Ideally, a chino should have a nice long rise and a full straight leg (8-9” opening). I always come back to that episode ofMad Menwhere Don was putting a playhouse together in a pair of mil-surplus chinos and a tucked in white tee—perfection!” To kick off the process, we enlisted a who's who of GQ staffers to wear-test our contenders. Some of our colleagues have worked in retail; others have toiled for small-batch labels; all spend objectively too much time thinking about pants. We leaned on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrowed down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Collectively, we've worn and tested hundreds of pairs of chinos over the years. Our testers owned some of the chinos on this list already, but a whole bunch were totally new to us. So after wear-testing the entire crop, we recorded ourdeeply scientificobservations and rejiggered our selections accordingly. Based on those evaluations, we ran the numbers, collated the anecdotal evidence, and emerged with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best chinos for men right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a pair here for you. (Read more aboutGQ'stesting processhere.) How should chino pants fit? Fit is all relative. But if that advice isn’t practical enough for you we suggest a few things. The best fit for most people is a classic straight fit, perhaps even a slightly relaxed fit. The silhouette du jour changes every few years, but if you split the difference and stick with a fit that’s middle-of-the-road, you’re much less likely to ruffle any feathers with your bosses, with the wedding party, and save yourself some embarrassment should you go down memory lane. At the end of the day, you should like what you see in the mirror. What's the difference between chinos and khakis? In short, chino is a fabric, and khaki is a color. However, two terms are typically used interchangeably to refer to a style of trouser. Both are usually made from a cotton-twill fabric with slanted hand pockets as well as welted pockets at the rear (as opposed to the patched pockets you'd find on a pair of jeans). But the menswear cognoscenti will tell you that khakis tend to use sturdier fabrics while chinos are slightly lighter. Not only that, khakis are tied to the dusty beige color from which they gets their name, so you’re more likely to see a pair of navy cotton twill pants dubbed as chinos rather than khakis. Can I wear chinos to a wedding? That depends on the wedding. Chinos aren't as dressy as suit pants, but if it's an outdoor wedding or if the wedding invite says to dress semi-formal or if it says ‘casual’ anywhere in the invite, chinos are a safe bet. But we'd advise that you wear your chinos with a button-up shirt and a tie at the very least, if not with a matching cotton blazer.",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best men's linen shirts are a refreshing summer treat, like an Aperol Spritz you can store in your closet, no mini-fridge required. Here atGQ, we’ve long maintained that linen shirts aren’texclusivelyseasonal—their texture-heavy vibe and breezy feel come in handy year-round in our age of terrifying, topsy-turvy weather turbulence—but when the mercury soars and layering opportunities are negligible, they’re no longer nice-to-haves:they’re essentials. It’s not just linen’s physical properties that excel in the summer, either. The fabric’s preternaturally relaxed appearance—those telltale wrinkles very much included—compliments the season’s laid-back energy like a fresh orange wedge in your wine glass. All of which leads us to the crux of the matter today, the raison d'être of the very article you’re reading: thegreat linen boomwe're in, which kicked off last year andhas since exploded in size and reach. You could read all sorts of macro implications in the fabric’s ubiquity (see: Dome, heat) but we’re content to focus on the upside and leave the glum scientific research to you. Brands are rolling out entire collections focused on linen, retailers are buying it by the metric ton, and hardly a day goes by that wedon’tspot a nubby linen shirt we’d do unspeakable things to get our hands on. So to help you flex your flax this season, we aggregated the very best of them below, each vetted, tested, and (barely) sweated in by us. J.Crew J.Crew Reed is 5’9” and weighs about 145 lbs. The best linen shirts should be as easy to wear astheir oxford counterparts—and about twice as comfortable when the temperatures turn sinister. J.Crew's doesn’t just check every box, it adds a few more to the list. For starters, it’s made with anIrishlinen—a.k.a. the finest version of the fabric—sourced from the Baird McNutt mill, one the finest linen mills in Ireland. (Easy math there.) It also boasts a Goldilocks fit—not too boxy, not too slim—that’s amenable to any breeze, big or small. It looks great rumpled or crisp, can deftly slide in under a suit, and also plays well with jeans, shorts or, heck,jorts. Oh, and it’s under $100. We probably should've led with that. “J.Crew’s linen shirts return every spring and summer for a reason,” says GQ style commerce writer Gerald Ortiz. “The fabric is top-notch, they come in a variety of silhouettes that fit just about everyone, and they're available in a gang of great colors and patterns.” Ortiz says that the linen fabric feels especially cool to the touch and silky smooth. “For the price, quality, and variety, why would you go anywhere else?” Bather Bather Reed is 5’9” and weighs about 145 lbs. Sometimes, a style of shirt works well in linen. And sometimes, it absolutelythrivesin linen.Camp shirts are the latter—and Bather's riff is one of our favorites, period. It starts with an assertive, unambiguous camp collar before moving into three (3!) pockets at the front—including two at the hem that offer more utility than you might imagine—and ends with an easy-going flat hem that works well buttoned or open. The linen fabric is robust, which lends it just a bit of structure, but because it’s linen, it stays airy regardless of the thermometer reading. Just because it’scalledthe Traveler shirt doesn’t mean you won’t love it at home. This isn't the first time we've waxed eloquent on Bather's signature button-up: way back in 2022, GQ contributor Eugene Lardy pennedthe definitive odeto the style, which ended his quest to find the platonic summer shirt. Two years ago, Lardy praised the shirt for how cool it looked, sure, but also how cool hefeltwearing it, “like a welcome midday breeze” was gently buffeting his torso. “What I initially thought was going to be a fairly straightforward camp shirt,” Lardy wrote, “ended up revolutionizing my summer fits. I can’t take it off. Its breathable construction makes it ideal forwarm weather layering, and those nifty trio of pockets offer a level of functionality I never knew I was missing.” Emma Willis Mr. Porter Emma Willis Reed is 5’9” and weighs about 145 lbs. All the work you did to finda breezy summer suitis instantly undone if you pair it with the wrong shirt. Plenty of more casual-leaning options promise to maximize airflow, but when those RSVPs hit your inbox, a proper, capital-D Dress Shirt is your surest bet to make the right impression—and crush the “garden party” theme in the process. The best one we've tried comes from Emma Willis, the storied British shirtmaker headquartered on Jermyn Street, the stretch of London that is to shirts what Savile Row is to suits. The linen is light, airy, and somehow not remotely flimsy; the collars and cuffs hold their shape without feeling stiff; and the silhouette looks equally killer under a jacket early in the evening or leading the charge on the dance floor late at night. “Emma Willis is one of Britain's lesser-known menswear gems, at least stateside” says GQ commerce editor Avidan Grossman. “Her flagship boutique is a stone's throw away from the legendary cutters on Savile Row; she brings the same rigor and craftsmanship her neighbors are famous for to her otherworldlychemises.” Grossman digs how the brand's sizable spread collars look with a funky paisley tie, but he recommends treating its shirts the same way you would any other on this list. If their formal bent (or the tony zip code they hail from) feels daunting, he says, it really shouldn't: “Few shirts looked better wrinkled, sweaty, and with half a bottle of Aperol spilled down the front.” Alex Crane Alex Crane Reed is 5’9” and weighs about 145 lbs. We're not going pretend like there’s anything wrong with wearing a plain-Jane cotton T-shirt in the summer—the more threadbare the better. Compared to linen, though, cotton isn’t actually all that breathable, and it dries like paint. Which is precisely where Alex Crane's perfectly nubby pure linen joint comes in. It’s made with 100% sustainably-grown linen, which adapts to rising temperatures faster than you ever will, and washed with biodegradable softeners to help it feel like a beat-up tee you already know and love. Just, y'know, better. “To keep it a buck, I never though I'd recommend a linentee,” Grossman confesses. “But enough of my buddies keep asking about ‘em, so I did my due diligence.” T-shirts arenotoriously difficult to perfect, but Alex Crane nails the details; Grossman has yet to hear from a friend who regrets the purchase. “Nine months of the year, I prefer a slimmer cut and a tighter neckline,” he says, “but this is exactly how a tee should fit when you're sweating through your fifth park hang in as many weeks.” Wythe Wythe New York Reed is 5’9” and weighs about 145 lbs. If your flannel went on vacation it would come back looking an awful lot like Wythe's Hometeam work shirt. The plaid is just as rugged as its cold-weather counterparts and the construction is rock-solid, but it’s crafted from a super soft linen-cotton fabric that breathes like a window screen and wears like a hand-me-down. Don't let the out-of-the-box comfort fool you, though: It's built to last years, not seasons. “My personal qualm with most linen shirts isn't their wrinkly nature,\" Ortiz says: “it's that they're too stiff or suspiciously thin.” Wythe's version is the exception to the rule, he mantains—the fabric really does feel vintage, like it's been washed and worn to perfection. If youareworried about wrinkles, Ortiz notes that the shirt's mix of cotton and linen lends it the latter's telltale breathability and the former's crispiness. As for the fit, it’s a spot-on relaxed, yet tailored fit. For reference, Ortiz is 5’9” and weighs about 165lbs. Banana Republic Banana Republic In the LCU (that's the Linen Cinematic Universe, FYI), thelinen polo shirtmight be as underrated a character as the linen tee—until now. This loose-knit number, with a super dry and airy linen yarn, shows exactly why savvy guys are stocking up. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder A super soft linen, an easy-going cut, and the kind of construction details that will keep you coming back, summer after summer after summer. Todd Snyder, you spoil us. Madewell Madewell If you’re keeping linen confined to the poolside, you’re missing out. Madewell's elegant, vintage-inflected joint is ready for any fancy dinner you have in the calendar. Buck Mason Buck Mason A luncheonette-worthy camp collar combined with a wildly lightweight linen twill, dressed up in some military green? This is the short-sleeved linen shirt to rule them all. Portuguese Flannel Mr. Porter We’re not saying youneeda white linen shirt, but wearesaying that a good white linen shirt will become indispensable the moment you get it. Stóffa Mr. Porter A spread collar that looks like it drives the nicest car you’ve ever seen, made by a brand you’ve never heard of (but should reallybe paying more attention to). Felix Felix Felix flies under the radar, but has been able to keep its West Village retail space open for years because guys come back time and again each summer for its linen mastery. Sunspel SSENSE Summer is Sunspel's season, and while its Daniel Craig-approved pique polo steals most of the headlines, its soft linen shirting deserves just as much of your consideration. The best way to wash linen is to hand-wash it with lukewarm water and a mild detergent—there are a host of linen-friendly options available—or on the gentle cycle, if the washing machine you use has that option. If you do go digital, try to remove it from the washing machine as quickly as possible when the cycle wraps to avoid harsh creases. And remember, never use bleach on linen fabrics: it’s harsh on all clothing, but it’s a WMD on linen clothing. When it comes to drying your linen shirts, au natural is the best option. Preferably laid flat or hung on a line, which might sound cumbersome, but (!) one of linen’s charms is its quick-drying nature, making the process far quicker than, say, air-drying a pair of jeans. Also, don’t wring out your linen clothing when it is wet—wrinkled is good, pruned is less appealing. This all might sound a little more involved from a care perspective than, say, your trusty oxford, but know that ROI is well worth it. Both the weave and the physical properties of the fibers: when the individual linen fibers get hot, they expand, allowing for more airflow. They also have a slightly rougher texture and a dryer hand, which keeps them from clinging to sweaty skin the way cotton does—a combination that also makes for a fabric that dries much faster. For all those reason, folks have relied on linen to beat the heat for thousands of years, and still haven’t found many replacements. Absolutely. Long-sleeve linen shirts will keep you sufficiently warm through light-jacket weather so long as it's not too blustery. And just as a linen shirt will get more airy the warmer it gets, it also contracts in the cold, which means that the same properties that keep you cool in the summer will also help you when it cools down. From a dress code perspective, linen shirts are on the more casual end of the spectrum, unless they're teamed up with a suit or blazer (or you're living in a humidity hotspot like Miami or New Orleans). Linen-blend shirts, which weave in cotton, trade a little breathability for added crispness and breeze-blocking. Though in chillier weather, the best linen shirts can turn into underrated layering heroes, too, under a thick sweater or cardigan. If you run hot even in the colder months, swapping a linen shirt for a denser, less-breathable cotton shirt might make life more bearable. The short answer: yes, at least a little bit. Or it will, if you treat it like a T-shirt. That being said, if you wash it on cold and line-dry your shirts, they should maintain their original dimensions for as long as you do (it'll air-dry faster than most clothing will, too). If you accidentally put it in the dryer, linen tends to shrink slightly both horizontally and vertically, depending on the weave, but a bit less than cotton, because its fibers are less naturally elastic. Again, the short answer is yes. But be super careful if you feel like rejecting the natural wrinkles—again, we recommend leaning into 'em. If you’re ironing a linen shirt, make sure it’s damp, for starters. Linen is very sturdy, and the moisture will soften the fibers a bit. Also make sure you have a pressing cloth between the iron and the fabric, and a solid ironing board underneath. The GQ office is just as varied in body type, stylistic preference, and budget as the rest of the world; if you polled our colleagues, you’d be hard-pressed to land on a single winning shirt in any category. By and large, though, we gauged the merits of each shirt we tested across three key metrics: quality, fit, and price. For this guide, we prioritized shirts that were either 100% linen or those with other natural fibers blended in, like cotton or hemp. Synthetics aren't always a no-go, but tend to interact with natural fibers unpredictably over time, and have far less history to fall back on. Linen has been around for thousands of years; the kinks in the fabric are natural, the kinks in the processes have been worked out. And while we often gave credence to shirts made with linen from mills we know, “often” is doing some lifting there—many of the shirts on this list don’t need provenance to shine. Which brings us to fit, arguably the most subjective metric. To state the obvious, every one of us is delightfully unique, which is wonderful, but it also makes assessing something like fit a bit of a moving target—two people with the same height and weight might have completely different measurements in key areas. So to narrow our search, we primarily focused on a few different types of linen shirts, and primarily stuck to what has become colloquially known as a “classic cut,” or the one that doesn’t trend too slim or too baggy. The Goldilocks Fit, if you will. (Because we couldn't help ourselves, you'll find a few breezier joints in the More We Love Section, which made for more work on our end, but hopefully is helpful on yours.) When it comes to price, we tried to stay in the middle cut of the spectrum—you can certainly find a linen shirt south of $30, and there are plenty that will run you more than $1,000, but those poles don’t always deliver. That being said, be wary of the super pricey options: expensive doesn't necessarily mean better, and affordable doesn't always mean bad. During our testing, there were $70 shirts that surprised us and $500 shirts that let us down—but for the most part, the best of the bunch landed squarely between those two extremes. To kick off the process, we enlisted a who's who of GQ staffers to wear-test our contenders. Some of our colleagues have worked in retail; others have toiled for small-batch labels; all have a deep appreciation of both shirts and staying cool. We leaned on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrowed down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. (Like we said—different strokes for different folks.) Our testers owned some of the shirts on this list already, but because linen is so seasonal, a whole bunch were totally new to us. So after wear-testing the entire crop, we recorded our deeply scientific observations and rejiggered our selections accordingly. Based on those evaluations, we ran the numbers, collated the anecdotal evidence, and emerged with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best linen shirts for men right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be one for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.) More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nominally speaking, A$AP Rocky is a musician. These days, though, the righteous Harlem MC is the rare multi-hyphenate actually worthy of the label. His prolific, industry-spanning output boils down to one key differentiator: elite taste, which he harnesses to make music,design clothing, and, most recently, reimagine Ray-Ban's sunglasses as the brand'snewly-minted creative director. This past February, whenGQ's Samuel Hine sat down with the man himselfto discuss the gig, he clocked Rocky wearing black shades that “looked like Wayfarers on steroids.” The description, it turns out, was entirely apt—as of this week, the first three silhouettes from Rocky's tenure have hit the market, and they're led by an especially brolic pair of familiar-ish sunglasses. That familiar-ishvibe is wholly intentional. The Blacked Out Collection—the “first-ever eyewear line customized by A$AP Rocky,” in Ray-Ban parlance—does exactly that: blacks out the details on three of the most iconic framesin Ray-Ban's extensive archive, while imbuing them with a jolt of trademark Rocky sizzle. Ray-Ban Ray-Ban The fittingly-named Mega Wayfarers live up to the first half of that moniker and then some: their arms are about twice as tall at the temple than usual, lending them an assertive profile without changing the visual language too dramatically head-on. Ray-Ban Ray-Ban Exhibit B: The Mega Clubmasters, which boast an amplified brow line and the same extra-tall temples as their Wayfarer counterparts, this time juxtaposed with the distinct thin gold rims that remain an enduringsignature of the silhouette. Ray-Ban Ray-Ban To round out the trio, Rocky and the Ray-Ban squad introduced the Mega Baloramas, which just might be the hulking wraparounds of your dreams. Jet black and similarly adorned with gold hits at the temples, they make the original Baloramas look downright dainty by comparison—in the best way possible. Back in February, Rocky toasted his new gig by invoking the retro-tinged glamour of style gods like Sidney Poitier, Jack Nicholson, and Sammy Davis Jr. (\"I'm on my Rat Pack shit,\" were his exact words.) And sure, each pair would look right at home adorning those faces—but like everything Rocky touches, they also seem destined to drive theRolling Loud moshers nuts, which means they won't stick around for long. Grab ‘em while your own future’s still bright.",

    "title": "14 Best Workout Shirts for Men in 2025 That Are Stylish and Comfy",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best workout shirts for men should be masters of multi-tasking (just as versatile as yourfitness routine), combining sturdy and breathable fabrics that can clear the wringer of sweat, movement, and spin cycles in the wash without emerging significantly worse for wear or perpetually odorous. And when you hit thegymto get those gains, it's always a boost of confidence to show up in something that doesn't make you feel like a schlub. To that end, we've got you covered with some of thebest workout clothes for men, fromteestotanksto long-sleeves that are streamlined, breathable, and even stylish. Rhone Rhone Material: Nylon, polyester, and elastaneSizes available: S to XXLStandout features: UPF50+ sun protection, moisture wicking, GOLDFUSION anti-odor technology Rhone's four-way stretch Reign tee clings in all the right places (around the biceps, for example, so that the sleeves don’t ride up and down) and it doesn't cling to any of the wrong ones (the shoulders, the armpits, andthe gut) thanks to raglan sleeves and a slightly looser fit. This best seller is breathable enough to prevent soak-throughs, but not so thin that that a brisk day willhighlight your nipplesto everyone on the track. The best part, though, is that the fabric is infused with little bits of gold for anti-odor protection, which the company says delays the onset of that dreadedperpetual funkthat most other workout shirts succumb to eventually. It sounds dumb, but for us, contemporaneously acquired shirts from other brands have already acquired a certain musk that this one, mercifully, has not. Nike Nike Material: Cotton and polyesterSizes available: S to XXXXL (with tall sizes)Standout features: Moisture-wicking Dri-FIT Every brand now makes its own version of sweat-wicking fabric, but after almost three decades on the market, Nike’sDri-Fitis still a more-than-capable challenger to some of the more expensive counterparts. High armholes and a slim body make the tee comfortable enough for runs and fitted enough for weightlifting, while an array of classic colors let you wear this shirt on the regular without signaling to others that yeah, you lift, bro. At half the cost of our other top picks—plus,Nikeproductsfrequently go on saleat retailers—this is the most cost-effective solution to the reprehensible cut-off tee collection that you're still clinging to. Literary Sport Literary Sport Material: Merino woolSizes available: XS to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating Even beyond the dead of winter, some folks prefer to work out in a long-sleeve, whether it's to help absorb excess sweat or to create a hotter environment that helps you sweat it out even more. Literary Sport, a new name in the workout apparel world, makes a great long-sleeve top, dubbed the Weldon, that's crafted from universally beloved merino wool. Its construction means that it's naturally moisture-wicking and temperature-regulating, even though it is a long-sleeve top. Arm holes keep your palms warm while allowing for the flexibility to use your digits (say, if you need to change songs on your playlist), and its fit is neither too slim nor too baggy. Y'IWO Y'IWO Material: CottonSizes available: S to XXLStandout features: Cropped Before there were tech-y workout shorts, bodybuilders worked out in whatever the hell tops they had lying around. Hence: Lots of crop tops and impromptu muscle tanks at the gym. Yeah, I Work Out, more affectionally called Y'IWO, is ushering back the era of cut-offs and we're absolutely here for it. These shirts aren't made of any special materials, and they're not treated with any anti-odor properties, but dammit if you don't look good pulling five plates wearing a Y'IWO top. Lululemon Lululemon Material: Polyester, elastane, nylonSizes available: XS to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, odor-resistant For a brand that’s synonymous with athleisure, Lululemon makes gym clothes that are actually good for working out and not just lounging. A shade looser than the Rhone, this updated version of one of our favorite Lululemon workout tops deserves its spot in these hallowed rankings because it lets in a whole lot of air. That's thanks in large part to a series of visible, larger-than-usual holes that somehow don’t show any skin. Also, the heathered colorways and contrast-stitched seams provide a nice reprieve from the bright solid colors available at your local sporting goods store. For those of you who aren’t inclined to shill for an athletic apparel giant without an endorsement deal in place, the logo—already small and unobtrusive—is tucked away on the back, just below the neck. Under Armour Amazon Material: Polyester, elastaneSizes available: XS to 3XLStandout features: Moisture-wicking Under Armour's HeatGear compression shirt will help you focus on your workout without any interruption from the brisk winter weather. Its super-light fabric delivers superior coverage without weighing you down. It includes a mesh underarm and back panels for better ventilation to help wick sweat and keep you dry. For an affordable $32, this HeatGear long-sleeve top is a must-have. The cold won't be an excuse next winter. Tracksmith Tracksmith Material: Polyester, spandexSizes available: S to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, anti-odor Tracksmith has carved out its own niche in the running community for its preppy New England athletic apparel—think Prefontaine-era silhouettes with a dash of retro Ivy League style. Its Van Cortlandt tee is one of the brand's most popular styles because of its iconic sash motif, but it's also just a great top for working out in. It feels good on the skin, even during long-distance runs, and it'll keep you cool while helping to quickly wick away your sweat. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie and Fitch Material: CottonSizes available: XS to XXLStandout features: Cropped Chest day got you feeling like you want to show a little more off? Fellas, behold the muscle tank, a sleeveless way to show off your gains during intense workouts, HIIT training, or cardio days. In our testing, Abercrombie's YPB cropped tank offers just enough shoulder-baring action without alerting the gym staff to a flasher situation. These are also great for arm days, when you need to show off the firepower you've been accumulating doing all those curls, dips, and tricep extensions. Plus, wearing a muscle tee at the gym just sort of… rocks. (We're leaning into the meatheaderry in 2025.) Bandit Bandit Material: MicromeshSizes available: XXS to XLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, quick-drying No matter how low-impact my work out might be, I'm guaranteed to work up a sweat. Bandit's Micromesh performance tee is best for people like me—because of its construction, it won't cling to your sticky skin, while the anti-odor properties won't have your gym bros keeping their distance from you when you're in need of a spotter. Its holey construction makes it super breathable, though we don't recommend wearing this if it's windy out because you will get chilly. We’ve noticed zero chafing during runs (which makes sense, since Bandit prides itself as arunning apparel brand), and this makes a great base layer under a crewneck or hoodie. Also, unlike so many other long-sleeve tees that prioritize a slim fit for accentuating the look of your upper body, this option has a relaxed fit that's easy to slip off and toss in the laundry hamper at home. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Material: Polyester, spandexSizes available: XS to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, quick-drying, anti-odor If you see a guy wearing, Ten Thousand—easily identifiable by its “X” logo–then you already know he's deep intogoing after it. The brand makes a bunch of workout apparel tailored for specific sports and activities, but its Versatile shirt is exactly that: great for any variety of activities, whether it's running,boxing, or lifting. It wicks away moisture, which means it doesn't end up smelling if you take a while to get through your dirty laundry pile, and it has a great fit that shows off all those assets you've been working so hard on. Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Material: Cordura, nylon, spandexSizes available: XS to XXLStandout features: Abrasion-resistant, moisture-wicking, four-way stretch Cordura is an incredibly durable fabric, which is why so many brands use it when crafting products they want to be durable. You rarely see it as a T-shirt, but Reigning Champ did just that, making something that can hold up to rounds of rolling around on a yoga mat or going at it with a heavy bag. It's a heavy-duty activewear shirt, but hey, you could say the same about your workouts. Alo Alo Material: Polyester, elastaneSizes available: S to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, four-way stretch While Alo's built a reputation for its yoga apparel, the brand's been churning out an excellent selection of gear that's good for all kinds of workouts. Its Conquer Reform shirt is a popular one for its versatility, but we especially like it for how soft the material is. It definitely makes it easier to suit up for a workout when that might be the last thing you want to do. Gymshark Gymshark Material: CottonSizes available: XS to 3XLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, four-way stretch On any given day, half of the gym is bound to be decked out in Gymshark gear. Why? It's affordable, and it works. Take this under-$30 long-sleeve tee for example. It has no reason to be this cheap, and yet it is. So there: For what's most likely less than a month's gym membership, you can get a top that'll be there for all those PRs you're going to break. District Vision Mr Porter Material: Polyester, elastaneSizes available: S to XXLStandout features: Moisture-wicking, four-way stretch This is an expensive workout shirt, but anyone who recognizes the logo will immediately be made aware of its IYKYK status. District Vision's much-beloved running apparel is great for any workout because if its purpose was for running, few things are as intense (or sweat-heavy). Material:Cotton feels great on the skin and is super breathable, so you might be surprised to hear that it can make for a not-so-great workout shirt. That’s because cottonabsorbsmoisture instead of wicking it away. So as your cotton T-shirt takes on sweat, it blocks airflow and can make you feel hotter. Most activewear brands avoid using all-cotton fabrics for that reason and it’s also why you’ll rarely ever see an athlete wearing a jersey made of the stuff. Instead, the best materials for gym shirts are polyester or a polyester blend. They’re not only breathable, but moisture-wicking and fast-drying too, so your sweat can dissipate through your most grueling gym sessions. Some workout shirts are even designed with strategically placed mesh for more airflow. But it’s not just about keeping cool. Your workout shirt ortankshould also have enough stretch to accommodate a wide range of motion for that next-level yoga pose and work with you when you’re trying to set a personal best on the shoulder press machine. High-quality workout shirts will use elastane or spandex that will stretch and conform to your every move, and remain flexible for the long haul. Fit:Fit is another consideration, depending on how you want to train. Tighter activewear garments like compression shirts can help increase blood flow for better performance and decreased soreness, while looser-fitting gym shirts have better airflow to cool you down. It's all a matter of preference. We put the best workout shirts for men through their paces byrunning, lifting, training, andsweating abundantlyin them—even anointing some our favorite fitness pieces of all time with aGQFitness Award. Some are extra-ventilated with mesh panels, others offer UPF50 sun protection, while still others are so fly that they provide extra motivation for getting out there to run laps in the dead of winter. Above all, they're the perfect medium of comfort, breathability, and design to help you work out in style—with bonus points given to any shirts with sweat-wicking and odor-blocking properties. Here are some of the best workout shirts for men that deserve a spot in your fitness rotation. What is the best workout wear for men? We found you the best workout shirts here (our favorite is theRhone Reignif you already need a refresher), but we do know a thing or two about thebest brands for workout gear. From indie labels like Tracksmith to legends in the game like Nike, the best workout clothes for men will have you looking your best while you sweat it out. What is the best workout shirt for big guys? If you're looking for a workout shirt to accommodate a bigger frame, we recommend theGymshark Crest tee. It goes all the way up in size to 3XL, and it has a regular fit so it's not too restrictive.",

    "title": "How to Finally Divorce Your Toxic Sports Team",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. About a year ago, while watching his team lose a must-win game, a fan of the Dallas Cowboys named CJ Boyd removed his replica jersey, balled it tight, and hurled it off the balcony of his apartment in DeSoto, Texas. While his partner looked on, filming Boyd’s tantrum on her phone, he chased his floating jersey outside, where he picked it up to hurl it farther along the street. He was topless. It was winter. Boyd didn’t feel the cold, he told me, for misery. The clip of his outburst circulated online, and when I watched it I thought: Yeah, that captures it—the circular pain of a fully felt love for a sports team, the seeming impossibility of escape. In the video, Boyd marches up and down the street renouncing, then retrieving, the jersey, never able to throw it far enough to be free. When a spark has gone, lovers may separate and spouses divorce. Businesses are dissolved all the time without acrimony. Friends quietly stop texting one another. We abandon unsatisfactory jobs, apartments, political parties. Why should it be different with a team? Of all the many rules governing human behavior—stuff codified by law, etiquette, or religious decree to steady interpersonal relations—the only universal taboo I can think of that’s rational, legally sound, ethically neutral, yet carries the social equivalent of the noose is the ditching of a sports team. Among fans, there’s no excuse that will account for it. No exit papers or under-the-table permissions may be obtained. It’s bone-felt, beyond argument, and if you care to know anything about sports, you know that however degraded, bored, impoverished, or exhausted a fan may feel, their continued fidelity is expected, no matter what. In Michigan, a few years ago, it made its way from local to national news that a family, the Carpos, had decided to give up the Detroit Lions, tired of years and years of losing. It was a sensation, an outrage. When David Cameron was on the verge of being reelected British prime minister in 2015, commentators saw it as an awful portent that he could not seem to remember which fan base he belonged to: Hammers or Villans. Before the director Steve McQueen was underway on his name-making movie,12 Years a Slave,he was fanatical about an English football team, Tottenham Hotspur. “I gave up football,” McQueen told an interviewer in January 2014. “It affected my day too much. It’s just stupid.” Within a couple months of that unusual admission, McQueen was the proud owner of an Oscar for best picture. A Tottenham fan myself—affected by it, made stupid by it—I imagined a cosmic link between the two events. In renunciation, McQueen seemed to have found peace, and reward. That was a decade ago, and also when I first started to dream about bailing out, imagining the many ways the emotion and ambition I wasted on a sports team might be better spent. I felt like a reasonably well functioning adult, a fun parent, a listening spouse, a reliable wage earner…. But only till about 3 p.m. on a Saturday, at which point I became a pacing, pink, grudge-holding bore with a fuse the length of a fingernail. I was perfectly prepared to obliterate all sorts of cheerful occasions with thermonuclear sulks about sporting contests I had no control over. I knew that lifelong fans, periodically swearing off, almost always came back. I dredged newspaper archives and the internet for examples of successful separations like McQueen’s, but there wasn’t much out there. In the 2010s, an English fan called Adam Thompson finally tired of his team, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and sought a parting. He registered a WordPress blog—How to Divorce Your Football Team: A Social Experiment in Leaving Your First True Love—and charted his efforts to begin again. There were field trips. Even flirtations. The blog fizzled out. When I contacted Thompson to ask what happened to his experiment, he told me he got cold feet. Boyd, the man in Texas, said that if the Dallas Cowboys were a girlfriend, he would have broken up with them years ago. But this was sports, where sticking it out or dying can seem the only options available to malcontents. Could anything be done? There is asentiment in Korean sport: The fan doesn’t choose the team; instead, the team chooses the fan. If this is true, then Tottenham took a roundabout route to get me. My dad grew up in Scotland. As a boy he cheered for Aberdeen FC, which occupies a crumbling redbrick stadium on the sandy banks of the North Sea. When he moved to London, he was a lonely provincial teenager in need of work and friends. He tried to assimilate in a hurry, and various severings of identity took place. He anglicized his accent. He told fibs about his upbringing. Out went the old team, and after he met my mother, he took up supporting Tottenham, whose players used to visit the special-needs school where she worked. That gesture was enough to plant something in him that he later planted in me. So we were Tottenham fans. For as long as I can think, my relationship with the team has been anxious, angular, a bit wrongheaded, a bit much. At the first live game I went to, a player from the visiting team turned to the home fans and threw out an arm in a fascist salute. He also mimed having a Hitler mustache. These were stunning gestures in a stadium full of Jewish North Londoners like me. Nothing has been neat or shapely about following the team since. Season after season, my dad and I ground our teeth and ground it out, celebrating some, chuntering more. He died in 2022, just days after the end of a reasonably successful campaign by our standards. My dad and I had enjoyed four, maybe five, such golden seasons, spread out over the 30-plus years we doggedly followed the team. Were they enough, the scattered good times? One of his mates came to his funeral wearing a Tottenham jersey. I remember thinking how odd it was, that a team could take root in someone’s identity to such an extent, finding purchase in my dad where religion, music, luxury, literature never did. I remember wondering as I said goodbye whether this was the time to say goodbye to our shared team too. By 2024 I was more determined: a parent to growing children of my own, children who watched me celebrate or pace the corridors of our home, mysteriously elated, inexplicably upset. I took my son to watch Tottenham play our loathed local rivals, Arsenal, and we fell behind 1-0, 2-0, then 3-0 in the first half. Gremlin-y Arsenal fans howled at us from their section. There was something in my son’s flushed face, a frustration that I had no power to relieve, that made me decide:enough. Fan to fan, we are conditioned to admire unconditionality, a devotion that’ll withstand any stress. The most exemplary fans are not the winningest or the most neatly coordinated, nor those that travel in large, uncomplaining packs. The exemplars are the undernourished loyalists who hang around when there’s little to no encouragement for them to do so. I think of Ron “Crackman” Crachiola, that immortally optimistic Detroit Lions fan, or that much televised booster of the New York Jets, Edwin “Fireman Ed” Anzalone, both of whom have clung on, costumed, hoarse, through actual decades of false dawns. Dawg Pounders with your heads in your hands at Huntington Bank Field, a stadium known in Cleveland as the Factory of Sadness: I see you too. Broadly, there is peer-to-peer sympathy for all of these franchises—Lions fans, Vikings fans, Sabres fans, Kings fans—and their collective centuries of waiting. We have to be impressed by such devotion. Me, I’m also put in mind of tales of prisoners or kidnap victims, so accustomed to their jails they might refuse a means of escape. Logic is not meant to be a part of the true fan’s equipment. Applying logic to our situations, 99 out of 100 of us would start a mighty bin fire, burning the keepsakes. I wish I’d asked my dad how he did it, severing himself from his boyhood team. Even without that guidance, resolutions took shape for me through the summer of 2024. I needed to at least try to break it off, stop this reflexive way of thinking of the team as an extension of myself. When another season began in August, I refused friends’ offers of tickets. I kept away from screens during matches where I reasonably could. If I failed, I’d at least leave the beginnings of a trail, something for future escapees to follow. I stayed quiet on text chains and left WhatsApp groups—swearing off the bumblebee emoji, never expecting to be “buzzing” about a goal again. I accepted, glumly, that some of my friendships would suffer in the short term. I warned my only brother I’d be taking a holiday of indefinite duration from our team. What next? Actual holiday, putting miles between myself and the home stadium? Hypnosis? I thought I might try laughing at the whole situation. On paper, intense fandomisabsurd. I reached out to an online comedian named Isaac Barron, who produces videos throughout the NFL season in which he plays a distraught sports fan. Tears streaming down his face, Barron pleads for release: “I can’t take this no more…. Every year I go through this…. I’m sorry about the TV.” Barron puts in such a persuasive performance that I had to call him out as a fraud. There’s legitimate pain here, I insisted. Barron, another Cowboys lifer, laughed. At least 50 percent of the anguish is legit, he said. Barron’s wife, Shannon, told me that he had ruined a date, years earlier, by hiding in his bedroom and crying over a loss. Sketch comedy was a compromise they’d dreamed up, a form of catharsis. “The tears come from the fan in me,” Barron said. “The actor in me pushes them.” He’d made himself find humor in what might otherwise be breaking his heart. If humor wasn’t my way out, maybe I could deaden myself with cool, professional distance. John Powers, a sportswriter atTheBostonGlobe,told me how he’d extricated himself from fandom: by becoming a sportswriter and forcing himself to turn neutral. His colleague Dan Shaughnessy, who grew up outside Boston and has written about the Red Sox for theGlobefor over 40 years, said something similar. “If I’m covering a game, the Red Sox lose, I need to be able to tell the readerswhythey lost,” Shaughnessy told me. “When my head hits the pillow it doesn’t matter whether they won or lost, except for the story. I’m rooting for the story.” I had tried laughing, like Barron; now I tried rooting for the most dramatic narrative around my team, whatever that might be. It was a Sunday in October. Tottenham were playing away. We were up 2-0 at halftime and the best story, following Shaughnessy’s theory, would be a dramatic three-goal comeback by the opposition. When exactly that happened, it felt dreadful as always, an ache that made its way around the belly, groin, molars. I was at a family lunch that Sunday. My sister-in-law, a therapist, asked why, if I truly wanted out, I hadn’t sought counseling yet. Embarrassment wasn’t reason enough to keep dragging my feet. Googling, I came across a therapist named Christina DeCoux, who is based in Los Angeles. A particular sentence on DeCoux’s website caught my eye: “People often seek me out because they are feeling stuck in a painful emotional pattern that just won’t let go.” I bookeda consultation with DeCoux and we spoke over video. I explained my predicament and we talked about what I might like to achieve. I said I just wanted to leave it all behind with some dignity on both sides, affectionate memories in tact. I wanted a happy divorce. I had just spent an afternoon with Ryan Ray, an insurance broker from England, who I thought might have the saddest story of any fan in the world. Ray and his mates followed their own boyhood club, Wimbledon FC, based for a century in southwest London, when it was moved by new owners to Milton Keynes, 60 miles north of London. Fans who decided to keep their allegiance local reinstituted a new club in the neighborhood called AFC Wimbledon. The old team that moved north became MK Dons, taking with it the players and, in theory, the status and history…plus Ray and a smattering of original fans. Supporters on either side of this angry divide insist it is the other lot who are the deserters. “I don’t open my mouth anymore,” Ray says. “ ‘Ah, who do you support, then?’ I don’t bother answering. It’s not worth the hassle.” Ray and I had come together to watch MK Dons play a cup game against AFC Wimbledon. Visiting fans traveled up in red double-decker buses, to emphasize their fundamental London-ness. In the stadium they sang a chant that ironically glamorized life in the capital (Champagne, cocaine, Ferraris) at the expense of the turncoats who’d left. “You’ve got bus stops and secondhand shops,” went one part of the chant, probably the nicest part. “Your clothes are shite and your haircut’s fucking weird.” As with many separations, dialogue had cheapened to insults, lists of bad traits, the once-unsayable things now exaggerated for maximum cruelty. After his team went down 1-0, then 2-0, Ray and I retreated to a windowless bar inside the stadium. “I look forward to it,” he said, “the six to eight weeks when I don’t have to focus on anything to do with this football club. Ilongfor it.” Ray meant the offseason. “Sometimes I wish I could just sit there without any bias, without any interest—but it’s not me. I’m tribal.” I mentioned this idea of tribalism to the therapist, DeCoux. I explained my conviction that the saddest, bleakest parts of the fan’s experience—the exaggerated grievances, the shortsighted bragging, the narrow delusion of being exceptional—were the parts bound up in tribal feeling. She said that whenever she watched her own husband watch sports—he was a New York Rangers fan—she was sometimes put in the mind of religious cults. DeCoux was raised inside a rule-bound evangelical church. She left in her 20s and made cult recovery one of her areas of focus as a therapist. “You wouldn’t know what songs to sing unless you were a part of the group,” DeCoux recalled of her church. “You had to perceive what were the correct things to say. If you were ever off message, you could feel the energy shift.” She might have been describing any supporters’ pub in Newcastle or Bavaria; one of those stadium sections that are set aside for drum-banging, flares, ride-or-die piety. DeCoux continued: “Of course, the one thing you can’t say is, ‘I’m not sure I want to follow along with you guys anymore. I’m changing cults.’ Because that would be immediate social exclusion.” She described a commonly reported reason that people give for staying in cults: the sunk cost fallacy. “People can’t leave because they’ve spent so much time and money and energy,” she explained. I thought of Boyd, the jersey-throwing Cowboys fan, who described the NFL offseason to me as though talking through an obvious, yet completely irresistible, con. “Let’s say your guys get knocked out in January,” he said. “You’re pissed. You’re mad. I would guess that for the average fan it’s free agency when most of them start getting invested again. That piques the interest.” The seasonal reset creates a void. Optimism quickly fills it. The fan thinks, Maybe I’ll be a better member of this cult if I only believe harder, give overmoreof my money and my time. “Then roster cuts happen. Players get traded. It’s almost like a mind game, right? ‘Okay. This could work.’ And God forbid you have a good preseason.” In November,DeCoux texted me to say she’d been pondering my case and she regretted likening it to extraction from a cult. The situation, she said, had more in common with addiction, the high highs, the low lows, the swearing-offs, the shame-inducing returns to the cookie jar. I was nodding. Could we talk? “There are a couple of ways I know of looking at addiction,” she said. “One is, you [follow the spirit of] a 12-step program. You go totally sober. You aim to be sober forever. A lot of people in addiction would say this is the only way. There are other branches of treatment, known as harm reduction, where a therapist meets a person where they’re at. They try to reduce the harm that a substance is causing.” The idea, she continued, is to help a client use less, with greater control and greater awareness. “I would ask you, when you feel the out-of-control feelings, what do you believe about yourself? I would want to know: Which feeling comes up strongest? Give me an ‘I am’ statement.” Smallness, I said. “ ‘I am small,’ ” repeated DeCoux. “So it’s really about feeling like a child. Completely out of control of your destiny. Powerless.” She considered this. “I would say, maybe, your connection is linked to old childhood beliefs that need to be examined. When did it become clear that this was an identity for you? What were the experiences that made you form an identity around this team?” I pondered it and told DeCoux that I found it hard to remember a time when it didn’t feel like a part of my identity. I couldn’t remember choosing tribes. As children, she said, we make a lot of meaning: “But if you don’t remember the meaning that was made, how do you even shift that? You have to go back. Find the meaning you made around the team.” There was always a rivalry dynamic, I said, between Tottenham and Arsenal, our North London rival. A sense of us and them; a big sibling/little sibling vibe. At my school there were Jewish kids and Greek kids. The Jews ended up in one class and the Greeks in the other. We were Tottenham, they were Arsenal. For seasons-long stretches at a time, all through my teenage years and into my 20s, Arsenal were the more successful of the teams. It was bad luck. It was agony. As an adult, I always lived in flats and houses in enemy territory, within earshot of Arsenal’s stadium. The schools in these neighborhoods are Arsenal hothouses. The babysitters get busy indoctrinating your kids as soon as the front door shuts. On match days, main roads chock up with Arsenal fans, identifiable beneath their colors, I always think, because of a smugness of bearing that must come from their being part of a fan base that’s had a nice time of it over the years—that expects more glory as its due. (American readers will be unconsciously balling their fists picturing the Belichick-era Patriots.) No Tottenham fan of my generation thinks of glory as a right. Tottenham fans take nothing for granted and they are keenly aware of the entitlement of other fan bases. Whenever Tottenham play Arsenal, a starved chippiness smacks up against spoiled lordliness. DeCoux would often talk about going back, in psychological terms, to the scene of the crimes. Had I ever been to a game in Arsenal’s stadium, for instance? In all these years, a lifetime, I hadn’t. And so, on an apocalyptic weather day that November, the sky dark with clouds, as if in judgment over a travesty, I went to sit among the home fans at Arsenal. There will havebeen so many Red Sox fans who died in October 2004, only days or hours before the team turned the tide in its American League Championship Series against the Yankees, setting up a first World Series title in 86 years. During darker times, their optimism gravely tested, the frightened fan wonders: Whydidthis team choose me? Why the post-Aikman Cowboys? Why the Tottenham team that contracted mass food poisoning in 2006 on the eve of its most important game in years? Why wasn’t I chosen by Steph’s Warriors, Schumacher’s Ferrari, Messi’s Barca? Winning fans never ask themselves such questions. Winning fans are amnesiacs. They forget the random flights of ball or puck, the bad-breaking weather, the dumb injuries that must have caused them misery in the past. They ascribe their better times to tactics, organization, culture—whatever, to “championship DNA” or “winning mentality” or a dozen other press-conference clichés. Uh-huh, thinks the Mariners fan, 48 seasons and counting without a maiden World Series appearance, hearing about championship DNA. Oh sure, think fans of the Knicks, the Kings, the Hawks, decades without an NBA title. Why didn’twethink to have a mentality that prioritized winning when it would matter instead of losing when it would hurt the most? Fans are pitiable if they try to ditch a team and damned absolutely if they ever try to swap. And yet players, coaches, even owners are permitted to drift between teams as opportunity or profit dictate. Magic Johnson, always a Lions fan, cheered on that team’s recent playoff defeat by the Washington Commanders, of which he owns a minority stake. Presidents have been quick to pardon themselves for straying. Nixon supported one NFL team while playing footsie with another. (You understand that I’m a Washington fan, he told Don Shula, the coach of the Miami Dolphins. “But I’m a part-time resident of Miami and I’ve been following the Dolphins real close….”) At around the same time, in the early 1970s, a young Bill Clinton, besotted with his college girlfriend, added Hillary’s Chicago Cubs to his own St. Louis Cardinals (bitterest of rivals) as the baseball teams he rooted for. Jimmy Carter switched from the Yankees to the Braves in the mid-1960s after they relocated to Atlanta and never looked back, though the exchange left him in the championship red over the rest of his long life—two World Series titles to the Yankees’ seven. As a boy, the director Spike Lee gave up the Mets for the Yankees. Again, those many, many titles. Most fans stick, and if they don’t, they stay quiet. The Carpos, that family in Michigan who ditched the Lions, made the news because they’d elected to support the Kansas City Chiefs instead. Of all the eras in Taylor Swift’s life, one remains creatively underexplored: the time before she was a Chief, when she was an Eagle. There is a fascinating page on NamuWiki, the Korean-language Wikipedia, that outlines the philosophical case against abandoning one’s team. The act is known in Korea as 팀 세탁—team laundry—and it is understood to involve a paradox. You care enough, you want to put an end to your suffering. You care enough, you can’t. “If you have blue eyes,” said Shaughnessy, the sportswriter, “you have blue eyes.” From my own empirical research, it does seem the body understands if denial is in play, that a sacrament is under threat. Sitting in the chilly stands at Arsenal, I fidgeted and sweated, feeling well beyond the pale. Next to me there was another displaced fan, a woman named Liubov Liushnenko, from Ukraine. Liushnenko’s swings in team allegiance had been so intense, I soon felt ashamed of my own discomfort. She was raised in the Ukrainian capital, the only daughter of a devout Dynamo Kyiv fan. Liushnenko baffled her father by becoming a fan of Dynamo’s hated rivals, Shakhtar Donetsk, who played 450 miles away, in the Donbas region. Her dad wanted to know why she’d made the decision. “I couldn’t explain,” she told me “I still can’t. If you love something you can’t explain.” Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine changed Liushnenko’s life. She lost her job and lost friends to the army or migration. Before long she was persuaded by her parents to seek asylum in England. Staying in lodgings outside London, “I felt completely lost,” she said. Streams of Ukrainian football games, watched from her bedroom, helped. And over time it was football that made her feel more at home in her adopted country. She started playing for a lower-league team and took work as a coach for a charity called Fair Shot, which helps refugees find a place in English communities through football. Liushnenko took out her phone and showed me pictures of her parents. “I wanted to go back for New Year but my parents said no, not now. There’s no electricity. No heating. It’s a bad time.” In the Arsenal stadium, pre-match theatrics were underway. The Clash’s “London Calling” rang out with its snarling lyric about battle and war. Fireworks popped on the grass and the air around us filled with the sharp smell of gunpowder. Liushnenko said that in Ukraine, the war had brought about a shock truce between the fans of Shakhtar Donetsk and Dynamo Kyiv. “When part of your country is occupied,” she said, “you cannot be enemies with each other. You cannot be enemies with yourself.” We watched most of the match together, then I snuck out after halftime, feeling incongruous and grubby in that environment, chastened as well by Liushnenko’s example, trying to hear the right lessons in her story. Traveling home, I thought of what the therapist had said about us trying to cut certain cords that bound me to my team, working against negative feelings of anger, shame, or regret while retaining other, more positive associations: acknowledging the good. “I would want to see you go through a cycle of anger, then acceptance,” DeCoux said, “then get to some appreciation of what the team has done for you.” It was obviousthat I couldn’t just choose another team in the Premier League to support. But casually, that fall—just having some fun on the apps—I started seeing other sports. I watched YouTube reels of the World Series–bound Dodgers and dabbled in a trial subscription with the resurgent Knicks. When work took me to Hamburg, I showed up in the city’s pungent arena to watch its much-loved handball team. I texted the therapist: “We’re winning 6-5, I think. There’s a mascot dressed as a Dole banana.” Except when balls were successfully thrown into goals, I had no fucking idea what was happening, why we groaned as fans, why we regained our faith or sensed blood. I couldn’t follow the mysterious waves of belief and dread that take hold of people when a team matters so much to them they know its every mood, all blind spots, all flaws. Around then, the Jacksonville Jaguars came to London to play an international game at Wembley Stadium. I showed up to sample the visiting NFL circus. Agents of a seductive Americana had been sent overseas to tempt in new fans. For an hour, I joined in with other mesmerized Londoners as we yelled locally flavored endearments at the Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. “G’wan, Trev! Get in, Trevah.” Floridan cheerleaders tried their best to look like they wanted to be dancing under drizzle in a stadium that’s usually configured for English football. Bros in tracksuits bazooka-ed T-shirts at the crowd. The men behind me were doggedly checking Premier League scores by phone, grumbling about the consequences for their fantasy teams. It was a novelty to be able to drink in our seats, an indulgence imported from overseas, and people got very drunk. Our section started to smell like a wet ashtray. As the Jags pulled away, my attention started roving around the stadium. I’d been here often in support of Tottenham and I found old landmarks, picked at old wounds. Down there. That was where I sat to watch a 5-1 annihilation in a can’t-lose semifinal. Up there, in the eaves. That’s where I closed my eyes while Lionel Messi and his Barcelona teammates ate us for dinner. The humiliations lingered keenly. The losses were more alive in memory than the wins. I realized that having begun this trial separation, having started to make strides toward indifference, I was starting to miss the pain. DeCoux was interested to hear it at our next session, though not greatly surprised. Look at the faces of people at sports events, she said. Look at what they do with their bodies, the tactility, the tears. Sport seems to open up a rare space for people, especially men, to emote in public. It gives people a way to indulge what they might otherwise be suppressing—grief included. One weekend, I traveled to Aberdeen in Scotland where my dad grew up. I had a ticket to watch his boyhood team. Maybe there were answers for me there—compatible blood. Policemen frisked us at the stadium gate, checking pockets, checking socks. One teenager had a bottle of beer pulled out of his hood. At least a hundred men were smoking in a tight, high-walled gully that ran between the outer ramparts and the stands. I had a place in the hard-core section. Beside me, an elderly man, about the age my dad would have been, ate two chocolate bars and a bag of cheese crackers in silence, methodically tossing the empty packaging at my shins, possibly in provocation. I opened and ate a KitKat, also in silence, adding to the litter under my feet, a bid for acceptance that seemed to work. Soon a huge white-and-red flag was dragged over our section. A fan with a bass drum started up a regular thump, about the rate of an excitable heartbeat. As enthusiasm in the stadium began to grow, the flag was whipped away at just the moment the fans around me burst into song. The drumming and the singing did not let up till halftime. The home team, my dad’s team, played with flair, winning handsomely, and the terrace chants echoed in my head for hours afterward. I walked away along the seafront, eating a mince-and-oatmeal pie, his favorite. It was an ideal evening of sport. As meet-cutes go, the circumstances could not have been more propitious for second love if the whole thing was scripted by Austen or Ephron. I came away stimulated, all my senses fed, glad to have made the pilgrimage. When I asked my heart a question, whether it could love this other team, the answer was unequivocal, as clear as the drum:No chance. While I was in Scotland, I texted Adam Thompson, the Wolverhampton Wanderers fan who’d written the divorce blog all those years ago. In the end, not only did Thompson renew his vows, he sealed them in ink—he now has aW.W.tattoo—as if in apology for straying. CJ Boyd has team tattoos of his own: massive, palm-size Dallas Cowboys stars on either pectoral. Try divorcing those. I would suggest that—with respect to Spike Lee, the Carpos in Michigan, and at least three former US presidents—the swappers are outliers. You can’t choose the team. The team chooses you. It was January.My team hobbled into another new year, embarking on a historically terrible run, oblivious as to whether I was following the endless carnival or not. A friend had coined the term “low-power mode” (as when your iPhone downshifts to suck up less energy) to describe my renegotiated commitment to Tottenham, and I seized on his words like serious praise. What would seem a blunt desertion to some, a fuss over nothing to others, felt to me a small, treasurable achievement. On the night of a bad loss to Arsenal, I wasn’t there, I wasn’t pacing in front of a screen; I was out at dinner with friends. We spoke of Zuckerberg and Musk, ceasefires and wildfires. Los Angeles’ NFL teams had lost in the January playoffs, as though making dignified withdrawals to focus on more important matters. Perspective, if you wanted it, was easily found that month. “You can never just leave something completely behind. It’s always a part of you,” DeCoux had told me. That was the day her son wandered in, mid-session, to say goodbye to her before leaving for school. The three of us fell into conversation. DeCoux explained that we were discussing “sport and feelings,” and the boy made a brilliant noise, a weary groan with a rising note at the end:really?He was at the outset of his own journey as a fan, with a curated roster of teams he loved. I asked if he followed English football and he said he did. He had even picked out a team. “You’re kidding,” I said, when he told me which one. “Why us?” The boy gave a few reasons. It wasn’t important. Why anyone? I notice now that I’d made unthinking use of that wordus.Months later, did I feel the same? DeCoux had warned that, from all she knew of helping cult leavers, separating couples, and addicts in recovery, forswearing could be difficult. She suggested I might work toward a more realistic goal of peaceful coexistence. In her own case, she no longer felt angry toward the cult that raised her, only distant. In my case, I might consider it progress if I could walk past Tottenham’s stadium, my old Tottenham pubs, and think:Good for them. At the end of the month, I walked from enemy into friendly territory, trying my hardest to recategorize the landscape as neutral, scrubbing it free of tribal lines. I walked a few miles to Tottenham’s stadium, passing landmarks dear to me: Seven Sisters station; the High Cross pub; Tottenham Bagels; the clock over the old Whitbread brewery, the one without hands or numbers—a grimly appropriate symbol, I always used to think, as frustrating seasons amassed. Like a chain-smoking ex-lover, lingering on some significant curb, I stood outside the Beehive bar, remembering bouncing up and down with pure joy as other delirious fans ripped plywood paneling off the walls, wanting keepsakes. It was midafternoon. A match was scheduled for the evening. Stewards were beginning to drag fencing into the traffic-free zone beyond the discount-sportswear shop. A burger chef in team colors was fixing a tablecloth into place on the pickle station next to Chunky Chips. The keenest fans were assembling, hours early, muttering to one another on public benches, treating nerves with tinned beer. Good for them, I thought. Tom Lamontis aGQcorrespondent.

    "title": "How Aaron Elliott Helps Private Citizens Cook Like Private Chefs",
    "article_text": "There’s a Michelin air to Aaron Elliot’s Los Angeles home kitchen. No clatter, no chaos—just quiet focus and a playlist that bounces between post-hardcore and Brazilian jazz. Elliott is a calm and measured guy withtattoosup to his ears. He wouldn’t hurt a fly, but you get the sense he may have hit something besides a baseball with a bat once or twice. Today, the house smells like miso, golden garlic, and something sweet that turns out to be a wedge of lasagna with cultured cashew mozzarella and a single basil leaf on top that tastes like a Hi-Chew. Elliott’s cooking feels like an even cleaner coastal-California version of Nancy Silverton’s approach—obsessively honing dishes people love, but knowing when to stop before whatever you do won’t be better than what the farmer did. That's how you create food that people keep coming back for all year long, instead of just that one time on Valentine’s Day. After bouncing around some L.A. kitchens, Elliott landed his first private chef gig with C.J. Wilson, sending the since-retired Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitcher out for road games with quinoa-oatmeal bowls. Then came Endeavor CEO and superagent Ari Emanuel, who brought Aaron into his house for what turned into a ten-year run—six days a week, including through the early days of the pandemic. “It’s easy to put a plate of vegetables in front of someone,” Emanuel says. “It’s much harder to make them taste good. Aaron has mastered this.” James Cameronall but hired him on the spot after Elliott refused to cook meat for his kitchen audition. “Aaron made beautiful food for the whole family,” Suzy Cameron says. “I still make many of his recipes now that we’re in New Zealand.” Eventually, he connected withTravis Barkerthrough Elliott's younger brother Jake, who runs the front of the house at the West Hollywood vegan-hot-spot-to-the-stars Crossroads Kitchen, whose investors include Barker. Elliott still cooks Sunday suppers for the Barker-Kardashian orbit, which is as casual and intense as it sounds. And if your daughter is not actively beefing with Bhad Bhabie or you’re not a guy who’s had a cameo onEntourage, there’sMeal Ticket, Aaron’s weekly delivery drop. The makings of six plant-based dishes are delivered chilled, ready to be taken across the finish line with cute little cups of sauces and garnishes that make reheating and plating each dish feel truly fun and intuitive. The menus go out via email weekly, and regulars jump on fast. At $250, Meal Ticket ain’t cheap, but it gets you three to four days of food made with the same ingredients Elliott would serve to any of his A-list clients. We’re talking about a level of produce you’d see onChef’s Table, but you get to eat it while stoned on the couch. Elliott hits the Santa Monica Farmer’s Market twice weekly, first to wander and get ideas, then to stock up. He’ll swing byErewhonfor pantry items or any veg he couldn’t snag at the market (he’s one of Erewhon’s “top spenders,” and they recently thanked him with a gift card to the now-shuttered clothing boutique Fred Segal). Elliott then cooks it all himself with help from a small crew. No ghost kitchens. No mystery staff. Just a guy who still likes to touch and taste every single thing before it’s lovingly packaged and labeled accordingly, with reheating instructions so easy even a novice home cook couldn’t screw them up. The cilantro stems have been hand-selected to Elliott’s exacting standards; all you have to do is lay them down on that perfect Japanese sweet potato. Before the Calabasas parking passes and fermented cashew cheeses, Aaron was bussing tables in Pittsburgh at his family’s Italian spot. His childhood was a little loud, a little chaotic, and a lot likeThe Bear’s “Fishes” episode, minus the car crashing into the dining room. That chaos, he says, birthed a specific type of work ethic—an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work. He trained at Noma, arguably the best restaurant on earth, where he worked through each station until his visa ran out—just short of his turn to make “family meal,” which he jokes was probably a relief for the omnivores on staff that day. He landed in L.A. at the lauded neighborhood spot Rustic Canyon, known as L.A.’s produce mecca and, in my opinion, the closest thing we’ve got to Chez Panisse (and the only reason I’ll drive to Santa Monica.) You won’t find reindeer ceviche or pinecone chawanmushi on his menu, but you will find a perfect mix of dishes conceived by a chef who’s old enough to know the golden era of farm-to-table cooking but can plate it with modern techniques for the next generation. I loved Aaron’s signature fried artichoke sandwich, impossibly crunchy in mochi flour, or a perfect dairyless corn chowder cooked down with their cobs. You’ll find cultured cashew mozz that actually stretches and grated parm made from the good Marcona almonds. Every dish tastes like Sunday. Ask him about his death row meal, and he won’t say, “Pad thai, extra tofu” or “celeriac shwarma.” He’ll say linguine with red clam sauce. A classic vongole, finished with tomato. A nod to where he started. After hanging out with Aaron for an afternoon, this was the first and last time he alluded to the possibility of “breaking edge.” There might be a restaurant in the works. Something small, thoughtful, hopefully with his brother Jake on the floor and a lasagna melting under thesalamander. Until then, he’s doing what he does best: feeding people who have every option in the world, but keep coming back to him.",

    "title": "Prince Harry and King Charles’s Relationship Is Still “Distant,” Says Source",
    "article_text": "Last week,Prince Harryspenttwo days in a London courtroomas a continuation of his long-running fight for enhanced security when he visits the UK. Though Harry visited his birth country for the hearing, he didn’t see his father,King Charles III,who was on a royal tour of Italy with his wife,Queen Camilla. According to sources who spoke toPeople,the relationship between Harry and the king is still strained, and the pair haven’t seen one another since Harry’s quick trip to the UK in February 2024, soon after the king announced his cancer diagnosis. “They are distant,” one source told the magazine. Though the relationship between Harry and his father has been strained since the prince and his wife,Meghan Markle,left their royal roles in early 2020, the relationship has been on ice since January 2023, when Harry published his memoirSpare,which was filled with intimate details about his family. A source close to the palace toldPeoplethat there hasn’t been much contact between Harry and the King since. “I don’t think there is any rapprochement,” the source said. “Nothing has changed.” Right now, Harry’s ongoing legal fight about security is one of the sticking points in their relationship. Harry has fought the British government about their 2020 decision to strip him of elevated security for years, and last year Harry argued that the king’s aides, who have roles on the security committee RAVEC, might have played a role in that decision. Harry has returned to the UK multiple times in the last year, but Meghan and their two children,Prince ArchieandPrincess Lilibet of Sussex,have not visited since 2022. After the hearings last week, Harry toldPeople’sSimon Perrythat his family’s safety “has always mattered the most.” Harry added that was surprised to learn of the private information that was discussed in the courtroom last week. “People would be shocked by what’s being held back,” the prince said, adding that his decision to fight back on the matter of his security was “driven by exposing injustice” and a desire to “get under the bonnet and fix” things. In his conversation withPeople, Harry also mentioned his wife’s recent business successes with the launch ofher brandAs Everandher new podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder.“I am so happy for my wife and fully support absolutely everything she’s done and continues to do,” the prince said. “I’m incredibly proud.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "'And Just Like That' Trailer: A Che Diaz-less Summer in the City",
    "article_text": "So long, Che Diaz. The trailer for the third season ofAnd Just Like That,the series starringSarah Jessica Parker,Cynthia Nixon,andKristin Davisas now middle-aged friends Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, dropped on Tuesday and from the looks of it there are a lot less comedy concerts in store this summer afterSara Ramirez's rocky exit from theSex and the Cityrevival series. Ramirez starred as Che Diaz, Miranda’s nonbinary standup comedian lover turned ex, for two seasons onAnd Just Like Thatand was, well,divisive to say the least.After a turbulent season two,Varietyreported that Ramirezwould not be returning for the third season of the series. Season two ended with Che and Miranda on good terms but broken up, with Che Diaz find a potential new love interest as well as a new side hustle working at a pet shop. And just like that, series creatorMichael Patrick Kingsent Che Diazto the great sitcom farm upstate. Now it’s time for Miranda and the gals to start a fresh chapter. From the looks of the trailer, all three ladies are on to brand new adventures as they take on summer in the city. Newly single Miranda seems to be flirting with a colleague at her new job as a lawyer for the Human Rights Watch. Charlotte is juggling being mother to two very different teens in Lily (Cathy Ang) and Rock (Alexa Swinton). And Carrie, fresh off of deciding to put her relationship with Aidan (John Corbett) on pause, is getting back out ther. In the trailer, Carrie tells her best gal pals that Aidan sent her a postcard. “Well, what did he write?” asks Charlotte excitedly. “Nothing,” says Carrie. Charlotte delivers a half-hearted “aww” as Miranda looks on in disbelief. “Blank postcard gets an ‘aww’?\" asks Miranda. “Well, not an over-the-top ‘aww’ but it's better than nothing.” While Aidan is giving Carrie little more than nothing, it looks like she sparks a connection with a handsome new neighbor. Although, she may want to get that rat problem fixed before she invites him over. But that’s not all. Supporting players Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) and Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury) have even been bumped up a notch, with Lisa dealing with a work crush of her own and Seema getting back out into the dating pool once again. They’re even included on the season-three poster, walking across a NYC intersection with Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda at golden hour. Carrie is staring right at the camera and wearing a ridiculous hat as is her wont. Of course, there’s no sign of the fourthSex and the Citygal, Samantha Jones, famously played byKim Cattrall,whodidn’t sign on for the revival series. But let’s not forget that Jones briefly and indelibly appeared on the season two finale ofAnd Just Like That—giving one ofVanity Fair's best performances of 2023in about 90 seconds of screen time. Whether or not we get any more Samantha Jones this season (and here's hoping we do), season three is all about fresh beginnings. “We can choose to begin a new chapter,” says Carrie at the end of the trailer. The new chapter ofAnd Just Like Thathits Max on May 29. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "title": "Donald Trump, Silicon Valley, and the Neoliberal Roots of an Unlikely Alliance",
    "article_text": "The story everyone’s heard about the Cold War is that capitalism won out. The fall of the Berlin Wall, it goes, extinguished the last embers of communism, while the flames of neoliberalism blazed on. But that’s not the story that all neoliberals actually believed, according toQuinn Slobodian,the author ofHayek’s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right,a rousing relitigation of the 1990s’ ideological scorecard. In it, the Boston University history professor reveals that some of the most fervent neoliberals, likeCharles Murray,Murray Rothbard, andHans-Hermann Hoppe,worried that the red enemy had not, in fact, vanished. Rather, itshape-shifted—into feminism, environmentalism, and civil rights. To these men, Slobododian writes, “communism was a chameleon.” ‘Hayek's Bastards’ by Quinn Slobodian Princeton University Press Desperate for a new intellectual underpinning, neoliberals and libertarians sought refuge in the work of economist Friedrich Hayek, who famously argued in his 1944 polemicThe Road to Serfdomthat government intervention in markets is antithetical to individual freedom. But Murray, Rothbard, Hoppe, and others fatally twisted Hayek’s message, claims Slobodian, and took it so far as to argue that only Western countries are intellectually and culturally primed for capitalism. The politics of this cohort, which he dubs the “new fusionists,” was rooted in “three hards,” argues Slobodian: “Hardwired human nature, hard borders, and hard money.” They forged sordid alliances with biologists, evolutionary psychologists, and ethnonationalists, spouting pseudoscience about the link between race and IQ, a topic famously repopularized in the 1994 best-sellerThe Bell Curve,coauthored by Murray and psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein. They railed against lax immigration policies on the premise that they led to cultural decay. But perhaps most strangely, they ballyhooed the value of gold as a backstop against a looming economic cataclysm caused by incompetency in Washington. (Talk about apropos.) In an interview withVanity Fair,which has been edited for length and clarity, Slobodian analyzesDonald Trump’s radical agenda through this new prism of neoliberalism. He also unpacks the distressing parallels between goldbugs and crypto bros, and details why the tech set has suddenly taken up with the MAGA right. Silicon Valley’s “willingness to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Donald Trump,” he says, is indicative “of the embrace of an ideology that pretty frankly ranks human capacity along the spectrum of intelligence and IQ.” Vanity Fair:Tell me what inspired you to report on “new fusionism,” as you call it, and the sudden racial or biological turn that political theorists made to fight back against a wave of progressivism after the Cold War? Quinn Slobodian:It seemed that the real competitor to capitalism was defeated in the 1990s. So I was curious how the neoliberals understood their mission at that point. And looking into it, I was startled to see that they had this belief that they had actually not reallywon—that socialism was dead, but “leviathan” lived on, as they usually framed it. The social state was still quite large. You still had all kinds of entitlement programs. And to make matters worse, you also had the expansion of what they saw as a toxic wave of political correctness and affirmative action and feminist demands, as well as, perhaps most worryingly, environmental demands—all of which were presenting new challenges to capitalism and economic freedom. So it was pretty quickly clear that a lot of the things that the right refers to as “cultural Marxism” or “gender ideology” and, more recently, “wokeness,” were labels that they were using to describe the new guises that socialism was taking. This led to some pretty wild alliances that I noticed first in something called the Property and Freedom Society, which was created by the anarchocapitalistHans-Hermann Hoppeas a way to organize the diverse opponents of a new nefarious leftist ideology. At his gatherings, you’d get financial advisers talking to Afrikaner nationalists talking to revisionist historians of the Second World War talking to race scientists and people who end up appearing in the book—likeRichard Spencer,who became the face of the alt-right in 2016 and ’17; andPeter Brimelow,who was the face of nativism already in the 1990s and increasingly in the 2010s as well. So it was at the time when everyone was trying to get their head around the alt-right in 2016 and ’17—and was shocked by the effects of theCharlottesville protests—that I started to cobble together this genealogy of people who were primarily interested in economic freedom (or libertarians) making alliances with people who had very different priorities, including racial purity, monetary stability, the removal of the historical stain of Nazism from German memory and so on. How do you view Trump through this prism of neoliberalism? He’s obviously a nativist and a xenophobe, but he’s not a free marketeer. So how do you see that strange combination? Yeah, I think that in the first Trump administration there were, as there always is around him, a motley crew of people with clashing ideologies all trying to capture his ear and realize their own particular wishlist. And one of the most effective activists in that project wasArthur Lafferand his collaboratorStephen Moore,who were both these denizens of neoliberal think tanks. Arthur Laffer was best known for the Laffer curve, which justified Ronald Reagan’s first-term tax cuts and the idea of supply-side economics. Stephen Moore had been quite vocal in his ideas that capitalism is more important than democracy. And they were perfect creatures of the kind of milieu I described in the book in that they were not very discriminating about who they could work with as long as they could drive through what became Trump’s only real legislative accomplishment, which was the2017 tax cuts. But at the same time, you had other people in his coalition likeRobert Lighthizer,who was pushing through a trade policy that doesn’t have much to do with neoliberal principles. I would say in Trump 2.0, that contradiction has become even more heightened in that there are people who are thinking about geoeconomics in terms of state sovereignty anddirect annexation, which is the exact sort of sovereigntism and statism that neoliberals originally mobilized against in the 1930s. On the other hand, I think that what I lay out in the book is helpful to understand [what] people from Silicon Valley are up to in their willingness to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Donald Trump because of the embrace of an ideology that pretty frankly ranks human capacity along the spectrum of intelligence and IQ. So I think that the idea of hardwired human nature working alongside market competition and commodified human relationships captures the Silicon Valley attitude quite well. But even there, I would say in its radicalization, it's drifting quite far from the neoliberal canon. For example, the embrace of monopoly and the desire to destroy all competitors and produce walled gardens of markets and capture domains that one company can oversee—these are not traditionally neoliberal attitudes towards the market. Traditionally, neoliberals have wanted to have multiple actors within a market and saw that as producing greater efficiency. So I think the kind of techno-monarchism, which has been noted in the Silicon Valley right, is a further turn of the screw away from some of those original principles. I feel like IQ is notexplicitlytalked about in the way that it was with Rothbard and Murray. Do you feel like that obsession has manifested through a different proxy? How is Silicon Valley really pushing a “biologized credit score,” as you call it? It’s definitely part of just the vernacular of what passes for intellectual life on the chatboards and Twitter spheres of Silicon Valley. It’s still very common tohear invocationsof IQ. Like, people from the DOGE team were posting about IQ related to racial group and so on. Because Silicon Valley in its right-wing form isn’t particularly interested in collective public outcomes, I think the use of IQ as a measure of policy effectiveness is a little bit irrelevant. But I do think we can see that idea of ranked humans come across more in the immigration debate. For example, theH-1B [visa] showdownbetweenElon MuskandVivek Ramaswamyon one hand andSteve Bannonon the other late last year. I think it was an interesting moment where the terms of the immigration debate within the MAGA movement were defined, on the one hand, as being about ethnic belonging as some form of essential right as an American citizen. And then on this side of Musk and Ramaswamy, it was about utility and instrumental value for the economy. The idea being that you should be able to enter the country if you’re able to contribute to the economy, leading, I would say, pretty smoothly to Donald Trump’s discussion of agold-card system, where, as he put it, an Indian, Chinese or Japanese kid could graduate from Yale, Harvard, or Wharton, and pay a million dollars to stay in the country. That’s a pretty explicit racialization of a meritocracy vision and a monetization of it. So I found that a very telling moment where the idea of racially ranked economic actors was lined up with a price tag on it and then substituted as a hard-line immigration strategy. It’s actuallynot.It’s actually what they call a “designer” immigration strategy that uses dog whistles about racial difference to somehow signal its reactionary overtones. And it’s that weird combination I think we see manifesting a lot. One of the other key topics in your book is the perceived value of gold in the economy and how the neoliberals thought it could be used as a backstop against the potential market apocalypse induced by Washington incompetency. I couldn’t help but think that that’s kind of how crypto is sometimes talked about in Silicon Valley. Do you feel like there’s a parallel there? Absolutely. If anything, the crypto idea is even more far-fetched, right? I mean the goldbug idea—which is, it must be said, a very minority view among neoliberal intellectuals and economists—very few of them actually believe in the need to return to a gold-backed monetary system, partially because it makes most of the economic activity that we value impossible. You basically choke out any possibility of credit if you say that you have to have a 100% gold-backed currency system. You can’t have an expanding monetary base. So you might get rid of inflation, but you instead have hyper-deflationary tendencies. And that’s the same with crypto. Of course, the fantasy or the myth is that you could somehow move to a totally crypto-based money system, but both crypto and gold only work in relationship to a fiat system as hedges and speculative assets at different moments of the business cycle. The interesting thing symptomatically to me—especially nowadays of the goldbug imaginary—is that their devotion to capitalist principles is so extreme that they would embrace a solution that would destroy capitalism itself. And that tells me something about the quasi Red Guard–type tendencies that we’re seeing in the first months of the MAGA administration, where the devotion to ideology overrides economic rationality. In the case of the goldbugs, the idea was that in the ruins of an economy destroyed by what they call “monetary socialism,” you would be able to barter and truck and exchange with small chunks of gold that had been in your possession through the whole duration of the collapse. But it strikes me as a very strange and negative utopia where life has been reduced to exchanging metal. And yet for a lot of people, there was this twin vindication of being proven right if that happens, and then also being able to purchase the lives and properties of others for nothing. There’s a really interesting twist here, which is that at times these hard-money people especially can become sort of trenchant critics of late capitalism. I think they’re accurately seeing some of the absurdities of a hyper-financialized economy. And yet, as with achaotic trade policyof these last weeks, the [critics] diagnose accurately the problem, which is the social and economic disruptions of hyperglobalization. But then they compose a solution that will only make it worse. Let’s talk about the tariff situation because I think that’s probably what our readers are worrying about. But he just gave a 90-day delay, so maybe no one’s going to be talking. [Laughs] Exactly. Well, I read your latest column in theFinancial Times,and you talk about how his tariffs are a powerful form of “direct economics.” Do you want to unpack what you mean? Sure. I think that much of the three hards—hardwired human nature, hard borders, and hard money—is an attempt to recover an immediacy that people feel has been lost. So there are three different ways of responding to what feels like excessive abstraction and dematerialization of people’s everyday lives, their senses of themselves, their senses of the place that they live. They attempt what the financial press categorizes as a “flight to safety” or a “flight to security” under terms of uncertainty. So that could mean taking refuge in literally gold or, symbolically, the privileges of whiteness or national citizenship and the security that is assumed to go along with that. I think that Steve Bannon’s idea of citizenship value is kind of brilliant—that we need to move from a world of shareholder value to citizenship value. I think that’s a perfect expression of the demand for immediacy and recompensation for feeling of loss that people in many cases are experiencing. So to give people a sense of immediacy, they resort to a series of techniques, which you could call gimmicks, tricks, or clever tactics to satisfy people’s political earnings. And in that piece, I describe a couple of them. The exercise of executive power over trade policy itself. The ability of the president, as with the many executive orders, to simply turn the ship of the national economy—and by extension the ship of the world economy—at the stroke of a pen is a remarkably empowering feeling for people who see the president as an extension of themselves in some way. The practice of cash transfers—as in the stimulus checks that people received in the course of the pandemic—with the president’s name on them, colloquially known as Trump Bucks, was another example of that. Obviously, purchasing a memecoin like TrumpCoin or $MELANIA is another way that you’ve managed to do an end run around this dense thicket of elites, whether they’re Wall Street advisers or bankers or university professors and economists who all pretend to know how everything works, and yet you suspect that they don’t. When someone offers you these methods of direct economics, then you feel satisfied and satiated. Power seems to have come back down to earth and taken a human form.

    "title": "The Love Story of the Royal Family and Cartier, Told Through One Spectacular Pink Diamond",
    "article_text": "In May of last year,Queen CamillaandKing Charles IIImade an appearance at a Buckingham Palace garden party, one of their first since the king announcedhis cancer diagnosisthree months earlier. Perhaps to mark the emotional significance of the moment, the queenworetheWilliamson brooch, a truly spectacular 23.6-carat pink diamond set in platinum, designed by Cartier in 1953. The brooch, which matched Camilla’s pinkAnna Valentinecoat dress and the king’s pink cummerbund, wasdesigned for Queen Elizabethearly in her reign, and the late queen brought it out for sentimental moments throughout her life. When Queen Camilla wore the brooch last May, she was continuing to breathe new life into the legendary royal collection. At the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, where a much anticipated “Cartier” exhibition opens on April 12, cocuratorsHelen MolesworthandRachel Garrahanworried they might not be able to include it in the upcoming show. “We are very fortunate that the king is lending it to us for the show,” Garrahan tellsVanity Fair.“It is only by seeing it in real life that visitors can really make that connection between the piece and the drawings and the people who made it.” The brooch features 170 small brilliants, 12 baguettes, and 12 marquises alongside its pink centerpiece, set in a platinum truss designed to showcase the diamonds and practically disappear. It will be on public display at the museum’s South Kensington location until November 16 as a part of a survey of the house’s nearly 180-year history, featuring objects from the early days of its popularity among the British aristocracy, like theManchester Tiaraand fern brooches, both from 1903, all the way to a whimsical 2024 carabiner watch. In assembling the exhibition, Molesworth and Garrahan were able to dive into the company’s archives, along with related materials from the Royal Archives. “All the royal pieces, through five generations, show how times change and tastes change,” Garrahan says. “Cartier is able to offer something and has that relationship with the royal family in order to adapt to that.” The British royals are devoted to Cartier, and vice versa. King Edward VII first gave the brand a royal warrant, a public certification for companies who provide goods or services to the royal household, in 1904, and Windsors ranging from Queen Mary to Wallis Simpson to the Queen Mother to Princess Diana toMeghan Marklehave all incorporated pieces from the company into their collections. Cartier still holds a royal warrant to this day, and Garrahan says that the show illustrates why the bond remains so strong. “Trust is absolutely essential in any client-jeweler relationship, but if you are a royal family, then trust is on a whole other level,” she adds. “Discretion, elegance—all these things would’ve been and still are important to important clients, and Cartier was able to manage these well.” The queen’s beloved Williamson brooch was named for John Williamson, the Canadian mine owner who provided the pink diamond as a wedding present when Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947. Using notes and sketchbooks from the archives, Garrahan found that the stone was incorporated into the brooch as the result of a close collaboration between the queen and the company’s designer Frederick Mew. Four gouache paintings that Mew created for the queen’s approval are on display in the show, next to the finished brooch. Garrahan also learned that Williamson had originally hoped to present the queen with more pink diamonds to fill out the brooch. It seems Williamson was unable to find any more in his mine, so he provided more than 200 white diamonds instead. Mew, who worked at Cartier from the late 1920s until his retirement in 1971, was a great lover of nature, like the late queen. Garrahan pointed to design illustrations for delicate kingfisher brooches, also included in the exhibition, as evidence of his innovative approach to incorporating the shapes of nature into figurative jewelry. “He was a very humble but talented artist,” she says. “In the Williamson designs, you see these different varieties of flower and the way you use diamond cuts to bring out different elements of a design.” The queen’s diamond has never changed hands, but in 2022, a smaller pink diamond from the Williamson mine set records when it wasauctionedfor $57.7 million, or about $5.2 million a carat. The Cartier archives themselves don’t shed much light on what motivated Williamson, a Quebec-born geologist without any obvious ties to the Windsors, to give the queen such a lavish gift.Writing in 1969, jewelry historianSheila Youngdescribed the mine owner as having a “passionate personal attachment to the royal family.” Tanganyika, now known as Tanzania, was part of the British Empire when Williamson “discovered” a diamondiferous area in its borders. Though there is some dispute about whether locals were aware of the mine before Williamson set up his operation, his interest in it made him an extremely wealthy man. On the future queen’s wedding day in November 1947, the uncut diamondwas on display at St. James Palacealongside other gifts given by Canadians, including an emerald and diamond necklace from the people of Victoria, British Columbia. Trade journalGems & Gemologywould report in itsWinter 1948 issuethatthe Diamond Trading Companytasked diamond cutters Briefel and Lemer to turn the 54-carat raw diamond into a brilliant-cut stone. In March 1948, Elizabeth, then Princess of York, was joined by her grandmother Queen Mary at the firm’s Clerkenwell Green factory, where they inspected the diamond and saw the process in action. It was incorporated into Mew’s design, and the finished product became one of Elizabeth’s most sentimental pieces. She wore it to three major royal weddings: the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Kent in 1961, the televised nuptials of Charles and Princess Diana in 1981, and the marriage ofPrince EdwardandSophie, Duchess of Edinburgh,in 1999. The queen likely never met Williamson before his death in January 1958, and her personal feelings about the man and his gift will probably remain unclear until more of her personal papers are made public. One of the best clues as to Williamson’s motivation might come from a fascinating account of what it was like to visit the “shy and mysterious” tycoon at his mine, often called Mwadui, outside of Shinyanga. In an article forMaclean’s Magazinecalled “My Strange Encounter With the Diamond King,” Canadian businessman Robert Kipp told the story of his 1951 travels to Tanganyika to show Williamson and his polishing machines in action. In his essay, Kipp explained that his time at the mine exposed him to a sheer glut of raw diamonds, to the point that Kipp “became bored” with them. “The grubby glass-like lumps were as commonplace as potatoes,” he continued. “Like everyone else at Mwadui, I literally walked on them; they are mined only a few inches from the surface. I saw rough diamonds packed in flat tins and tucked into shirt pockets as casually as cigarettes. I saw them in glass jars, tier upon tier, in Williamson’s safes. Sometimes I found myself alone in a sorting room, trickling a fortune in stones through my fingers.” In 1976, Williamson’s biographer John Gawain described the gift to Queen Elizabeth as an example of the miner’s attention to the “personal obligations which he felt were his duty.” It’s easier to give nearly 200 diamonds to a hereditary monarch when you have plenty to spare.

    "article_text": "Harvey Weinsteinis back on trial for sex crimes in New York. On Tuesday, jury selection began for the 73-year-old’s new trial, in which the disgraced film mogul and face of the #MeToo movement is accused of sexually assaulting three different women. In 2020, Weinsteinwas convictedof two felony sex crimes in New York: rape and criminal sexual act. (He was acquitted by the jury on three other charges, including accusations that he was a sexual predator.) Weinsteinwas sentenced to 23 years in prisonfor the two felony convictions. In 2022, he wasfound guilty of three counts in Los Angelesand sentenced to serve 16 years in prison after completing his 23-year New York sentence, all but assuring that Weinstein would spend the rest of his life in prison. However, that potentially changed last April when the New York Court of Appealsoverturned Weinstein’s convictionin a 4-3 ruling, deciding that Weinstein had been subject to “egregious errors” during his first trial due to the judge permitting testimony from several witnesses who described alleged sexual misconduct committed by Weinstein that was not charged in the indictment. After the verdict, Weinstein’s 23-year New York convictionwas voidedand a new sexual assault trial wastentatively scheduledto begin in November of last year. After adelay, that trial begins today. “I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time,” said Weinsteinin a statementon Monday, reported byThe New York Times. “Tomorrow, I walk into court a free man in New York—and I expect to walk out the same way.” In the new trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from the two alleged victims who testified in 2020, former actressJessica Mannand producerMiriam “Mimi” Haley.Manhattan District AttorneyAlvin Bragg—who declared his intention to retry Weinstein soon after his conviction was overturned—announced a new accuserand an additional grand jury indictment for this latest trial. The new accuser alleges that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in a hotel in 2006. According toThe New York Times,prosecutors saythat they have known about the new accuser since 2020, but that she only recently agreed to come forward. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and accusations of nonconsensual sex, and has long denied all the allegations against him. He has also appealed his California conviction. Before his multiple convictions, Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood—the super producer behind Oscar-winning films likePulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love,andThe English Patient.At the dawn of the #MeToo movement in 2017, his empire began to crumble as multiple actresses, includingGwyneth PaltrowandAngelina Jolie,accused him ofsexual harassment. Since his convictions, Weinstein has been held on Rikers Island, with the exception of multiple stays at Bellevue Hospital. The 73-year-old’s health has been in decline for years, and he was hospitalized in September foremergency heart surgery. He was laterdiagnosed with a form of bone marrow cancer. Despite his ailing health and status as a convicted felon, Weinstein is still making headlines. He recently spoke out aboutthe legal battlebetweenBlake LivelyandJustin Baldoni.In a statement issued toVanity Fairvia a representative, Weinstein clarified that he was not choosing sides. “Please note that Harvey is not taking sides in the Baldoni–Lively matter. He is not familiar with the details and has only ever had the kindest, warmest interactions with both Blake andRyan [Reynolds].” JudgeCurtis Farberpresides over Weinstein’s retrial and has said that the jury selection process could take up to five days.

    "title": "Meghan Markle Says She Wouldn’t Trade Her “Full On” Parenting Style For Anything",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday,Meghan Markle’snew podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder,returned for its second episode, and during her conversation withReshma Saujani,the founder of Girls Who Code, the duchess opened up about raising her childrenPrince ArchieandPrincess Lilibet of Sussex. While discussing the challenges of balancing work and her home life, Meghan said that both her children were home sick from school while the episode was being recorded, one with flu and one with RSV. After Saujani said she agreed with Meghan’s past comment that her most important title is “Mom,” Meghan said that her parenting style is very intensive, adding that she occasionally chooses to spend more time with the children, even when her husbandPrince Harrysuggests she take a break. “Oh my gosh. I love being a mom so much. It’s my favorite thing,” she said. \"It is the thing where you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, I just need a break. I just need a minute. I just need a minute.’ The second you step into the room, you go, oh!” she said. “Then my husband’s like, ‘My love, can you just give yourself a minute? Why don’t you go work out? Why don’t you go take a bath? I’m like, I know, but I just want to cuddle.\" Meghan said she thought parenting during the pandemic might have affected her approach. “It’s the parenting paradigm where it is so full on, and I wouldn't trade it for anything,” the duchess said. “The pandemic may have been the thing that shifted this, when working from home and parenting from home where they are completely converged, can feel incredibly overwhelming.” During the interview with Saujani—who founded Girls Who Code in 2012 and is now founder and CEO of Moms First, which organizes for improved paid leave policies—thanked Meghan for supporting her projects. They revealed that they first met when Saujani visited Meghan at Kensington Palace in 2018, when Girls Who Code was preparing to launch in the UK. “I remember you came in, we sat in the audience room, and I just said, tell me all about it,” the duchess said. “It was an eye-opener for me of so many other ways in which women were showing up for young girls.” A few years later, Meghan became an early advocate for Moms Firstthrough the Archewell Foundation, and Saujani said the duchess helped the organization get off the ground. Meghan’s podcast, which is produced by Lemonada Media, premiered on April 8, andits first episodefeatured an interview with Bumble CEOWhitney Wolfe Herdwhere Meghan revealed that she had suffered from postpartum preeclampsia. During the second episode, Meghan discussed her feelings following a miscarriage in 2020, which she wrote about ina 2021 essayforThe New York Times.In her conversation with Saujani, she mentioned the feeling of letting go of something she had hoped for, comparing it to the feelings associated with a career change. “You’ve spoken publicly about as you were doing Girls Who Code, all the interpersonal things that were happening for you at that time, and the miscarriages you’ve experienced,” she said. “I’ve spoken about the miscarriage [Harry and I] experienced. And I think in some parallel way, when you have to learn to detach from the thing that you have so much promise and hope for, and to be able to be okay at a certain point to let something go, something that you planned to love for a long time.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Obama Praises Harvard for Standing Up to Trump and Calls On Other Universities to Do The Same",
    "article_text": "In short order,Donald Trumphas managed to bend to his will much of the American political system and many major institutions outside government, like law firms and universities. But Harvard University, in refusing his demands Monday, is setting an example for other Trump targets to follow: “Let’s hope other institutions follow suit,” as former PresidentBarack ObamawroteMonday evening, praising the Ivy League school for “rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom.” Obama had been pushing for higher education institutions to avoid being “intimidated” by Trump’s bullying, as Columbia University and some top law firms like Paul Weiss have been as the administration threatens their funding and operations. “We’re in one of those moments when…it’s not enough just to say you’re for something,” the former presidentsaidearlier this month in an appearance at Hamilton College. “You may actually have to do something and possibly sacrifice a little bit.” And, indeed, it seems Harvard will have to sacrifice for its stand: After Harvard released aletterMonday saying it was “not prepared to agree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration,” the administrationsaidit would freeze more than $2 billion in federal funding as punishment. Then, on Tuesday, the president, on TruthSocial,escalatedthe clash between the elite university and the White House, threatening Harvard’s tax status. The Trump administration has been pressuring universities under the guise of combating antisemitism on campuses. But the administration’s stated intent to root out antisemitism is but acynical coverfor its more earnest ambitions: to dismantle diversity initiatives and to cow institutions seen as bastions of liberalism. “The universities seem all powerful, and they have acted as if they were all powerful, and we’re finally revealing that we can hit that where it hurts,” conservative activistChristopher RufotoldtheNew York TimesMonday. “We want to set them back a generation or two.” The administration’s hardball unquestionably puts universities and other institutions in a difficult position; Harvard’s letter—written by attorneysWilliam BurckandRobert Hur, the latter of whom was the special counsel who investigatedJoe Biden’s handling of classified documents (and called attention to his age and mental dexterity in his report)—noted that Trump was threatening “federal funding critical to vital research and innovation that has saved and improved lives and allowed Harvard to play a central role in making our country’s scientific, medical, and other research communities the standard-bearers for the world.” The Harvard showdown underscores just how critical it is that institutions, inside and outside the government, show resolve in the face of Trump’s threats. It might come at a “price,” as Obama acknowledged at Hamilton College earlier this month. But it’s not as if Columbia caving to this administration will be spared Trump’s intimidation campaign; as always, the appeased bully has only sought further satisfaction, with the administration—still yet to restore the school’s funding—nowreportedlyseeking to ensure the university adheres to its demands by putting it in a consent decree. It won’t be easy for Harvard and any other universities thatfollow its lead. But to capitulate to this administration’s authoritarian tactics is to help legitimize them. This is a time for institutions to muster strength.

    "article_text": "Vice PresidentJD Vancedropped the College Football Playoff national championshiptrophyat the White House on Monday during a ceremony on the South Lawn. The Ohio State Buckeyes—Vance’s alma mater—were invited byDonald Trumpto celebrate the team's title-winning season only to encounter this fumble. The Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame for the trophy which is made of a 12-inch bronze base, and a separate 26-and-a-half-inch trophy made from 24-karat gold, bronze and stainless steel. Together, the pieces weigh 50 pounds which does explain whyTreVeyon Henderson, a running back on the team, tried to help when Vance originally went to hoist it from the table and the two components separated with the base toppling to the ground. Eventually ditching the base altogether and holding the trophy for the group photosVance later joked on X, “I didn’t want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.” A sentiment that appears to be the administration’s undercurrent,breaking norms—democratic,legal,and otherwise—as Trump and Vance near their first 100 days in office, a benchmark that has traditionally been used to measure presidential performance. According to a recent Reuters/Ipsossurveyconducted March 31 to April 2, 49% of Americans have an unfavorable view of the vice president while 41% view him favorably. Meanwhile, 52% of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump while 45% view him favorably. But the divide falls starkly along party lines as 83% of Republicans say they view Vance favorably and 88% of Republicans say they view Trump favorably. It’s unclear if Vance’s ill-timed drop will affect his approval rating, but the president is touting the deepening embrace of MAGA throughout the Republican party. According to a newNBC News Poll, 36% of registered voters identify as MAGA supporters, with 71% of Republicans calling themselves MAGA supporters. Hours after Vance’s mishap, Trump took to Truth Social to spread the MAGA gospel: \"A just out NBC Poll says that MAGA is gaining tremendous support. I am not, at all, surprised!!!\" Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Meet Kristi Noem, America’s Chief Immigration Enforcement Influencer",
    "article_text": "Since becoming Department of Homeland Security secretary,Kristi Noemhas worn a lot of hats—literally. There was thefirefighter hatshe wore during a photo op with the Coast Guard, theICE hatshe wore standing in front of a group of caged men in El Salvador, thehelmetshe put on during an ATV ride along the border, and who could forget thecowboy hatshe donned while riding on horseback with Customs and Border Protection agents? Not that Noem would let anyone forget it: Framed shots of Noem’s horseback and ATV rides now feature prominently on the walls of the DHS offices, theWall Street Journalreports. Noem has, like few before her, blurred the lines between cabinet member and content creator. But according to theJournal, the DHS secretary’s prolific social media presence is beginning to rub other top Trump officials the wrong way. TheJournalcites one incident in particular in which Noem posted on X about her participation in an ICE raid before the raid was complete, a move people familiar with the raid told theJournalundercut the mission. (A DHS spokesperson told theJournalthe raid was almost over when Noem’s post went live). In an interview with Fox News last week, Noemdefendedher frequent wardrobe changes, saying she represents an agency with many different branches underneath and “they are so proud of the fact that I’m willing to wear an ICE hat, that I’m willing to wear an HSI vest.” According to theJournal, other top Trump officials, including White House border czarTom Homanand deputy chief of staffStephen Miller, have taken on the practical parts of the president’s mass deportation efforts—which would otherwise fall within Noem’s purview. That turf war has reportedly driven tensions within DHS to the point that Noem is now polygraphing staffers to identify possible leakers. A DHS spokesperson told theJournalthe three officials are “working hand-in-glove.” While Noem’s stunts may be particularly flashy, they blend seamlessly into the White House’s broader social media strategy, where the administration’s Instagram and X feeds have churned out a constant stream ofcruel memesand dehumanizingmockeryat the expense of people who are being deported. For the Trump administration, immigration isn't just a crisis; it's content.

    "title": "In ‘Dexter: Resurrection,’ Michael C. Hall Rises From the Ashes—and Hopes to Stick Around",
    "article_text": "Dexter Morgan knows what the end feels like, and he’s not too keen on it. The morally minded serial killer portrayed byMichael C. Hallfirst showed up in Showtime’s eponymous drama seriesDexter,in the thick of the late-2000s antihero boom alongside Walter White (Breaking Bad) and Don Draper (Mad Men). The hit show ran for eight seasons before reaching a widely maligned conclusion, in which Dexter decided to fake his own death and go live as a lumberjack in a secluded mountain town. Hall then reprised the role in a sequel series,New Blood,which ended with Dexter seemingly actually dying—at the hands of his son, Harrison (Jack Alcott). That finale was fairly divisive too. Still—dead is dead, right? Not quite, it turns out. “We thought it would be the end, but he’s a remarkably resilient guy, so the possibility was always—at least for me—percolating,” Hall says over Zoom. He’s speaking to me on break from a day of production onDexter: Resurrection,whose title should tell you thatNew Bloodwas not, in fact, the end. Hall reiterates that he personally pushed to bring his signature character back to TV. He calledClyde Phillips,Dexter’s original showrunner andNew Blood’s creator, to see what could be done. Here’s how Phillips remembers the pitch: “Michael said, ‘Dexter is in my bones, and I know what’s in your bones, Clyde. Can you figure out a way to undo what we did at the end ofNew Blood? Is there a way to make him survive?’” Within a week, Phillips and fellow executive producerScott Reynoldscame up with an idea. They told Hall it was a yes. They put aResurrectionwriters’ room together while shootingOriginal Sin,a prequel starringPatrick Gibsonas Dexter in his 20s, set about 15 years before the events of the initial series.Sin’s first season, which concluded in February (it’s been renewed for a second season), has turned out to be a crucial text. It’s narrated by Hall’s Dexter in the immediate aftermath ofNew Blood;as he’s revived by doctors, his life flashes before his (or really, our) eyes. He looks back on how he got into the killing-for-justice game in the first place. “The character was severely traumatized by a lot of what happened to him in the original incarnation, and is only now at a place where he’s able to shed that,” Hall says. “Spending time with that [Original Sin] material helped embroider and color in what was maybe a line drawing or an outline that I had in my mind from the beginning—so it’s a tool for us.” Premiering this summer on Paramount+ With Showtime,Resurrectiontakes place a few weeks afterNew Bloodand is framed by the intense dynamic between father and son. Dexter chases a missing Harrison to New York City, whereDavid Zayas’s Captain Angel Batista is hot on their trail from way down in Miami. Zayas is far from the only original cast member returning: “John LithgowandJimmy Smitswill be in for a minute,” Phillips says, referring to their beloved respective roles of the Trinity Killer and ADA Miguel Prado. Dexter’s late adoptive father, Harry, who instilled the code of killing in his son, will return in ghost form, again portrayed byJames Remar.Then there’s the matter of Harrison—safe to say, he’ll play a prominent role. “Dexter has a lot of hesitation about making contact, which is a fundamental part of the tension that is pervasive for the first bit of the season,” Hall says. “Harrison revealed himself to be, and remains, an all-the-more potent connection to Dexter’s tiny sense of humanity. He craves it, in spite of himself, so it’s a major bolt of thread running through his interior life and the life of the season.” Phillips adds that Dexter’s search for his son intersects with the reemergence of his father’s physical memory: “Dexter finds Harrison fairly quickly, then he asks Harry, ‘Do I reveal myself to him? Is it going to screw him up to have a zombie dad?’” At the “dramatically right moment,” Phillips teases, father and son resume contact. “Dexter is determined to make sure that he has a solid—and more importantly honest and loving—relationship with his son.” And then there are the new cast additions:Neil Patrick Harris, Krysten Ritter, Eric Stonestreet, David Dastmalchian,and more will appear in guest roles, while new adversaries include Emmy winnerPeter Dinklageas a billionaire venture capitalist with a dark side and Oscar nomineeUma Thurmanas his mysterious head of security. “When Uma first came to the set, the whole set changed—in walks this movie star, and she haspresence,” Phillips says. “But nobody gets a call sheet like this, particularly on a TV show. I guess it shows that we’re more than just a TV show. People want to work with Michael.” A native of North Carolina, Hall completed his MFA at New York University to begin the pursuit of an acting career. “It’s where I, I suppose, came of age,” he says. It feels special to be again reprising the role of Dexter Morgan not just anywhere, but in the place where his dream took root. “I’m in the midst of something I only once imagined, shooting something like this, with a role like this, on location in New York City,” he says. “It’s important to remind yourself that while you’re very much wide awake in the present, you’re simultaneously in the midst of what was once a dream.” Although Hall has pulled off acclaimed, significant work onstage and onscreen both before and afterDexter—coleading HBO’s groundbreakingSix Feet Under,doingCabaretandHedwigon Broadway—he’s long been most closely associated with his chilly, terrifying, strangely vulnerable turn as TV’s most honorable serial killer. For his performance, he won a Golden Globe and a SAG Award, and received five Emmy nominations. (He earned another Emmy nod for best drama series as a producer.) “Why would an audience invite a serial killer to their home every Sunday night? He kills for good, he has a code, he does all of that—but it’s Michael,” Phillips says. “His voiceover brings a relatability, a vulnerability, and shows a whole other side to the process that we absorb and honor and believe—and, I think, we’re hungry for more. I ask Hall if he felt any reluctance about jumping back into the character, especially since it required an “undoing,” as he described it, of where he’d previously left him. “None that in any way serves me at the present—I’m probably dispositionally addicted to ambivalence, but no,” he replies. “It’s a special thing to be onto something that continues to give you something back. Ultimately, any misgivings were overwhelmed by relishing the idea of him rising from his self-imposed ashes.” In our interview, both Hall and Phillips sound energized by what they call at various points a “second chance” and a “new beginning.” They’re all over New York, “a place where you can be lost and found,” as Phillips puts it. “Dexter for a while was lost, and now he’s found himself again.” The same logic might just apply to where Phillips and co. find themselves at the moment, deep in production onResurrection.They can imbue the psychological insights ofOriginal Sin,expand on the narrative building blocks ofNew Blood,and return to what madeDexterso distinctive in the first place. “This show can end up being an Easter egg hunt for the OG fans, but we’re also making it a fresh new show. If people haven’t seen the show before, they can come in and watch a fully formed television series,” Phillips says. Do Hall and Phillips viewResurrectionas a limited, one-off series? They respond defiantly. “We’ve got the strongest franchise in Showtime’s history, and we plan to do this for years,” Phillips says. Hall chimes in: “Yearswith ans.The thinking is not to come back for a sort of self-contained one-off again, but leave it open to further exploration. The intention, and hope, is that the story will continue beyond this.” Hell, even if that weren’t the case, Dexter Morgan is a hard guy to keep down. “He’s a much more human, flesh-and-blood version of that horror trope of someone who just refuses to go down,” Hall says. And rest assured, Hall is not complaining.",

    "title": "On Jackie Robinson Day, I’m Remembering the Hall of Famer—and My Friend Chadwick Boseman, Who Brought Him to Life",
    "article_text": "Jackie Robinson Day is upon us and if current events are any indication, it needs to be celebrated with some exigency this year. As Robinson is rightfully and righteously remembered on ballfields across America, I’d like to remember my friend Chadwick Boseman, who played Jackie in the film42.I first met Chad in the casting offices ofVickie Thomas.The search for Jack Roosevelt Robinson had begun, and Chad was the second person we met on what promised to be an exhaustive endeavor. He wanted to skip the small talk that generally precedes an audition. “I’d like to get right to it if that’s cool?” Chad chose to start with the most emotionally challenging of the four scenes he’d been sent. No warm up—just straight into the fire. As he finished, I knew he’d just cast himself in the film; the exhaustive search had taken 20 minutes. And then he was gone. I said to Vickie, “A movie star just walked out of the room.” She knew it too. Chad had been waiting for his chance, and when it came, he owned it. About two months later, we stood on the field of UCLA’s Jackie Robinson Stadium. We had to pass a bronze statue of the man, so it was pretty clear where we were. By this time, the studio has seen Chad’s casting tape, but this is a baseball audition, and 20 people have shown up to watch Chad get worked out. A professional scout for the New York Yankees (!) is here to run the show. Chad is plenty athletic: He played point guard for his high school basketball team, though he hasn’t played baseball since Little League. The scout throws Chad a ball (a scout for theNew York Yankees,if I didn’t make that clear). When Chad throws the ball back, he “dirts” it. I don’t mean it reaches the scout on a hop or two; I mean he rears back and fires the ball into the ground at his own two feet! The world stops spinning; time stands still. Chad looks over at me for a beat and then nods: “I got this, Brian.” He picks up the ball and fires it back…. Bullseye. Chad nails the workout; he’s got the part. We shoot in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama. I walk into Chad’s trailer one day. He freeze frames the movie he’s been watching. There’sClint Eastwoodon the screen, fromCoogan’s Bluffof all things. Chad says, “I’ve been studying him. I love the way he says nothing.”Harrison Fordarrives in Chattanooga—in the flesh, not on screen. His first scene is one of his most emotional in the movie. It’s when he finally answers Jackie’s thrice-asked question, “Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey?” Chad simply needs to listen to his confession. But he not only holds his ground opposite Ford, he maybe even steals the scene just listening. Back behind those monitors, I think, “I love the way Chad says nothing.” When we’re done, Ford asks me, “Is that what he’s been doing?” It’s not a criticism. Ford is impressed. On a sweltering day in Macon,Rachel Robinsonmakes an appearance. Legendary Entertainment CEOThomas Tull,who embraced Chad as Jackie early on, has scooped her up in his jet and deposited her by the visitor’s dugout. Possessed of royal bearing that QE2 could only dream of, Mrs. Robinson meets the actors playing the Dodgers, and they announce who they are portraying. She’s delighted to meet the ones who treated her husband fairly but keeps the ones who didn’t at arm’s length. Chad has met her several times, but this is the first time she has seen him in uniform as her husband. As Chad moves to hug her, she puts an arm up to block him, “Get away from me with all that sweat,” she laughs. He smiles the most beautiful smile. “Come here,” he says, and then takes her into his arms. Mrs. Robinson melts. For a moment, she is with her beloved Jack again. Finally, we shoot a day in Brooklyn in and around the actual brownstone apartment Jackie and Rachel lived in in 1947. Chad arrives on set in costume, and he is nearly speechless. It turns out we’re shooting on the same street that he himself lived on before he moved to Los Angeles. He lived on Jackie Robinson’s street without knowing it! On his way to the set, old neighbors stop him.We haven’t seen you in a while. What are you up to?“Well, I just came back to play Jackie Robinson.” On that day, I started to believe in fate. Coincidences are just not that coincidental. We are on an ADR stage rerecording a few lines of dialogue during postproduction. The ADR recordist keeps stopping the take. He’s picking up some metallic sound on his headphones. Finally, he asks if anyone has any loose change in their pockets. Chad sheepishly pulls about $10 in quarters out of his jeans. As he sets them on the table, he explains to me, “I gotta go do my laundry after this.” In response, the recordist’s voice over a speaker: “After this movie comes out, you’re never going to have to do your own laundry again.” Chad gives me a wistful look and whispers, “I like doing my own laundry.” They’re screening the film at Dodger Stadium after a game on the huge video screens in the outfield. Ten thousand people end up staying to watch. The Dodgers have asked Chad to throw out the game’s opening pitch. He calls me a week out. “I can’t do it, man. I can’t go out there and throw the first pitch into the ground. You gotta do it.” I measure out 60 feet 6 inches in my backyard and practice. This is going to be a disaster, but better me than Chad. Ten minutes before my public humiliation, Chad comes over and says, “I got this.” It’s like the governor signed a stay of execution. Chad goes to the mound and throws a perfect strike. After42was long gone from theaters, we used to go to Skye Tacos on Pico to catch up and trade schemes we had for the future. Chad was on a crazy ride, an overnight sensation if you ignore the decade of yeoman anonymous work that came before it. But if anyone could take a rollercoaster ride in stride, it was Chad. We would shoot the breeze for an hour or two every few months at this spot. On one particular day, we took our tacos outside to a sidewalk table. After a minute, Chad suddenly asked if I minded switching places. We do-si-doed. I sat the other way, wondering what was bothering Chad about this seat. Then I saw it, a block down Pico: an enormous rooftop billboard with Chad 25-feet-tall, leaning over a microphone as the godfather of soul, James Brown. I think he knew his days of sitting at Skye Tacos, being known simply for how friendly he was, were over. It was also at Skye that Chad told me he was in love. It was the real thing. And it was far and away finer than any old billboard. In 2016, I got a phone call from that love,Simone Ledward,asking me if I could come to the hospital. A volatile health episode had landed Chad there. The details are private, but he was faced with life-changing news. An enormous future was opening up before him. But was it? We talked about his hospital socks. The color he was wearing—an easy-to-spot reference for the staff—was a dire indicator of his current condition. We talked about how he needed to get out of those socks and into a less-serious palette. A few days later, he was in different colored socks. A clock was ticking, but the fight had begun. We would always discuss his illness obliquely. Chad, in fact, would never give cancer its name. We only ever talked about it in terms of socks. “What color socks do you got on today?” “I am doing everything I can to keep those socks off my feet.” His battle would be his own, shared only with those closest to him. In 2020, because of the pandemic, Jackie Robinson Day—traditionally held on April 15 —was delayed until August 28. Chad died that day with his family by his side...on Jackie Robinson Day. Put that in your coincidence pipe and smoke it, ya’ll. His memorial was held on a beautiful day on a bluff in Malibu overlooking the sea. His casket rested under a canopy, and, one after the next, people stepped up to say their farewells. I watched from afar. Something was holding me back; I still can’t quite explain it. But I think I was afraid, just plain old afraid. Finally, I went down and stepped up before him. They say, “rest in peace.” If anyone needed a rest, it was Chad. He’s accomplished so much after42in such little time. All the films he made, fromBlack PanthertoMa Rainey’s,were filmed during and between countless surgeries and treatments. I had something I wanted to say to him. Except, there on top of his casket was a wooden cross, and printed on it was the number 42. Beyond the film, it was a hugely important number to him, a mile marker, a part of him that he carried. It gave him strength somehow. Right then, it took all mine away. A year or so after Chad passed, I had my own staredown with cancer. I promised Chad I would fight like he fought. I didn’t have to. Mine was spotted early, a kindergarten version compared to his. Life is unfair, even when it comes to cancer. Cancer took Chad away, but in no way did it beat him. The King still wears the crown, the belt, and the mantle. Unequivocally, cancer did not beat him. The number 42 has been retired by every team across baseball in honor of Jackie Robinson. His legacy, of course, is unbeaten and still fighting, despite the Department of Defense taking down a web page honoring his military service earlier this year. The number 42 is also retired in my heart, where Chadwick Boseman will always be loved and will always be with me.

    "title": "‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ Star O-T Fagbenle Was Waiting for Luke to Take His Turn Too",
    "article_text": "InAlways Great,Awards Insider speaks with Hollywood’s greatest undersung actors in career-spanning conversations. In this installment,O-T Fagbenlelooks back on how his career exploded while starring on six seasons ofThe Handmaid’s Tale,and the breakthroughs (and setbacks) that led to it. It’s not justTheHandmaid’s Talefans who were waiting six seasons for Luke (O-T Fagbenle) to say, “This is my turn.” After being rescued by June (Elisabeth Moss) from No Man’s Land, Luke makes clear to his wife in the final season’s fourth episode that his decision to take action against the Gilead regime and join the Mayday resistance group was not a one-off. He’s spent nearly the entirety of the show watching June risk death to try and rescue their daughter, Hannah, and take the bad guys down. He feels determined to step in now and is prepared for the consequences—and Fagbenle, for his part, was relieved by his character’s evolution. “The chagrin of Luke is watching his inaction, and it’s very frustrating for audience members seeing him be this cardigan-wearing passive guy while so much is going on—and I guess, for a while, it was tempting for me to be frustrated as well,” the actor says. “This is the season where he’s going to take matters into his own hands. The only way Luke could get there was to make peace with the fact that he might die doing this. That excited me.” An alum of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Fagbenle has appeared in dozens of TV shows, but never for as long as onThe Handmaid’s Tale. His career has transformed in the time he’s been on the Emmy-winning series, going on to star opposite the likes ofViola DavisandJake Gyllenhaalwhile always returning to a project that’s come to feel like home. Coming off of this last season ofHandmaid’s Tale, playing Luke came to feel disarmingly second-nature. “I have real memories of a decade ago, of stowing away on a ship or being shot or seeing my kid dragged away,” he says. “It’s a very strange feeling to have actually lived through something in front of the camera.” Fagbenle rose in his native UK as a theater actor long before getting his big break onscreen. He performed in major Shakespeare productions as a teenager and generated international acclaim for his turn as Mercutio in aRomeo & Juliettour in his early 20s. He started getting cast in notable films and series a few years later; after starring oppositeMichelle PfeifferandPaul RuddinAmy Heckerling’s2007 rom-comI Could Never Be Your Woman, he decided to make a go of an American screen-acting career. He guest-starred on theCourteney CoxdramedyDirt, the TBS sitcomMy Boys, and aMichael Strahancomedy on Fox that was swiftly canceled. The guy known for his chameleonic stage presence back home was landing jobs in Hollywood, to be sure, without exactly getting to show his stuff. “I actually had a really great hit rate—I put a lot of work into every single audition,” Fagbenle says. But when he turned 30, he decided to reach higher and stop putting himself up for guest roles. “I was, like, ‘Right, this is my time. I’m going to go get the big part,’” he says. “I auditioned for a year—and I think I did almost a hundred auditions without even a callback.” He simultaneously suffered a bad burning accident in his kitchen, hurting his face and chest; then he climbed a mountain in the Mojave Desert with a friend and had a “psychedelic experience” that gave him perspective. He asked himself: “Do I want to keep pursuing this thing that doesn’t look like it’s going to happen?” He found an answer. He packed his bags and moved back to London. “I did a small play in a tiny theater where there were nights where there were more people on stage than there were in the audience,” he says of his return home. He felt better than he had in years. And then, naturally, the offers started coming in—from back across the Atlantic. Fagbenle first caught my eye in HBO’sLooking, the intimate portrait of a group of gay friends in contemporary San Francisco. He played Frank, the put-upon long-term boyfriend of Agustín (Frankie J. Alvarez), a volatile and damaged budding artist. It came around because Fagbenle had made an impression on the directorAndrew Haighyears earlier while auditioning for his 2011 feature,Weekend. Fagbenle was in the final two to play one of the lead roles but dropped out to pursue a safer opportunity. “I have very few regrets in my career, and not taking part in that is probably one of them,” Fagbenle says. But though Haigh soared afterWeekend, now considered a modern queer classic, he did not forget Fagbenle. A good thing, too: Fagbenle’sLookingperformance was sweet, warm, and patient; he conveyed an effortless sexual freedom and emotional intelligence. “Frank is justinme, and he was in me 5 years and 10 years before I ever didLooking,” Fagbenle says. “It was more an exploration of that part of me, whether it’s physical or vocal. It was a real explorative time, and I loved him and miss getting to play him. Andrew, if you’re listening, we’ll come back. We’ll do it again.” The show ran for two seasons before wrapping up with a finale movie for HBO, in which Fagbenle made a brief appearance. The Handmaid’s Talebegan shortly thereafter, and Fagbenle received his first Emmy nod for the show. The time commitment hardly limited him; his career blossomed around the blockbuster drama, making good on his career beginnings on the London stage by never doing the same thing twice. Well, exceptLookingdid represent one troubling pattern: “I was a professional boyfriend,” Fagbenle says with a laugh. “I went through something like 20 shows in a row where I had to make out with someone.” (Most recently, he was a charmer asMichaela Jaé Rodriguez’slove interest onLoot.) He started taking control of his own fate, too, after watchingQuentin Tarantinopoint out at an awards-season roundtable that, with technology today, most anyone can try making their own film: “I was, like, ‘Fuck you, Tarantino, calling me out!’” He took the note, making his own short films, and eventually his own TV show:Maxx, a well-reviewed comedy about a washed-up boy band star vying for a comeback. He’s got a few other projects in development now. Fagbenle has started getting meatier offers, too.Susanne Bierasked him to play former presidentBarack ObamaoppositeViola Davis’sMichelle ObamainThe First Lady, which remains the hardest job of his career. “This wave of excitement and exhilaration then becomes this crash of dread as the reality of an almost Sisyphean, Herculean task is put ahead of you,” he says. “We know Obama. We know how he walks, we know what his jump shot looks like. It was a crushing pressure to play him.” Did he feel like he pulled it off? Fagbenle demurs: “It was challenging, particularly vocally because there was quite a lot of improvisation in that show.” What did he make of the show’s muted reception and eventual cancellation? Again, he demurs: “It’s somewhat of a mystery to me of what makes something successful or not successful,” he says. “As much as I can not let my sense of self-worth or happiness be too tethered to the success of any show, it’s hard to do.” Fortunately, this awards season is filled with hits for Fagbenle. Last summer, he chewed the scenery alongsidePeter Sarsgaardas ruthlessly ambitious DAs inPresumed Innocent, the hit legal drama helmed byDavid E. Kelleyand starring Gyllenhaal. This is a complement because each performance in the show is dialed to 100—it’s the whole juicy appeal. “I seriously wondered on day one whether someone would just take me aside and be, like, ‘Why are you talking like that? Can you stop?’” Fagbenle says. Instead, he saw Sarsgaard digging in even more. “The stuff that was left on the cutting room floor—he would just do insane things. You would read the scene and you’d be, like, ‘Oh,thisis how it’s going to be played. Everybody in that cast is a theater actor, and the court is a type of theater, so there was this meta thing going on.” Handmaid’s,meanwhile, has earned its best reviews in years as it approaches the end. One highlight so far this season found Luke finally coming face to face with June’s other love interest,Max Minghella’sNick, after years of buildup. The scene is so perfectly awkward that Elisabeth Moss couldn’t look at Fagbenle without bursting into laughter. “In that scene, you’ll see she never looks at me,” Fagbenle says. The moment also oddly reminded Fagbenle of his beginnings as a screen actor. Some 20 years ago, he got called up by a famous director despite having never made a movie before. He was asked to put himself on tape and wound up scoring the part after an in-person audition. “I was so excited and I went outside and I was dancing, and then I turned around to see that where I was dancing was right outside the window where he was sitting—and he was watching me,” Fagbenle says. “I felt so embarrassed.” Still, he ultimately got to makeBreaking and EnteringwithJude Law, Juliette Binoche,andRobin Wright. The director was the late great Anthony Minghella (The Talented Mr. Ripley), and while making that movie, Anthony’s son, Max Minghella—yes, now Fagbenle’sHandmaid’sTaleromantic foil—“came to set in his uniform after school to come sit with the actors,” Fagbenle says. “Just one of those full-circle moments.” He smiles thinking back on it again. Surely, as his career continues to expand, more are on the way.

    "title": "Mar-a-Lago Has Gone to the Dogs: Inside a Surreal Canine Fundraising Gala",
    "article_text": "Raising more than $4 million for a dog rescue is unquestionably a noble feat. Yet the Big Dog Ranch Rescue fundraising gala hosted at Mar-a-Lago managed to blur those lines in a culture in which one’s voting record now defines their perceived virtue. The setting, which is so inextricably linked toDonald Trumpthat it’s been deemed the “winter White House,” raised more than a few eyebrows. Still, the event was a financial success even before a single adoption took place, with table tickets ranging from $7,500 to $25,000. At the helm wereLauree Simmons,a longtime Trump ally and the CEO of Big Dog Ranch Rescue, andNicolaVerses,a member of the family that founded Conair. And with rumors of Trump’s attendance swirling, it quickly became clear that this wasn’t just a dog-rescue gala; it was a political spectacle in its own right. After all, Simmons has known the Trumps for 12 years, and Mar-a-Lago offered her the space and allure for wealthy and well-connected guests, includingElon Musk,who stood in as a sideshow with his sonXon his back, who was wearing a rocket ship backpack. Trump’s daughter-in-law,Lara,was the master of ceremonies, while his granddaughterCarolinaparaded his “granddog” down the runway. And the president himself, never one to miss the opportunity for self-promotion, eventually made a short appearance. The highest adoption bid, $18,000, went to the coveted “pick of the litter.” But funds from every auction were earmarked to support the rescue’s mission of pulling dogs from kill shelters, covering lifesaving veterinary care for rescued dogs, and providing US veterans with fully trained service dogs at no cost. Simmons, who wants liberals and conservatives to “come together” for future fundraisers, holds that “dogs aren’t political.” It’s hard to argue with that. But BDRR’s choice of venue definitely raises a debate: How much should we let our principles yield to a greater purpose?Vanity Fair’s photographerSarah Rae Shermancaptured this bizarre and spectacular gala through her lens.

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Tariff Whiplash Sparks Meme Storm and Online Economics Lessons",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s tariff whiplash might not be instilling mucheconomic confidenceor public goodwill, but itisproving to be ripe creative fodder for chatter online. Chinese social media users have flooded the internet withAI-generated memesmocking the administration over trade tensions (see:Donald TrumpandJ.D. Vancestitching red hats in sweatshops), while stateside onlookers are expressing everything from confusion todismayupon discovering just how much of their daily goods are produced by China. One TikTok user posted a video of atroupe of penguins—presumably from the otherwiseuninhabited Heard and McDonald islandsthat were hit with tariffs—descending stairs while on their way to negotiate with the White House. Others have taken to captioning posts of themselves jetting across the sea in a motorboat or standing near a barge ship. “Forget the tariffs,” theywrite. “I’ll just go get it myself.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Amid all the hubbub, manufacturers have identified a somewhat savvy marketing opportunity, too: Many that sell products made in China have taken toTikTok in particularto attract moreattentionfor their merchandise.Pages like Lunasourcingchina, which usually posts about the Chinese suppliers of major brands like Lululemon and Zara, have dedicated recent posts to consumer costs due to tariffs. “Factories won’t absorb the losses,” she explains. “They are not in the business of losing money, and importers won't take the hit either; they’ll just pass the costs down the supply chain.” Small business owners on the platform are readying their followers for potential price increase, while others, likeChelsey Brown, aretakingsomething of a stand: “I REFUSE to close!” she said. “I refuse to fail!! So I’m going to keep taking out loans until I can’t anymore—just to survive the 54% and 145% tariffs hitting my shipments.” On Friday, the administrationannouncedthat some electronic products would be excluded from reciprocal tariffs. However, on Sunday, Trump seeminglywalkedthat plan back, stating on Truth Social, stating that no one was “getting off the hook” and that “there was no Tariff ‘exception.” “These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs,” he added, “and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.” Adding to the confusion, Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnicklaid out Trump’s plan on Sundayto enact “a special focus-type of tariff” on smartphones, computers and other electronics products in the coming months alongside sectoral tariffs targeting semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. “[Trump is] saying they’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnicksaidin an interview—the hope being the levies would swing manufacturing of these products to the U.S. “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.” Trump,en route back to Washington, D.C. on Sunday night, said there “shouldn’t be ambiguity” on tariffs. Needless to say, ambiguity persists.

    "title": "This Is How Meta AI Staffers Deemed More Than 7 Million Books to Have No “Economic Value”",
    "article_text": "Last month, I prompted Meta AI with a question: “Is it okay to use pirated books to train AI?” The machine’s response was unequivocal. “Using pirated books to train AI is not okay,” it admonished. “In fact, it’s a serious violation of copyright laws and can have significant consequences for authors and publishers. Recently, it’s been reported that Metaused millions of pirated booksto develop its AI programs, which has sparked widespread outrage and condemnation from the writing community.” A few days after my original query, for reasons best known to itself, the algorithm lawyered up. In response to the same prompt, it hedged, “Using pirated books to train AI is a complex issue, and the answer isn’t straightforward. While some companies, like Meta, argue that their use of copyrighted material falls under fair use, others claim it infringes on copyright laws.” (In a2024 statement, Meta describes such varying responses as “hallucinations,” a challenge for all generative AI systems.) Lawyers for Meta are indeed invoking that very “fair use” defense in a copyright suit that’s been wending its way through the Northern District of California legal system fornearly two years.Richard Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms—and the reams of confidential Meta communications, newly in the public record as exhibits for the plaintiffs—offers an unprecedented look at the internal maneuverings behind the company’s decision to train its model on a database containing more than 7 million pirated books. Just last week, plaintiffs—including Pulitzer Prize–winnersAndrew Sean GreerandJunot Díaz,and comedianSarah Silverman—filed a summary judgment motion that reads, “It is now undisputed that Meta torrented tens of millions of pirated books and other copyrighted works, including over 650 copies of Plaintiffs’ Books, for free and without consent from the rightsholders because it did not want to pay for them.” The plaintiffs, figureheaded byRichard Kadrey,the bestselling author of, among other books, the Sandman Slim series, claim that Meta’s “unlawful conduct,” used in service of training its large language model (LLM), infringed on their work. In its own motion, filed last month, Meta claims, as it has since its first motion to dismiss filed in September of 2023, that its Llama (large language model Meta AI) project is “highly transformative” and therefore fair use. (Asked for comment, a Meta spokesperson provided a statement that said, in part, that fair use of copyrighted materials is vital to the development of the company’s open-source AI models. “We disagree with Plaintiffs’ assertions, and the full record tells a different story.” An amicus brief filed last week by the Association of American Publishers on behalf of the plaintiffs argues against this claim: “There is nothing transformative about the systematic copying and encoding of textual works, word by word, into an LLM. It does not involve criticism or commentary, provision of a search or indexing utility, software interoperability, or any other purpose recognized as transformative under fair use precedents.”) The lawsuit is one of more than 16 copyright cases concerning generative AI tools and the multibillion dollar entities that create them currently rippling through the US court system, ranging from musicians suing Anthropic for using lyrics to train its AI, to visual artists suing Stability AI, toTheNew York Timessuing Microsoft, toAuthors Guild v. OpenAI,which is being heard in the Southern District of New York and is expected to go to summary judgment this fall. (Condé Nast,Vanity Fair’s parent company, is a plaintiff inone class action lawsuitagainst the enterprise AI platform Cohere.) The cases raise existential questions about art and literature—their inherent worth and what it means to commodify them—and arrive at a time when generative AI tools are making technical strides. Kadrey et al.has attracted particular attention. One of Meta’s most prominent lawyers,Mark Lemley,quit the case earlier this year—not because he doesn’t believe in its merit, but because of what he described ina LinkedIn postas the company and its CEOMark Zuckerberg’s “descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.” Then, last month,Meta tried to blockthe promotion ofa tell-all memoir by a former employee, which did not further endear the corporation to the literary community. Perhaps most importantly, theet al.plaintiffs are a cadre of big names—besides Greer, Silverman, and Díaz, they include the satiristMatthew Klam,and the National Book Award–WinnersTa-Nehisi CoatesandJacqueline Woodson.(Coates and Woodson areVFcontributors.) A court case, like a work of literature, relies on a good story told persuasively. An interesting wrinkle in this case is that part of the story Meta needs to tell is how little individual books and authors meant in the creation of Llama. (“Is it—do you pronounce it ‘Llama?’” the judge wondered, early on.) Accordingly, a noteworthy argument from the defense was revealed in a court filing last week: “There is no allegation or evidence that the copies Meta made were used for reading Plaintiffs books by Meta employees or anyone else.” Commodifying books is intrinsic to commercial publishing, but there’s something particularly stunning about seeing how thoroughly Meta researchers reduced literature into a pure asset, devoid of meaning. “Fiction is great” for training the language model, one researcher wrote, but noted that there was only about “700GB” of it in the LibGen database. The same researcher gives Hemingway a run for his money, describing the fiction database as “mostly novels, easy to parse, what we use.” In an internal memo, researchers point out the problems with the converted pirated data: page numbers found their way into the body text, the line breaks were incorrect, and there was missing “whitespace” between words. To illustrate, a Meta employee quoted these lines, “Now be nice to Willa Jean, said Mrs. .\\nQuimby, as…” and “Ramona, 33\\n\\n\\would you like…,” which were unmistakably ripped from Beverly Cleary’s beloved 1981 children’s book,Ramona Quimby, Age 8,a book, notably, that remains under copyright. “Goals: get as much long form writing as possible in the next 4–6 weeks,” reads one directive. Articles, movie scripts, magazines, and “books—all genres.” Kadrey et al.argues that Meta “torrented at least 81.7 terabytes of data across multiple shadow libraries through the site Anna’s Archive, including at least 35.7 terabytes of data from Z-Library and LibGen”—illegal databases of pirated books, the latter of which received, in September 2024, a permanent injunction against it in a federal court for copyright infringement, and which has allegedly also been used by OpenAI and others. (In response to complaints filed by prominent authors, OpenAI has said their “models are trained on publicly available data, grounded in fair use.”) Last month,Alex ReisneratThe Atlantic,who hasreported extensivelyon the use of pirated libraries in AI training, published a tool to search the titles inLibGen. (My novel,The Mythmakers,appears in the database, along with books by otherVFstaff. Not all books included in the database were necessarily used to train Llama; Meta has said that their training tool utilized “a fraction of LibGen,” and Reisner notes that the search tool uses a snapshot taken in January 2025, more than a year after Meta accessed its content.) For authors likeCarmen Maria Machado,who isn’t a named plaintiff in the cases but whose books—includingIn the Dream HouseandHer Body and Other Partiesin their original English and in translation—appear to be among those pirated by LibGen, the titles in the database represent countless hours of work. “A decade of my life. That’s my creative labor. That’s my mind,” she tells me. “I just felt—I mean, violated is a really strong word, but it’s like, I sign a lot of contracts. I am in tremendous control of the rights that I have over my books, and my work, and my translations, and my film rights. All of that stuff is so carefully managed, but the idea that some company can just, with zero consequences, feed it into a machine is so insane to me that I can’t fully wrap my head around it.” Speaking toVF,Lemley, the former Meta lawyer, says that the pirated books are “one of those things that sounds bad but actually shouldn’t matter at all in the law. Fair use is always about uses the plaintiff doesn’t approve of; that’s why there is a lawsuit.” He, like the current Meta legal team, cites Google Books, which scanned millions of books without permission—“and all search engines crawl the full internet, including plenty of pirated content,” he argues. “We want to reduce the chance that AI generates infringing output. But regulating what AI trains on is likely to have unexpected consequences.” To his mind, “copyright law should focus on the output rather than how the AI is trained.” That is, if AI trains onHarry Potterbooks and then spits out a Harry Potter book, that’s a copyright problem. If it spits out its own sequel, “that, too, might be a copyright problem.” But, he says, “The vast majority of what people are using AI for is not, Give me a Harry Potter book. It’s, Give me something new.” Meta did conduct preliminary discussions with publishers about potential licensing fees, but they received numbers that, according to court documents, to the company’s mind, were “wildly off.” In the transcript of a taped deposition that has been made public, the defense describes potential negotiations over licensing material as “a bit of a song and dance” that “takes a bunch of their time; it takes our time,” and says that because of book publishing rights structures, “absent fair use, Meta would have to initiate individualized negotiations with millions of authors,” which would entail “identifying individual books and their authors; determining how to contact them; ascertaining whether they own rights clear of encumbrances,” etc. (While Metadescribes its AI platform as “open source,”the company requires that developers who use Llama enter into a community license agreement, the terms of which range from the requirement that users“prominently” display the phrase “Built with Llama” on accompanying websitesto including “Llama” at the beginning of a new AI model name.) The company claims “this process would be onerous for even a few authors; it is practically impossible for hundreds of thousands or millions.” But the data required to build the models was enormous and, according to in-house company correspondence, couldn’t be achieved without using books, which kicked off internal debate and discussion that lasted years. In October 2022, a senior researcher,Melanie Kambadur,wrote in a message to teammates, “I don’t think we should use pirated material. I really need to draw a line there.” An internal slide deck outlines concerns about using LibGen, such as policy risks, including US legislators concern “about AI developers using pirated websites for training,” and that “if there is media coverage suggesting we have used a dataset we know to be pirated, such as LibGen, this may undermine our negotiating position with regulators on these issues.” The same deck noted, “In no case would we disclose publicly that we had trained on libgen, however there is practical risk external parties could deduce our use of this dataset.” Researchers, meanwhile, seemed to be adopting a policy of don’t-ask-don’t-tell. In a redacted exhibit from the plaintiffs that contains internal messages among Meta generative AI researchers concerning the use of LibGen, sent in November 2022, Kambadur asks, “Did someone in legal confirm that? Or are we just trying to not ask too many qs?” To whichGuillaume Lampleresponds, “I didn’t ask questions :D but this is what OpenAI does with GPT3, what Google does with PALM, and what Deepmind does with Chinchilla so we will do it to[o].” (When reached for comment, a spokesperson from OpenAI said that the models powering ChatGPT and its current API were not developed using LibGen: “These datasets, created by former employees who are no longer with OpenAI, were last used in 2021.” A representative for Google, which also owns Deepmind, did not respond to a request for comment.) “Not sure we can use meta’s IPs to load through torrents pirate content,” an engineer wrote in a 2023 message. “Torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right [laugh/cry emoji].” The same person later shared a webpage with his colleagues: “What is the probability of getting arrested for using torrents in the USA?” Other communications show that researchers worked to remove the copyright pages from the books they had downloaded. (Meta’s lawyers argue that this was merely to make the data more friendly to the training model by eliminating boilerplate text.) In a 2024 email chain with the subject line “FW: [A/C Priv] LibGen Approval for OneLLM,” a Meta employee states that she wants to “flag an issue that’s going to be significantly gnarly.” A motion filed by the plaintiffs in February describes a case of collective amnesia: In a deposition, Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, “claimed to have no knowledge of LibGen or any involvement in its use,” though internal documents describe needing “zuck/cox/ahmad” approval to move forward with using Books3 data for training, and the decision to use LibGen as occurring “[a]fter a prior escalation to MZ.” Another witness who claimed not to know the specifics or legal concerns regarding LibGen had received a memo describing the dataset as one “we know to be pirated.” Meta’s attorneys argue that under precedent, “it does not matter whether Meta downloaded datasets containing ‘pirated’ books from a third-party who lacked authorization to distribute them, or borrowed used books from the library and scanned them by hand to achieve the same result.” But their defense also hinges on the argument that the individual books themselves are, essentially, worthless—one expert witness for Meta describes that the influence of a single book in LLM pretraining “adjusted its performance by less than 0.06% on industry standard benchmarks, a meaningless change no different from noise.” Furthermore, Meta says, that while the company “has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in LLM development,” they see no market in paying authors to license their books because “for there to be a market, there must be something of value to exchange, but none of Plaintiffs works has economic value, individually, as training data.” (An argument essential to fair use, but that also sounds like a scaled up version of a scenario in which the New York Philharmonic board argues against paying individual members of the orchestra because the organization spent a lot of money on the upkeep of David Geffen Hall, and also, a solo bassoon cannot play every part in “The Rite of Spring.”) “Would it kill these companies to shell out the measly price of 33 books?”Margaret Atwoodwrote in a 2023 piece forThe Atlantic. “They intend to make a lot of money off the entities they have reared and fattened on my words, so they could at least buy me a coffee.” (For the answer to this question, she need look no further than an email by a director of engineering at Meta,Sergey Edunov,in which he explains that “if we license one single book, we won’t be able to lean into fair use strategy.”) Lemley addresses the idea of compulsory licensing for works that AI has trained on. “I’ll take a specific example. Stability AI trained on 2 billion images. The company itself is probably worth, I don’t know, maybe now a billion dollars, but say it was 2 billion. Even if you wanted to say half of the value of the company should be attributed to [the work it used for training], we should give the money to the people you trained on. Everybody gets 50 cents. I think what authors have in mind when they see this is not, I’ll get paid 50 cents.” Meta argues that the end justifies the means. That “Oracle, ScaleAI, and Lockheed Martin are all using Llama to develop national security programs and to supplement existing data analysis and code generation functions,” that Yale’s medical school is building an open-source LLM designed to improve clinical decision-making, that the nonprofit Jacaranda Health is using it “to provide personalized health support in Swahili to Kenyan mothers.” “Nevertheless,” the opposition statement coyly concedes, “Meta acknowledges that it is a commercial enterprise, that Llama is used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and that Meta hopes one day to recoup its significant investment in this important new technology.” In the years since AI companies began unveiling their generative AI tools, the general consensus among authors has swelled. In a survey that the Authors Guild sent to its members in November 2023, 96% of the 2,431 respondents said that writers’ consent should be required to train AI, and that writers should be paid for their work. “The obvious threat,” saysMary Rasenberger,CEO of the Authors Guild, is that “this unlicensed use is being used to create these machines that authors rightfully fear could replace them, or at least will replace some of their work.” AI-generated genre books, she points out, have already flooded Amazon. The other concern is that “authors can’t enforce things like, you can’t allow outputs that include my work.” Some AI companies say that they’re putting filters on their tools that prevent the large language model from duplicating work verbatim—it’s one of the arguments at the heart of Meta’s fair use case. “But you can copy style, you can get excerpts from authors’ works, you can do sequels or mashups,” argues Rasenberger. On X last month,Sam Altmanannouncedone of OpenAI’s recent ventures: His team had trained a new model that was “good at creative writing” and “got the vibe of metafiction so right.” In response to Altman’s prompt, “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief,” the algorithm output 1,100 words of purple prose (“she lost him on a Thursday—that liminal day that tastes of almost-Friday”) told by an LLM. In one line, the narrator describes AI as “a democracy of ghosts”—the story’s best phrase. An avid reader might recognize it from Nabokov’s grief-ridden and oh-so-human 1957 novel,Pnin. Reading through the emails by Meta employees that reduce literature to mineable assets and seeing title after favorite title rise from LibGen’s depths brings to mind a different Nabokov line altogether, this one from the perspective ofLolita’sHumbert Humbert recalling a drive with Dolores Haze. “It was quite special, that feeling: an oppressive, hideous constraint as if I were sitting with the small ghost of somebody I had just killed.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle WhenThe SopranosTook Off, So DidJames Gandolfini Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Testifies That He’s So Over Facebook Friends",
    "article_text": "Meta has longdescribedits products as enabling people “to connect and share with friends and family.” It’s one of the few things about the ever-evolving social networking giant that has remainedunchangedover the years. Now,Mark Zuckerbergis trying to walk that all back. During his testimony Monday in a high stakesantitrust casebrought by the Federal Trade Commission, Zuckerberg argued that the Facebook friend, once the currency of the company’s global user base, is no longer Meta’s bread and butter. Instead,accordingto Politico, he said that Meta has morphed into “more of a broad discovery-entertainment space.” Zuckerberg testified that just 20% of the content people consume on Facebook and 10% of content they see on Instagram is from their friends, Reutersreported. “The vast majority of the experience is more around exploring your interests, entertainment, things like that,” heexplained. “That’s kind of just been the trend the whole history of the company.” Zuckerberg’s suggestion that the era of the Facebook friend is over—or at least, that it’s quickly coming to an end—was no accident. The FTC’s case relies on the idea that Meta monopolized the “personal social networking” market and that it allegedly bought both Instagram and WhatsApp to choke off two competitors in that market, a claim that Zuckerbergdeniedon Monday. The FTC wants the court to force Meta to divest from both apps. But the “personal” part of the FTC’s argument is crucial. One reason the FTC can argue Meta has an illegal monopoly in the market is because it’s not considering TikTok and YouTube to be competitors. Those platforms, the government argues, don’t connect users to people they know the way Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp do. On Monday, the FTC’s lawyer insisted that this is the company’s “core value proposition.” Indeed, as recently as 2021, Facebookinsistedthat “the majority (57%) of posts that people see is from their family and friends,\" by way of dismissing claims that polarizing political content dominated people's feeds. But during his testimony, Zuckerberg repeatedly rebuffed the FTC's characterization. In one 2022 email presented during the trial, the Facebook founder evensuggestednuking users’ entire friend networks and starting over, Insider reported. The truth is, over the last few years, Metahasmore or less given up on real world connections as the central connective tissue between its billions of users. It’s just rarely been so blunt about it. In 2022, when the companybeganinfusing users’ Instagram feeds with videos from accounts they don’t follow, the backlash, including from celebrity power users likeKylie Jenner, was fierce, prompting the platform to temporarily roll back some changes. But Meta has continued to move in that direction, prioritizing content “discovery” over real-world connections as it races to catch up to TikTok. Users' feeds today now brim with some combination of creator content, AI slop, and ads, ads, and more ads. One can quibble with whether that's good for users. But from a legal standpoint, it's undoubtedly good for Meta. By distancing itself from the very premise that once defined his company, Zuckerberg is undermining a central pillar of the FTC’s case. Facebook may have been in the business of connecting friends, but Meta is over it.

    "title": "Report: Rodents Found on Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa’s Property",
    "article_text": "Moreunfortunate informationregarding the deaths of two-time Oscar winnerGene Hackmanand his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, has been made available to the public. According to a report obtained byCNN, multiple dead rodents and rodent nests were found scattered throughouttheir $3.8 million Santa Fe estate, where both were found dead on February 26. The report was filed by the New Mexico Department of Public Health after a homesite environmental assessment of the multimillion-dollar property was conducted on March 5, a week after Hackman’s and Arakawa’s bodies were discovered. Records show that rodent feces were found in three detached garages on the property, as well as in two casitas and three sheds. Per CNN, a live rodent, a dead rodent, and a rodent nest were also found in the three garages on the property. According to the report, Hackman and Arakawa’s primary residence was clean and showed no evidence of rodent activity. Rodents reportedly had access to eight other buildings on the property. Investigators found live traps in the outbuildings during their assessment and also saw rodents in two vehicles on the property. Arakawa, 65, likely died on February 12, with the cause having been hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare infectious disease resulting from a virus primarily spread via rodents. Arakawa was initially believed to have died on February 11, but officials now think that Arakawadied the following day, as she reportedly called the concierge medical service Cloudberry Health early on February 12. She was found on a bathroom floor next to a counter scattered with loose pills, near the couple’s dog Zinna, who was found dead in a crate in the bathroom closet. Hackman, 95, died on February 18,approximately a week after his wife, based on the last activity from his pacemaker. His autopsy reportedly showed signs of serious heart disease, with evidence of previous heart attacks and several surgical procedures; advanced Alzheimer’s disease was also cited as having contributed to his death. He was found in the mudroom, off the kitchen, near his cane. Hackman tested negative for hantavirus. The homesite environmental assessment was conducted to ensure that investigators, first responders, and family members who had visited the Sante Fe Summit home were safe following the hantavirus discovery.Erin Phipps,the New Mexico state public health veterinarian, reported that risk exposure in Hackman and Arakawa’s primary residence was low. Phipps has previously said that diagnoses of hantavirus are somewhat rare, but the condition has been fatal in 41% of cases in New Mexico, per CNN. According to theNew Mexico Department of Health, there were 17 confirmed cases of hantavirus in the state between 2022 and 2024. Hackman wasa prolific actorwho won two Academy Awards, forThe French Connection(1971) andUnforgiven(1992). He married Arakawa in 1991 and retired from acting in 2004. Hackman and Arakawa lived full-time on the Santa Fe, New Mexico, property.

    "article_text": "Forecaster says temperatures are highest so far this year, while doctor warns residents in high-risk groups to reduce outdoor activities Hong Kong experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday, with the city’s forecaster reporting a temperature of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) at its headquarters in Tsim Sha Tsui in the afternoon. The Observatory issued the very hot weather warning at 1.45pm, with temperatures in Sheung Shui soaring to 36.3 degrees. Yeung Kwok-chung, a senior scientific officer with the Observatory, said the last time that Hong Kong had been affected by such severe hazy weather was 15 years ago. “Although there is a chance of an easterly wind on Wednesday, where there is a possibility that the current weather situation will slowly ease. This will depend on the strength of the wind and the conditions allowing for the dispersal of the air,” he told a radio programme. “There is a chance that this low visibility condition will last until the middle to latter parts of this week, which is the Easter holiday.” Yeung said the forecaster had recorded visibility levels of about 5km (3.1 miles) on Monday at its headquarters between 11am and noon, which rose to about 6km during the latter parts of Monday to Tuesday.",

    "title": "Autism rate rises slightly; RFK Jr. claims he’ll “have answers by September”",
    "article_text": "The slight rise is due to better access to tests in underserved communities. The rate of autism in a group of 8-year-olds in the US rose from 2.76 percent (1 in 36) in 2020 to 3.22 percent (1 in 31) in 2022, according toa study out Tuesday in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report's authors—researchers at the CDC and academic institutions across the country—suggest that the slight uptick is likely due to improved access to evaluations in underserved groups, including Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities. The data comes from the CDC-funded Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The national network has been tracking the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 8-year-olds at a handful of sites since 2000, publishing estimates every two years. In 2000, ASD prevalence was 1 in 150, with white children from high-income communities having the highest rates of the developmental disability. In 2020, when the rate hit 1 in 36, it was the first year in which higher ASD rates were seen in underserved communities. That year, researchers also noted that the link between ASD and socioeconomic status evaporated in most of the network. In the new data, prevalence continued to be higher in underserved communities compared with white children. Prevalence among white children was 27.7 per 1,000, which is lower than prevalence among multiracial (31.9), Hispanic (33.0), Black (36.6), American Indian or Alaska Native (37.5), or Asian or Pacific Islander children (38.2). And, overall, prevalence was higher among children from low-income neighborhoods. \"The reversal of these patterns in prevalence by race and ethnicity and SES [socioeconomic status] is consistent with increased access to and provision of identification services among previously underserved groups,\" the researchers conclude. A look forward also shows trends toward more and earlier access to services. While monitoring has focused on 8-year-olds, because children are more likely to have a diagnosis by that age, the researchers also examined autism evaluations and rates among children who were 4 years old in 2022. Researchers found that the younger children, born in 2018, had more evaluations in the same age window as the children who were born in 2014. This year, the ADDM included 16 sites across the country—in many past years, there were 11 sites. It's important to highlight that although the prevalence rates from these sites are often seen as national estimates of ASD prevalence, they are not. These 16 sites are not nationally representative. The populations within ADDM \"do not generate nationally representative ASD prevalence estimates,\" the authors caution. Among the sites, there were large differences. Prevalence ranged from 9.7 per 1,000 children who were 8 years old in Texas (Laredo) to 53.1 in California. These differences are likely due to \"differences in availability of services for early detection and evaluation and diagnostic practices,\" the CDC and network researchers wrote. For instance, California—the site with the highest prevalence among 8-year-olds and also 4-year-olds—has a local initiative called the Get SET Early model. \"As part of the initiative, hundreds of local pediatricians have been trained to screen and refer children for assessment as early as possible, which could result in higher identification of ASD, especially at early ages,\" the authors write. \"In addition, California has regional centers throughout the state that provide evaluations and service coordination for persons with disabilities and their families.\" On the other hand, the low ASD rates at the network's two Texas sites could \"suggest lack of access or barriers to accessing identification services,\" the authors say. The two Texas sites included primarily Hispanic and lower-income communities. The newly revealed higher rates in some of the network's underserved communities could link ASD prevalence to social determinants of health, such as low income and housing and food insecurity, the authors say. Other factors, such as higher rates of preterm birth, which is linked to neurodevelopmental disabilities, as well as lead poisoning and traumatic brain injuries, may also contribute to disparities. The detailed data-heavy report stands in contrast to the position of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine advocate who promotes the false and thoroughly debunked claim that autism is caused by vaccines. Last month, Kennedy hired thediscredited anti-vaccine advocate David Geierto lead a federal study examining whether vaccines cause autism, despite numerous high-quality studies already finding no link between the two. Geier, who has no medical or scientific background, has long worked with his father, Mark Geier, to promote the idea that vaccines cause autism. In 2011, Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license for allegedly mistreating children with autism, and David Geier was fined for practicing medicine without a license. In a media statement Tuesday in response to the new report, Kennedy called autism an \"epidemic\" that is \"running rampant.\" He appeared to reference his planned study with Geier, saying: \"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration has reportedly refused to back a G7 statement condemning Russia’s recent missile strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed firing two Iskander-M missiles the day before, targeting a gathering of Ukrainian and Western command staff, killing at least 60 senior servicemen. The Ukrainian authorities, however, have claimed that the Russian missiles struck a military awards ceremony, leaving 35 civilians dead and 129 others injured. Following the attack, Ukraine and a number of its international backers accused Russia of deliberately targeting civilians and undermining peace talks. According to Bloomberg, the G7, which is being presided over by Canada this year, has drafted a joint statement denouncing the strike on Sumy but has not released it due to a lack of US support. In a draft of the statement seen by the outlet, the group said that the attack was proof that Russia was determined to continue the hostilities. Bloomberg reported that Trump’s team had told the group that it couldn’t sign the statement because it is“working to preserve the space to negotiate peace.” Since taking office in January, Trump has pushed to get both Moscow and Kiev to the negotiating table and has resumed direct contacts with Russia in order to facilitate a peace deal. Throughout the Ukraine conflict, Moscow has maintained that it never targets civilian infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov recently emphasized that Russia only strikes military targets. Russian officials have also stated that Moscow remains open to a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict but have stressed that any settlement must address its root causes. Moscow has demanded that Kiev demilitarize, denazify, give up its NATO ambitions, and adhere to a position of neutrality, and recognize the territorial“realities on the ground.”",

    "article_text": "Poland intends to profit from future aid to Ukraine, including from post-conflict reconstruction, and will not“naively”help Kiev at its own expense while others make money, Prime Minister Donald Tusk has said. Speaking at the European Forum for New Ideas (EFNI) on Tuesday, Tusk stressed that Poland would prioritize its domestic economy in commitments to Kiev. “We will brutally guard our interests and Polish companies,”Tusk declared. “We will help [Ukraine] – Poland is in solidarity, we are a symbol of solidarity – but never again in a naive way,”he said.“It won’t be the case that Poland will express solidarity while others profit, for example, on the reconstruction of Ukraine. We will be in solidarity and we will make money on it.” Tusk cited a potential logistics hub in the south of the country, run by Polish companies as a point from which materials could be exported to Ukraine from the EU. “This is a difficult time for the world, but the best possible time for Poland… In this increasingly ruthless competition of egoists on world markets and on front lines, Poland will not be a naive actor,”Tusk stated, pledging to act“ruthlessly when necessary.” Poland has been among Ukraine’s main supporters since the escalation of the conflict with Russia in 2022, providing more than €5.1 billion ($5.7 billion) in aid, over 70% of which was military, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute. The country has also received a large number of Ukrainian refugees, although public attitudes have reportedly cooled amid the influx of arrivals. Warsaw is also part of the so-called“coalition of the willing,”a group of European countries pushing to maintain military support for Ukraine and proposing to send troops, purportedly in a post-conflict peacekeeping role. Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Poland was ready to become the“largest beneficiary”of Ukraine’s reconstruction. Reconstructing Ukraine will cost some $500 billion over the next decade, according to the World Bank. Some EU members, including Poland, have advocated using frozen Russian sovereign assets to finance rebuilding efforts. Others, however, have warned that doing so without legal grounds could create a dangerous precedent and deter global investors. Moscow has condemned the freezing of its assets and warned that seizure would amount to“theft,”which would be followed by retaliatory measures targeting Western investments in Russia. Moscow has also repeatedly warned that Western aid will not alter the outcome of the conflict, only prolong it.",
