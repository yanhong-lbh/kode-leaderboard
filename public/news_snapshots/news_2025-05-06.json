Former Boise State star running back Ashton Jeanty headlined the Las Vegas Raiders' 2025 NFL Draft class. But the franchise's sixth-round selection caught Tom Brady's eye. Cam Miller, who won two FCS national championships during his standout career atNorth Dakota State, was the 215th overall pick in last month's draft. Brady owns a minority ownership stake in the Raiders.The Athletic chronicledBrady's close relationship with Raiders general manager John Spytek. Brady's friendship with Spytek dates back to the University of Michigan. Spytek also worked in the Buccaneers' front office during Brady's time in Tampa Bay.

Given the build-up of trust between Brady and Spytek, it stands to reason that the former NFL quarterback was on board with taking Miller on the third day of the draft. RANKING 2026 QB DRAFT CLASS: IS ARCH MANNING CLEAR-CUT NO. 1 OF A STACKED BUNCH? Spytek revealed that Brady provided a glowing assessment of Miller, saying, \"He liked the way he threw it, his technique, throwing from the ground up and his motion.\" The Raiders general manager added that Brady was bullish on Miller's \"potential to improve.\" A screen shows North Dakota State quarterback Cam Miller after he was selected by the Las Vegas Raiders with the 215th overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft April 26, 2025, in Green Bay, Wis.(Perry Knotts/Getty Images) Miller ended his four-year run at North Dakota State with a 45-11 record. He will enter aRaiders quarterbackroom that includes Geno Smith and Aidan O'Connell. The Raiders sent a third-round pick in the 2025 draft tothe Seahawksin exchange for Smith. The move to Las Vegas brought Smith's five-year run with the Seahawks to an end. He was the primary starter for three of those seasons and earned Pro Bowl honors twice. Geno Smith of the Seattle Seahawks celebrates a win against the Arizona Cardinals at Lumen Field Nov. 24, 2024, in Seattle.(Steph Chambers/Getty Images) Smith threw for 4,320 yards and 21 touchdowns with 15 interceptions last season and remains the favorite to be the starter when the Raiders open their season, even with the drafting of Miller. The Raiders finished 4-13 last season, which led to the departures of coach Antonio Pierce and general manager Tom Telesco.

    "title": "New Pulitzer Prize winner disparaged Israelis kidnapped by Hamas on Oct 7, questioned their 'hostage' status",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot provides an update on the latest plans for Gaza on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX -The Pulitzer board awarded a prize Monday to a Palestinian poet and author who frequently disparagedIsraeli hostageson social media, referring to them as \"killers\" and denying they were tortured under Hamas captivity. Mosab Abu Toha was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his essays published in the New Yorker which detailed the ongoing war in Gaza. Social media posts of his, uncovered by the journalism watchdog groupHonest Reportingand shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, show a frequent pattern of hostility towards the Israeli hostages, particularly the women. All posts are from 2025, with the most recent April 13. \"How on earth is this girl called a hostage? (And this is the case of most 'hostages'). This is Emily Damari, a 28 UK-Israeli soldier that Hamas detailed on 10/7… So this girl is called a ‘hostage?’ This soldier who was close to the border with a city that she and her country have been occupying is called a ‘hostage?’\" Tohapostedabout Israeli hostage Emily Damari on January 24, 2025. Pulitzer Prize-winning Palestinian poet Mosab Abu Toha appeared to attack Israeli hostage Emily Damari, who lost two fingers after getting shot by Hamas terrorists, on social media.(Mosab Abu Toha/Facebook) TRUMP'S DOJ SAYS UN AGENCY CAN BE SUED FOR OCT. 7 ATTACKS, REVERSING BIDEN-ERA POSITION Damari, 29, was shot in the hand during the barbaric Hamas Oct. 7 terrorist invasion of Israel and subsequently lost two fingers. She was dragged from her home by terrorists and held in captivity in Gaza for 471 days. She said she suffered immense pain for a year and a half from an open-festering wound that resulted from shoddy medical work done by Hamas, who her mother said\"sewed her up like a pin cushion.\" \"The Israeli ‘hostage’ Agam Berger, who was released days ago participates in her sister’s graduation from an Israeli Air Force officers’ course. These are the ones the world wants to share sympathy for, killers who join the army and have family in the army! These are the ones whom CNN, BBC and the likes humanize in articles and TV programs and news bulletins,\" Tohapostedon Feb. 3, 2025. Berger, 28, is an Israeli violinist and former Gaza border scout at base Nahal Oz who was held captive in Gaza for 482 days. The young womandetailedhow her captors tried to force her to convert her to Islam and how she and a fellow scout, Liri Albag, were kept in a \"small room with no natural light.\" Mosab Abu Toha Israeli hostage Agam Berger and other hostages \"killers\" in a Facebook post.(Mosab Abu Toha/Facebook) PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE AFTER 471 DAYS OF HAMAS CAPTIVITY — PLEASE SAVE THE REMAINING HOSTAGES Toha has also cast doubt on the forensic evidence that showed that the Bibas children, 9-month-old Kfir and Ariel, 4, were killed by their captors. \"Shame on BBC, propaganda machine. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said ‘forensic findings’, which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with ‘bare hands.’ If you haven’t seen any evidence, why did you publish this. Well, that’s what you are, filthy people,\" TohapostedFebruary 21, 2025. An Israeli forensic analysis found thatthe two small boyswere killed by the murderers' \"bare hands.\" Heart-wrenching footage from Oct. 7 showed Shiri Bibas and her two boys being kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. The bodies of the two boys were returned in February, Hamas had initially returned a different body and claimed that it was Shiri Bibas before surrendering her remains after international outcry. The poet has also cast doubt onIsraeli hostages'claims that they were tortured, despite multiple testimonies from freed captives alleging horrific treatment. \"When the Israeli hostages were released, did you see any torture signs? Even the soldiers among them?\" Tohapostedon X on February 1, 2025, over a video of a freed Palestinian prisoner who appeared to have severe blisters on both of his legs, whom Toha alleged was \"kidnapped\" after Oct. 7. Toha appeared to imply the Israeli hostages weren't tortured. Freed hostageEli Sharabbi revealedthat Hamas terrorists kept him in chains so tight they ripped his skin, beat him and broke his ribs and practically starved him. He said when he was finally released he said he weighed just \"44 kilos\" (97 pounds) and had lost half his body weight, in a speech delivered to the UN. An Israeli health ministry report found that teenage captives were forced toperform sexual actson each other. President Trump said that Sharabbi and other freed hostages looked like \"Holocaust survivors\" during a press scrum on Air Force One Feb. 9. \"They were in horrible condition—emaciated. It looked like something from many years ago,\" Trump said. Toha also seemed to mouth Hamas propaganda, accusing Israel of having bombed Al-Ahli Hospital in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 17, 2023. In the initial hours after the blast, mainstream media outlets parrotedclaims made by the Hamas-controlledGaza Health Ministry that Israel bombed the hospital, killing as many as 500 people. But international authorities quickly concluded that it was the hospital’s parking lot that was hit by a Palestinian terrorist group’s missile that misfired, resulting in a death toll a fraction of what Hamas had first alleged. \"Remember when Israel denied its responsibility for the bombing of the Ahli/Baptist Hospital in 10/2023? Today Israel bombed a building and a power plant minutes after it threatened to bomb. Another piece of breaking news: Israel warned that it would carry out another air strike,\" Tohapostedon April 13, 2025. GAZA HOSPITAL COVERAGE PROVES MEDIA NEEDS TO BE SKEPTICAL OF SOURCES, EXPERT SAYS: ‘ALL THE FACTS WERE WRONG’ Mosab Abu Toha appeared to mimic disproven Hamas claims that Israel bombed the Al-Ahli hospital.(Mosab Abu Toha/X) \"The Pulitzer Prize is the top award in journalism and should not be blemished by bestowing it to a man who repeatedly twisted facts, Abu Toha justifies abducting civilians from their homes, and spreads fake news. That doesn’t sound prize-worthy to me,\" Honest Reporting Executive Director Gil Hoffman toldFox News Digital. \"To state the obvious these posts are an absolute disgrace and this man should be condemned for his comments, not given a Pulitzer Prize. Reading these posts should make any decent person absolutely sick to their stomach,\" Israeli Consul General in New York Ambassador Ofir Akunis told Fox News Digital. The Pulitzer committee wrote that they awarded Toha the coveted prize for his \"essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combine deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.\" Toha hadwrittenthat he was detained by Israeli forces while trying to flee Gaza with his family in 2023. He claimed he was beaten and interrogated by IDF troops as he attempted to make his way to Egypt.

    "article_text": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks with 'The Ingraham Angle' about relations with China and trade negotiations. Top officials with the Trump administration are expected to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation this week in Switzerland, marking the first major talks between the two countries since PresidentDonald Trumpignited a trade war based on tariffs on imports. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and trade representative Jamieson Greer are expected to represent the U.S. as they meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva. \"Economic security is national security, and President Donald J. Trump is leading the way both at home and abroad for a stronger, more prosperous America,\" Bessent said. \"I look forward to productive talks as we work towards rebalancing the international economic system towards better serving the interests of the United States.\" TRUMP SAYS HE WILL NOT DROP TARIFFS TO GET CHINA TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent listens during a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government hearing in Washington, DC, Tuesday.(Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The meeting is scheduled to take place on Thursday, and during his time in Switzerland, Bessent will meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. According to a news release, Bessent will follow up with his recent meeting with Keller-Sutter on the sidelines of the recent World Bank Group (WBG) International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Meetings. Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Ministry ofForeign Affairs of China, confirmed the meeting in a post on X on Tuesday. CHINA OPEN TO TALKS WITH TRUMP ADMIN ON LOWERING TARIFFS, MINISTRY SAYS \"At the invitation of the government of Switzerland, from May 9 to 12, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council He Lifeng will visit Switzerland. He will hold talks with Swiss leaders and relevant parties,\" Jian said in the social media post. \"During his visit to Switzerland, Vice Premier He, as the Chinese lead person for China-US economic and trade affairs, will have a meeting with the US lead person Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"From May 12 to 16, Vice Premier He will be in France to co-chair with the French side the 10th China-France High Level Economic and Financial Dialogue,\" he added. The meeting comes as the U.S. market worries over the effects of Trump’s tariffs on prices and supply continue to increase. TRUMP WAGERS US ECONOMY IN HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBLE AT 100-DAY MARK President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping Trump announced sweeping global tariffs last month. He slapped a 145% tariff on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Beijing put a 125% tariff on U.S. imports. However, the country recently waived the tariff on a host of American-made products. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There were already exemptions for some pharmaceuticals, microchips and aircraft engines, but China added an exemption for ethane imports,according to Reuters. Beijing’s change in messaging regarding the tariffs comes in stark contrast to its April 23 comments during a U.N. Security Council Arria-formula meeting on \"The Impact of Unilateralism and Bullying Practices on International Relations.\" At that meeting, China accused the U.S. of using tariffsto bully the rest of the world.

    "title": "California AG takes stance on Menendez brothers prosecutor staying on case amid resentencing battle",
    "article_text": "Mark Geragos, the Menendez brothers' attorney, argued that it was the prosecution’s duty—not the defense’s—to object to graphic photos of the crime scene that were previously shown. (Fox News Digital) California Attorney General Rob Bonta is pushing back against Erik and Lyle Menendez's defense team's request to remove the Los Angeles District Attorney's office from their resentencing case. The brothers' attorneys have argued that the DA's office has shown bias against them and violated Marsy's Law against their family. In a 22-page opposition filed this week, the AG's office noted that the Menendez defense attorneys have failed to present evidence that meets the \"stringent standards\" for an office-wide recusal of the DA, stating that each claim fell short of any merit. \"First, the transfer of two members of his Office who previously supported resentencing is not sufficient to establish a disabling, office-wide conflict of interest. Second, even if Ms. Cady's prior representation of Kitty Menendez's brother could present a potential conflict, the District Attorney's Office has walled her off from this matter,\" the filing read. \"As such, defendants have failed to identify a disqualifying conflict that demonstrates a reasonable possibility that the assigned prosecutors may not exercise discretionary functions in an evenhanded manner, nor have they established that any alleged conflict is so grave as to render it more likely than not they will not receive unfair treatment if the case continues to be handled by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office,\" - California Attorney General's Office Last week, the DA's office filed it's own opposition, calling the move a \"drastic and desperate step.\" LA DA REJECTS MENENDEZ BROTHERS' RECUSAL PUSH IN RESENTENCING, CALLS IT A 'DRASTIC AND DESPERATE STEP' California Attorney General is urging the judge hearing Lyle and Erik Menendez case to keep the LA County District Attorney's office on the case. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman filed the response on Friday, arguing that theMenendez brothersare trying to force a recusal simply because they're unhappy with the district attorney's overall stance on resentencing. \"In the opposition, the District Attorney’s Office has argued that in a ‘drastic and desperate step,’ the defense has decided to ‘sidestep the central issue of resentencing’ and present an argument ‘devoid of merit’ to recuse the entire District Attorney’s Office,\" Hochman said. \"The entire defense argument over recusal boils down to the defense not being happy with the current District Attorney’s position on resentencing. While this desperate argument may work in a press interview, it fails in a court of law based on an adversarial system of justice.\" Attorney Mark Geragos, who represents the Menendez brothers, wrote in an April 25 motion that Hochman should recuse himself because of a \"conflict of interest.\" In that filing, Geragos wrote that Hochman \"has a very different view\" on resentencing. \"In the prosecution's view, there was no sexual abuse at all. Resentencing is not appropriate because although defendants have admitted the shooting for decades, they continue to maintain (as they have since trial) that they had been sexually abused since they were children,\" Geragos wrote. \"Under the District Attorney's view, there can be no rehabilitation unless defendants not only admit the shooting, but disclaim the corroborated history of sexual abuse which caused the first juries to reach verdicts evenly split between murder and manslaughter.\" IF MENENDEZ BROTHERS ADMIT TO 'LIES,' LOS ANGELES DA MAY RECONSIDER RESENTENCING MOTION TO FREE THEM: REPORT This combination of two booking photos provided by the California Department of Corrections shows Erik Menendez, left, and Lyle Menendez.(California Dept. of Corrections via AP, File) \"Because the record shows a conflict that renders it unlikely Erik and Lyle can receive a fair resentencing hearing, recusal is proper,\" Geragos added. The Menendez brothers' motion for Hochman's recusal focuses onan attorneythat Hochman recently hired. After former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon announced he was considering a resentencing request from the Menendez brothers, 20 family members met with deputy district attorneys Nancy Theberge and Brock Lunsford and discussed their support for resentencing. One family member, however, objected to the resentencing and filed an amicus brief in opposition through his attorney, Kathleen Cady. When Hochman won his election against Gascon, Geragos claimed that Theberge and Lunsford were intentionally reassigned because they were viewed as sympathetic to the Menendez brothers. Geragos also claimed that Hochman hired Cady, the attorney who represented the only Menendez family member against resentencing, to lead the district attorney's Office of Victims' Services. Hochman reportedly has a list of 20 lies the Menendez brothers have told over the last 30 years since their parents' murders and previouslytold ABC Newsthat he would consider resentencing if both brothers \"sincerely and unequivocally admit, for the first time in over 30 years, the full range of their criminal activity and all the lies that they have told about it.\" TIMELINE OF THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS' MURDER CASE Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.(AP Photo/Nick Ut) The Menendez brothers and their supporters have been pushing for a resentencing hearing, saying the brothers were unfairly convicted to life in prison in 1996 for murdering their two parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in theirBeverly Hills home in 1989. Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors couldn't agree on their fate.

    "article_text": "GOP Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte is telling Colorado gun manufacturers that his state is open for business after their Democrat governor, Jared Polis, signed one of the country's strictest gun control bills into law. (Office of Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte) Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed legislation that would largely ban Styrofoam containers, dubbing it \"textbook government overreach.\" House Bill 477 would phase out the use of the containers by 2030, but starting in 2028 for restaurants and the hospitality industry. Introduced by Democrat state Rep. Marilyn Marler, the legislation garnered some bipartisan support in the Republican-majority legislature. WATCH: RED STATE GOV URGES FIREARMS MAKERS TO DITCH COLORADO AMID ITS ANTI-GUN PUSH A Styrofoam cup(Julie Schwietert Collazo/File) \"Our state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise, and let high taxes, high spending, and hyper-regulation remain a feature of deep blue, progressive states,\" the Republican wrote in his veto letter, citing how various bluestates like Californiaand Washington have imposed similar regulations. \"Frankly, I was surprised to receive House Bill 477 which dictates to restaurants, food establishments, bakeries, resorts, hotels, and others what they can and can't use to package food and drinks,\" he continued.

Greg Gianforte(William Campbell/Getty Images/File) The billstated that polystyrene foam \"is a material that causes environmental harm and poses a threat to fish and wildlife; and whereas, styrofoam takes up space in landfills and contributes to the need for costly expansions borne by taxpayers; and whereas, styrofoam threatens the right of each Montanan to a clean and healthful environment.\" The proposal included a few exceptions but would require an application for using the foam as it relates to \"transportation; construction; health; or safety.\" \"Finally, if policymakers are trying to get rid of Styrofoam, which I'm not, why only target restaurants and food-service establishments? Why not packaging supplies?

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Friedrich Merz was electedchancellor of Germanyafter facing a historic loss in the Bundestag. In the second round, 325 lawmakers voted for Merz, bringing him past the 316-vote threshold. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has already demanded that Merz step down and call for new elections following his loss in the first round. Merz’s initial loss marked a historic moment, as it was the first of its kind in post-war Germany. The result came as a major upset, as Merz waswidely expected to win, thanks to a coalition deal involving his party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU); its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU); and the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

However, on Tuesday, Merz received 310 votes—falling short by six—as at least 18 Members of the German Parliament in the coalition did not back him,according to Reuters. Friedrich Merz is expected to become Germany’s next leader after the center-right Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democrats reached a deal to form a new German government.(Michael Kappeler/dpa via AP) GERMANY'S NEW LEADER LOOKS TO DISTANCE EUROPE FROM TRUMP To secure the position of chancellor, Merz would have needed to win 316 out of 630 in the Bundestag. The coalition of CSU/CDU and SPD has 328 seats, more than enough to secure a majority victory. However, Merz received 310 votes, while 307 members voted against him and nine others abstained.

The Bundestag now has 14 days to elect the next chancellor, and Merz still has a chance of winning the position. Germany’s socialist Left Party, however, is pushing to hold another round of chancellor elections as soon as Wednesday, according toGermany-based news outlet DW. Merz had already lined up victory trips toFrance and Polandon Wednesday, Reuters reported, though it is unclear whether he will proceed with the visits as planned following the defeat.

The shouting critics, however, did not appear to bother Ben-Gvir, who was a right-wing activist in his youth. Ben-Gvir spoke with Fox News Digital about his U.S. visit, highlighting his trips to Mar-a-Lago, Yale and New York. He noted that he felt a shift in Israel-U.S. relations since PresidentDonald Trump's return to the White House. \"Under Biden’s administration, I was considered persona non grata.

Prior to his meeting with Mast, Ben-Gvir had the chance to visit his home state where he saw something that he wanted to take back with him to Israel: gun culture. Ben-Gvir has long been an advocate for wider distribution of firearms in Israel, and while he was visiting the U.S., he took time to see how America handles guns.

One of the important lessons is their policy on weapons,\" Ben-Gvir told Fox News Digital. \"I’m not sure I would distribute arms to the same extent, but I definitely believe in expanding access because citizens have the right to defend themselves.\" Gun culture in Israel has changed since the Oct. 7 massacre. Before the attacks, Israel was strict about who was eligible to obtain a firearm.

According to the Times of Israel, these reforms included changes to military service requirements for those seeking a license. Additionally, he expanded eligibility requirements to include national service members who have no criminal record, history of violence or mental health issues. \"We need to allow as many citizens as possible to be armed.

    "title": "Canadian PM Carney to meet Trump at White House after election influenced by annexation threats",
    "article_text": "Canada's Mark Carney reacted to winning election as prime minister Monday. (Reuters) OTTAWA – While PresidentDonald Trumpwas widely viewed as the major factor in securing a fourth consecutive term in office for the Liberals in last Monday’s Canadian general election, the Conservative leader played a role in his party’s defeat at the polls, according to Canadian political analysts. \"Trump set the stage\" for Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney \"as a somber leader for the Liberals, who made people feel assured that things could be handled when there was a sense of fear of people at the beginning of the campaign worried about\" the president’s threats of annexing Canada as the 51st state, University of Manitoba political studies professor Christopher Adams told Fox News Digital. \"It’s highly unusual for American presidents to wade into Canadian politics, especially during elections,\" said Adams. He explained the last time that happened was during the 1963 Canadian general election campaign, when the press reported on President John F. Kennedy speaking favorably about Canadian Liberal Leader Lester Pearson, whose party toppled Prime Minister John Diefenbaker’s Progressive Conservatives to win the election and form a minority government. CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER MARK CARNEY SAYS 'OLD RELATIONSHIP' WITH US 'IS OVER' AMID TENSION OVER TRUMP TARIFFS Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney smiles on stage at his campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the Canadian election in Ottawa, Ontario, on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) Trump directly inserted himself into Canada’s election day, April 28, as a quasi-candidate when heposted on social mediathat the \"Great people of Canada\" should \"elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World…if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America.\" Whether in jest or not, the president’s pitch for annexation was a form of \"foreign interference,\" said Adams. OnNBC’s \"Meet the Press\"on Sunday, Trump said it was \"highly unlikely\" that the U.S. would use military force against Canada to acquire it as the 51st state. The president will meet the Canadian prime minister for the first time at the White House on Tuesday. After a post-election call with Carney last week, Trump said the Canadian leader \"couldn’t have been nicer\" and is \"a very nice gentleman.\" When asked about his upcoming meeting with the president, the prime minister told reporters at his first post-election news conference on Friday that Trump \"respects – as others who are good negotiators, and he’s one of the best negotiators – strength. That’s why we're building Canada strong.\" Before the Canadian election was called on March 23, the president toldFox News’ \"The Ingraham Angle\" host Laura Ingrahamthat he would \"rather deal with a Liberal than a Conservative,\" and said that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is \"stupidly no friend of mine.\" Trump earlier toldThe Spectatorthat the Conservative leader’s \"biggest problem is he’s not a MAGA guy.\" \"He’s not a Trump guy at all,\" said the president. TRUMP’S THREATS AGAINST CANADA BOOST TRUDEAU'S LIBERAL PARTY IN THE POLLS AS NEW TARIFFS SET TO BEGIN Conservative Party of Canada's leader Pierre Poilievre looks on at his election night headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on April 29, 2025.(REUTERS/Amber Bracken) Carney’s Liberals won 169 out of 343 seats in the House of Commons to form a minority government in Canada’s 45th general election with 44% of the popular vote. The Conservatives placed second, with 41% of the popular vote, and 144 House seats. More than 19.5 million Canadians cast their ballots in the election. Poilievre lost his position as official opposition leader after being defeated in his Ottawa-area riding by Liberal Bruce Fanjoy. Carney, in his first run at seeking public elected office, handily won his Ottawa seat. Poilievre will run in a yet-to-be-called byelection in an Alberta district in which the Conservative MP Damien Kurek, who was re-elected, will step aside. At the beginning of the year, polls showed Poilievre was poised to become prime minister and lead his Conservatives to a majority government. He just did not pivot fast enough to a new reality that unfolded within Canada since then, according to Adams, who is writing a book about Canada’s public opinion-research industry. Justin Trudeau, whose deep unpopularity as Liberal leader and prime minister, stepped down in March and was replaced by Carney, who scrapped an equally unpopular consumer carbon tax – two targets Poilievre continued to focus on. \"And Poilievre kept saying the country is broken, which was the last thing Canadians wanted to hear when Trump was making our country broken,\" said Adams, who added that the Conservative leader never polled high in likeability. \"Canadians didn’t realize how much they disliked him until Trudeau was gone.\" Then-President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a news conference at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on Dec. 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Poilievre will meet in Ottawa on Tuesday with members of the Conservative caucus who won their ridings in last week’s election. They could decide whether he stays or goes as leader through the Reform Act – a 10-year-old law introduced in Parliament by re-elected Conservative member of Parliament (MP) Michael Chong that empowers parliamentarians to hold leadership reviews following elections. Conservative MPs will also need to choose an interim official opposition leader. Adams believes Poilievre’s job as party leader is safe given the Conservatives’ overall electoral performance that led to them winning 16 more Commons seats in the most populous Canadian province of Ontario – at the expense of both the Liberals and fellow progressive New Democrats – and their forming the largest official opposition in Canadian history. TRUMP THREATS BOOSTED CANADA’S CARNEY, HURT CONSERVATIVES AS COUNTRY VOTES FOR NEW LEADER Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus in the University of Toronto’s Department of Political Science, told Fox News Digital that the race between the Liberals and Conservatives narrowed when Trump pulled back his attacks against Canada in the latter half of the campaign. The focus shifted to \"Conservative issues – cost of living, affordability, housing, time for a change – while Carney was making speeches about Trump – because he knew that was his trump card, no pun intended – and it was wearing off,\" said Wiseman. Elections Canada signage is seen as voters arrive at a polling station on Election Day in Halifax, Canada, on Monday, April 28, 2025.(AP) May will be a busy month for Carney. Next week, he will unveil his Cabinet and, on May 27, welcomeKing Charles IIIto read the Speech from the Throne to open the next session of Parliament as Canada’s head of state – the first time the British monarch has come to Ottawa to perform that ceremonial role since Queen Elizabeth II in 1977, 20 years after she did so during her first visit to Canada. Wiseman said the royal visit is intended to showcase national unity in response to Trump’s threats against Canadian sovereignty. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, the man who represented the crown as governor general in Canada from 1979 to 1984 said that he \"can’t believe that as many people are taking seriously this whole business of Trump talking about the annexation of Canada as an existential threat,\" Edward Schreyer, a former premier of his home province of Manitoba, told Fox News Digital. \"I think the whole thing is a joke – and was at the beginning, is now and ever shall be an absurdity.\" Christopher Guly is an Ottawa-based journalist and longtime member of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery.

Late Tuesday, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a former Newark mayor, wrote a lengthy letter to Duffy saying that given \"the serious consequences for our nation’s aviation system, it is critical that the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) take all necessary steps to identify and address the underlying causes of the ongoing flight disruptions.\" \"I appreciate that the USDOT has already responded to this ongoing situation by identifying the importance of technology upgrades across the entire air traffic control system, and I am committed to supporting these efforts in Congress,\" Booker wrote. \"However, I ask that you also immediately direct additional staff and resources in order to restore regular operations at EWR in the days ahead. This is of particular importance as the busy summer travel season approaches, which will put further pressure on EWR and the region’s airspace. Specifically, I request that you take additional steps to address the staffing shortages at the Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility, which have contributed significantly to the repeated suspension and interruption of flight operations at EWR.\" Sen.Jerry Moran, R-Kan., another committee member, told Fox News Digital maintaining America’s \"busiest and most advanced airspace in the world\" requires a skilled workforce and dependable technology. \"The radar outages at Newark put air traffic controllers in an impossible situation, endangered incoming flights and demonstrated the urgent need for modernization of our systems,\" said Moran, who along with senators John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., introduced the Air Traffic Control Workforce Development Act to bolster that workforce sector. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital later Tuesday that, as a \"member of the Senate Transportation Committee, this is deeply concerning to me. The Biden administration spent years funding anything other than important upgrades and updates to outdated FAA technology. \"I think many of us will be asking questions about how this occurred and how we can work with Secretary Duffy and Chairman Cruz to fix it. The flying public deserves to know that they are safe and secure when flying in American airspace.\" On the Democratic side, Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., said: \"The ongoing situation at Newark Airport is yet another example of the tremendous strain our aviation system is under — something I’ve been raising the alarm on for years —and it further underscores the urgent need to invest in updated air traffic control systems and equipment, not cut FAA’s funding and workforce.

Martin has served as interim U.S. attorney since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration but is facing a May 20 deadline to be confirmed. Martin met with Senate lawmakers Monday, and Tillis told reporters Tuesday he wouldn't support the nomination.

    "title": "White House calls Yemen ceasefire a 'WIN' – experts warn Houthis may not hold the line",
    "article_text": "Ret. Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard discusses the U.S. strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis on ‘Fox Report.’ PresidentDonald Trump’ssudden halt to U.S. airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants is drawing praise as a potential breakthrough – and doubts over whether it will last. Trump on Tuesday at the Oval Office marked the formal end of \"Operation Rough Rider,\" a 50-day bombing campaign that targeted more than 1,000 sites across Yemen. \"The Houthis have announced that they don’t want to fight anymore,\" Trump said during remarks at the White House. \"They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that’s what the purpose of what we were doing. So… we will stop the bombings.\" Bard Al-busaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, who has been involved in peace negotiations, confirmed that talks had led to a ceasefire agreement. \"In the future,neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.\" US STRIKES ON YEMEN CONTINUE AFTER HOUTHI MISSILE HITS BY ISRAELI AIRPORT; TERROR GROUP VOWS ‘AERIAL BLOCKADE’ \"The Houthis have announced that they don’t want to fight anymore,\" Trump said.(AP Photo) While Trump portrayed the ceasefire as a straightforward military win, experts say the path to this moment was built on deliberate diplomatic escalation – namely, a dual-pronged threat against both the Houthis andtheir Iranian backers. \"This was about linking Houthi aggression directly to Iran,\" said Can Kasapoglu, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"The Trump administration signaled clearly: any further attacks would bring consequences for Tehran as well. That was the actual key to success.\" The campaign's origin in March followed a surge in Houthi attacks on international shipping and the dramatic escalation last weekend, when a missile from Houthi-controlled territory landed near Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. That prompted a retaliatory Israeli airstrike on Yemen’s main airport in Sana’a, which military officials say crippled Houthi air capabilities. Lt. Col. Eric Navarro, director of the Red Sea security initiative at the Middle East Forum, called the ceasefire \"a product of overwhelming pressure,\" pointing to precision U.S. strikes on Houthi command-and-control infrastructure and weapons depots, paired with Israeli air assaults. \"They saw the writing on the wall,\" Navarro said. \"I would argue that this is the kind of pressure that needs to be applied over time – not just to the Houthis, but also to the Iranian regime.\" From a military standpoint, Trump’s campaign leveraged significant assets, including bombers flying from Diego Garcia and two U.S. aircraft carriers operating in the region. That show of force, combined with clear diplomatic signaling, appears to have catalyzed the ceasefire – at least for now. TRUMP CLAIMS HOUTHIS ‘DON’T WANT TO FIGHT' AND SAYS US WILL STOP BOMBING CAMPAIGN Trump on Tuesday at the Oval Office marked the formal end of \"Operation Rough Rider,\" a 50-day bombing campaign that targeted more than 1,000 sites across Yemen.(Reuters/Leah Millis/File Photo) Still, not all analysts see the Houthis as a grave threat or the campaign as a necessary use of force. \"Trump’s surprise announcement that the U.S. will stop airstrikes against the Houthis is the right decision, regardless of whether the group stops targeting U.S. vessels,\" said Rosemary Kelanic, director of the Middle East program at Defense Priorities. \"The Houthi threat was always more hype than substance.\" Kelanic argued the group’s attacks on shipping \"neither damaged the U.S. economy nor contributed to inflation, which actually went down during the militant group’s assaults throughout the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\" In her view, \"the Houthis’ biggest achievement was tricking the U.S. into wasting some $7 billion of its own resources by bombing them.\" \"Trump’s bold choice shows there are offramps from endless escalation in the Middle East,\" she added. ISRAEL APPROVES PLAN TO CAPTURE ALL OF GAZA, CALLS UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RESERVE TROOPS: REPORT An aircraft launches from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, on March 15.(U.S. Navy via AP) Jon Hoffman, a research fellow in defense and foreign policy at the Cato Institute, said, \"Washington's open-ended and congressionally unauthorized strikes against the Houthis for targeting shipping in the Red Sea was the epitome of strategic malpractice, neglecting the origins of the conflict (the war in Gaza) and failing to deter the group while squandering billions in taxpayer dollars.\" Military analysts remain skeptical about the Houthis’ long-term reliability. \"I am always worried about groups like the Houthis sticking to anything they say,\" said Navarro, warning that the ceasefire could simply be a pause to rebuild their capabilities. \"We need to remain vigilant… and adopt a broader strategy that includes not just military tools, but economic and informational pressure, and support for local alternatives to Houthi control in Yemen.\" Still, the Trump administration is framing the halt as a strategic victory that demonstrates how military power, when wielded with diplomatic clarity, can yield tangible political results. \"Massive WIN. President Trump promised to restore the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, and he used great American strength to swiftly deliver on that promise. The world is safer with President Trump in charge,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If they can deliver this,\" said Kasapoglu, \"it would be a major, major victory for the Trump administration.\" Whether the ceasefire holds – or proves to be merely a lull in a longer conflict – remains to be seen. But for now, the bombs have stopped, and Washington is claiming a win.",

    "title": "Federal judge orders return of deported migrant to US, rejecting Trump request",
    "article_text": "'Special Report' panelists Juan Williams, Mollie Hemingway and Hugh Hewitt discuss the Trump administration's push for illegal immigrants to self-deport and the legal challenges to nationwide injunctions. BALTIMORE, MD –A federal judge on Tuesday refused to change her order requiringthe Trump administrationto bring back a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker deported to El Salvador, citing due process protections. At a hearing Tuesday in Baltimore, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, aTrump appointee, rejected the government's request to amend her earlier ruling which ordered the government to return Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, to U.S. soil. But she also agreed to pause the ruling for 48 hours – enough time for the government to ask the 4th Circuit to take up the case. If the court declines, Gallagher said she will amend her ruling to set a formal timeline for the government to return the 20-year-old migrant to the U.S. IDENTITY OF SECOND DEPORTED MAN WHO JUDGE WANTS RETURNED TO US REVEALED AS TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS ORDER A person holds up a sign referencing the Centre for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT) prison in El Salvador during a May Day demonstration against President Donald Trump and his immigration policies in Houston, Texas, on May 1, 2025.(Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP) This decision \"strikes the right balance between giving the government the ability\" to appeal to the higher court as they see fit – and also allows plaintiffs to seek due process in U.S. courts, Gallagher said. Lozano-Camargo, previously referred to in court documents as \"Cristian,\" wasdeported to El Salvador in Marchunder the Trump administration's early wave of Alien Enemies Act deportations. Gallagher ruled in April that the government violated a 2024 settlement between DHS and a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo. Under that deal, DHS agreed not to deport the migrants – all of whom entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children – until their cases were fully heard in court. Last month, Gallagher said Lozano-Camargo’s deportation was a \"breach of contract,\" since his asylum case had not yet been heard, and ordered the U.S. government to facilitate his release. Gallagher reiterated her previous decision on Tuesday. She also emphasized it has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request, in a nod to two apparent low-level drug offenses and a conviction as recently as January. Rather, she said, it is about allowing him the process under the law, and under the settlement struck with DHS. That settlement agreement \"requires him to be here and have his hearing,\" she said. TRUMP-ALIGNED GROUP SUES CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS IN EFFORT TO RESTRICT POWER OF THE COURTS Residents protesting against the Trump administration march to the county courthouse in Livingston, Montana on April 19, 2025.(William Campbell/Getty Images) Gallagher noted that his removal without adjudication in a U.S. court \"pre-judges the outcome,\" with no ability for his attorneys to challenge the case in court. The Trump administrationtold the courtthat it had determined that Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the Alien Enemies Act, citing his earlier arrest and conviction for cocaine possession in Houston this year. On Monday, lawyers for the administration told the court that his designation as an \"alien enemy pursuant to the AEA results in him ceasing to be a member\" of the class that had negotiated a settlement. At the status hearing Tuesday, Gallagher made clear her decision was based solely on due process protections. The government is \"measuring utility using the wrong yardstick\" in this case, she said, adding that it is not a case of whether Lozano-Camargo will eventually receive asylum – it’s a question of process. Process, she said, is important for various reasons – noting that even when outcomes in certain criminal cases or trials seem obvious, individuals are still entitled to a trial under U.S. law.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to give an update on President Donald Trump’s moves to end new leases for onshore and offshore wind energy projects. PresidentDonald Trumpis facing a legal challenge to another one of hisexecutive orders, this time over his temporary withdrawal of offshore wind energy leases and review of wind power permitting practices. The District of Columbia and 17 states are suing Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and a slew of other officials over the administration’s move to do what they describe as halting progress to undertake an \"amorphous, redundant, extra-statutory, and multi-agency review of unknown duration.\" \"Citing unspecified ‘legal deficiencies’ and ‘inadequacies’ in past federalwind energy reviews, the Wind Directive orders the heads of relevant federal agencies to relinquish their congressionally imposed responsibilities,\" the suit alleged. \"It orders that agency defendants instead ‘shall not issue new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of federalwind leasing and permittingpractices’ — a review, grounded in no statute and duplicative of already required reviews…,\" the suit said. TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER FORCES NJ TO CANCEL ITS FIRST OFFSHORE WIND FARM President Donald Trump, left, wind turbines, right(Getty Images) The plaintiff states go on to warn against job loss, economic effects and a roadblock to the source of 10% of the U.S.'s energy generation. Filed in Boston federal court Monday, the suit seeks to allow states like Massachusetts to continue their projects after hundreds of millions of dollars have already been invested in offshore wind and \"well-paying green jobs,\" according to a statement from Bay State Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. \"The president’s attempts to stop homegrown wind energy development directly contradict his claims that there is a growing need for reliabledomestic energy,\" Campbell said. \"My colleagues and I will continue to challenge this administration’s unlawful actions to chill investment and growth of this critical industry.\" TRUMP HITS BIDEN ON LAST-MINUTE ENERGY CRACKDOWN, PROMISES DAY 1 REVERSAL The White House pushed back, with spokesperson Taylor Rogers telling Fox News Digital that instead of working with Trump to \"unleash American energy and lower prices for American families, Democrat attorneys general are using lawfare to stop the president’s popular energy agenda.\" \"The American people voted for the President to restore America’s energy dominance, and Americans in blue states should not have to pay the price of the Democrats’ radical climate agenda,\" Rogers said. Meanwhile, California Attorney General Rob Bonta added separately that Trump’s directive is \"reckless\" and will \"not only reverse America’s progress in clean energy initiatives, but our communities will also suffer the economic consequences of the president’s misguided lawlessness.\" Bonta claimed Trump’s order and similar actions billed as aiming to lower energy costs will only do the opposite. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy added in a statement that his state will continue to move toward its goal of 100% clean energy by 2035, and that wind power plays a key role in it. \"We are committed to reversing this disruptive action and will take every step necessary to get these projects back on track,\" he said.

Anthony Tata’s colorful past statements disqualify him from serving as undersecretary of defense for personnel and policy. Retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, President Trump’s pick for a top Pentagon post, came under fire at his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday for past inflammatory remarks, including calling former PresidentBarack Obamaa \"terrorist leader\" and suggesting ex-CIA Director John Brennan deserved execution. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, called Tata’s record of political statements \"disqualifying\" and said his rhetoric was \"not appropriate for a position of this significance.\" \"I respect and appreciate your military service,\" Reed said, \"but your record of public statements and behavior toward individuals with whom you disagree politically is disqualifying.\" Tata, under questioning from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said he regretted the comments, calling them \"out of character.\" HEGSETH ORDERS ‘HISTORIC’ REDUCTION OF GENERAL OFFICERS IN THE MILITARY Anthony Tata, President Donald Trump's nominee for undersecretary for personnel and readiness at the Department of Defense, disavowed his past remarks.(Tierney L.

I can guarantee that I will be an apolitical leader.\" Theretired Army generaland former Trump administration official was nominated for a senior Pentagon role in 2020, but the Senate canceled his confirmation hearing at the last minute over similar concerns. Trump later appointed him to a civilian advisory role without Senate confirmation. Tata’s post-military career includes stints as a school district official, North Carolina’s secretary of transportation, and a military thriller author. After calling Obama a terrorist in 2018, Tata later wrote on X that he was \"joking\" and meant to criticize Obama for the Iran deal. \"I was joking! Of course it’s not a conspiracy theory. He did more to harm US vital interests and help Islamic countries than any president in history. The Iran deal alone is more than enough evidence of his drive to subvert US national interests to Islam and a globalist agenda.\" \"Might be a time to pick your poison,\" Tata had also replied on X to Brennan in asince-deleted post,accusing him of treason. Last month, Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethfired Darin Selnick, his deputy chief of staff who had also been performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., asked whether Tata valued loyalty to the Constitution or the administration’s political agenda more. \"We all raise our right hand to uphold the Constitution,\" Tata responded, though he defended Trump’s vision of avoiding \"unnecessary wars\" and rebuilding the military. He pledged to uphold his oath even \"if it means getting fired.\" If confirmed as undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Tata would oversee military recruitment, education, healthcare and overall force readiness. He would also play a key role in implementing efforts backed by Trump allies to reduce the number of general officers and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the department. Tata said he would push to improve military recruiting by expanding access to high school programs to build a \"warrior ethos,\" and streamline medical waivers for disqualified candidates. He also pledged to advise the chain of command on \"apolitical and objective hirings,\" and denied supporting any kind of \"blatant purge.\" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., expressed concern about political pressure on military leadership, citing the recent ouster of Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. C.Q. Brown. Tata insisted his approach would be objective. Sen.

Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., on whether she believed Signal and Telemessage were permissible for work purposes at the DoD, after a slew of reports about the secretary's use of the encrypted messaging applications. \"Depends on the level of classification,\" said Sutton, adding there are a \"wide variety\" of apps in use at the DoD. \"OK, glad you got your talking point answer out,\" said Slotkin. \"It’s concerning to me that going into this job you can’t give a straight balls and strike answer.\"",

    "title": "Newark mayor takes fight to the gates of ICE detention center amid legal battle over alleged safety violations",
    "article_text": "F/A-18 fighter pilot Matthew 'Whiz' Buckley warns the problems with air traffic control will 'get worse before it gets better,' citing an antiquated system and overworked employees. The Democrat mayor of Newark, New Jersey, on Tuesday continued his crusade to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities inside a previously vacant prison that is being converted into an immigrant detention center. Mayor Ras Baraka arrived at the gates of Delaney Hall this morning alongside activists to demand entry into the facility that he claims GEO Group, the building’s new owner, is unlawfully preventing from being inspected. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the City of Newark on April 1 alleges that GEO Group failed to permit entry to safety inspectors and violated city construction code, including by conducting electrical and plumbing renovations without proper oversight. Fox News Digital reached out to the mayor's office for comment on the ongoing litigation and Baraka's visit to the facility. 'BOGUS CLAIMS': BLUE CITY MAYOR UNDER FIRE FOR TRYING TO HALT REOPENING OF ICE FACILITY In a press conference on Monday, Baraka said GEO Group is \"following the pattern of the president of the United States who believes that he can just do what he wants to do and obscure the laws, national and constitutional laws, and they think they can do the same thing in the state of New Jersey and in Newark.\" Baraka said fire department officials were trying to verify whether people were being detained in Delaney Hall after hearing \"from word of mouth that they said they've been putting people in the building, from an employee there who told us that detainees were in fact being allowed in the building.\" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka(AP photo/Mike Catalini) \"In the initial inspection, we found some violations. Some of them weren't grave violations, but they were, in fact, violations. Violations that put first responders at risk, violations that put detainees or workers that are there at risk,\" the mayor continued. Possible violations listed later in the press conference by lawyer Kenyatta K. Stewart included unsanitary kitchens, lack of emergency exits and lack of proper ventilation. IDENTITY OF SECOND DEPORTED MAN WHO JUDGE WANTS RETURNED TO US REVEALED AS TRUMP ADMIN FIGHTS ORDER Stewart and Baraka expressed concern about the possibility of children being detained in the building. The mayor said it violates the law to refuse access to fire inspectors, health inspectors and uniform code of construction inspectors. GEO Group contends they are using an old certificate of occupancy from 2007, but Baraka says it’s invalid. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka(Tanya Breen/USA TODAY NETWORK) \"The attempt by local and state officials to stop the opening of a lawful federal immigration processing center at the Delaney Hall facility in Newark is another unfortunate example of a politicized campaign by sanctuary city and open borders politicians in New Jersey to interfere with the federal government’s efforts to arrest, detain, and deport dangerous criminal illegal aliens in accordance with established federal law,\" a spokesperson for the group told Fox News Digital in a statement last month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These politically motivated tactics threaten both public safety and the local economy and are based on bogus claims about the Delaney Hall facility, which previously operated as a federal immigration processing center for six years under President Obama’s administration, without opposition from local political leaders,\" the statement continued. Baraka, who is running for governor of the Garden State, denied politicizing the issue. \"The reality is, this is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, in my mind. It's an issue of human rights. It's an issue of due process. It's the issue of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States,\" he said.

    "title": "Supreme Court stays lower court ruling, allowing Trump transgender ban to proceed",
    "article_text": "Soldiers given false arrest records have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for years. President Trump or Defense Secretary Hegseth could fix it, lawyers say. TheSupreme Courton Tuesday sided with the Trump administration in lifting a lower court order that paused the Pentagon's transgender military ban from taking effect – allowing Trump's order and related policies to proceed, at least. The high court ruling is a near-term victory for the White House, even as it did not address the underlying merits of the case or PresidentDonald Trump'sJan. 27 executive order banning transgender service members from the U.S. military. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the administration's appeal and kept the lower court injunction in place. At issue in the suit, Shilling v. United States, is Trump's executive order banning transgender military members. HEGSETH SAYS HE'S SIGNING MEMO ON COMBAT ARMS STANDARDS FOR MEN AND WOMEN At issue in the suit, Shilling v. United States, is President Donald Trump's January executive order banning transgender military members.(Getty Images) Theexecutive orderwould require the Defense Department to update its guidance regarding \"trans-identifying medical standards for military service\" and to \"rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\" The Trump administration has argued that further stalling the policy could pose a threat to U.S. military readines – concerns it outlined to Supreme Court in a filing late last month. \"Absent a stay, the district court’s universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this Court – a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the Nation’s interests,\" U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court, urging justices to grant the stay. Trump officials have argued that the transgender military policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\" The case was immediately challenged in federal court. Seven transgender military members brought suit against the administration in Seattle-basedfederal court,and in Washington, D.C., where U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes grilled lawyers for the Trump administration in a dizzying line of questioning that invokedshelters, Jesus, and Miss Pac-Man, among other things, before asking the government to push its planned implementation deadline. That decision was later overturned by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. TRUMP'S TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN DEALT LEGAL BLOW AFTER APPEALS COURT RULING The January executive order required the Department of Defense to update its guidance regarding \"trans-identifying medical standards for military service\" and to \"rescind guidance inconsistent with military readiness.\"(Omar Marques/Getty Images) In the Seattle case, plaintiffs argued that the executive order \"turns away\" transgender military members \"and kicks them out – for no legitimate reason.\" \"Rather, it baselessly declares all transgender people unfit to serve, insults and demeans them, and cruelly describes every one of them as incapable of ‘an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,’ based solely because they are transgender,\" it continued. U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle issued a preliminary injunction in March that blocked the administration from identifying and removing transgender service members as the suit worked its way through the lower courts. In his opinion granting the injunction, Settle characterized the ban as a \"blanket prohibition on transgender service.\" Settle found the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits of their equal protection, First Amendment, and procedural due process claims, among others. \"The government’s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" Settle wrote. Settle wrote in his order that the injunction was to \"maintain the status quo ofmilitary policyregarding both active-duty and prospective transgender service\" that were in place prior to Trump's Jan. 27 executive order. The administration quickly appealed the order to the 9th Circuit, requesting the appellate court stay Settle's order. HEGSETH SUGGESTS JUDGE REPORT TO MILITARY BASES AFTER RULING THAT PENTAGON MUST ALLOW TRANSGENDER TROOPS The administration argued in court filings that the policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\" A three-judge panel – composed of Judges Atsushi Wallace Tashima, a Clinton-appointee, John B. Owens, an Obama-appointee, and Roopali H. Desai, a Biden-appointee – denied the administration's request for a stay on March 31, which was overturned by the Supreme Court ruling Tuesday. Transgender plaintiffs also notably sued in D.C. federal court, where U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes also initially blocked the ban from going into effect.(Getty/Reuters) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Department of Justice has vigorously defended President Trump’s executive actions, including the Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness Executive Order, and will continue to do so,\" aJustice Departmentofficial told Fox News Digital at the time. Shilling v. United States is just one of several suits challenging the Trump administration's military ban. It comes as Trump has used his early days in office to undo major Biden-era policies, including their efforts to promote a diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, agenda.

    "article_text": "Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer discuss President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ FIRST ON FOX:Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is urging PresidentDonald Trump's Department of Labor to open an investigation into Tyson Foods on Tuesday after receiving a whistleblower report claiming the company employed child labor at one of its facilities. Hawley wrotea letter to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer on Tuesday, urging her to investigate the matter. He said his Senate Judiciary subcommittee opened its own investigation after being contacted by the whistleblower. Tyson plants in Tennessee and elsewhere have been the subject of child labor investigations in recent years. \"The whistleblower, a former Tyson Foods employee who oversaw plant safety, alleges that they personally witnessed underage workers and also received multiple reports from hourly Tyson employees about child workers in the plant. According to the allegations, these child workers were employed by a third-party entity contracted by Tyson for work in the plant,\" Hawley wrote in his letter.\"After reporting concerns to company superiors about child workers employed at the plant, the whistleblower was subjected to retaliation and a 'toxic work environment.' Due to the toxic work environment, the whistleblower quit. Tyson is now pursuing legal action against them related to their departure from the company,\" the letter continued. ONE DEAD, 2 HOSPITALIZED AFTER FIRE AT TYSON FOODS PLANT IN GEORGIA Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called for a labor investigation into Tyson Foods on Tuesday.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Hawley went on to note media reports showing that \"Tyson purposely uses subcontractors to avoid punishment for illegally employing children. As a result, Tyson has successfully avoided all liability and culpability for its clear violations of child labor laws.\" Tyson denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday. \"We do not allow the employment of anyone under the age of 18 in any of our facilities, and we do not facilitate, excuse, or in any other way participate in the use of child labor by third parties. We take the enforcement of all labor laws seriously, and we verify the age of all team members by fully participating in the federal government's E-Verify and IMAGE programs. We also have multiple processes in place, including an anonymous ethics hotline, for all team members to report suspicious activity,\" a Tyson Foods spokesperson said in a statement.

Chavez-DeRemer's office confirmed to Fox News Digital that the secretary had received Hawley's letter on Tuesday. \"The Secretary is reviewing the Senator’s letter and remains committed to protecting America’s children from potential labor violations,\" Labor Department spokesperson Courtney Parella said in a statement.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump spoke with the press in the Oval Office alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney addressing U.S.-Canada relations moving forward. President Donald Trump said he would \"love\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom to launch a White House bid for the Democrats, but said his response towildfiresand other issues would \"pretty much put him out of the race.\" The president, during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, took a swipe at Newsom, blasting California’s high-speed rail project. SMELT TEST: TRUMP ORDER OVERRIDES CALIFORNIA'S FISH-PROTECTING RULES TO MAXIMIZE WATER SUPPLY \"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that’s being run by Gavin New-scum—the governor of California,\" Trump said. \"Did you ever hear of Gavin Newsom? He has got that train—the worst cost overrun I’ve ever seen. It’s like, totally out of control.\" Trump said he \"always liked Gavin\" and \"had a good relationship with him.\" President Donald Trump, left, meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday, May 6, 2025 in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) \"I just got him a lot of water, you know, I sent in people to open up that water because he refused to do it,\" Trump said, adding that \"if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn’t have had the fires in Los Angeles.\" \"Those fires would have been put out very quickly,\" Trump said. Trump traveled toSouthern Californiain January, just days after taking office, to see damage from the devastating wildfires that destroyed thousands of acres and more than 10,000 buildings in the Los Angeles area. After the visit, Trump issued an executive order calling on federal agencies to overrule California regulations on endangered species to create more water availability, expedite the removal of debris in the areas affected by the fires and conduct investigations into the City of Los Angeles' use of federal grants. Trump also called on the Department of the Interior to immediately override existing regulationsin Californiathat \"unduly burden efforts to maximize water deliveries\" to the Central Valley Project, a water management effort in the state.

It was expected to cost $33 billion and be finished by 2020, but the project has been riddled with funding challenges, cost overruns and delays. The project is now reportedly expected to cost an estimated $106 billion to complete. \"This government is not going to pay,\" Trump said, noting that he toldTransportation Secretary Sean Duffythat the Trump administration is \"not going to pay for that thing\" –  [it's] \"30 times over budget.\" \"It was supposed to be a simple train,\" Trump said. Duffy, in February, began a Transportation Department review to determine whether the California High-Speed Rail Authority had \"followed through on the commitments it made to receive billions of dollars in federal funding.\" \"If not, I will have to consider whether that money could be given to deserving infrastructure projects elsewhere in the United States,\" Duffy said at a news conference inLos Angelesin February. Looking ahead to 2028, the president said he would \"love\" to see Newsom run for president. Newsom is barred from seeking re-election as California governor in 2026 due to term limits.

    "title": "SCOOP: Trump ally's Gulf of America bill sparks frustration in House GOP",
    "article_text": "Charlie Hurt tours an oil rig in the Gulf of America with Energy Secretary Doug Burgum on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.' FIRST ON FOX:A scheduled vote on making PresidentDonald Trump’sGulf of America name change permanent is causing some heartburn within the House GOP conference. Multiple House Republicans who spoke with Fox News Digital said they were frustrated by House GOP leaders’ decision to spend time voting on what they saw as a largely symbolic gesture in an otherwise light legislative week. It comes as GOP negotiators work behind the scenes to iron out divisions on Medicaid, tax policy and green energy subsidies in time to pass Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill\" by the Fourth of July. \"This is a time where we should be in our districts, going to graduations, making sure that we're listening to folks who have tariff issues,\" a more moderate GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital. \"Instead, we’re going to spend time doing this… it's frustrating for somebody who's got a lot of pragmatic legislation, waiting in the queue to be heard. Instead, we're doing posture bills. It’s not what I came here to do.\" SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One as he prepares to sign a proclamation declaring Feb. 9 Gulf of America Day.(AP/Ben Curtis) But the frustration is not limited to moderate and mainstream Republicans. One conservative GOP lawmaker vented to Fox News Digital, \"125 other [executive orders], this is the one we pick.\" \"Folks are upset that we're not doing something more important,\" the conservative lawmaker said. Two sources familiar with House Republicans’ whip team meeting said at least three GOP lawmakers aired concerns about the bill — Reps. Don Bacon, R-Neb., Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., and Glenn Grothman, R-Wis. One of the sources described their sentiments as, \"They just think it’s kind of frivolous or not serious.\" \"I’ve heard criticisms from all corners of the conference. Conservatives to pragmatic ones,\" Bacon told Fox News Digital. \"It seems sophomoric. The United States is bigger and better than this.\" Bacon is among the Republicans pushing hard for a restrained hand on Medicaid cuts in Trump's multitrillion-dollar bill, while other GOP lawmakers are pushing for more significant cuts. Grothman would not confirm or deny his concerns, telling Fox News Digital, \"That’s behind-the-scenes stuff.\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene led the bill.(Reuters/Jim Bourg) Obernolte’s office did not respond to requests for comment by press time. While the concerns have not come from a large number of the overall conference, any degree of defections is significant with the GOP’s razor-thinHouse majority. With all lawmakers present in the chamber, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can currently lose up to three votes to still pass something along party lines. It’s also a sign of Trump’s continued dominance on Capitol Hill starting to wear on some Republican lawmakers. It’s not clear that the lawmakers who expressed concerns will vote against the final bill, however, particularly with pressure from House GOP leaders. A third House Republican who spoke with Fox News Digital anonymously acknowledged the frustrations, but nevertheless said, \"It’s not the hill to die on.\" Meanwhile, Trump allies have defended the bill as a core part of the president's agenda. Trump himself has touted his \"Gulf of America\" name change several times, and even proclaimed Feb. 9 to be \"Gulf of America Day.\" It's worth noting that congressional Republicans have passed several bills promoting Trump's agenda already, including resolutions to roll back key Biden administration policies. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., addressed that with reporters Tuesday morning, \"Here's a few key examples, okay, of what we've already voted to codify in terms of the executive orders – the President's election security executive order through the SAVE Act…the executive order banning men from women's sports, we did that through the Women and Girls in Sports Act.\" \"His sanctions on the ICC, we did that through our Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act to support our ally Israel, and his forest management executive order through the Fix Our Forests Act,\" Johnson said. \"Now this week, we'll add another one to the list. We're going to pass Marjorie Taylor Green's bill to permanently rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, and then we're going to codify dozens more of President Trump's budget-related executive orders, spending related executive orders, through the budget reconciliation process.\" The budget reconciliation package, Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" is GOP negotiators' current priority. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE Rep. Don Bacon is among the Republicans with concerns about the measure.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The Gulf of America Act was introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top Trump ally. When reached for comment on some GOP lawmakers' concerns, Greene told Fox News Digital, \"Codifying the rightful renaming of the Gulf of America isn’t just a priority for me and President Trump, it’s a priority for the American people. American taxpayers fund its protection, our military defends its waters, and American businesses fuel its economy. My bill advances President Trump’s America First agenda.\" \"If certain moderate Republicans want to start elsewhere, where do they suggest?\" she continued. \"I have bills ready for all of it. But let’s be clear, we should be voting to codify every single executive order President Trump issues.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The House is also voting on a bill this week cracking down on Chinese influence in the U.S. through Confucious Institutes. The bill is currently slated toget a vote onThursday morning. Rep. Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., posted on X in support of the speaker, \"This will be a tremendous economic driver for my district. Families across the country will flock to the Florida Panhandle to be the FIRST to enjoy the Gulf of AMERICA!\" A White House official told Fox News Digital in response to the GOP concerns, \"Codification of the president’s executive orders remains a priority for the administration.\" \"The Congress can pass this simple legislation and work on THE One, Big, Beautiful Bill at the same time. This bill is ultimately about sending a clear statement that the elected leadership of the United States of America celebrates this great nation and its extraordinary people,\" the official said.

Josh Hawley introduces legislation to implement safeguards for abortion pill mifepristone.(Reuters/Getty) COVID VACCINE BOOSTERS CALLED INTO QUESTION BY FDA CHIEF: ‘VOID OF DATA’ Hawley cites last week’s study by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), which revealed in itskey findingsthat \"10.93 percent of women experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious or life-threatening adverse event within 45 days following a mifepristone abortion.\" The study assessed 865,727 insurance claims between 2017 and 2023 for women who used the medication to terminate early pregnancy. The pill can be taken up to \"70 days since the first day of their last menstrual period,\"according to the FDA. The exact number of women who have undergone a mifepristone abortion since the FDA’s approval under the Clinton administration in 2000 can be difficult to calculate, as some pregnancies are terminated without official medical intervention. Demonstrators gather in front of the Supreme Court as it hears oral arguments in U.S. Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine on March 26, 2024, in Washington, D.C. The case challenges the 20-plus-year legal authorization by the FDA of mifepristone, a commonly used abortion medication.(Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) The Guttenmacher Institute, a non-governmental organization (NGO) which was once a part of Planned Parenthood,estimates thatthere were 1,038,100 clinician-provided abortions in 2024, though this number only reflects \"states without a ban\". The estimation does not include the number of abortions that occurred illegally or in states where pregnancy termination laws vary. SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL At the time of approval, there were stricter parameters for administering the drug. However, the Obama administration’s FDA rolled back some of these requirements in 2016 by reducing the need for in-person visits, removing mandatory physician prescription requirements, and eliminating non-fatal adverse event reporting. Hawley sent a letter last week to Trump-appointed FDA CommissionerDr. Marty Makary, whom Hawley questioned during the former Johns Hopkins School of Medicine professor’s confirmation before the U.S. Senate.

The health and safety of American women depend on it.\" TRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES LEADING CHARGE ON NEW MULTISTATE LAWSUIT OVER HHS CUTS The introduction of Hawley’s bill comes just one day after Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ)asked a Texas federal judgeto dismiss a case that could restrict access to the controversial pill.

    "article_text": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada wouldn't ever be available for purchase. In response, Trump told him the option wasn't off the table. Despite PresidentDonald Trump’sinterest in Canada becoming the 51st state, Canada isn't for sale — ever, according to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump regularly has said he wantsCanada to become a U.S. state, and has discussed acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal for security purposes. However, the matter of Canada isn’t open to negotiation, Carney said. \"Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale,\" Carney said at the White House Tuesday. \"Won't be for sale ever, but the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. We have done that in the past, and part of that, as the president just said, is with respect to our security and my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security and our partnership.\" TRUMP SAYS HE WASN'T ‘TROLLING’ ABOUT ACQUIRING GREENLAND, CANADA AS 51ST STATE President Donald Trump meets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo) While Trump acknowledged that Canada was stepping up its investment in military security, Trump said \"never say never\" in response to Canada becoming another state. \"I’ve had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable,\" Trump said. Later, Carney said Canada's stance on the issue wouldn't alter. \"Respectfully, Canadians' view on this is not going to change on the 51st state,\" Carney said. TRUMP REMAINS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ODDS OF ACQUIRING GREENLAND: ‘I THINK IT'LL HAPPEN’ President Donald Trump greets Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House, May 6, 2025. (AP Photo) The interaction comes after Trump told Time magazine in an April interview that he wasn’t \"trolling\" when discussing the possibility of Canada becoming part of the U.S. Trump told Time’s Eric Cortellessa that the U.S. is \"losing\" money supporting Canada, and the only solution on the table is for it to become a state. \"We’re taking care of their military,\" Trump told the magazine. \"We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state.\" Still, Trump will continue pushing for Canada to become a state, though he cast doubt on whether he'd use military force to achieve such ends, he told NBC's Kristen Welker in an interview that aired Sunday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Well, I think we're not going to ever get to that point,\" Trump said. \"It could happen.\" In the same interview, Trump doubled down on how significant Greenland is for the U.S. in terms of national security. Although Greenland has asserted it is seeking independence from Denmark and isn't interested in joining the U.S., Trump has regularly expressed a strong interest in securing Greenland — particularly given an increase in Russian and Chinese presence in the Arctic. \"Something could happen with Greenland,\" Trump told NBC. \"I'll be honest, we need that for national and international security.\" Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering theWhite House.",

    "title": "Dangerous fungus could spread to parts of US, researchers claim",
    "article_text": "Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab joins 'Fox & Friends' to examine a new study on the effects of pathogenic gut bacteria and tips for limiting exposure to harmful bacteria. Some researchers are sounding the alarm about a potentially deadly fungus that could spread throughout parts of the U.S., Europe and Asia. The study article, which was published in pre-print (not yet peer-reviewed) in Research Square, claims that \"rising global temperatures\" could lead tosevere infectionsof Aspergillus, a fungal mold that thrives in warm, damp climates. The resulting infection — called Aspergillosis — can impact humans, livestock and plants, the researchers wrote. DANGEROUS FUNGUS SPREADING IN US HOSPITALS HAS ‘RAPIDLY INCREASED' In the study, scientific models were used to predict where Aspergillus is expected to increase based on different climate scenarios. Some researchers are sounding the alarm about a potentially deadly fungus that could spread throughout parts of the U.S., Europe and Asia.(iStock) The researchers predict that the fungus’ prevalence could increase by 77% by the year 2100, potentially exposing millions of people in Europe to the infection. Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, a San Francisco biotechnology company, was not involved in the research but reviewed the findings. \"The study indicates that some global climate change scenarios will result in changes of habitat ranges for certain lung andsystemic fungal infections,\" he told Fox News Digital. RINGWORM RESISTANT TO COMMON ANTIFUNGALS FOR FIRST TIME IN US: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE SKIN INFECTION Jatin M. Vyas, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine and infectious disease at Columbia University in New York, agreed that the study highlights concerns if Aspergillus becomes more prevalent in warmer climates. \"We do know that there are increased cases in regions of the world that are more temperate,\" Vyas, who was not part of the study, told Fox News Digital. \"It is likely that levels of human exposure will continue to increase, as will diseases of plants, crops and animals.\" Cornelius Clancy, MD, associate chief of the VA Pittsburgh Health System and opportunistic pathogens at the University of Pittsburgh, said he has seen an increase in fungal infections in humans, as well as fungal diseases in agriculture, horticulture and veterinary medicine. \"Given that Aspergillus is prevalent in the environment and ongoing changes in climate favor growth of Aspergillus in the environment, it is likely that levels of human exposure will continue to increase, as will diseases of plants, crops and animals,\" he predicted to Fox News Digital. For mosthealthy people, Aspergillus spores won’t cause any adverse effects, the experts noted. \"Most people will typically inhale some spores every day,\" Clancy said. \"If your immune system is intact, then these spores are usually removed by immune system cells in the airways and lungs and disease does not occur.\" \"Rising global temperatures\" could lead to severe infections of Aspergillus, a fungal mold that thrives in warm, damp climates, researchers said.(iStock) But for people whose immune systems respond excessively to proteins in the spores, infection can cause reactions ranging fromallergy-like symptomsto invasive disease. \"In persons who are immunosuppressed, such as those receiving cancer chemotherapy, there is a risk of spores invading the lungs and causing Aspergillus pneumonia or other lung infections, which can then spread in the blood to other organs,\" Clancy cautioned. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"These are potentially very serious infections in immunosuppressed hosts.\" Allergic reactions and asthma exacerbations can also occur in people who are not known to be immunosuppressed, but who are predisposed to allergies and asthma, he added. People who are elderly or have asthma are also at a higher risk of severe infection.(iStock) \"In patients whose immune system may be compromised — most commonly as a result of medications for cancer or other conditions — these organisms can invade the lung to causesignificant pneumonia, and may even travel throughout the body to cause systemic disease,\" Vyas cautioned. \"These patients are typically quite sick and require hospitalization.\" THE TRUTH ABOUT 'ZOMBIE CICADAS': 'THE FUNGUS CAN DO SOME NEFARIOUS THINGS' People who are elderly orhave asthmaare also at a higher risk, noted Glanville. \"Unfortunately, there is also a global trend toward increases in rates of asthma and general demographic shifts toward a more elderly population in many areas,\" he added. As Aspergillus is an environmental organism associated with soil, it is difficult to fully avoid, experts say.(iStock) \"As clinicians, we worry about this infection because it is both hard to diagnose and evenharder to treat,\" Vyas told Fox News Digital. \"We don’t have great drugs to effect cures for invasive fungal infections, including Aspergillus infections.\" Another obstacle is that some fungi become resistant to drugs over time, the experts agreed. As Aspergillus is an environmental organism associated with soil, it is difficult to fully avoid, according to Vyas. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Those who are immunocompromised should avoid working with soil unless they have had a discussion with a doctor, he recommends. \"Research into how Aspergillus causes diseases, better ways to diagnose this disease and the development of better treatments is sorely needed,\" Vyas added. \"These are potentially very serious infections in immunosuppressed hosts.\" Glanville reiterated that there are anti-fungal treatment options for Aspergillosis, although the infections are often missed during initial diagnosis. \"It would be a good idea to increase medical training to recognize these infections and to subsidize the development ofnew antifungals,\" Glanville recommended.

    "article_text": "Emma Dimery, a Minnesota woman who had stage 4 colon cancer, shares how an experimental trial led by Dr. Emil Lou at the University of Minnesota saved her life. The patient and doctor both discuss. Two years ago, Emma Dimery was told her stage 4 colon cancer was incurable. Today, she is healthy and cancer-free — and she says a last-resortclinical trialsaved her life. Dimery, who lives in Minnesota, was just 23 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer, which has been rising sharply among teens and young adults in recent years. After experiencing abdominal pain and having abnormal blood work, Dimery underwent a colonoscopy, which revealed a \"softball-sized\" tumor and another \"golf ball-sized\" one, she told Fox News Digital. ALTERNATIVE CANCER TREATMENT COULD REPLACE CHEMO AND SURGERY, STUDY SUGGESTS Despitemultiple surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation and some combination therapies, Dimery’s treatment-resistant cancer spread throughout her body over the years, leading to what she described as a \"low point.\" Emma Dimery is shown during the first phase of the clinical trial.(Emma Dimery) \"I was basically treading water, doing immunotherapy every other week for probably four years or so,\" she told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview, adding that she was \"out of options.\"(See the video at the top of the article.) \"I had been waiting for a clinical trial,\" recalled Dimery, now 35. \"I had exhausted every other standard of treatment, and even some not-so-standard ones.\" When Dimery heard about a new trial at the University of Minnesota, she said it \"wasn’t a tough decision.\" \"I was on board pretty much from day one,\" she said. The trial, led by Dr. Emil Lou, tested an experimental genetic therapy that the researcher described as the \"next frontier of immunotherapy.\" WOMAN SAYS DOG DETECTED HER BREAST CANCER BEFORE DOCTORS DID: 'HE'S KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME' While most immunotherapies have targets that are on the outside of cells, this one targeted the insides of cells. \"Some of the targets inside the cell are preventing the immune system from activatingagainst the cancer,\" Lou, a medical oncologist and scientist who had previously treated Dimery, told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview. \"It’s kind of like a shield that protects the cancer cell from the body’s immune system.\" In 2023, Emma Dimery is pictured in the hospital with her care exam during the clinical trial with her care team.(Emma Dimery) In the trial, immune cells were retrieved from the participants, then were altered in a lab using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology, which Lou described as \"genetic scissors.\" The process programmed the cells to have a more effective anti-tumor response. The altered cells were then reintroduced into the patients’ bodies via infusion. \"They trained the cells to be able to fight my cancer specifically when they were reintroduced into my body,\" Dimery noted. \"What we saw … was a magnificent and unprecedented level of response.\" It was a long process that was grueling at times, she shared, with some challenging side effects. \"You just get through it and try to focus on the good,\" Dimery said. \"And I had a lot of good around me. I had really amazing support team.\" A total of 12 patients participated in the study — but Dimery had by far the best results. The vast majority of advanced colorectal cancers are not considered to be curable, Lou confirmed to Fox News Digital. \"The chemotherapies or whatever other treatments we have available, while there are a number of them, are palliative — meaning they don't have the capability to induce a cure in patients with metastatic stage 4colorectal cancers,\" he said. \"Emma was in that category until she came onto our trial.\" Emma Dimery and her husband Andrew celebrate after buying a home right after she was released from the hospital after the trial in 2023.(Emma Dimery) Lou described Dimery’s response to theexperimental immunotherapyas \"remarkable.\" After just one infusion of the engineered cells, she was pronounced cancer-free — an outcome that is \"almost unheard-of\" with advanced colorectal cancer. \"We term this in oncology as a ‘clinical complete response,’ which is something that you see in 10% or less of all patients,\" Lou said. \"And it’s less than 10% for stage 4 colorectal cancers.\" WOMAN SAYS CHATGPT SAVED HER LIFE BY HELPING DETECT CANCER, WHICH DOCTORS MISSED \"What we saw in Emma was a magnificent and unprecedented level of response, going from a metastatic stage for an otherwise incurable cancer … where now we don’t see any cancer.\" Two years after the trial, Dimery said she’s doing \"really well.\" Emma Dimery is pictured with her sister, Anne Johnson, during a 2017 hospital stay.(Emma Dimery) \"The trial worked almost immediately — and I've had no evidence of disease since,\" she told Fox News Digital. While she’s hesitant to use \"the C-word,\" or \"cure,\" she said the trial has changed the way she thinks of cancer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Until now, the best I could hope for was remission to the point of no evidence of disease … and had to accept that it could rear its head again at any point, even if they can't detect iton a scan,\" Dimery said. \"All of my scans have just been coming back better and better.\" \"You just get through it and try to focus on the good,\" Dimery said in an on-camera interview with Fox News Digital. \"And I had a lot of good around me. I had really amazing support team.\"(Fox News) Dimery’s story was unveiled last week at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in Chicago. \"Emma is exceptional in many ways, but what we learned from her case, we hope to replicate and decipher how we can achieve this on a more consistent basis across the board for more patients like her,\" Lou added. Studies have shown that in 2023, one in 10 colorectal cancer diagnoses were considered early-onset, or affecting patients under 50 years of age. The American College of Surgeons predicts that early-onset cases will double by 2030. Emma Dimery is pictured in 2013, at just 23 years, after receiving her initial cancer diagnosis.(Emma Dimery) \"Colorectal cancer remains one of the few cancers for which we have validatedscreening tools,\" Lou noted. Those include blood-based tests, stool-based tests and colonoscopies. In 2018, the American Cancer Society changed its colorectal screening recommendation from age 50 to age 45. Other medical organizations followed suit in ensuing years. \"The trial worked almost immediately — and I've had no evidence of disease since.\" Even so, Lou said he is seeing patientsdiagnosed well aheadof the age 45 benchmark. \"I'm seeing something in the last five or six years that I really did not see earlier in my career — teenagers, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s,\" he shared. \"Just last week, I saw someone in their early 40s with widely metastatic stage 4 colorectal cancer.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER What’s \"striking and alarming,\" Lou said, is that about half of the cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed at stage 4. \"A lot of times, they don't even have symptoms, or they have symptoms that were construed as something else.\" The more people who are aware, the better.

Then, it extended that suspension for almost a full year before putting the NBA back on its state-run television during the2020 NBA Finals. After suggesting the NBA and China had to come to a deal to get their relationship back on track, Blackburn pressed Koenig for the details. \"So, since we’re talking about broadcast rights and what they’re worth, why don’t you tell me what the broadcast rights in China are worth, and how much NBA owners have invested in China,\" she said.

I’m asking what are the media rights worth? You’re the president of global content and media distribution. So, what are those rights worth, and how much have the NBA owners invested in China?\" Koenig responded, \"The NBA does not comment publicly on the financial terms of our relationship — U.S. or abroad. But I can comment that you are accurate that, in light of the tweet that Daryl Morey made in 2019 …\" \"You had to cut a deal,\" Blackburn replied, but Koenig said the league did not. \"The estimates are these media rights are worth hundreds of millions of dollars to you all, and that NBA team owners have invested as much as $10 billion dollars [in China]. I think some clarity into those numbers would be important,\" Blackburn added.

Enes Kanter Freedom, one specifically. So, can you commit to me that in every deal the NBA makes around the globe that the league is upholding human rights, and that the league is upholding freedom of speech, and they’re upholding the American ideals of freedom?\" Koenig replied by saying \"one of the NBA’s most important values is freedom of speech.\" \"In fact, the example you cited before — Daryl Morey. He was not disciplined or censored in any way in light of the comments that he made,\" Koenig added. \"You’re right. That comment may have led to lack of coverage by CCTV and other things. But, no, we very much value freedom of speech, and that’s something I can confirm.\" Since the NBA mended its relationship with China, Commissioner Adam Silver has stated the league will look into playing games there again. \"I think we will bring games back to China at some point,\" he said in October. \"China's government took us off the air for a period of time.

    "title": "Women's swimmers speak out after unknowingly facing trans competitor, filing complaint: 'I feel betrayed'",
    "article_text": "XX-XY Athletics founder Jennifer Sey on Washington State failing to pass proposals to protect girls' sports and a report that former President Joe Biden secretly believed that trans athletes shouldn't compete alongside women. EXCLUSIVE:U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS), a competitive swimming membership organization with over 60,000 adult swimmers, wasthrust into national controversylast week after reports surfaced that a trans swimmer won five women's events. USMS confirmed to Fox News Digital it is currently conducting aneligibility reviewin response to a request from a competitor at the meet. Louisiana woman and long-time swimmer Wendy Enderle said she filed the request for an eligibility review after finding out that one of the competitors she has faced for years was transgender, via a news article stemming from last week's incident. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Women's swimmer Wendy Enderle swims at the 2018 USMS Spring Championship.(Courtesy of Wendy Enderle) \"I feel betrayed. Plain and simple,\" Enderle told Fox News Digital. Enderle most recently competed against the trans athlete at the USMS Spring National Championship in San Antonio April 26-27. The trans athlete, Ana Caldas, won gold in five races, including in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle in the 45-49 age bracket against Enderle. Enderle first ever saw Caldas in person in February 2024 at the World Aquatics Masters World Championships women's 50m freestyle in Doha, Qatar.Enderle finishedwith a time of 29.19, while Caldas finished in 27.91. However, Enderle said she did not directly introduce herself to Caldas until a USMS meet in Little Rock, Arkansas, in January. Upon meeting Caldas, Enderle noticed the athlete's muscles and height, but still assumed Caldas was biologically female. \"I knew there was something, but I didn't know what, I had no idea she was a trans female up until this past Wednesday after the meet,\" Enderle said. \"I was shocked… It makes me concerned, it makes me mad.\" Enderle submitted her request for an eligibility review against Caldas this past week. One of the main goals of that decision is to keep Caldas from competing in this year's World Aquatics Masters World Championships in Singapore. \"I don't think it's right that she was competing in the women's category, and I don't believe that she should be competing in the women's category this August in Singapore,\" Enderle said. \"I'm not trying to keep Ana, I'm not trying to keep anyone else from competing. I have nothing against trans individuals, I have nothing against LGBTQ individuals. But I believe in fairness in sports and I don't believe that men should participate in women's sports. I don't think it's fair.\" Fellow USMS women's swimmer Angie Griffin also swam with Caldas last week without knowledge of Caldas' birth gender. The shock of learning the news about Caldas prompted Griffin to write a formal letter of complaint to USMS. The letter also requested the organization to \"re-evaluate\" that recent Spring National Championship and completely overhaul its current gender eligibility policy. Griffin competed against Caldas in three races and finished behind the trans athlete in the 50-yard breastroke and 100-yard individual medley. \"I couldn't stop thinking about how the integrity of individual competition had been compromised Why doesn't USMS follow the same competitive standards as the rest of the world andNCAA? Why are athletes asked to accept less transparency and fairness?\" Griffin told Fox News Digital \"I paid my entry fees, airfare, and hotel, trusting I'd be competing in a women's division defined by biological sex. I deserved to know the truth before stepping onto the blocks.\" Griffin's team did beat Caldas' team in the Women's 45+ 200 Free Relay, but Griffin still walked away from the incident feeling concerned. RILEY GAINES WANTS TO SEND A ‘THANK-YOU NOTE' TO LIA THOMAS – HERE'S WHY \"Reflecting on the meet, that one high point of winning the relay didn't erase the larger concern,\" Griffin said. While USMS is currently conducting an eligibility review based on the San Antonio meet, the organization admitted it has never disqualified a swimmer based on gender identity. \"USMS has not disqualified a swimmer from official recognition based on gender eligibility after an event,\" the organization told Fox News Digital. USMS gender eligibility policy states that swimmers who identify as transgender are not required to provide documentation on eligibility to participate, until a request for review is made. Still, the organization said that documentation verification is rare. \"If a review request is filed, our eligibility panel — composed of member leaders and subject matter experts — follows a structured, confidential process to determine whether the athlete meets the criteria for official recognition. This includes reviewing documentation the swimmer provides following our published policy,\" USMS said. \"Cases that require documentation are extremely rare, and we follow a structured process in line with our published rules and policy. This protects athlete privacy and ensures the same standard applies to every swimmer.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP USMS policy allows transgender swimmers to participate in the gender competition category in which they identify, and they may also be recognized for accomplishments, if certain conditions are met. One of the two conditions requires that a hormonal therapy appropriately be administered continuously and uninterrupted in a verifiable manner for no less than one year. The other condition is proof of testosterone serum levels measured during the last twelve months being below five nmol/L (144.25 ng/dL). Trans swimmers who do not meet those requirements can still participate in the women's category, but their times are removed from the submitted results, and they are not eligible for official times, places, points, records, Top 10 or other forms of official recognition.

    "article_text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration asked fishermen and boaters to avoid a sanctuary off Boston where there are historic shipwrecks. CREDIT: NOAA Archaeologists are shedding light on the astonishing identification of two 18th-century slave shipsoff the coast of Central America. The ships, named Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, have been sitting in shallow waters off Costa Rica's Cahuita National Park for over 300 years, as Fox News Digital previously reported. The18th-century vesselswere shipwrecked in 1710, and archaeologists only recently discovered that the ships – long believed to be pirate ships – were used to transport slaves. Now, in a statement to Fox News Digital, National Museum of Denmark archaeologist David John Gregory said the two ships carried between 600 and 700 African slaves at the time of the sinking, plus around 100 crewmen. GARDEN OF EDEN'S TRUE LOCATION 'CAN ONLY BE' AT UNUSUAL TOURIST LANDMARK, NEW ARGUMENT CLAIMS \"When the ships were abandoned on the coast of present-day Costa Rica, almost all of the enslaved were released on the forested coast except for about 20 people, who were forced onboard smaller vessels heading for the nearby Spanish town of Portobello,\" he said. Gregory added, \"[Fridericus Quartus] wasset on fireby its crew, while the other, Christianus Quintus, was set free from its moorings and soon after stranded on the coast.\" New details have been revealed about two recently identified slave ships.(Jakob Olling; Ana María Arenas Moreno) The slaves – mostly of West African origin – either assimilated into local communities or were, unfortunately, recaptured, according toEast Carolina University. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE' Gregory also described his team's excavation as \"minimal,\" saying they only searched some 21 square feet around the ship \"specifically to obtain samples of the ship's timber.\" \"Almost all of the enslaved were released on the forested coast.\" He added, \"No human remains were encountered [or] disturbed during the excavation process.\" ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH STRANGE HEAD DEPICTING ROMAN GOD BENEATH CATHOLIC BASILICA Archaeologists were able to date the ships thanks to dendrochronological technology, finding that the wood came from Northern Europe at the end of the 17th century. No human remains were found at the excavation site, said a National Museum of Denmark archaeologist.(National Museum of Denmark) \"The timbers originate in the western part of the Baltic Sea, an area that encompasses the northeastern German province of Mecklenburg, as well as Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark and Scania — and that the tree was cut down sometime during the years 1690-1695,\" the National Museum of Denmark said in a statement.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke with TSA Acting Administrator Adam Stahl about how REAL IDs will impact travel with state and airports working ahead of the May 7 deadline. The countdown is on. In just one day, Americans will no longer be able to travel with a standard driver's license as their ID. Instead, they will need a REAL ID, with a gold star showing in the upper right-hand corner. Travelers will need to show their REAL ID or other forms of acceptable identification ondomestic flightsstarting Wednesday, May 7. The deadline has sparked panic among many Americans who have been rushing to obtain the new identification before their travels, with some still waiting to receive their REAL IDs in the mail. MARRIED WOMEN FACE REAL ID DOCUMENTATION HURDLES: 'I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS' Flyers who enrolled for a REAL ID will receive the identification via mail with the times varying by state. The New York DMV said after passengers apply, they will receive a temporary document and \"it takes about 2 weeks for your new Enhanced and REAL ID document to arrive in the mail.\" With the REAL ID deadline just a day away at this point, some Americans report delays in receiving their identification.(Fox News) In California, meanwhile, according to their DMV, \"it typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to receive a physical REAL ID card in the mail after applying.\" In the state of Michigan, the identification should arrive in the mail within two to three weeks, according to its DMV site. Pennsylvania, for its part, said it will mail out a REAL ID within 15 business days if a person enrolls at a DMV; but if a traveler visits a PennDOT REAL ID Center, the person can \"be verified in real time, and your REAL ID will be issued [the] same day.\" HIDDEN REAL ID HASSLES FACING AIRLINE TRAVELERS AND STATES TO AVOID Daniel Velez, a spokesperson for TSANew England, shared advice with Fox News Digital about what passengers should do if they're still waiting for their REAL IDs. \"Passengers who present a non-compliant state ID along with a state letter or receipt will still be subject to additional screening but should be able to proceed faster than those who only present a state letter or receipt,\" said Velez. Travelers experiencing mail delays with their new IDs can use passport alternatives for domestic flights when standard licenses become invalid on Wednesday, said the TSA.(Fox News Digital) He added, \"We strongly suggest (even if you have a receipt/letter from the DMV) that passengers bring another form of an acceptable ID such as aU.S. passportin order to proceed through security faster.\" Velez said that if passengers do not have any acceptable ID, TSA \"strongly suggest[s] they arrive to the airport 3 hours prior to their departure time.\" \"I tried calling, can't reach a person.\" Other forms of identification that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID include a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry;Department of DefenseIDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards.

    "article_text": "Archaeologists in Brussels, Belgium, recently came across the remnants of an old cemetery located in a busy part of the city. The remains date back to the Middle Ages. (Source: @mijnmivb via Facebook) A skull was recently discovered at amedieval church– and an expert believes it may belong to a legendary European king. Emese Gábor, a facial reconstruction specialist and portrait sculptor based in Hungary, spoke with Fox News Digital about the discovery. The skull was found in the ossuary portion of the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Székesfehérvár, Hungary. Gábor believes the skull belongs to Matthias Corvinus, who ruled as king ofHungary and Croatiafrom 1458 to 1490. ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER CENTURIES-OLD SHIPWRECK BENEATH HISTORIC CITY: 'UNIQUE SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE' Called Matthias the Just, the medieval king is known for restructuring the Hungarian army and ushering in judicial reforms.

ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNEARTH STRANGE HEAD DEPICTING ROMAN GOD BENEATH CATHOLIC BASILICA Gábor told Fox News Digital she found an \"exceptionally high degree of morphological similarity\" between the unknown skull and the skull of Matthias Corvinus' son, János Corvinus. \"The greenish discoloration observed on the bone surface likely indicates the presence of a metal crown once worn, which left traces through oxidation.\" \"[The skull's] external characteristics are also of exceptional importance: the greenish discoloration observed on the bone surface likely indicates the presence of a metal crown once worn, which left traces through oxidation,\" Gábor said.

    "title": "How hackers are breaking into Apple devices through AirPlay",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple’s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to. Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration. Join The FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up. A person holding an iPhone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm OligorecentlydisclosedAirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device. From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance. A woman scrolling on her smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches. A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors. The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable. HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION Steps to update your iPhone’s software(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE 1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network. 2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers. 3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like cafés, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.For the best VPNsoftware, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 5) Limit device permissions and exposure:Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access. Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.

    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks deconstructs Tim Walz's 'code talking' to White men in 2024 election. Can one man represent an entire race? My skin is black — do I represent all Blacks? My good friend is white — does he represent all Whites? If we are indeed representatives of our races, do we possess superpowers of sort? Apparently, Tim Walz does. The former Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota governor was on a listening tour across the country when he stopped by Harvard's Kennedy School for a talk. He told the audience that Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate, because \"I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck (and) put them at ease.\" He added that he was the \"permission structure\" for the White man to vote for Democrats. There you have it. The self-appointed man of all White men. The one that has the \"code\" to talk to White men and command him as he may. WALZ SAYS HARRIS PICKED HIM FOR VP TO 'CODE TALK TO WHITE GUYS' It is hard to believe that such stupidity exists in the year 2025. There is no lowlier man than the one who thinks of himself in racial terms. And Walz is such a man. If you believe I am being harsh, then explain what value is to be had in thinking of oneself in racial terms? Walz was a failure since he clearly didn’t deliver the White man in enough numbers to win Harris the presidency of the land. So, I ask again what value is to be had? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Is the man so delusional that he thinks he holds a mystical grasp on whiteness? I don’t even think he thinks this far. His kind of whiteness for him is a virtue of sorts and this is precisely my point here: for him whiteness means racism. Walz’s virtue lies in believing that his white skin is racism personified and that he is guilty of all the privileges that come with it. He believes that all whites share this same guilt. Democratic presidential nominee, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz celebrate during the final day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 22, 2024, in Chicago, Illinois.(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Commentator and authorShelby Steelecalls this white guilt. But it’s not actual guilt. Rather, it is the desire to see oneself as innocent of racism — to dissociate oneself from America’s racial past. When Walz \"confesses\" to the racism of his white skin, he believes he’s achieving innocence of America’s racist past.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: What Kamala Harris buzz is telling us. Read between the lines, America",
    "article_text": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris urged her fellow Democrats to take a lesson from elephants during her first public address since leaving office on Wednesday. Are Americans ready for Biden 2.0? That’s what the country will get if they electKamala Harrispresident in 2028. During last year’s campaign, the former VP didn’t even pretend to offer the country any change of course from the disastrous Biden presidency. Harris notoriously told Sunny Hostin on The View, who asked what she might do differently from President Biden, \"There is not a thing that comes to mind.\" It was possibly the most boneheaded of all her campaign goofs. After all, Biden didn’t exactly thrill the country by allowing millions of people to enter the country illegally, adopting an expensive green agenda, embracing DEI in every federal agency or by driving inflation to multi-decade highs with excessive spending. When polling shows voters begging for change – candidates should oblige. HARRIS DRAWS SOCIAL MEDIA SCORN FOR DIGRESSION ABOUT ELEPHANTS DURING AN EARTHQUAKE It is astonishing on many fronts that a slight buzz is forming about Kamala Harris’ chances of running again for the Oval Office. It is indeed \"slight\" so far, audible mainly to campaign consultants hoping to cash in on another multi-billion run and, frankly, to gleeful Republicans who love their chances should Harris receive the Democratic nomination. Chatter about the former VP andCalifornia senatorpicked up this past week because Harris finally emerged from the witness protection program to make a speech. It was her first public appearance of note in five months. She appeared before a group supporting Emerge, a non-profit that \"provides aspiring [Democrat] women leaders with cutting-edge tools and training to run and win elected office.\"   Harris is probably not the most convincing example of Emerge’s effectiveness. After all, Harris not only lost toDonald Trump, but lost every swing state and the popular vote, despite spending over $2 billion, including monies from Super PACs. Remember that even the widely disliked Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016 by 2.3 million votes. Harris not only lost big but dragged down her party, with Democrats also losing four senate seats, and their majority. Since Harris was not deemed a successful vice president, earning negative favorability ratings for almost her entire four years in office, and given her poor showing last year, why on earth would anyone even consider giving her a second chance? Only because Democrats are in trouble. The party has no visible leadership now that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden have retired from view, Barack Obama is invisible and Chuck Schumer is fighting a possible primary challenge from New York RepresentativeAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Harris, the last credentialed national figure with substantial name recognition, is it. But the party’s woes go beyond lack of leadership. Democrats also have no message and no platform. All they have is hatred of Donald Trump. At the Emerge gathering, other than a peculiar foray into elephant behavior, Kamala Harris spent her brief appearance lambasting Trump, echoing the refrains and lies popular among his critics. She offered no new policies, no ideas how to make life better for Americans. This is not a winning formula. For all the breathless reporting on Donald Trump’s failing polls and unpopularity, the president continues to earn higher approval ratings than Democrats. A quite recent CNN/SSRS poll showed that when respondents were asked who would be doing a better job as president, 45 percent chose Trump, while 43 percent chose Harris, about in line with last year’s election results. Further, an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll from late April, reported that when respondents were asked who they trusted more to deal with the country’s main problems, 40 percent chose Trump while only 32 percent chose Democrats in Congress. In her Emerge speech, Harris revealed, unknowingly, her party’s essential problem. She mentioned being inspired \"by leaders across the spectrum, including congressional leaders, like Cory Booker, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy, Jasmine Crockett, Maxwell Frost, AOC, and Bernie Sanders, all who in different ways, have been speaking with moral clarity about this moment.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Note that the \"leaders\" cited are the most progressive members of her party. They are not speaking \"in different ways\" nor are they \"across the spectrum\"; they all parrot the same far-left tax-the-rich, Big Government nonsense that most Americans abhor. Democrats, including apparently Kamala Harris, are in thrall to the most liberal wing of their party and it will continue to cost them election victories. Unhappily for Democrats, progressives have a lock on the party’s energy and money. It is AOC and Bernie Sanders who can without embarrassment tour the country via private jet calling out \"oligarchs\", echoing earlier speeches made byBernie Sanders, who warned that billionaires were taking over the country in 1993, 1994, 1995, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and now…again, today. Sanders has been issuing the samedire alarms about oligarchs for decades, and now others have jumped on board. Elon Musk and other tech CEOs are a threat to our country, according to Sanders and his posse, but only if they support the GOP. Oligarchs like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban or George Soros, who back Democrats, evidently do not pose a threat to the nation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Harris is making a mistake tying herself to the far-left wing of her party. Gallup polling consistently shows that only a minority of the country – 25% -- considers themselves \"liberal\" or \"very liberal\", while 37% rate themselves \"conservative\" or very conservative and 34% say they are \"moderate\". How do Democrats expect to win elections if only one quarter of the country is ideologically in their corner? In 2016,Hillary Clintonlost primarily because supporters of Bernie Sanders did not come out to vote for her. In 2020, Joe Biden adopted Bernie’s platform in return for the Vermont Socialist’s support, and he won. But embracing Bernie’s fondness for the Green New Deal, open borders and attacks on the wealthy failed to put Harris over the finish line last year; it won’t push her to a win in 2028 either.

    "title": "DR. MARC SIEGEL: Trump is right to block 'dangerous' gain-of-function research",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses President Donald Trump signing an executive order banning funding for gain-of-function research. PROGRAMMING ALERT: Watch Dr. Siegel discuss this topic and more on \"Fox & Friends\" and \"America's Newsroom\" on Tuesday, May 6. Gain-of-function research has many purposes, including gauging the potential for treatment and vaccines to work against a particular pathogen. But this type of research is also used to manipulate a virus or other pathogen to test its potential to go human to human or to be deadly. And therein lies the problem. Scientists have wrestled with the consequences for decades. When Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier, Ph.D. conducted gain-of-function research in 2012 to determine the number of mutations (four) it would take for an H5N1 bird flu virus to travel human to human, it prompted none other thanDr. Anthony Faucito support an H5N1research moratoriumas a result.Yet in the years that followed, it was Fauci and others whosupportedcertain types of gain-of-function research to test a virus’ potential involving what is known as Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogens (EPPP). \"Potential pandemic pathogens (PPPs) are bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that are likely highly transmissible and capable of wide, uncontrollable spread in human populations and highly virulent, making them likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.\" But there are many problems with this approach, leading to Dr. Robert Redfield and myself tocall for a moratoriumon all this type of gain-of-function research as far back as 2021. TRUMP BANS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR 'DANGEROUS' GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH Whereas Fauci and others have relied on an international consortium of scientists, we believed then, and now, that it is impossible to verify both safety and containment outside the borders of the U.S., and many times even within these borders.  There is also the danger of a roadmap to consider, where a bioterrorist might get ahold of these plans. At the same time, with advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer analysis, there is less and less reason to believe that actual gain-of-function research involving manipulating real viruses is necessary or prudent. For years now, the vast majority of Americans have believed that COVID came from a lab in Wuhan. This consensus has only increased as intelligence agencies, including the FBI, and national public health agencies like the CDC, have put their thumbs on the scale. But it is also important to ask the follow-up question. If COVIDdidcome from a lab, then what should that mean going forward? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Doesn’t it in fact mean that there should be a moratorium placed on this kind of gain-of-function research around the world? The answer to that question is a definite yes, which is one of the reasons why the delay and obfuscation at the beginning of the pandemic in terms of origins was so harmful. That is also why PresidentDonald Trumpwas correct to issue an executive order on Monday that will block federal funding for \"dangerous\" gain-of-function research in China, Iran, and elsewhere, including the U.S., where there is \"the legitimate potential for societal harms that this kind of research poses.\" TheWhite Housefact sheet on the subject also said, \"For decades, policies overseeing gain-of-function research on pathogens, toxins, and potential pathogens have lacked adequate enforcement, transparency, and top-down oversight.\" The order will also deputize the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other agencies to identify the threat level of biological research. It also singled out the potential for lab-leak incidents for gain-of-function of function research such as those conducted by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There have beenfunding pausesplaced on gain-of-function before here, including in 2017, but they haven’t worked, either because of reversals, or ignoring of these orders both outside our borders and even within. Still, the president’s executive order on Monday is a necessary warning step. It's one step putting us out of danger versus so many other steps have already put the world directly in danger.

    "title": "Trump’s latest move proves his manufacturing Golden Age is just fools’ gold",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the Trump administration’s tariff negotiations with China and more on ‘Special Report.’ President Donald Trump continues to promisethat his tariff regime will usher in a new Golden Age for American workers with an explosion of high-paying manufacturing jobs across the Rust Belt and America.  These tariffs will certainly drive up the costs of imports, hurting American consumers. As demand for foreign goods declines, the unfairly maligned trade deficit targeted by the president may indeed narrow. But more expensive imports also guarantee the supposed manufacturing renaissance will turn out to be fools’ gold for American workers and will not boost exports. Contrary to popular belief,American exporters have enjoyeda manufacturing renaissance. Since 1994, American exports have nearly tripled, even after you adjust for inflation. Americangoods exported exceeded $2 trillionlast year. America’s aerospace industry now exports nearly $100 billion a year. The American automotive sector exports more than $160 billion annually, nearly doubling in inflation-adjusted terms since 1994. American soybean farmers supply livestock around the globe with feed. Each of these export-intensive sectors stands to lose jobs due to these tariffs. US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SAYS IT’S A MATTER OF ‘WEEKS’ BEFORE NEW TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENTS First, don’t expect an overall gain in American manufacturing jobs. Certainly, individual companies may benefit. A tariff on steel might save a few jobs at a specific steel mill. But the cost for every American manufacturer using this higher-priced domestic steel will also increase. President Donald Trump holds a tariff chart comparing the U.S. and other nations.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) American manufacturing relies on a complex global supply chain utilizing imported parts. Automakers, construction firms and appliance makers all must pass this cost along — sometimes cutting wages or even jobs to stay afloat. Numerous American companies have already begun laying off American workers in response to the tariffs, including at five Stellantis plants. Currently, up to 30% of North American auto production may be temporarily halted due to the tariff uncertainty. These headlines will become routine if the trade war continues. American manufacturers, who export their American-made goods to the rest of the world, will fall behind as their input costs increase. This danger compounds as other nations retaliate against us by imposing their own barriers. As American exporters find their market shares shrinking and costs rising, American companies will see their profits plunge and American jobs vanish. Second, the limited tariff-created manufacturing jobs will not be better paid jobs. Good-paying jobs are contingent on productivity. Higher tariffs lower labor productivity as less efficient businesses are protected from competition. Thanks largely to the innovation and efficiencies from free trade, our jobs market has diversified away from a concentration of jobs in a lower-paying, physically demanding industry. The burgeoning sectors have supplied tens of millions of Americans with opportunities in safer professions. Productivity overall of workers doubled in just the past 40 years. It’s not just investors or managers who benefit as resources yield more output. Workers share in this abundance of affordable, available and diverse goods. Our so-called \"trade deficit\" has largely enabled this boom in newer, more productive jobs. The surplus dollars overseas generated by us importing more than we export flow back to the United States often in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) in businesses here — exploding more than 500% compared to thirty years ago to more than $330 billion last year. If the president succeeds at eliminating this trade deficit, workers employed in these new jobs will suffer as foreign direct dries up. Economic distortion caused by tariffs will shift jobs and resources to industries in which we lack a comparative economic advantage. As government policies deploy resources to less efficient businesses, more individuals will be forced to take these less desirable jobs. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer poses with Tandy Jeckel, owner of TandyWear, at her flagship store in Commack, Long Island, NY, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Jeckel is a Trump voter who is unhappy with the raising of tariffs.(Rashid Umar Abbasi for Fox News Digital) The overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs. Contrast this world of fewer, lower-paying jobs with a competitive environment which ensures that over time, each employee can produce more without working more. Business owners, employees and consumers all benefit. Higher prices on imported goods will not magically make American manufacturers more efficient or innovative. Quite the inverse! By shielding them from competition, these businesses will grow complacent — with less incentive to improve, cut costs, and deliver better products at lower prices. As productivity declines, the standard of living for workers will also decline. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The ingredients for a flourishing manufacturing sector are lower regulations, lower taxes and more freedom to trade with others. In fact, many jobs returned to the USA after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) because America became more competitive with the rest of the world. Embracing even part of this recipe has created a \"Golden Age\" for the past 40 years. Millions of people who would have previously worked in lower-paying factory jobs, now work in higher-paying, advanced services. In fact, we now export far more of these services than we import. For this reason, the typical American family enjoys an annual income $26,000 greater than just one generation ago. A record percentage of young adults are participating in our stronger economy. Tariffs are a roadblock to prosperity, not a highway. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs. We’ve been here before: Look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. It was meant to protect American industry, but it prolonged the Great Depression by choking global trade. The layoffs, price hikes, financial carnage and cratering approval ratings caused by this historic tax increase may cajole the president into soon relenting. If not, the promised manufacturing jobs will come at the expense of jobs elsewhere and be far fewer in number than promised. We will produce less, consume less and earn less. The Golden Age will deliver nothing but fools’ gold: Politically caused scarcity in an age of abundance. Joel Griffith is a senior fellow at Advancing American Freedom.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: 'REAL ID' is coming for you",
    "article_text": "State assemblymember Nancy Muñoz, R-Union, and Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Ky., discuss some citizens delaying and opting out of getting the REAL ID as the deadline approaches. It is my second trip to the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles in four days. I admit from the start it is my fault that I had to make two trips. When I traveled two weeks ago, the friendly TSA agents reminded me —repeatedly— that come May 7, I would need to bring my passport as my valid Virginia driver’s license was non-compliant with theREAL ID Act. I was vaguely aware that the push for new \"REAL\" IDs was back, the requirement to obtain one having been suspended during Covid, but unaware that thedeadline loomed. So last Thursday I trekked to my local DMV office, bringing along my current, valid, Virginia driver’s license, my current, valid passport, my Social Security Card and my birth certificate. Surely, I supposed, that would be enough as I’d been assured I could fly with just the passport by the helpful Team TSA. REAL ID REJECTION BY AMERICANS MAY COME DOWN TO ONE SURPRISING FACTOR I definitely needed the new license because, while a \"REAL ID is an optional, upgraded version of your driver’s license or ID card that has a star in the right corner,\" I had no star and no desire to carry my passport everywhere. Not surprisingly, a lot of people want to get their\"REAL ID\" for as the VA DMV helpfully alerts you: \"Beginning May 7, 2025, the federal government will require you to present a REAL ID compliant driver's license or ID card, or another federally approved form of ID, in order to board a domestic flight or enter a secure federal facility or military base (some military bases may already require REAL ID or a federally approved form of ID*).\" The DMV opens at 8 AM, so I rolled up last Thursday at 7:30 AM. The line was already more than a dozen people long. An hour later more than 50 good folks were standing in the rope line waiting for one of the three DMV employees assigned to the REAL ID processing. The average processing time was 15 minutes —at the head of the line. You may want to pack a lunch if you get there at official opening time. It had not occurred to DMV to perhaps add some staff forREAL ID deadline days, or reassign others from the standard busy work. No. Just three DMVers on Thursday and three again on Monday. I’d flunked REAL ID eligibility last week because none of my current documents list my home address. I use a P.O. Box for a variety of reasons on my driver’s license and had —wrongfully it turns out— thought that as a passport could get me on the plane, my passport plus my driver’s license, birth certificate and Social Security card should serve to secure my star, right? Wrong. I needed a utility bill or a mortgage statement or a voter registration card with my home address on it. When I smiled my mild protest that, as a valid passport is sufficient to board a plane, why would it not be sufficient to obtain my \"REAL ID\" I got the DMV look back. It’s the same look at every DMV everywhere. She had heard it all before, but it says on the VIrginia DMV website that I needed documents with my home address. Hadn’t I read the DMV website? Ms. DMV sent me home in search of \"secondary documents\" with my physical address on it. \"Your house deed will work\" she helpfully offered. I dutifully trooped off to my Registrar of Voters and got a voter card with myhome addresson it. I added a print out of a utility bill and a print out of my mortgage and returned three days later. And held my breath. The young’n in front of me was getting shot down and was not happy. He’d taken off work. He’d just moved here. He worked remotely and didn’t have a boss who could write him a letter with his home address on it. He hadn’t opened a bank account. There were unhappy Virginia drivers at windows two and three as well, perplexed that their state government was making it difficult for them to get a new version of their perfectly legal driver’s license. Expressing dismay at a DMV counter is a rookie mistake. Never, ever express unhappiness or dissatisfaction of any sort with anyone at any DMV. Ever. It will become a mark in your permanent record, and while nothing else moves quickly among the nation’s DMVs, word of troublemakers challenge light speed in their travels. My advice is based on experience with four state DMVs and the District of Columbia DMV (the latter is where crying citizens can be seen on an almost on-demand basis.) So having obtained the paperwork and a promise that the new license would be sent —to my P.O. Box, of course— I decided to search out the original reason for \"Real ID.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Turns out that \"The REAL ID Act\" was passed in 2005, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission to set federal standards for state-issued identification. 2005! Now, it’s been 20 years since the law passed and almost 24 since 9/11, so the next question is \"Why the urgency now?\" As far as I can tell from the Transportation Security Agency website, the May 7 deadline is now because it is – there had to be a deadline sometime. It’s the same reason that octogenarians are routinely pulled aside for special screening because the buzzer sounds at the TSA station. Doesn’t matter if you have \"TSA-pre\" or \"Clear\" or have zero luggage and not even a sweater. The buzzer is the virtual guillotine, and there are Madame Defarges everywhere to enforce the buzzer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Here’s the good news. If you entered the country without permission but obtained \"Temporary Protected Status\" under one of the Biden-era machinations, you too can get a \"REAL ID: \"Yes, a TPS beneficiary or individual with a pending TPS application can obtain a REAL ID compliant license or identification card: \"The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain designated countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS.\" Such folks are eligible for REAL ID. Good to know that. But better to know the passport that will get you on to the plane come Wednesday will not get you a REAL ID. Forewarned is forearmed.

The company said Tuesday it expects to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 EVs by the end of 2025. That’s despite Rivian sayingone month agothat it was still holding to its estimate of delivering 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles across this year. Rivian raised its capital expenditure guidance to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion due to the expected impact from tariffs. The company’s previous capex guidance was between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion,according to its 2024 shareholder letter. Rivian’s earnings announcement comes days after both Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump’s tariffs. Ford said it expects the tariffs to add $2.5 billion in costs across 2025, while GM told investors it expects the impact to be around $5 billion. Rivian warned investors in February that “changes to government policies and regulations, and a challenging demand environment” could threaten demand for its vehicles. Things could only get more challenging if the Trump administration, Congress, or bothdecide to killthe $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. Delivering fewer than 46,000 EVs would be a step back for the electric automaker, as the company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024 and 50,122 in 2023. The company’s more affordable R2 SUV, which it expects to deliver in greater numbers, won’t come until 2026. The company said Tuesday that it was able to generate $206 million of gross profit in the first quarter of 2025 on 8,640 deliveries. It was the second straight quarter the company was able to generate gross profit. This first-quarter gross profit was particularly important because it met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker. While gross profit may look good on the balance sheet, net income provides a more realistic view of costs. The company reported a net income loss of $541 million in the quarter, a considerable improvement from the $1.4 billion in losses in the same year-ago period. Automotive revenue shrank to $922 million from $1.12 billion in the first quarter of 2024, although total revenues were up slightly year-over-year thanks to a boost from sales of the company’s software and services. Total software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2025 were $318 million, nearly a fourfold increase from the $88 million in the same period last year. Rivian credited the increase to its new vehicle electrical architecture and software development services, increased remarketing sales, and an increase in repair and maintenance services.

On Tuesday, after a five-year legal battle, a jury ruled that NSO Group must pay $167,254,000 in punitive damages and around $444,719 in compensatory damages. This is a huge legal win for WhatsApp, whichhad asked for more than $400,000in compensatory damages, based on the time its employees had to dedicate to remediate the attacks, investigate them, and push fixes to patch the vulnerability abused by NSO Group, as well as unspecified punitive damages. WhatsApp’s spokesperson Zade Alsawah said in a statement that “our court case has made history as the first victory against illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone.” Alsawah said the ruling “is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone. Today, the jury’s decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.” NSO Group’s spokesperson Gil Lainer left the door open for an appeal. “We will carefully examine the verdict’s details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal,” Lainer said in a statement. The trial, as well as the whole lawsuit, prompted a series of revelations, such asthe location of the victims of the 2019 spyware campaign, as well asthe names of some of NSO Group’s customers. The ruling marks the end — pending a potential appeal — of a legal battle that started in more than five years ago, whenWhatsApp filed a lawsuit against the spyware maker. The Meta-owned company accused NSO Group of accessing WhatsApp servers and exploitingan audio-calling vulnerabilityin the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists.

Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, explained the lawsuit’s reasoningin a Washington Post op-edat the time, where he said that “this should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all Internet users. Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk.” Last December,WhatsApp won. Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who presided over the case, ruled that NSO Group was liable for breaching federal and California hacking laws in its 2019 spyware campaign against the 1,400 WhatsApp users. The judge ruled that NSO Group was also liable for breaching WhatsApp’s terms of service, which prohibit the use of the app for malicious purposes. Cathcart celebrated the December rulingsaying in an X postthat it was “a huge win for privacy,” and that “surveillance companies should be on notice that illegal spying will not be tolerated.” At that point, the case moved on to a jury trial to determine what damages the spyware company owed WhatsApp, which has now concluded. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, where he has studied the spyware industry for more than a decade, celebrated the ruling. “This is an incredible moment for those of us who have been around since the beginning of research on mercenary spyware,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “NSO makes many millions of dollars helping dictators hack people. After years of every trick and delay tactic it only took the jury a day’s deliberation to see right through to the heart of the matter: NSO’s business is based on hacking American companies…so that dictators can hack dissidents.” “The company emerges from this trial severely damaged. Aside from the huge punitive damages, the bigger impact of this case has also been a huge blow to NSO’s efforts to hide their business activities,” said Scott-Railton.

In recent weeks, a key federal office for AI research, the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), has been hit bysteep budget reductions. Meanwhile, scores of staffers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which houses TIP, have found themselves on the chopping block. In itsproposed budget for fiscal year 2026, the Trump administration is calling on Congress to slash over half of the NSF’s funding, eliminating what it describes as wasteful and “woke” spending. At risk are thebillions of dollarsawarded to AI R&D projects by the NSF and other federal agencies, like the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy, which are also facing cuts. Trump has also threatened to end the CHIPS Act, a major Biden administration-era law that sought to boost domestic semiconductor production in the U.S., including the production of specialized chips for AI. The office responsible for administering CHIPS Act funds waslargely gutted in early March. Tech industry groups, including the Software and Information Industry Association, have sent letters to White House AI “czar” David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warning that the reductions could hobble America’s global leadership in AI.According to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, federally funded research yields annual returns of 25% to 40%, comparing favorably tothe 15% to 27% returns achieved by top-quartile VC funds. “We believe that [federal R&D funding] right now [is] happening at close to historic lows in terms of percentage of GDP,” Krishna told TechCrunch, “and that more federally funded R&D has an incredibly positive effect on the economy, on economic growth, on the competitiveness of the United States, and also in investing in many technologies that are essential for our future.” IBM has been directly affected by federal cutbacks. During its Q1 earnings call in April, the companyrevealedthat 15 of its federal contracts were canceled, amounting to $100 million in future payments. Federal contracts represent between 5% and just under 10% of IBM’s consulting practice. Krishna, who was quick to note that federal funding makes up only a fraction of IBM’s overall business, said that he’s “optimistic” the government will ramp up R&D spending within a year. “I will tell you I expect that in a year … federally funded R&D for AI, for quantum, for semiconductors — I expect it to be in as good or in a better shape than it is today,” Krishna said.

Thelarge-scale experimentwas designed to explore just how persuasive AI can be. The bots posted over 1,700 comments, adopting personas like abuse survivors or controversial identities like an anti-Black Lives Matter advocate. For Reddit, the incident was a mini-nightmare. Reddit’s brand is associated with authenticity — a place where real people come to share real opinions. If that human-focused ecosystem is disturbed withAI slopor becomes a place where people can’t trust that they’re getting information from actual humans, it could do more than threaten Reddit’s core identity. Reddit’s bottom line could be at stake, since the company nowsells its content to OpenAI for training. The company condemned the “improper and highly unethical experiment” and filed a complaint with the university that ran it. But that experiment was only one of what will likely be many instances of generative AI bots pretending to be humans on Reddit for a variety of reasons, from the scientific to the politically manipulative. To protect users from bot manipulation and “keep Reddit human,” the company has quietly signaled an upcoming action — one that may be unpopular with users who come to Reddit for another reason: anonymity. On Monday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffmanshared in a postthat Reddit would start working with “various third-party services” to verify a user’s humanity. This represents a significant step for a platform that has historically required almost no personal information for users to create an account. “To keep Reddit human and to meet evolving regulatory requirements, we are going to need a little more information,” Huffman wrote. “Specifically, we will need to know whether you are a human, and in some locations, if you are an adult. But we never want to know your name or who you are.” (Social media companies have already started implementing ID checks after at least nine states and the U.K. and passed laws mandating age verification to protect children on their platforms.) A Reddit spokesperson declined to explain under what circumstances the company would require users to go through a verification process, though they did confirm that Reddit already takes measures to ban “bad” bots. The spokesperson also wouldn’t share more details about which third-party services the company would use or what kind of personally identifying information users would have to offer up. Many companies today rely on verification platforms like Persona, Alloy, Stripe Identity, Plaid, and Footprint, which usually require a government-issued ID to verify age and humanity. Then there’s the newer and more speculative tech, like Sam Altman’s Tools for Humanity and itseye-scanning “proof of human” device. Opponents to ID checks say there are data privacy and security risks to sharing your personal information with social media platforms. That’s especially true for a platform like Reddit, where people come to post experiences they maybe never would have if their names were attached to them. It’s not difficult to imagine a world in which authorities might subpoena Reddit for the identity of, for example, a pregnant teen asking about abortion experiences on r/women in states where it is now illegal. Just look howMeta handed over private conversationsbetween a Nebraska woman and her 17-year-old daughter, which discussed the latter’s plans to terminate a pregnancy. Meta’s assistance led law enforcement to acquire a search warrant, which resulted in felony charges for both the mother and daughter. That’s exactly the risk Reddit hopes to avoid by tapping outside firms to provide “the essential information and nothing else,” per Huffman, who emphasized that “we never want to know your name or who you are.” “Anonymity is essential to Reddit,” he said. The CEO also noted that Reddit would continue to be “extremely protective of your personal information” and “will continue to push back against excessive or unreasonable demands from public or private authorities.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Previously, on version 125.4.1 of Patreon’s iOS app, users who wanted to subscribe to a creator’s membership plan would have to do so using Apple’s in-app purchases. See below: In the updated version released on Monday (version 125.5.0), users now have the option of making a purchase via the web, where they can choose to pay with other payment methods, including credit cards, Venmo, and PayPal, as well as with Apple Pay. The option to use Apple’s own in-app purchases method, meanwhile, is shown only in very small text below the larger, bold “Join” button. This change will likely direct more customers to pay via Patreon’s website instead of through Apple’s in-app purchases. Reached for comment, Patreon confirmed the app update was approved and is now rolling out to U.S. users. Users who update their app should see the new checkout experience within 24 hours, the company told TechCrunch. However, the company earlier said it had submitted an update to Apple for approval that would allow for web payments and was waiting for the update to be approved. These changes follow a significant win in a legal battle fought by Fortnite maker Epic Games that impacts how app developers can process payments on iOS. On April 30,a U.S. court ruled that Appleis no longer allowed to prevent app developers from linking to alternative payment mechanisms from inside their apps while still collecting a commission. As a result, Apple was required toupdate its App Store developer guidelinesfor U.S. developers and accept newly revamped apps, likeSpotifyand theAmazon Kindleapp, which now link to external websites where consumers can choose to pay the app publishers directly. Patreon was alsoquick to celebrate the winat the time, noting creators would now be able to keep more of their money if they didn’t have to pay Apple its commission on purchases. Inanother recent update shared with its community,Patreon said its subscription billing transition plan is being put on hold. Last August, Patreon said Applehad given it a deadline to switch all creators to Apple’s iOS in-app purchase systemby November 2025 or risk removal from the App Store. Now, the company believes this change will no longer be necessary. “This is still a developing situation, but we are moving forward under the assumption that the November 2025 deadline for all Patreon creators to switch to subscription billing is no longer necessary,” the company said in an update toa support documentand in a Discord post shared with its creators. “While additional information may come that alters Apple’s requirements for Patreon’s iOS app, we are optimistic that this ruling will give us additional flexibility in how we support creators on legacy billing models. However, for now, creators still need to be on subscription billing to be able to accept payments through the Patreon iOS app,” the post states. In the meantime, Patreon is still offering to help any creators who want to move to subscription billing.

The April 8 crash, which involved an unoccupied Zoox vehicle and a passenger car, prompted the company to issue a recall for about 270 vehicles equipped with a specific version of its automated driving system. The recall number doesn’t reflect the full fleet size, according to Zoox. The recall was issued over concerns the self-driving software could inaccurately predict the movement of another vehicle and increase the risk of a crash. The company said no injuries were reported and minor damage occurred to both vehicles. The crash occurred after a passenger car quickly approached the lane from a commercial driveway where the purpose-built robotaxi was traveling,according to Zoox. The Zoox vehicle, which inaccurately predicted that the passenger car would proceed, slowed down and steered to the right. Instead, “the car came to a stop, fully yielding to the Zoox robotaxi and remaining in the shoulder lane,” according to the company. “The Zoox robotaxi braked hard, but contact was unavoidable,” the company wrote in its blog post.Zoox said it paused all driverless testing operations on April 8 — the day of the crash — and launched an internal review. Operations resumed after a software update was released to all Zoox vehicles on April 17, according to areport submittedto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The crash, and voluntary recall, comes as Zoox pushes to launch a commercial robotaxi service in Las Vegas. A company spokesperson confirmed that Zoox is still planning to launch that service later this year. The company has been testing its self-driving system in retrofitted Toyota Highlanders and its custom-built robotaxis, which don’t have a steering wheel or pedals in various cities, notably along the Las Vegas Strip and in certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Earlier this year, Zoox allowed employees, media, and other vetted guests totry the service. The company is also testing in Austin, Miami, and Seattle using Highlanders with human safety operators behind the wheel. This is the second Zoox recall this year. In March, the companyissued a voluntary recallfor 258 vehicles due to issues with its autonomous driving system that could cause unexpected hard braking. Last year, the NHTSA conducted apreliminary investigationinto the company after the agency received two reports of incidents in which motorcyclists collided with the back of Toyota Highlanders equipped with Zoox technology. The initial investigation found that in both cases, the Zoox vehicles were operating with their autonomous systems engaged.

The new tool comes just a week after FutureHouselaunched its API and platform. The tool, called Finch, takes in biology data (primarily in the form of research papers) and a prompt (e.g. “What can you tell me about molecular drivers of cancer metastasis?”) and runs code before generating figures and inspecting the results. In aseries of posts on X, FutureHouse co-founder and CEO Sam Rodriques compared it to a “1st yr grad student.” “[B]eing able to [do all] this in minutes is a superpower,” Rodriques wrote. “[Finch] actually ends up finding some really cool stuff […] For our own projects internally, we have found it to be pretty awesome.” In addition to open-ended analysis, Finch can also do directed data analysis. In this example, we had it do a differential expression and functional enrichment analysis of some RNAseq data (GEO accession GSE87466). It identifies upregulated genes (e.g. inflammatory modulators,…pic.twitter.com/phRybhTVpb FutureHouse’s proposition, like that ofmany,manystartupsand tech giants, is that Finch and other AI tools will someday automate steps in the scientific process. In an essay earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said “superintelligent” AI tools could “massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation.” Similarly, the CEO of Anthropic, which just this week launched an“AI for science” program, has boldly predicted that AI couldhelp formulate cures for most cancers. Yet evidence is lacking.Many researchers don’t consider AI today to be especially usefulin guiding the scientific process. Tellingly, FutureHouse has yet to achieve a scientific breakthrough or make a novel discovery with its AI tools. Biology, particularly on the drug discovery side, is an attractive target for AI companies. Precedence Researchestimatesthe market was worth $65.88 billion in 2024 and could reach $160.31 billion by 2034. While there have been some successes, AI hasn’t provided an immediate magical solution in the lab. Several firms employing AI for drug discovery, including Exscientia andBenevolentAI, have sufferedhigh-profileclinical trial failuresin recent years. Meanwhile, the accuracy of leading AI systems for drug discovery, like Google DeepMind’sAlphaFold 3,tends to vary widely. Finch similarly makes “silly mistakes,” Rodriques said — which is why FutureHouse is recruiting bioinformaticians and computational biologists to help evaluate its accuracy and reliability and train it while it’s in closed beta.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber announced its third partnership with a Chinese autonomous vehicle company this week, revealing the ride-hail and delivery giant’s appetite for global domination in the emerging robotaxi sector. Uber said Tuesday it would work with Guangzhou-based Pony AI, which late last year went public on the Nasdaq at a$5.25 billion valuation, to launch robotaxis on the Uber platform in “a key market in the Middle East” later this year. The Pony tie-up comes a day after Uber shared plans for two other strategic deals with Chinese firms: Momenta and WeRide. Uber said it would work withMomentato launch robotaxis on its app in Europe in 2026, and withWeRideto expand into 15 cities across the Middle East and Europe over the next five years. Uber and WeRide have already launched acommercial robotaxi servicein Abu Dhabi. The deals with Pony, Momenta, and WeRide add to Uber’s growing list of more than 15 autonomous vehicle partnerships across ride-hail, delivery, and freight. Most of Uber’s partners, which include Waymo and May Mobility, are based in the U.S., with a few outliers like the U.K.’s Wayve. As Uber faces perceived threats from companies like Tesla, which intends to launch its firstrobotaxi service in Austinnext month, federal probes for allegedlymisleading subscription practices, and an expected consumer spending pullback in 2025, the company is moving fast to reassure investors that there’s still plenty of room for expansion. Pairing up with Chinese companies could be a smart way to achieve that growth. Chinese AV firms are already expanding internationally. Aside from Abu Dhabi, WeRide is operating commercial services in Beijing and France, and testing in several other markets across China and Europe. Pony offers paid robotaxi rides in three Chinese cities and recently began testing in Luxembourg. Waymo, the only AV company in the U.S. that’s operating a commercial, driverless service today, has only just begundata collection in Tokyo. Pony’s partnership with Uber opens up the firm to the Middle Eastern market. Uber already had a strong presence in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — a presence that expanded in 2019 whenUber acquired its Middle Eastern rival Careem. In a press release, Pony said the goal of its Uber’s deal is to scale deployment to additional “international markets” in the future. As with Uber’s other launches, when Pony joins the app, Uber customers will have the option to have their trip fulfilled by an AV. During the initial pilot phase, the vehicles will have a safety operator onboard until the companies’ full commercial launch. Uber’s first-quarter earnings call is this week, so we’ll likely get more color on the company’s plans for growth — including its move to acquire acontrolling stake in a Turkish food delivery company— and how it plans to navigate current challenges.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us OpenAI said on Monday it is pursuing a new restructuring plan after conversations with Delaware’s and California’s attorneys general, both of whom were closely watching as OpenAI tried to break free of its odd corporate structure. Currently, OpenAI’s nonprofit board governs the organization’s for-profit operations. Under the new plan, OpenAI’s for-profit arm will become a public benefit corporation (PBC) but will still be controlled by OpenAI’s nonprofit. The new restructuring plan may be enough to appease regulators and OpenAI’s investors, who’vepoured billions into the companyin expectation of a return someday. But it could also throw a wrench into OpenAI’s future plans, particularly if the company seeks to one day go public. Last December, OpenAI outlined a path that would’ve allowed it to spin its for-profit arm out from under the control of its nonprofit board, which is bound by certain obligations, including a clause in its charter to ensure thatartificial general intelligence(AGI) benefits all humanity. That plan went out the window on Monday. Now OpenAI intends to have its nonprofit control and be a large shareholder of the aforementioned PBC. Besides allowing OpenAI to operate more like a conventional company, a simpler structure could open the door to OpenAI raising additional capital by going public via an IPO. Given OpenAI’s scale,the huge amount of cash it burns, and the public’s massive interest, an IPO seems like something OpenAI might eventually explore. Stephen Diamond, a corporate governance professor at Santa Clara University, told TechCrunch there’s a very narrow path to OpenAI becoming a public company under its newly proposed transition plan. While nonprofits can’t go public, PBCs can. However, thereisa question as to what OpenAI’s PBC would own were OpenAI to IPO. “My sense is there’s enormous intellectual property value at the OpenAI nonprofit level,” said Diamond in an interview. “But if the PBC doesn’t own and control the core IP, but are just licensed to use it, then what’s the IPO? That’s the challenge.” Diamond noted that we don’t know the exact details of OpenAI’s plan and that it’s unclear if it’ll even be successful in the end. In an email to TechCrunch, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said OpenAI’s nonprofit will continue to control the company’s technology and that while OpenAI has no intention of going public at this time, an IPO would be “theoretically” possible under the proposed structure. If OpenAI’s nonprofit really is in control of the organization’s critical technology, shareholders wouldn’t have much of a say in the company’s decisions, said Rose Chan Loui, the founding executive director for UCLA’s Law Program on Philanthropy and Nonprofits. Unlike buying stock in a typical company, shareholders in OpenAI would have to know that their influence over the corporation is limited. “I think an IPO is much harder in this scenario,” said Loui in an interview with TechCrunch. OpenAI has been squeezed on all ends during its attempted restructuring. Just last week, a group of former OpenAI employees asked California’s and Delaware’s attorneys general to block the startup’s conversion, claimingit was at odds with OpenAI’s charitable roots.Both attorneys general told TechCrunch that they’re reviewing OpenAI’s new plan. OpenAI’s proposal also needs to appease the company’s largest private investors, including Microsoft and SoftBank, whosemultibillion-dollar investmentsreportedlyhinge on OpenAI getting some sort of restructuring over the finish line. OpenAI’s new plan gives the company a more conventional capital structure, meaning employees, investors, and the nonprofit will hold equity directly. Microsoft has not yet given its blessing to OpenAI over the new corporate structure,Bloomberg reportedon Monday. The cloud provider wants to ensure the new structure adequately protects its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. It’s unclear if other key stakeholders have approved the deal. No one has put more pressure on OpenAI’s restructuring than Elon Musk. The billionaire who co-founded OpenAI and now competes with it through his AI startup xAI submitted a $97 billion takeover bid to raise the price of OpenAI’s nonprofit assets andgum up the ChatGPT maker’s for-profit transition. Musk has also made OpenAI’s restructuring a focal point in his lawsuit against the startup and Microsoft. At its core, Musk’s lawsuit accuses OpenAI of abandoning its nonprofit mission to develop AGI and distribute it broadly. Last week,a federal judge denied several of OpenAI’s motionsto dismiss claims in Musk’s suit. According to Diamond, this was a modest win for Musk and may have played a role in OpenAI’s changing course. However, in a briefing with members of the press on Monday, Altmanreportedly deniedthe suit had any impact on OpenAI’s plans. Marc Toberoff, Musk’s lead counsel in his case against OpenAI, told TechCrunch the new corporate restructuring plan “changes nothing,” implying that Musk won’t be so quick to drop the case.

    "title": "Can the Cadillac Celestiq EV make GM’s luxury brand great again? Don’t rule it out",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Nearly three years after unveiling the concept version of the flagship Cadillac Celestiq EV, GM has finally released the real thing: a “mid-$300,000” electric vehicle that oozes luxury and a come-gawk-at-me exterior designed to lure in passersby. But is this bespoke EV enough for Cadillac toregain its positionas the “Standard of the World”? I spent a day navigating this behemoth around Los Angeles in a bid to find out. Sliding behind the steering wheel of the new flagship fastback is a good start. I am surrounded by buttery leather — my rear end comforted by the cushy seat, which is adjustable in every way and then some. The fit and finish is precise and elevated like a Richard Mille watch and everything I touch has that distinct honed-by-hand aesthetic. And yet in 115 cases, those parts have been 3D printed, including the center of the steering wheel, window switches, parts of the console decor, and even some structural pieces. Cadillac clearly wanted to build an EV with zero compromises. The battery pack layout, however, presented certain design challenges. The modules in the Cadillac Celestiq’s battery pack aren’t uniform. Unlike the Lyriq, which has a flat battery pack, the Celestiq has different configurations of modules in the battery pack that are different heights. The modules under the front seats are about nine inches tall, but the ones under the rear passenger footwell are only six inches in height. The rear seats are brought up with modules that are 12 inches tall. Engineers needed to place some modules under the center console to get to a 111 kWh battery with 303 miles of range. The result is a shallow storage compartment that’s hardly big enough to fit my wallet and glasses. The looks I received while piloting the Celestiq made up for that teeny center console storage. There is nothing on the road that looks this graceful, with its dancing LED light signature in the front, long nose, and sculpted rear end. In a town full of manufactured beauty, the real-deal Celestiq stands out. I start off on the rough streets of Hollywood, where I intentionally aim for broken pavement and manhole covers. My tester is shod with 22-inch wheels — although 23-inch wheels are available — and Michelin Pilot Sport EV tires with very little sidewall. Having this little rubber between the car and the pavement often results in a harsh ride, but the Celestiq sports a compliant air suspension that keeps it all in check. Bigger events like potholes certainly make their presence known, but city driving is quiet and smooth. Make no mistake,this car is a biggun. The Cadillac Celestiq has a larger footprint than a two-door Chevrolet Silverado, made slightly more nimble with rear steering. Sure, it’s a bit hard to find street parking in this bad boy, but this car is more likely to find itself at the valet. Leaving Hollywood, I head to the hills to see just what 655 horsepower and 646 pound-feet of torque can do on a curvy road. Here the Magnetic Ride Control shines, reacting quickly to the road as well as the car’s weight transfer to provide a confident feeling of control. Aided by active roll control, the car feels flat through the turns despite its zaftig proportions. The steering here is a bit numb, but it’s weighted nicely and the brake regen provides a new skill to conquer. I find that at max regen, if I can time my throttle lifts right, I never have to hit the mechanical brakes before heading into a corner. The weight still transfers to the front so I have the grip to turn, but I’m also getting free electrons at the same time. I love it. I crank up the Dolby Atmos sound system pouring out of 38 internal AKG speakers — there are four outside the car that produce cool EV sounds for those unlucky enough to be walking — and head out to the highway. Of course, GM’s Super Cruise advanced driver-assistance system is here, so I take my hands off the wheel and let the car take over for a while in traffic. And therein lies the biggest problem with the Celestiq. I’m not necessarily mad that all GM electric vehicles run Google Built-In over Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Google Maps is great in this vehicle, accurately predicting my range when I arrive at a location, offering up charging stations and preconditioning the batteries if needed. It’s just that I can’t reliably get the system to hook up with my phone for hands-free texts and phone calls. And it’s not just in the Celestiq. In both the Optiq and the Escalade IQ, the process was persnickety. There are multiple settings on my iPhone that have to be correct, sometimes I have to reconnect if I turn off the car, and a few times it just refuses to tell me I have an incoming text. High-end customers demand simplicity and ease of use. This smartphone integration system is neither. But at least the screens look great. Stretching across the width of the dash, there are 55 inches of high-resolution goodness. The passenger gets their own screen for streaming media and internet browsing and all climate controls are on a smaller screen below the dash. I would give my kingdom for some physical HVAC buttons, but on a car like this I’ll settle for a separate screen where at least I don’t have to scroll through a bunch of menus just to turn on the air-conditioning. Massaging seats are here, of course, and they seem to stay on a bit longer than in other luxury vehicles I’ve driven. There is no heated and cooled cup holder, an omission I think is tantamount to forgetting to serve crème fraîche with your caviar, but Cadillac told me it could add the feature if someone really wanted it. I dig the glass roof that can dim up to 20% opacity in any of the four zones. Each person in the car can customize how much light they want to let into their part of the vehicle. I’m not 100% sold on the power doors, as my mind just goes to the worst-case scenario of being stuck inside the car in the Whole Foods parking lot or something. Still, it’s kind of cool to just press the brake pedal and have my door close automatically. There is also an icon on the lower screen that will close the doors, so passengers can get in on the high-tech, low-effort bandwagon. Each Celestiq will be made by hand at General Motors’ Global Technical Center in Michigan. I got a little taste of what customers will experience as I worked with a designer to select my favorite colors and materials. Choosing from what might have been 50 shades of everything was a bit overwhelming, but I walked out with my dream Celestiq in Kingfisher Tricoat, a brilliant blue that I think goes well with the long wheelbase and fastback profile, and an interior of Sheer Gray and Bahia Orange with Phantom Blue Accents. What can I say? I dig blue and orange. As the day progressed, I was treated to the Cadillac concierge service that customers will experience as they go through the buying process. Someone made sure I always had a cold Diet Dr Pepper in my hand and lunch options were tailored to my immature culinary tastes. In other words, I had tater tots for lunch and I’m not even embarrassed about it. While Celestiq customers will likely use their concierge to field logistics requests and not request copious amounts of carbs and caffeine, the point is that they will have someone to cater to their every car-buying whim. There isn’t too much out there in the uber-luxury EV market. The Cadillac Celestiq’s primary competition might be the Rolls-Royce Spectre EV with its cool starry-night headliner. Still, the Celestiq mostly sits alone in the ultra-luxury, battery-electric sector. Bentley doesn’t have a full battery-electric offering yet, just hybrids, and even Mercedes hasn’t fully electrified the Maybach S-Class sedan, although you can get a Maybach EQS SUV. If you want one in your garage, well, good luck. Cadillac will produce a limited run of 25 vehicles for 2025 and nearly all are spoken for. The company won’t give specific numbers for 2026, only saying that production will be capped atless than two Celestiqs a day. Topics © 2025 TechCrunch Media LLC.",

On Tuesday, the company announced the launch of the newParticle.newswebsite that connects news consumers with headlines and AI summaries from a variety of sources, plus the ability to delve into various categories like Technology, Sports, Entertainment, Politics, Science, Crime, Economics, and Video Games, in addition to browsing the day’s most popular stories on the home page. The company thinks that bringing its product to the web will help to reach more readers, giving them a different way to keep up with the news using AI technology enhancements. Like the existing Particle mobile app, the site offers AI tools designed to help consumers better understand the news. Instead of just summarizing stories into key bullet points for quicker reading, Particle also extracts key quotes and allows users to ask questions about the story via an AI chatbot. These questions and answers from users are available on the new website, but the site doesn’t yet offer the ability to interact with the AI directly. While reading the news on Particle, if you want to learn more about a topic, you can access “entity pages” that detail information about a specific person, product, or organization mentioned in the story. For instance, when you see the word “Trump” or “Knicks” or “Nintendo Switch” highlighted in a headline or news summary, you can click through to a page offering basic information pulled from Wikipedia and links to more stories about the subject. Particle also highlights the news outlets covering a story by sharing links to their stories directly alongside its AI summaries. In early tests on mobile, the company found that readers were clicking through to the publishers’ sites via these links, leading Particle to begin partnering with specific publishers like Reuters, Fortune, and the AFP to display their links more prominently. On the new website, Particle also displays links to related reporting at the bottom of its AI summaries to keep users clicking through to read more. Plus, when users share a link from Particle’s mobile app, it will connect readers with the dedicated landing page on the website, opening up access to Particle’s content to more readers, including those who don’t have the app installed. The addition of AI into the news and journalism market has been controversial at times, particularly when some publishersattempted to outsource reporting to AI bots, leading to much backlash. But Particle’s founders want to find a way to use AI to help readers better understand the news, without stealing traffic from publishers. Particle was founded in 2023 by the former senior director of product management at Twitter,Sara Beykpour, and a former senior engineer at Twitter and Tesla,Marcel Molina. It’s backed by$4.4 millionin seed funding and a$10.9 million Series Aled by Lightspeed. Particle joins other efforts to leverage AI for news summaries, including TechCrunch’s former parent company, Yahoo, which acquired theArtifact news app from Instagram’s co-founderstorevamp its News appwith AI-powered features. Bloomberg,Gannett(USA Today),The Wall Street Journal, and others have also been experimenting with AI article summaries. However, readers are likely less forgiving of AI’s mistakes on the news outlets’ websites where they’re directly reporting the news, compared with an independent app devoted to AI summaries and Q&As.

The capital infusion “will be used exclusively and only for growth” and not for operational expenses or product development, Kos Stiskin, Finom’s chairman and co-founder, told TechCrunch. He described it as a nontraditional funding round in which General Catalyst doesn’t take any equity. “[O]ur core operations are generating positive cash flow, and all new investments and funding go directly toward attracting new clients,” Stiskin said. Finom is primarily in the banking business, but this year, the company expanded its offerings beyond digital banking services. In February, Finom unveiled what Stiskin described as an “autonomous AI accounting agent” for entrepreneurs and freelancers in Europe. And in March, the startup expanded into direct lending, which incorporates an AI-powered scoring engine. Finom’s credit offering, available in the Netherlands, will be expanded across Europe by year-end, Stiskin added. Today, Finom counts over 100,000 businesses across Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy as customers, reporting positive unit economics in all markets. Its revenue model is primarily subscription-based. Finom also generates revenue through transaction fees for certain services and offers a competitive cash-back program. The recent expansion into lending also opened a new revenue stream through interest on credit lines. Stiskin declined to reveal hard revenue figures, but he told TechCrunch that Finom doubled its annual recurring revenue in 2024 and that the company is “EBITDAM [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and marketing] profitable.” In an interview, Stiskin described Finom’s closest competitor as Qonto, a Paris-based challenger bank that in January 2022 announced a massive€486 million (~$552 million)Series D funding round. But Stiskin believes that Finom has a “stronger localization strategy and more comprehensive product suite.” Presently, Finom has 505 employees, up 31.5% compared to last year. Last September, the company named Alessandro Camilotti, former head of finance and analytics EU at Klarna, as its CFO. In total, Finom has raised nearly €190 million (roughly $214 million) since its inception in 2020. In February 2024, Finom announced it had raised €50 million (roughly $56 million) ina Series B equity round of fundingco-led by General Catalyst and Northzone. The startup has declined to reveal its valuation.According to PitchBook, Finom was valued at $150.7 million post-money in November 2021 after a €30 million (roughly $33.8 million) seed funding round from VCs Target Global, Tal Ventures, and General Catalyst. Zeynep Yavuz, partner at General Catalyst, believes that Finom has “shown strong execution in a market that is still deeply underpenetrated.” She also thinks its modular infrastructure gives the company the ability “to scale efficiently” across geographies, “leveraging shared capabilities while localizing where needed.” “We see Finom’s proprietary anti-money laundering and know-your-customer engine as a standout advantage — not just for compliance, but for customer experience,” Yavuz said.

Simplify features a prompt refinement approach developed by Google Research and uses Gemini to make complicated text more digestible, without losing key details. Google says its testing found that the simplified text allowed users to better understand and retain the original information. By offering a built-in feature like Simplify, Google is likely hoping that people will stay within its ecosystem of tools and services for help with complex topics, rather than turning to popular third-party tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. You can use Simplify by selecting any text on a web page you’re visiting in the Google app and then tapping the “Simplify” icon that appears. You’ll then see a simpler version of the text to help you digest the information and allow you to continue reading. Google’s research blog shares an example of what this feature could look like. For example, you may come across a passage that reads: “The complex pathology of this condition involves emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma, diffuse interstitial fibrosis, changes in the composition of lung immune cells, increased production of immunomodulatory factors, and the prominent remodeling of pulmonary vasculature.” The simplified text would then read: This complex condition involves damage to the lung tissue from emphysema, a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs, and widespread scarring of the lung tissue, called fibrosis. The immune cells in the lungs change, and the body makes more immunomodulatory factors, substances that control the immune system. The blood vessels in the lungs also change a lot.” Google says the idea behind the feature is to make it easier for people to grasp complex topics they might come across when trying to learn something new on the web. “Our goal requires models to paraphrase complex ideas accurately without introducing errors or omitting key details,” Google said in a blog post. “The rewritten text must help the reader understand challenging material without sacrificing the integrity of the original information.” Simplify is rolling out to iOS users this week.

Despite companies establishing best practices and drawing up documentation, it can be hard for developers to understand someone else’s codebase. To solve this problem, Dennis Pilarinos built a tool calledUnblocked— an AI-powered assistant that answers contextual questions about lines of code. Pilarinos is a seasoned professional at building developer tools. He has worked as a director at Microsoft and Amazon, working on Azure and Amazon Web Services. Later, Pilarinos built a continuous integration platform for remote teams called Buddybuild, which was acquired by Apple in 2018, and he worked at Apple for around two years on the Xcode Cloud platform. “Developers trying to get the information they want is quite painful and time-consuming,” Pilarinos told TechCrunch in a phone interview. “We wanted to use all the data, code, and tribal knowledge of conversations to present developers with easy answers.” Pilarinos added that withmore AI programming toolsseeping into developers’ workflows, the aforementioned problems are going to get worse. Unblocked integrates with development environments and apps like Slack, Jira, Confluence, Google Drive, and Notion. The tool gathers intelligence about a company’s codebase and helps answer questions such as “Where do we define user metrics in our system?” Developers can also use the platform to search for the person who made changes to a particular module and quickly gain insights from them. Unblocked offers admin controls that can be easily adopted by a company’s system admin, and the startup is working on integrating with platforms likeCursorandLovableto improve code explainability. Beyond this, Unblocked is developing tools that actively help developers with projects rather than simply answer questions. One, Autonomous CI Triage, supports developers in testing code through different scenarios. Unblocked counts companies such as Drata, AppDirect, Big Cartel, and TravelPerk as customers. Pilarinos claims that engineers at Drata were able to save one to two hours per week using Unblocked’s platform. Unblocked said Tuesday it has raised $20 million in Series A funding from B Capital and Radical Ventures. The round takes the company’s total capital raised to $30 million from investors, including Amplify Partners, First Round Capital, and XYZ Capital. Rob Toews, a partner at Radical Ventures, said that as AI-generated code proliferates, products like Unblocked will become extremely valuable. “There is a thesis that much of the software in the future will be written by AI,” Toews said. “There will be second- and third-order effects of that, creating new challenges. One of them is that people won’t understand when, why, and how [a particular piece of code] was written.” Toews thinks that, just as AI-powered Glean enabled enterprises to make sense of their troves of data, Unblocked will help devs understand their increasingly complicated codebases.

New investors Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Khosla Ventures also invested, as did returning backers Founders Fund,Dimension Capital, Elad Gil, Garry Tan, Patrick Collison, and others. The fundraise comes two years after the company raised a$40 million Series A. Founded over four years ago by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong (pictured above), former GV partner Blake Byers, and stem cell professor Jacob Kimmel, NewLimit claims it has made significant progress toward developing treatments that can restore youthful characteristics to aged cells. Kimmel told TechCrunch the company has discovered three prototype medicines that reprogram liver cells. NewLimit’s lab experiments, he said, demonstrate this rejuvenation can restore the cells’ ability to process fat and alcohol. The company measures its progress by contrasting how cells from a younger individual and an older person respond to the substances. An older liver cell that has gone through NewLimit’s epigenetic reprogramming behaves more like a younger cell, Kimmel said. Promising early results notwithstanding, NewLimit is still a few years away from starting human trials. In the meantime, the company wants to continue developing new anti-aging medicine using an AI model and then testing the most promising of these machine-generated drugs in its laboratory. “What the AI model allows us to do is run all those experiments in simulation and then only follow up on the most promising subset,” Kimmel said, adding that the data points from the experiment are then used to retrain the AI model in a process known as “lab in a loop.” Other noteworthy biotech startups developing drugs that aim to increase lifespan include Retro Biosciences, which raised $180 million from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman two years ago and is reportedly raising a$1 billion Series A;and Altos Labs, whichlaunchedwith $3 billion in 2022 and is backed by Jeff Bezos.

    "title": "Carney tells Trump that Canada 'won't be for sale, ever'",
    "article_text": "Mark Carney has told Donald Trump that Canada \"is not for sale\" as the president raised the prospect of the country becoming the 51st US state while welcoming the prime minister to the White House. Carney won election last month promising to \"stand up\" to Trump, who has imposed tariffs on some Canadian products and sometimes talks about annexing the country. The former central banker responded with a firm but measured tone after the president proposed a \"wonderful marriage\" of incorporating Canada into the US. Despite a strained relationship recently between the once-close neighbours, the two men also lavished praise on each other in what was a largely cordial Oval Office meeting. Trump has imposed general tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico and sector-specific import taxes on cars, some of which have been suspended pending negotiations. The US president, who accuses Canada of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl south, has levied similar duties on steel and aluminium. Tuesday's meeting was the first time the two had met since Carney won Canada's general election on 28 April, a victory many have credited to concerns in that country about Trump. But the two leaders began with warm words, with Trump describing Carney as \"a very talented person\". He also hailed his guest's election win as \"one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine\". Carney said Trump was a \"transformational president\", with \"a relentless focus on the American worker, securing your border, and securing the world\" and said he had \"revitalised\" Nato. But friction arose when Trump again argued that Canada would be better off as part of the US. Carney came prepared with a carefully worded response. \"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" he told property magnate Trump, likening Canada to the Oval Office itself and to Britain's Buckingham Palace. \"Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign in the last several months, it's not for sale. Won't be for sale, ever.\" Trump replied: \"Never say never.\" The US leader traced his own red line when a journalist in the Oval Office asked if Carney could say anything to persuade him to lift tariffs. \"No,\" he replied. \"It's just the way it is.\" \"This was a very friendly conversation,\" he added. \"But we want to make our own cars.\" Trump once again argued that the US was subsidising Canada's military and did not need Canadian goods such as aluminium and steel. He said he and Carney would discuss \"tough points\" at their meeting, but \"regardless of anything, we're going to be friends with Canada\". Trump also criticised his visitor's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, with whom he had an adversarial relationship. Still, he said the meeting with Carney was in stark contrast to another recent Oval Office \"blow-up\" - a reference to a disastrous visit from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in February. Notably, Trump also downplayed the prospect of trade deals, even though his administration has repeatedly pointed to the over 80 countries the White House says are hoping to negotiate as a sign of progress. \"Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?,\" Trump said. \"We don't have to sign deals, they have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don't want a piece of their market.\" Carney said that he \"pressed the case\" to Trump on lifting tariffs, and found him to be \"willing to have that negotiation\". \"I think that's the main thing. That doesn't presuppose the outcome of the negotiation,\" Carney added at a  news conference at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC. \"There'll be zigs and zags. Difficult aspects to it. But the prospect is there.\" Carney did not speculate on timing, saying only that both leaders and their teams would speak again in the coming weeks. Additionally, Carney said he again asked that Trump stopped calling for Canada to become a US state. He added that he believed it important to distinguish between \"wish and reality\". \"He's the president. He's his own person,\" Carney said. \"He understands that we're having a negotiation between sovereign nations.\" During Canada's election campaign, Carney argued he was the leader who could fight Trump's \"betrayal\", as well as push back against US threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. In his victory speech, the Liberal leader went as far as to say that the formerly tight US-Canadian relationship was \"over\" and that Canadians must \"fundamentally re-imagine our economy\" in the Trump era. More than $760bn (£570bn)  in goods flowed between Canada and the US last year. Canada is the US' second-largest individual trading partner after Mexico, and the largest export market for US goods. The politicians, who had been sheltering at the Argentinian embassy in Caracas for over a year to avoid arrest, are now on US soil. Cory Bowman, who was endorsed by Vance, will face off with the city's Democratic incumbent mayor after finishing second in Tuesday's primary. The incident traumatised air controllers, and triggered delays at one of New York's busiest airports. The newly-elected prime minister repeated that Canada is not for sale during his visit to the White House.

    "title": "UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks",
    "article_text": "The UK and India have agreed a trade deal that will make it easier for UK firms to export whisky, cars and other products to India, and cut taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports. The British government said the \"landmark\" agreement, which took three years to reach, did not include any change in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would boost the economy and \"deliver for British people and business\". Last year, trade between the UK and India totalled £42.6bn and was already forecast to grow, but the government said the deal would boost that trade by an additional £25.5bn a year by 2040. India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, described the agreement as an historic milestone that was \"ambitious and mutually beneficial\". The pact would help \"catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies\", he said in a post on social media platform X. Once it comes into force, which could take up to a year, UK consumers are likely to benefit from the reduction in tariffs on goods coming into the country from India, the Department for Business and Trade said. That includes lower tariffs on: The government also emphasised the benefit to economic growth and job creation from UK firms expanding exports to India. UK exports that will see levies fall include: The British government said the deal was the \"biggest and most economically significant\" bilateral trade agreement the UK had signed since leaving the European Union in 2020. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the benefits for UK businesses and consumers were \"massive\". Tariffs on gin and whisky, a key sticking point in negotiations previously, will be halved to 75%, with further reductions taking effect in later years. Tariffs of 100% on more expensive UK-made cars exported to India will fall to 10%, subject to a quota limiting the total number. The deal also includes provisions on the services sector and procurement allowing British firms to compete for more contracts. Under the terms of the deal, some Indian and British workers will also gain from a three-year exemptionfrom social security payments, which the Indian government called \"an unprecedented achievement\". The exemption applies to the staff of Indian companies temporarily transferred to the UK, and to UK firms' workers transferred to India. Social security contributions will be paid by employers and employees in their home country only, rather than in both places. The UK already has similar reciprocal \"double contribution convention\" agreements with 17 other countries including the EU, the US and South Korea, the government said. However,leader of the opposition Kemi Badenoch described the agreement as \"two-tier taxes from two-tier Keir\", with Labour's increase in employer NI contributions from the Budget coming into force last month. Shadow trade secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"Every time Labour negotiates, Britain loses\". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it was \"very worrying to hear concerns that Indian workers coming over here, companies may not have to pay taxes on those workers\" and called for MPs to be allowed to vote on the deal. The government said the National Insurance exemption would not affect NHS funding, since Indians working in the UK would still be required to pay the immigration health surcharge. India, currently the fifth largest economy in the world, is forecast to become the  third-largest within in a few years, making it a desirable trading partner for the UK, currently the world's sixth largest economy. The UK is also a high priority trading partner for Prime Minister Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to increase exports by $1 trillion by 2030. The deal is a win for free trade at a time when US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff campaign has put the idea on the defensive and raised fears of tit-for-tat trade wars. It appears to have increased the impetus to strike this trade deal. Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of business lobby group, the CBI, welcomed the deal saying it provided a \"beacon of hope amidst the spectre of protectionism\" following Trump's wave of tariffs. UK businesses saw \"myriad\" opportunities in the Indian market, she added. Allie Renison, from communications firm SEC Newgate, and a former government trade adviser, said the deal was potentially  \"transformational\" due to India's size, growth rate and relatively high existing barriers to accessing its market. The trade deal gives a tax break to Indian professionals, which critics say undercuts UK businesses. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war. Experts warn that a flood of cheap Chinese goods could hurt the competitiveness of Indian exports. It comes as moviemakers worry the UK's thriving film industry could be hit by the new tariff threat. An average of £55,572 was given in loans and gifts by members of the family, estimates show.",

    "article_text": "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that \"we are on the eve of an intense entry into Gaza.\" Israel would, he said, capture territory and hold it: \"They will not enter and come out.\" The new offensive is calculated, according to the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, to bring back the remaining hostages. After that, he told Israeli radio, \"comes the collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat, its submission\". The offensive will not start, Israel says, until after Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. Assuming Trump does not dissuade Israel from going ahead, Israel will need a military and political miracle to pull off the results described by Brig-Gen Defrin. It is more likely that the offensive will sharpen everything that makes the Gaza war so controversial. The war, starting with the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, has taken the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis to a point as dangerous as any in its long history. Prolonging the war divides Israelis, kills even more Palestinian civilians and horrifies millions around the world, including many who describe themselves as friends of Israel. While the IDF attacks Hamas in Gaza, the government's plan is that its soldiers will force some or all of the more than two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza into a small area in the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid would be distributed, perhaps by contractors including American private security firms. The United Nations humanitarian agencies have said they will not cooperate, condemning the plan as a violation of the principles of humanitarian aid. They have also warned of starvation in Gaza caused by Israel's decision more than two months ago to block all humanitarian deliveries. Israel's blockade, which continues, has been widely condemned, not just by the UN and Arab countries. Now, Britain and the European Union both say they are against a new Israeli offensive. A fortnight ago, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, all allies of Israel who regard Hamas as a terrorist group, warned that the \"intolerable\" blockade put Palestinian civilians, including one million children, at \"an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death\". The ministers also warned, implicitly, that their ally was violating international law. \"Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change\", they insisted. \"Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.\" Israel denies it violates international humanitarian law and the laws of war in Gaza. But at the same time its own ministers' words suggest otherwise. One of many examples: the defence minister Israel Katz has described the blockade as a \"main pressure lever\" against Hamas. That sounds like an admission that the blockade is a weapon, even though it starves civilians, which amounts to a war crime. Countries and organisations that believe Israel systematically violates its legal obligations, committing a series of war crimes, will scour any new offensive for more evidence. Extreme language used by ministers will have been noted by the South African lawyers arguing the case at the International Court of Justice alleging Israeli genocide in Gaza. Much of it has come from ultra-nationalists who prop up the Netanyahu government. They see the new offensive as another step towards expelling Palestinians from Gaza and replacing them with Jewish settlers. One of the most vocal extremists, Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister said that in six months Gaza would be \"totally destroyed\". Palestinians in the territory would be \"despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places\". \"Relocation\", the word used by Smotrich, will be seen both by his supporters and political enemies as another reference to \"transfer\", an idea discussed since the earliest days of Zionism to force Arabs out of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Netanyahu's Israeli critics say prolonging the war with a new offensive instead of ending it with a ceasefire is about his own political survival, not Israel's safety or the return of its hostages. In the days after the 7 October attacks there were lines of cars hurriedly parked outside military bases as Israelis rushed to volunteer for reserve duty to fight Hamas. Now thousands of them (some estimates from the Israeli left are higher) are refusing to do any more reserve duty. They argue the prime minister is continuing the war because if he doesn't his hard right will bring down the government and bring on the day of reckoning for mistakes and miscalculations Netanyahu made that gave Hamas an opportunity to attack. Inside Israel, the sharpest criticism of the planned offensive has come from the families of the hostages who fear they have been abandoned by the government that claims to be rescuing them. Hamas still has 24 living hostages in the Gaza Strip, according to Israel, and is holding the bodies of another 35 of the 251 taken on 7 October. The Netanyahu government has claimed repeatedly that only as much military pressure as possible will get the survivors home and return the bodies of the dead to their families. In reality, the biggest releases of hostages have come during ceasefires. The last ceasefire deal, which Trump insisted Israel sign in the final days of the Biden administration, included a planned second phase which was supposed to lead to the release of all the hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu's extremist allies told him they would bring down his government if he agreed to a second phase of the ceasefire. First, Israel blocked humanitarian aid to put pressure, it said, on Hamas to agree to a renegotiated deal that would give Israel the option of going back to war even after the hostages were released. When Hamas refused, Israel went on the offensive again with a massive air attack on the night of 18 March. Since then, Israel has put unrelenting pressure on Palestinians in Gaza. A new offensive will kill many more Palestinian civilians, deepen the misery of the survivors and bereaved inside Gaza and widen the toxic rifts within Israel. On its own, without a ceasefire deal, it is unlikely on past form to force Hamas to free the remaining hostages. The carnage inflicted by Israel inside Gaza has been a recruiting sergeant for Hamas and other armed groups, according to President Joe Biden's administration just before it left office in January of this year. It is worth repeating the words used by Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a speech in Washington on 14 January. \"We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,\" Blinken said. \"That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war.\" When he spoke, Israel was claiming that it had killed around 18,000 Palestinian fighters inside Gaza. More have been killed since then, and many more civilians. Israel's massive onslaught broke the back of Hamas as a structured military organisation more than a year ago. Now Israel faces an insurgency, which history shows can go for as long as recruits are prepared to fight and die to beat their enemy. The UN also expresses alarm after Israel approves a new plan that may include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely and controlling aid. Oman's foreign minister says a \"ceasefire\" between the US and the Iran-backed group has been reached. Three civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway and a military air base were hit, reports say. Five-month-old Siwar can barely cry, her voice so hoarse from the lack of milk she needs to survive. The Israeli military says the expanded offensive will displace most Palestinians in Gaza.",

    "title": "GCSE results day to change for thousands of students with new app",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of GCSE students will get their grades in an app on their phones on results day this summer. The government is trialling the Education Record app with 95,000 students in Manchester and the West Midlands, ahead of a national rollout. Ministers say they hope it will save money for college admissions teams, while school leaders say students and schools will need \"seamless support\" to ensure the app works properly. Students involved in the pilot will still be able to go to school to get their paper results and do the traditional opening of the envelope on results day in August. Under the plans, students' results will be made available on the app at 11:00 on results day, which is Thursday 21 August. Students collecting their results in person can do so from 08:00. This year's firstGCSE examsbegan on Monday 5 May, and will last until Wednesday 25 June. The government's plan is to bring each student's exam results and certificates into one online set of digital education records. Students who are under 18 after finishing their GCSEs have to stay in full-time education, start an apprenticeship or work while studying part-time. The government says the new app will mean further education colleges no longer have to hire extra staff to photocopy results or chase missing paperwork from prospective students. Education minister Stephen Morgan said it was \"high time exam records were brought into the 21st century\" and that it would stop schools and colleges being \"bogged down in bureaucracy\". Mark Giles, principal at The Hathershaw College in Oldham, said the app was \"accurate and verifiable\" after conducting a local trial at his school since last spring. Other school leaders have welcomed the pilot. James Bowen, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said his union was \"pleased the app is being piloted\". \"It makes a lot of sense to look into modernising how exam results are handled and any moves to cut bureaucracy and costs are welcome,\" he said. But he said it would be important that the app's rollout is done carefully, with \"seamless support\" for students and schools if issues arise. \"When we are dealing with something as important as exam results it is crucial that the government gets this absolutely right,\" he said. Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) also welcomed the move, and called for the use of digital technology in education to go even further. He said the digital approach should be extended to exams themselves, which are still done using pen and paper and can create a \"massive burden\" for schools who are required to securely transport thousands of exam papers. He said the development of education technology had so far been \"frustratingly piecemeal\", adding that the government should \"invest in creating the infrastructure schools and colleges need to make this a reality\". More than 100 schools that support pupils with special educational needs will use the kits. Teachers and support staff at Roedean School are walking out amid a dispute over pay and pensions. More than 20,000 fines have been handed out to parents since 2022. The NAHT wants a judge to review proposed changes to the way Ofsted inspects schools in England. The proposals, which could see Powys end up with just two sixth forms, have been met with concern.",

    "title": "Call the Midwife film and prequel series announced",
    "article_text": "The BBC has announced plans to make a Call the Midwife film as well as a prequel TV series set during the Second World War. It comes as filming begins for the 15th series of the BBC One drama, which follows a group of nurse midwives working in London's East End from the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s. The film will be set in an as-yet undisclosed overseas location in 1972, and will feature characters from the existing TV show. Meanwhile, the separate prequel series will \"delve into the deeper past\", showrunner Heidi Thomas said, offering a view of life in Poplar, east London, during the Blitz. The new, separate film and prequel projects will be written, created and produced by Thomas and executive producers Dame Pippa Harris and Ann Tricklebank, who will also oversee the production of series 16 of the programme together. The prequel series will feature \"some familiar (if much younger) faces\", Thomas said. She said that while she has \"never run out of stories for our midwives\", she had found herself \"yearning to delve into the deeper past\" than the years 1957 to 1971 which have been covered by the show. \"The Blitz years in the East End were extraordinary - filled with loss, togetherness, courage and joy,\" she said. Meanwhile, the film will see the \"much-loved\" regular characters \"take a short break from Poplar and test themselves in an unfamiliar landscape\", Ms Thomas said. The location of the film remains \"top secret\", she added - but said it would look \"absolutely fantastic\" on the big screen. The first series of the show was originally inspired by the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, who worked as a midwife and nurse in the community in Poplar. Dame Pippa said the prequel series and film project were being made partly for a \"new, younger generation who have also fallen in love with our characters and the challenges they face.\" The 15th series will begin with a two-part Christmas special which will see characters travelling to Hong Kong on a mercy mission. The High Court in Dublin is hearing a libel case brought by Gerry Adams against a BBC programme and online article. She joins the lead presenting team as Sally Magnusson steps down from the role after 27 years at the desk. The former Sinn Féin president believes he was defamed in a BBC NI Spotlight programme. As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next? A review into the BBC's workplace culture was commissioned in the wake of allegations against Huw Edwards.",

    "title": "The divides behind the scenes in the Vatican ahead of the conclave",
    "article_text": "The Vatican's Santa Marta guesthouse has 128 rooms. From 7 May, it will be filled with cardinals participating in the conclave to elect the next Pope. But one room in the guesthouse is still sealed with a red ribbon, as it has been since its occupant died there on Easter Monday. That suite will only be reopened when the new pope is chosen. The ribbon remains a tangible reminder of the man whose shoes the cardinals are looking to fill – but Pope Francis's presence looms large over this conclave in many profound ways. He spent 12 years in the role and appointed around 80% of the cardinals who will select his successor. He also looked to radically shake up the workings of the Catholic Church, moving its centre of gravity away from its hierarchy at the Vatican in the direction of the rank-and-file faithful all over the world, and focused on the poor and marginalised. My conversations with cardinals and those assessing the needs of the Church in the days leading to this papal election almost always end up looking at what is required through the prism of what Pope Francis did in the role. While in recent days there appears to have been a growing coalescence around the idea that Francis's work should be built on, some of his critics remain far from convinced. So might there be enough of them to sway the vote as the Church attempts to reconcile the different outlooks and realities it faces around the globe? During the two weeks that followed the Pope's death, the cardinals met almost daily at the Vatican for pre-conclave gatherings known as general congregations. While the conclave in the Sistine Chapel is limited to cardinals who haven't yet reached the age of 80 (133 will participate in this one), these preliminary meetings are open to all 252 cardinals. Each attendee was given up to five minutes to air their views, though we know that some took longer. It was during such a meeting ahead of the last conclave of 2013, in a speech lasting less than four minutes, that Pope Francis - then known as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina - made an impact, talking of a need to connect with those in the far reaches of the Catholic world. As Pope, he made a conscious drive to appoint cardinals from such places. It is why this is the most diverse conclave there has ever been. For the first time Cape Verde, Haiti, South Sudan, Tonga, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Rwanda will be represented. That diversity has already made its mark: the pre-conclave meetings are said to have brought to the fore just how different the needs of the Church appear to be depending on where in the world they are viewed. In Europe, for example, a primary consideration for some might be finding ways to reinvigorate and make relevant the mission of the Church in the face of shrinking congregations, whereas elsewhere - in African or Asian countries - concerns may revolve around social issues, poverty and conflict resolution. A prospective pope is likely to be one who has at least shown recognition of those very different realities. The official titles that the new pope will inherit gives a sense of the breadth of the role: Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Sovereign of the State of Vatican City among them. While some relate to the deeply spiritual, the last of those titles suggests the need for a statesman too, given that the pope is leader of a country, albeit the world's smallest. \"Unlike your average state, the agenda of the Vatican is driven to an extent by where the pope reigning at the time puts their emphasis,\" says Chris Trott, British ambassador to the Holy See. \"On the face of it a very tiny state, [but it is] one that punches many, many times above its weight. \"And Pope Francis had 50 million followers on Twitter, so [it is] a very, very small state and an incredible global influencer.\" Pope Francis chose to amplify this part of the role, becoming a powerful global spokesman on behalf of those on the margins, including the poor and victims of war. He also tried to play the role of peacemaker, though not everyone thought he was successful in that regard, in relation to China and Russia in particular. According to Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic figure in England and Wales, this expansion of the role is one reason so many even outside the faith are invested in the outcome of the conclave. \"There is a sense that the Pope in the person of Pope Francis became a figure who addressed everybody in the world… religious people and even those who do not have a religious affiliation,\" he says. \"I'm more and more aware that it's not just Catholics who are interested in this.\" For many voting cardinals, it is primarily issues within the Catholic Church that are under the spotlight, which brings about the question of the type of pope they want as a manager, and someone who runs the Church's administrative body and its ministries. While Pope Francis worked on improving the way the Church deals with the huge issues of sexual abuse and of financial corruption, it is his successor who will have to ensure that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world. Even supporters of Pope Francis's efforts to make changes to the way the Church relates to its rank-and-file believers, and the way he built bridges with those outside the faith, were sometimes left confused about how exactly he envisioned things should work. Pope Francis changed the tone on social issues through comments he made, talking openly about subjects ranging from climate change to financial transparency within the Vatican. But throughout his papacy, some were unclear about what he meant or how it would be applied. One mission he had was to take some of the power and decision-making away from the Vatican hierarchy and into the hands of rank-and-file Catholics. Over nearly four years, at great effort, he commissioned what was, in effect, a poll of many of the world's Catholics to find out what mattered to them. Lay people were invited to participate in the most recent bishop's conference where the results of the survey were discussed. The biggest issues raised related to greater roles for women in the running of the church and welcoming LGBT+ Catholics. But the meeting ended in some confusion, with little in the form of tangible steps forward and little clarity as to how lay people will help steer the future direction of the Church. So, there is a general keenness for greater clarity from the new pope. Throughout his pontificate, some vocal traditionalists opposed what they saw as Pope Francis straying from Church teaching and long-standing tradition. In the pre-conclave meetings of cardinals, a number of those over the age of 80 (who because of their age would not be involved in voting) took the opportunity to play their part. Most contributions remained secret, but one that was reported was that of 83-year-old Italian cardinal, Beniamino Stella. He criticised Pope Francis for \"imposing his own ideas\" by attempting to move Church governance away from the clergy. And yet during the homily, or religious speech, at Pope Francis's funeral, what appeared to resonate with the public in attendance – judging by the volume of the applause – was talk of the themes Francis chose to champion: the dignity of migrants, an end to war, and the environment. This applause would have been heard loud and clear by the rows of cardinals. In some senses, Pope Francis did have clarity in focusing on the Church being relevant to people in their daily lives and, indeed, their struggles. He was clear about connecting with the world outside the faith too. \"There is a sense that in the voice of the pope, there's a voice of something that is needed,\" says Cardinal Nichols. \"For some people it's a moral compass, for some people it's the sense of being accepted, for some people it's the insistence that we must look at things from the point of view of the poorest. \"That's a voice that has fallen silent and our task is to find someone who can carry that forward.\" From the death of Pope Francis to the moment cardinals checked into the Santa Marta guesthouse and its overflow residences, there appeared to be a trend towards a desire for continuity of what Pope Francis had achieved. Though perhaps that vision of continuity is one that could bring along more of his sceptics, in a way that was pragmatic. The word \"unity\" has been talked of a lot, after a period where the divides between supporters and detractors of the Pope's vision could sometimes become ugly. But in the end, when they step into the Sistine Chapel, the holiest of voting chambers, for all the pragmatism they may have taken into consideration before they cast their ballot, they will be urged to let God and the Holy Spirit guide them.

    "title": "Abuse victim fled ex but council left her in unsecure home",
    "article_text": "A woman who fled an abusive relationship said she had to barricade herself into her rented home every night for more than six months, because her council left her with a broken door lock. Jane – not her real name – should have had extra home security, known as target hardening \"within a couple of working days\" of being classed as high risk, according to government guidelines. North Kesteven District Council admitted a \"significant failing\" and offered Jane £100 in compensation for failing to secure her home in a timely manner. The domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales said \"patchy\" target hardening meant many victims were \"living in daily fear\" of their abuser turning up at their home. The government said it was increasing domestic abuse funding. Since 2021, local authorities have had a legal duty to make sure domestic abuse victims have a safe place to live. It meansmost councils in England now run a sanctuary scheme, which includes installing target hardening at a victim's home, when they no longer live with their abuser. The measures - such as alarm systems, extra locks, and fire-proof letterboxes  - should be fitted \"as soon as possible\" following a risk assessment, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). Jane, from Lincolnshire, said she had been told to expect extra security after leaving her partner in May 2024, which included fixing a broken lock. However, delays in completing the work left her living in \"terror\". She said she was \"completely failed\" by the council, and did not sleep properly for six months as her patio door did not lock. \"Every time I looked at the door, it made me feel sick,\" said Jane. \"One night, there was a bang outside and I was shaking in the kitchen, I was retching in the sink, because I was terrified he was there and was about to come in and murder me.\" It became a nightly routine for Jane to \"barricade\" her sliding patio door with household items, such as chairs, tables and an ironing board. Until November 2024 she said she spent her evenings in silence, listening for any sign of her ex-partner outside. \"I felt completely unsafe. It was horrific,\" said Jane. Women are most at risk of being killed by their ex-partner in the first month after leaving an abusive relationship,according to statistics from the Femicide Census. \"That fact that Jane waited so long put her life at risk,\" said Claire Chamberlain, who runs domestic abuse organisation Clear Path UK. The domestic abuse commissioner, Dame Nicole Jacobs, said target hardening was a \"postcode lottery\", and some victims were being \"driven into homelessness\" because it was becoming \"too dangerous\" to stay in their homes. \"This is simply not good enough,\" she said. Caroline Vincent, 50, from Chapel St Leonards, is calling for change and believes her daughter and grandson might still be alive today if they had been offered target hardening. Bethany Vincent, 26, and her nine-year-old son Darren Henson, known as DJ, weremurdered at their home in Louth, in 2021. They were stabbed to death by Bethany's ex-partner, Daniel Boulton, who had walked 28 miles (45km) from a homeless hostel in Skegness, despite being under a restraining order. A review into their deaths found there had been \"little work\" by agencies to target harden Bethany's home. The reviewsaid there were \"obvious warning signs\" Boulton was a \"high risk\" to Bethany and DJ, given his history of domestic abuse-related offences. \"No one came round and checked her property for her, even though he'd tried to break in before,\" said Ms Vincent. \"They knew what he could be capable of, and if things were put in place it would be a totally different outcome. \"Not enough is being done. It makes me so angry that women are still being put at risk.\" Bethany's council, East Lindsey District Council, did not respond to a request for comment. The Local Government Association is calling for the government to provide sufficient funding for target hardening to make sure \"support reaches those who need it most, without delay\". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing said: \"We are increasing domestic abuse funding to councils by £30m this year so that victims can get the support they need in safe, secure accommodation and we expect councils to deliver this.\" Campaigner Emma Storey, chief executive of the Domestic Abuse Housing Alliance (DAHA), said she was aware of the \"challenges\" facing the sector. Ms Storey said in some cases there were issues making contact with landlords, and also problems gaining permission for target hardening works, despite efforts to persuade them it was a \"positive\" step. DAHA has made a toolkit,recognised by the Home Office, which sets out steps local authorities can take to improve their response to housing for victims. But not all local authorities have signed up. In a letter to Jane, seen by the BBC, North Kesteven District Council said it could not offer any explanation for the delay in installing her extra security. \"There has clearly been a significant failure within our processes that has led to the works not being undertaken in an acceptable timeframe and resulted in this unacceptable level of service,\" the letter stated. The council said it would carry out a review of its procedures, and also apologised for a \"lack of communication\" with Jane, who had made repeated calls for the target hardening works to be done. In a further statement, to the BBC, the council said sometimes delays were because of a lack of available contractors. It added that target hardening does not cover all home repairs that might need doing. Jane also raised her concerns over the council's delays, with the domestic abuse commissioner. In a letter seen by the BBC, the commissioner's office described Jane's case as \"appalling\" and said it had raised \"serious concerns\". Jane said living in constant fear had affected her job, her mental health and her relationships with other people. \"I don't want anybody to go through the terror that I had for six months,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have had to be in fight or flight mode when target hardening is meant to be there to prevent this happening.\" Woking Borough Council says the government has agreed to provide financial support. A government department is planning to close its offices in Exeter and Truro. Sheffield organisers say staff are \"really worried\" over plans to shut offices at St Paul's Place. Daniel Elmer says a settlement with at least 10,000 homes would help meet high demand. North Kesteven District Council will decide on an application to build the properties in Leasingham.",

    "title": "How street sex workers are helping police stop child abuse",
    "article_text": "WARNING: This article contains details of a sexual nature and child sex abuse. If you have been affected by anything in this story, help can be found at theBBC Action line. As darkness falls, street sex workers are helping police and a charity to protect a city's most at-risk children. Often the eyes and ears after dark, the women have been providing vital information on child exploitation to the Night Light initiative in Bristol and helping to bring child sex offenders to justice. \"If you think there's a chance you're leaving a child in that position, you've got to stay. You've got to find out.\" Anna, whose real identity the BBC is protecting, is in her 50s and worked on the streets of Bristol over a 30 year period. She says she is now \"retired\", but has been key to the success of a unique project helping to put dangerous criminals in prison. On one occasion a man, who was paying her for sex, asked her to engage in role-play, where she had to pretend to be a primary school age girl. \"It was really unpleasant. Sickening to be honest,\" she said. \"I had to carry on for three months, but I couldn't walk away until I knew what was happening.\" After reporting her concerns to the police, it turned out the man was abusing his eight-year-old daughter. Anna testified against him in court and he has now been sent to prison. In another case, a man showed her child abuse photos on his phone so horrific she could not watch but reported him to the authorities and he is now awaiting trial. \"You can't not do something about that,\" she said. \"I see that kid's face every time I shut my eyes.\" The sex workers are not only helping to catch child abusers, but also helping to identify children at risk of exploitation and get underage girls off the streets. \"The streets are scary. They are dark, they are lonely,\" Megan, not her real name, said. \"For underage women, like just so young, children, to be going through whatever they are going through, wherever they are, I can't bear to imagine.\" Megan is one of those working with Avon and Somerset Police and children's charity Barnardo's Night Light team - providing them with vital intelligence about the children she sees after dark. \"My hectic day to day lifestyle [as a sex worker] is troubling, exhausting, and very miserable, to just have that little bit of positivity brought through something I have achieved and done personally, is great. It makes me feel proud,\" she said. Night Light started in 2020 during the Covid lockdowns. The streets had become quieter, exposing the children who were at risk of being exploited, hanging around in the part of Bristol where sex is bought and sold. Paige, not her real name, was vulnerable and just 15-years-old when she was spotted with her sister. She told the BBC that at the time, she wasn't aware of the danger she could be in. \"We were out because we didn't want to be at home, as we thought being out at night was safer than home,\" Paige said. Forced onto the street she was approached by men being \"nice\", offering her food, drinksor lifts and getting into their cars. \"I didn't think I was at risk, but looking back now I see things a lot differently,\" she said. Paige and her sister initially ran away from the Night Light team on at least two occasions. But identified as being at risk of sexual exploitation, the team eventually caught up with her and explained the danger she was in. Paige has now been placed in a foster home. Now 19-years-old, Yas - also not her real name - has also been helped by the team. \"They [men] would ask me if I wanted go to their place and if I want any drink or like they'd offer me balloons [nitrous oxide],\" she said. \"Back then I couldn't see why they were asking that. I thought they just wanted to have fun, in like the innocent way, but now I've realised they were probably asking me to go back so that I would have sex with them.\" Now supported by Night Light, Yas said thinking about the situation she was in makes her feel \"creeped out\" and scared for other young people. The potential and benefits of using street sex workers to help stop child exploitation was first realised by Jo Ritchie, a social worker employed by Barnardo's. She now works closely with Rose Brown, a sex work liaison officer from Avon and Somerset Police, as well as Bristol City Council. Jo recalled one of the first women she spoke to, saying her knowledge was so good it was like she was part of the police investigation. \"She knew everything. But what was really sad, was at the end, she said 'but what can I do? I'm just a sex worker.' \"And that really struck me. I really felt, actually, we could really do with your help.\" In 2024 the Night Light team had 124 conversations with street sex workers – who have made 65 reports about dangerous men and highlighted around 20 young people at risk of exploitation. The trust that has built up between the sex workers and the Night Light team has been key to its success. As well as talking to them about children they have seen on the streets and dangerous offenders, they also offer the women support, food, clothing and a supportive ear. Rose said that since the project started five years ago, they have seen huge progress. \"We're getting a massive increase in the women sharing about their own experiences of being sexually assaulted, as well as worries about children,\" she said. \"It isn't rocket science. It is just investing that time in building those relationships.\" Because many of the women have been sexually assaulted themselves, they are keen to prevent young people from going through similar experiences, Jo said. \"Time and time again, we hear them say, 'I wish this had been running when I was a kid, because perhaps I wouldn't be out here now',\" she added. \"I think they're probably the most passionate advocates... they really don't want to see children on the streets.\" Megan, 34, doesn't want to be working on Bristol's streets for long, but while she is, she said she is proud to have helped safeguard other girls. \"The underage thing is something I really feel strongly about,\" she said. \"There's a bad stigma about sex workers, drugs... but we're not bad people.\" Night Light is proving so successful in Bristol, that other parts of the country are now looking to roll the project out. And Rose and Jo are both very clear, Night Light would not exist without the women, and hope it helps to challenge the narrative around street sex workers. \"They're incredible,\" Jo said. \"We are totally dependent on them. We've identified children at risk, who are out on the streets, who we weren't aware of, because of them. \"And that's really one of the key things about Night Light, the children they are pointing us towards are probably some of the highest risk children, but yet they are often really hidden.\" Follow BBC West onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "title": "The Papers: 'Two-tier' trade deal and 'Labour turmoil' over winter fuel",
    "article_text": "News of the Indian attack on Pakistan came too late for the first editions, and many focus on the free trade agreement between the UK and India. The Daily Telegraph leads withcriticism from the Conservativesthat the agreement - which exempts Indian workers in the UK from paying National Insurance for three years - amounts to a \"two-tier tax deal\". It also quotes the leader of Reform, Nigel Farage, as saying the agreement \"betrays working Britain\". The Daily Mail says the deal will make itcheaper to employ foreign workers, and Delhi has heralded it as an \"unprecedented win\". The Times says the agreement is worth up to £5bn for the British economy,but undercuts UK workers. It reports that ministers have pointed to similar deals Britain already has with the US and Europe and that it will also benefit British workers in India. The Guardian leads withcomments by the Israeli finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, that Gaza will be \"entirely destroyed\" and Palestinians will be driven out as a result of an Israeli military victory. The paper says the Israeli threat to take permanent control of the territory has sparked global outrage - and that Mr Smotrich's comments have \"raised fears of ethnic cleansing\". Ayear-long investigation into evidencefound at a disused factory owned by Christian Brueckner - who was questioned by German police about the whereabouts of Madeleine McCann - is the lead in the Sun. The paper claims officers found memory cards containing child kidnap stories, children's clothes and toys when they searched the factory in Germany in 2016. Looking at something beautiful - like a piece of art - may help free us from everyday anxieties, according to a new study reported in the Times. It says researchers from Cambridge University have discovered that engaging with aesthetically pleasing objects appears to induce \"psychological distancing\" which allows people to step back from their thoughts for a healthier perspective.

    "title": "'No food when I gave birth': Malnutrition rises in Gaza as Israeli blockade enters third month",
    "article_text": "Sometimes in war it is the smallest sound that can make the loudest statement. In Gaza's Nasser hospital, a five-month-old girl struggles to cry. Siwar Ashour is hoarse. Her voice has been robbed of the energy to fully communicate her distress. She cannot absorb regular formula milk and doctors say the Israeli blockadenow in its third month means supplies of the food she needs are scarce. Siwar sounds as if the weight of the war is pressing down on her lungs. Her mother Najwa, 23, is changing Siwar's nappy. She weighs just over 2kg (4lb 6oz). A baby girl of five months should be around or over 6kg. \"There was no food when I gave birth to her,\" says Najwa. \"If I wanted to feed myself so I could breastfeed her, I had no nutrients to make my health better... She now only drinks formula milk, and we don't know how we'll be able to provide it for her.\" Israel has banned international journalists from entering Gaza to report independently. A local BBC colleague filmed the unmistakable signs of advanced malnutrition on Siwar's body. The head that seems far too big for her frame. The stick-like arms and legs. The ribs pressing against her skin when she tries to cry. The large brown eyes that follow her mother's every small movement. Najwa worries about what will happen when she must leave the hospital. \"The hospital provided with great difficulty some milk for her, they searched all of the hospitals but they could only find it in one. They told me that they will give me one bottle when we leave, but it is barely enough for four days. Her father is blind and he can't provide a bottle of milk for her, and even if we found it, it would be expensive, and he doesn't work.\" According to Siwar's doctor, Ziad al-Majaida, it was her second stay in the hospital. She was back because of the shortage of milk formula. \"Nothing enters through the borders, no milk, food or anything. This leads to big problems here for the kids. This baby needs a specific type of milk. It was available before, but because of the border closure, the stocks have run out for a while now.\" The hospital is trying to find more supplies but Siwar is weak and suffering from constant diarrhoea. \"If she stays like this, her life will be in danger, but if her milk or treatment were provided, then her state would improve,\" says Dr Majaida. Since the beginning of the year, according to the UN, about 10,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children have been identified. Food prices have rocketed by as much as 1,400%. Charity kitchens, which have helped hundreds of thousands of Gazans, are shutting as food supplies run out. Twenty-five bakeries supported by the World Food Programme have been forced to close. In the southern city of Khan Younis, where Nasser hospital is located, our journalist visited a kitchen run by Shabab Gaza (Gaza Youth), which delivers food directly to families. Enough for a meal a day per family. The head of the charity, Mohammad Abu Rjileh, 29, said three of their four kitchens had closed due to lack of supplies. Looting by criminal gangs, and by desperate civilians has deepened the supply crisis. \"Many of the organisations that support us had their warehouses looted. Instead of having enough ingredients to cook 10,000 meals daily - ingredients that were expected to last us an additional week or 10 days - we now have enough for only one or two days. If no immediate solution is implemented and the borders are not opened as soon as possible, we will be forced to stop cooking.\" Israel cut off all humanitarian aid and other supplies from entering Gaza on 2 March, and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages the group is still holding in Gaza, up to 24 of whom are still thought to be alive. The United Nations has said the Israeli blockade constitutes \"a cruel collective punishment\" on civilians. The UN's humanitarian director, former British diplomat Tom Fletcher, said that international law was unequivocal. \"As the occupying power, Israel must allow humanitarian support in... Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,\" he warned. I put this point to Boaz Bismuth, a leading member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party. He denies there is an aid crisis caused by the blockade. \"There is food in Gaza... Israel wouldn't do such a restriction if the population didn't have food. I mean, I know my country perfectly well,\" he said. I put it to Bismuth that he was denying the evidence of people's eyes, that children were starving. \"There are not starving children. I repeat again.\" He said that there had been allegations months ago of famine, ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza \"which was crap\". \"Nothing has really changed because we're Israel, and we obey not only international law, but also humanitarian law.\" \"What we want is our hostages back and Hamas out of Gaza. The war can be over in exactly 30 seconds.\" Israel has long accused Hamas of hijacking aid, which Hamas denies. The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, based in the occupied West Bank, recently claimed most of the looting was being done by gangs associated with Hamas. He also called the movement \"sons of dogs\" and demanded the release of Israeli hostages. Hamas responded by saying Abbas \"repeatedly and suspiciously lays the blame for the crimes of the occupation [Israel] and its ongoing aggression on our people\". Without being able to enter Gaza and report independently, it is difficult to investigate the unfolding events. Violent criminal gangs have been heavily implicated in stealing aid. Hamas is threatening violence against groups and individuals it accuses of theft. Two people were shot outside an Unrwa warehouse but it is not clear who killed them. A local activist who was present blamed Hamas. \"Hamas is hoarding food, depriving the hungry population of food, and selling food at very high prices. The population protested and demanded that the food be distributed or they would take it by force. Hamas fired live ammunition at the hungry,\" said Moumen al-Natour, a lawyer and protest leader. All of this is happening in the context of a growing hunger and the breakdown in order that has accompanied the war and blockade. The Israeli cabinet has approved anescalation of the military offensive in Gaza. It says it aims to destroy Hamas - a goal that has proved elusive for the last 19 months of war. There are also reports that Israel plans to use private security companies to oversee the distribution of aid in Gaza, although no date for this has been made public. The United Nations and major aid agencies have described this as a politicisation of aid with which they will refuse to co-operate. With additional reporting by Alice Doyard and Nik Millard",

    "title": "Faisal Islam: Trump tariffs may have helped drive UK-India trade deal",
    "article_text": "It has long been the great prize for Britain's post-EU trade freedom - a deal with what is now the world's most populous country. India has agreed its most generous free trade agreement with the UK, which is at the same time Britain's biggest post-Brexit trade deal. It means a big boost for key UK exports such as whisky and cars which will see very high tariffs or taxes on imports slashed. This is not a normal deal taking two way trade down to zero tariffs. India is a highly protectionist economy. So, while 99% of tariffs on India's exports to the UK will be eradicated, 85% of British exports will not be tariffed going to India. But because British exports are so much higher value than Indian exports of clothing, footwear, and food, this should be worth £15bn extra for British exports and £10bn for India by 2040. This could change, though. For example, 88,000 cheaper Indian cars will now be able to be imported tariff free. The UK government sees this as a win-win which helps exporters, creates jobs, and means lower prices for consumers. This is all part of, in Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds words, making the UK the \"most connected market in the world\" - with a Brexit reset, a deal with the US, \"pragmatism\" on China, and new deals with India, and soon the Gulf. But there is also a much bigger picture here. This is the worlds fifth and sixth biggest economies doing a much closer deal to increase trade at a time when the top two - the US and China - are involved in a brutal trade war, and the Trump administration is tariffing everywhere. This may be one of the reasons why this elusive deal, coveted by many previous governments, has finally got over the line. It also turns the page on decades of missed economic opportunities, given the strong historic connections between the two nations. Global trade experts have told the BBC they expect the negotiations to take several months. India launched strikes in the early hours of Wednesday - two weeks after a deadly militant attack. Footage obtained by Associated Press shows rubble and destruction thought to be in Muzaffarabad. The Canadian PM responds firmly as the president proposes a \"wonderful marriage\" of incorporating Canada into the US. The trade deal gives a tax break to Indian professionals, which critics say undercuts UK businesses.",

    "title": "What have we learned from Grand Theft Auto 6's second trailer?",
    "article_text": "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer. Last week, the video game developer announcedthe game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn. It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising. But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime. Here are some of the highlights. The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set. We now know a bit more about their backstory. Thenew traileropens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game. According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home. In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\". From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world. We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together. According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\". Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez. Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks. Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades. Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park. In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs. The trailer did not appear to include any gameplay footage, but was made up of cinematic sequences usually seen between story missions. But fans were quick to praise the game's next-generation graphics in the trailer and aseries of screenshots published by Rockstar. Video game trailers are sometimes created using powerful PCs but a note at the end of the trailer said the scenes in it were taken from a PlayStation 5 console. But that doesn't answer questions about new ways of interacting with the game's world, or whether players can switch between characters on-the-fly as they could in GTA 5. The hype around GTA 6 is huge, and Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism. When it announced the delay last week it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\". According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier,the delay was to also to avoid \"crunch\"- a gaming industry term for enforced overtime. The company was previously criticised by some staff over the practice - it accepted that some worked \"long hours\" but said some accounts were exaggerated. When GTA 6's delay was announced, shares in Rockstar's parent company, Take Two Interactive, dropped by 10%. The industry was banking on the game - which will initially be available only on Xbox and PlayStation 5 - to boost console sales and break software sales records. However, having a firm date of 26 May 2026 for GTA 6 means that other publishers can now avoid releasing their own games at the same time.

    "title": "Germany's Merz becomes chancellor after surviving historic vote failure",
    "article_text": "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt. Merz had initially fallen six votes short of the absolute majority he needed on Tuesday morning - a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history. As it was a secret ballot in the 630-seat Bundestag, there was no indication who had refused to back him - whether MPs from his centre-left coalition partner or his own conservatives. After hours of uncertainty in the Bundestag, the parties and the president of the Bundestag agreed to hold a second vote, which Merz then won with 325 votes, a majority of nine. His coalition with the Social Democrats should have had enough seats in parliament from the start, with 328 MPs in total, but it is thought 18 of them dissented during the first vote. No chancellor candidate has lost a Bundestag vote in the 76 years since democracy was restored in Germany in 1949, and there was a prevailing mood of confusion in parliament in the hours after the vote. Under Germany's constitution, there is no limit to how many votes can be held but in practice another defeat for Merz would have meant a headache for his Christian Democrats, its sister party the Christian Social Union and their partner the Social Democrats. The result meant a total debacle had been averted, declared one German news website. Merz, 69, was then sworn in as chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his team of 17 ministers were due to take office. Bundestag President Julia Klöckner had originally been planning a follow-up vote on Wednesday, but Christian Democrat General Secretary Carsten Linnemann said it was important to press ahead. \"Europe needs a strong Germany, that's why we can't wait for days,\" he told German TV. Parliamentary group leader Jens Spahn appealed to his colleagues' sense of responsibility: \"All of Europe, perhaps the whole world, is watching this ballot.\" Merz's defeat had been seen by political commentators as a humiliation, possibly inflicted by a handful of disaffected members of the Social Democrat SPD, which signed a coalition deal with his conservatives on Monday. The Bundestag president told MPs that nine of the 630 MPs had been absent for the first vote while three had abstained and another ballot paper had been declared invalid. Germany's new Europe Minister, Gunther Krichbaum, told the BBC that some MPs may have hoped for a ministerial or state secretary role and had their hopes dashed. He also pointed out that some young Social Democrats had publicly said they were not convinced by Merz. However, SPD officials were adamant their party was fully committed to the coalition deal. \"It was a secret vote so nobody knows,\" senior Social Democrat MP Ralf Stegner told the BBC, \"but I can tell you I don't have the slightest impression that our parliamentary group wouldn't have known our responsibility.\" Krichbaum, a conservative, said the clear message was that \"now we are today in the situation to create a stable government\" to tackle Germany's big issues, including migration and the economy. Far-right party Alternative for Germany, which came second in the February election with 20.8% of the vote, seized on Merz's initial failure and called for fresh elections. Joint leader Alice Weidel wrote on X that the vote showed \"the weak foundation on which the small coalition has been built between the [conservatives] and SPD, which was rejected by voters\". Merz's choice for foreign minister, Christian Democrat colleague Johann Wadephul, told the BBC the initial vote was \"an obstacle but not a catastrophe\". Germany's handover of government is carefully choreographed. On the eve of Tuesday's vote, outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz was treated to a traditional Grand Tattoo by an armed forces orchestra. Merz had then been expected to sail through the initial vote on Tuesday morning, fulfilling a long-held ambition to become German chancellor. His rival and former chancellor Angela Merkel had come to the Bundestag to watch the vote take place. She was not present for the second vote. Among the first international leaders to congratulate Germany's conservative leader was Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, who hoped that Germany would \"grow even stronger and that we'll see more German leadership in European and transatlantic affairs\". Political correspondents in the Bundestag said Merz's initial shock result indicated he had a potential problem lurking within his coalition ranks. AfD MP Bernd Baumann said the CDU had promised a string of policies similar to his own party's, such as limiting migration, and had then gone into an alliance with the centre left: \"That doesn't work. That's not how democracy works.\" \"This isn't good,\" warned Green politician Katrin Göring-Eckardt. \"Even though I don't want this chancellor or support him, I can only warn everyone not to rejoice in chaos.\" Barely 24 hours earlier, the messaging from Merz had been very different, of a new, stable government bringing six months of political paralysis to an end. \"It's our historical duty to make this government a success,\" he had said as he signed the coalition document on Monday. Despite having a narrow majority of 12 seats, the agreement between the conservatives and centre left was seen as far more secure than the so-called traffic-light coalition of three parties that fell apart last November in a row over debt spending. The SPD, which had been the biggest party in the old coalition slumped to its worst post-war election result in third place, but Merz had promised that Germany was back and that he would boost its voice on the world stage and revive a flagging economy. After two years of recession, Europe's largest economy grew in the first three months of 2025. However economists have warned of potential risks to German exports because of US-imposed tariffs. Germany's services sector contracted last month because of weaker demand and lower consumer spending. The chancellor-in-waiting's conservatives have reached a coalition agreement with Germany's Social Democrats, five months after the last government collapsed. The move alters the German constitution, allowing the country to increase its military spending. German MPs could pave the way for huge investments to defend Europe against a threatening Russia. Germany's conservative leader clinches an major financial agreement ahead of a crunch vote in parliament. Germany's likely chancellor-to-be announces a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending.",

    "title": "India trade deal could undercut UK workers, opposition parties say",
    "article_text": "Opposition parties have criticised the new UK-India trade deal, saying it could undercut British workers. One aspect of the free trade agreement, whichLabour says will be worth £5bn a year to the UK, is extending an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years. Known as the double contribution convention, this means people on short-term visas will not make social security payments in both the country they work in, and their home country, when working abroad. Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform have claimed this could mean Indian workers become cheaper to hire than British workers - particularly whenUK employer Nicshave just been increased. The Indian governmentsaid the exemptionwas a \"huge win\" and an \"unprecedented achievement\" that \"will make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK\". The UK has16 agreementspreventing double taxation of work, which cover more than 50 countries - including the US, EU and South Korea - and workers will still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge. Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the arrangement was limited and only applied to inter-company transfers of professionals between the UK and India. \"This is something we have with a great deal of countries already,\" he said. \"It's very specific as to who this applies to, and obviously if people were in the UK they would still be paying income tax, they would still be paying, for instance, the health surcharge and they wouldn't be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system.\" Reynolds added that he believed the cost of the double contribution convention, as part of the trade deal, would be a \"net positive\" to the UK Treasury. The exemption will also apply to British staff, who are increasingly working away from home in India for large corporations. However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains \"two-tier taxes\" which will cost the UK \"hundreds of millions\". \"I had this deal on the table as trade secretary and I refused to sign it because that double taxation agreement was unfair,\" she said. \"It basically encourages workers from India but does not provide the same benefit to UK citizens.\" Pushed on the fact the UK has similar arrangements with other countries, Badenoch stressed that in those cases there were equivalent numbers of UK nationals working in those countries, whereas that was not the case with India, making the agreement \"very lopsided\" which would result in being a \"net cost to the Treasury.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the National Insurance plans were \"half-baked\" and risked damaging UK businesses' competitiveness, particularly  in light of the global trade turmoil sparked by US President Donald Trump. \"This deal risks undercutting British workers at a time when they're already being hammered by Trump's trade war and Labour's misguided jobs tax,\" she said. \"The government's failure to even publish an impact assessment of these changes gives the impression of something that is completely half-baked. \"It shows exactly why Parliament needs the opportunity to debate and vote on trade deals,\" Cooper said. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the deal as \"truly appalling\", adding: \"This government doesn't give a damn about working people. \"The Labour Party has, this time in a big, big way, betrayed working Britain.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said Indian nationals applying for jobs based in the UK would not benefit from the convention, so the tax break does not disadvantage UK workers. \"This deal will provide an annual £4.8bn boost for British businesses, create more jobs, raise wages by more than £2 billion a year and bring down prices for hard-pressed consumers,\" the spokesperson said.

    "article_text": "Rebekah Vardy must pay more than £1.4m of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their libel battle, a judge has said. Mrs Rooney ran up a legal bill totalling more than £1.8m while successfully defending herself against Mrs Vardy's High Court claim in 2022.After Mrs Vardy lost the case, court documents showed she had been ordered to pay 90% of Mrs Rooney's costs. Earlier on Tuesday, a specialist costs court was told that Mrs Vardy had agreed to pay £1.19m to Mrs Rooney, who was also asking for a further £315,000 in \"assessment costs\". Costs judge Mark Whalan then said it was \"reasonable and proportionate\" for Mrs Vardy to pay her an additional £212,266. This took the total to just over £1.4m, including interest. He said he was \"generally happy\" that the outcome represented a \"commercially satisfactory conclusion for both sides\", but noted there had been \"extraordinary expenditure of costs\" by the parties. \"I do mean it when I say that I hope that this is the end of a long and unhappy road.\" Mrs Rooney is the wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney, while Mrs Vardy is married to his former team-mate Jamie Vardy. Both women are now celebrities and TV personalities in their own right. Neither attended the remote hearing, with Judge Whalan declaring they \"can both part to put this matter behind them\". Mrs Vardy's barrister, Juliet Wells, had argued that Mrs Rooney was claiming \"grossly disproportionate\" costs, recommending they were capped at \"no more than £100,000\". In written submissions, Ms Wells said Mrs Rooney's original £1.8m legal bill was \"substandard\" and included costs \"of briefing the press\" and others to which she had \"no entitlement\". But lawyers for Mrs Rooney said in their written submissions that Mrs Vardy was \"the author of her own misfortune\" and that she should \"reflect upon her approach\". The pair are locked in a further battle over how much Rebekah Vardy should pay in legal costs. Dean McCullough is the second contestant to be voted out of the I'm a Celebrity jungle. Last month a judge ruled in favour of Mrs Rooney in a dispute about the legal costs Mrs Vardy must pay. It's a saga worthy of a soap opera, as Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy's dispute returned to court. Test how closely you've been paying attention to what has been going on over the past seven days.",

    "article_text": "King Charles and Queen Camilla have unveiled their new state portraits at the National Gallery on the second anniversary of their Coronation day. The paintings will be displayed in the gallery's Central Hall before moving to Buckingham Palace in June. The portrait of the King shows him wearing the Robe of State alongside his naval uniform with medals, and the Queen is portrayed wearing her coronation dress. There was applause at the gallery on Tuesday as the couple pulled down coverings to reveal both portraits, before stepping back to admire the paintings. The King was painted by Peter Kuhfeld, who has known him for more than 40 years, while the Queen was painted by Paul S. Benney. The robe worn by the King is the one used during the first part of the coronation service. In keeping with tradition, alongside him is the Imperial State Crown.

The King sat for Mr Kuhfeld at St James's Palace five times over a year and a half. There were also two separate sittings with just the crown. \"I've spent quite a long time with him over the years so I'm used to being with him, \" the artist said. \"As a person he's very interesting, he is very understanding of what a painter needs to do the job.\" Mr Benney had six official sittings with the Queen in the Garden Room at Clarence House. He was also allowed to set up a studio there allowing him to meet the Queen informally many times. \"The sittings were extremely pleasurable on my part,\" he said. \"I like to talk when I'm painting… and so we had a lot of chat and stories which we told each other. \"At times I would be holding my tummy from laughing so much. The Queen is very witty.\" Both the King and Queen reacted positively as they looked at the portraits after their unveiling. \"I suppose he thinks it's okay,\" Mr Kuhfeld said. \"You never ask a sitter what they think of their own picture because I'm not sure that they know.\" The Queen could be heard telling Mr Benney about her portrait: \"I think it's really lovely\". He also benefitted from some crucial family support: the Queen's daughter, Laura Lopes, was at the National Gallery for the unveiling and complimented the painting. Mr Benney said: \"The Queen has said nothing but wonderful things about it - but more importantly Laura, her daughter, likes it. \"And you know when the kids like it that you're probably on the right track.\" Sign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysisevery week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

    "title": "EU plans to end Russian gas imports by end of 2027",
    "article_text": "The European Commission has published a \"roadmap\" outlining its plans to end Europe's reliance on Russian energy in the coming years. Under the plans, imports of all Russian gas and liquefied natural gas to European Union member states will be banned by the end of 2027. \"No more will we permit Russia to weaponise energy against us... No more will we indirectly help fill up the [Kremlin's] war chests,\" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a news conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday. In response to the plans, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday that Europe was \"shooting itself in the foot\". The EU vowed to end its energy relations with Russia after Moscowlaunched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. A set of legislative proposals will be tabled in June asking all EU member states to make \"national plans\" to phase out Russian gas, nuclear fuel and oil imports, according to the European Commission. EU member states must submit strategies under the plans for replacing Russian oil imports by the end of 2027. Countries have also been asked to outline strategies for ending their reliance on Russia for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials. The EU hopes to move away from Russian gas by \"enhancing energy efficiency, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and diversifying supplies\", the European Commission said. While EU dependence on Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuels has decreased significantly since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the bloc still imports a significant quantity of its energy from Russia. According to the report, EU gas imports from Russia have decreased from 45% in 2021 to 19% in 2024. The share of Russian oil imports has also shrunk from 27% at the beginning of 2022 to 3% now. Work must be done to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian nuclear supplies, products and services, the report said, with more than 14% of uranium in the EU sourced from Russia in 2024. The EU's reliance on Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel poses \"risks to our economic security\" and financially supports Russia's war economy, the report said. \"We've come far, but not far enough,\" Jorgensen added in Tuesday's news conference, adding that measures to phase out Russian energy would be \"stepwise and gradual\" to minimise the impact on the EU. The roadmap also includes plans to target Russia's use of \"shadow fleets\" – oil tankers \"with obscure ownership and insurance\" that Russia uses to maintain its oil exports and bypass sanctions. Moscow's annual Victory Day commemorations coincide this year with a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine, ordered by Putin. Bulgarians Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov and Katrin Ivanova attended an event in the Palace of Westminster, the BBC finds. Last year was the deadliest for Russian forces since the start of the full-scale war with at least 45,287 killed.

    "title": "'Thank you Inter & Barca' - the game nobody wanted to end",
    "article_text": "Inter Milan will face Paris St-Germain or Arsenal in the final on 31 May \"It gave us everything. From start to finish last week to this week, everything about this semi-final has been pure entertainment,\" said Alan Shearer. For the second time in six days Inter Milan and Barcelona served up a European classic as the champions of Italywon 4-3 on the night- 7-6 on aggregate - to reach the Champions League final. In a thriller that will be remembered for years to come, Barca had trailed 2-0 and 3-2 in the first leg in Catalonia before salvaging a 3-3 draw. On Tuesday in Milan, they were then 2-0 behind at half-time - 5-3 on aggregate - before scoring three times without reply. Raphinha's 87th-minute strike was the first time Barca had taken the lead on aggregate but Francesco Acerbi's first European goal at the age of 37 took an utterly absorbing tie into extra time, with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring the winner to send more than 70,000 Inter fans inside the San Siro into raptures. It was the joint highest-scoring Champions League semi-final ever, with the 13 goals equalling the 2018 semi-final when Liverpool also defeated Roma 7-6 on aggregate. \"We didn't expect this, did we?\" added former England captain Shearer, who was inside the San Siro for Amazon Prime. \"We expected a good game, but this? Thank you Inter Milan, thank you Barcelona for providing us with incredible entertainment and two great football matches. \"What we have witnessed has been something very special. It's been a pleasure to be here.\" Inter will face either Paris St-Germain or Arsenal - who meet in the other semi-final in France on Wednesday (20:00 BST) - after one of the great modern classics. PSG lead 1-0 from the first leg. Inter beat Barcelona in all-time classic to reach Champions League final - reaction Where does Inter v Barca rank among best ever semi-finals? Inter have conceded eight goals in their past three Champions League games No neutrals wanted this tie full of twists and turns to end but, when Polish referee Szymon Marciniak sounded the final whistle at 23:38 local time, Inter Milan's players sank to their knees exhausted but triumphant. They remained on the pitch for a good 15 to 20 minutes after full-time to show their appreciation to their delirious fans, who can start booking flights and hotels for the final in Munich on 31 May. \"Inter were heading out, they were done,\" added Shearer. \"They somehow found a way to get themselves into the final. They deserve to be there.\" Inter's success in this season's competition has been built on dogged resilience and clean sheets. Not against Barcelona. They conceded more goals against the La Liga leaders over 210 minutes than they had in their opening 12 matches in this season's Champions League put together. The three-time winners had kept eight clean sheets in all, with Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer recording seven of those. On Tuesday alone, Barcelona peppered Inter's goal with 22 attempts - 10 on target - and scored three times in the space of 33 minutes. But Inter dug deep to go through with substitute Davide Frattesi scoring his side's extra-time winner. \"What happened? I don't know!\" he said afterwards. \"I celebrated so loudly that my head was spinning.\" Inter's Francesco Acerbi is the second oldest scorer in a Champions League semi-final (37 years & 85 days) after Ryan Giggs for Manchester United against Schalke in 2010-11 (37 years & 148 days) It is 15 years since Inter - managed by Jose Mourinho at the time - were crowned champions of Europe. No Italian side has won the Champions League since that victory over Bayern Munich in 2010. Will that change at the end of the month? While they weren't necessarily the obvious choice to win this year's competition, before a ball was kicked Opta did rate them as third favourites to go all the way behind Real Madrid and Manchester City. With both of those teams already out, Inter are now in the box seat. And they went back in time to reach their second final in three seasons. The 2023 runners-up to Manchester City are unbeaten in 16 home games in the Champions League - their longest undefeated run on their own turf in Europe since the 1980s. \"It was an amazing night,\" said Inter boss Simone Inzaghi. \"One to share with our fans, our club and our families. The players did something extraordinary. \"We played four amazing games against two world-class teams like Bayern [in the quarter-final] and Barcelona. It was great to celebrate this achievement here with our fans.\" Inter's Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries ended with two goals and three assists over the two legs against Barcelona. \"A crazy match again! Seven goals today... it was incredible,\" said Dumfries. Italy midfielder Frattesi added: \"After the game in Munich, I thought I would never experience anything like this again in terms of emotions. \"But that's the beauty of football. It's part of my career; I've always been the first to believe and the last to give up.\" Inter midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu (right) has scored all six of the penalties he has taken in the Champions League Latest Champions League table Champions League scores & fixtures Follow the latest Champions League news Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.

    "article_text": "Kevin de Bruyne has scored 108 goals in 418 appearances for Manchester City Inter Miami have relinquished their option to hold talks with departing Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne - leaving Chicago Fire in pole position to sign him should he decide to move to Major League Soccer. Miami had the 33-year-old on their 'discovery list', meaning they were the only MLS team able to negotiate with him in the United States. They had until mid-July to decide whether to hold talks but sources have told BBC Sport they will not pursue his signing meaning De Bruyne will not link up with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Sergio Busquets. Chicago now have the first option to speak to De Bruyne, who announced in Aprilhe would be leaving Citywhen his current deal expires at the end of the season. Sources say De Bruyne's representatives are to meet with Chicago, who are currently 11th in the Eastern Conference. The Belgian later said he wassurprised not to be offered a new contractby the club.

    "title": "Where does Inter v Barca rank among best-ever semi-finals?",
    "article_text": "In what is already being talked about as one of the greatest Champions League semi-finals of all time, Inter Milanedged past Barcelona 7-6 on aggregateto reach the final in Munich. As one BBC Sport reader messaged to say: \"Football needed that tie.\" But where does it rank among other memorable semi-final showdowns? We've picked 10 of the best - including Tuesday's humdinger at the San Siro - which you can read about below and then rank them in order of your favourite. Davide Frattesi celebrated in spectacular style after putting Inter 7-6 up on aggregate in extra time Inter Milan produced a dramatic late turnaround to beat Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate in a thrilling, all-time classic of a Champions League semi-final. With just two minutes of stoppage time left, Inter trailed 3-2 on the night and were heading out when 37-year-old centre-back Francesco Acerbi smashed a cross into the roof of the net to level the tie. And substitute Davide Frattesi won it for the Italian champions, curling a beautiful left-footed shot into the bottom corner in the first period of extra time. Barca had earlier recovered from 5-3 down on aggregate to lead 6-5 - having also trailed 2-0 and 3-2 during an equally remarkable first leg. Real Madrid beat Liverpool in the final in 2022 A thrilling first leg at Etihad Stadium saw Pep Guardiola overcome his old rivals on his most recent pursuit of Champions League glory. His side battled with Real Madrid to take a 4-3 lead into the second leg. In a game which was not short of chances, Riyad Mahrez extended City's advantage at the Bernabeu to leave Carlo Ancelotti's men needing two goals just to take the tie to extra time. Substitute Rodrygo kick-started an incredible turnaround, putting two efforts past Ederson in as many minutes right at the end of normal time. To Manchester City's disbelief they now had to put up with a fully enthused Madrid side, who managed to grab a place in the Champions League final thanks to a 95th-minute penalty from Karim Benzema. Pure drama. Liverpool went on to beat Tottenham 2-0 in the 2019 final Finalists the previous year, Jurgen Klopp's side looked as though they were heading out after a goal from Luis Suarez and a Lionel Messi double - including a dream free-kick - condemned them to a 3-0 first-leg loss at the Nou Camp. Liverpool needed a second-leg miracle. Usual starters Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino were missing - but up stepped Divock Origi. The striker pulled one back in the first 10 minutes and, as belief rose inside a fervent Anfield, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum popped up with two goals in two minutes to level the tie. Rarely have you seen Barcelona so rattled. Messi was as anonymous as he was omnipresent just a week earlier, and when Origi swept in Trent Alexander-Arnold's quick corner with 11 minutes left the incredible had become reality. Tottenham have not reached the Champions League last four since 2019 Ajax had been the breakout side of 2018-19, beating Real Madrid and Juventus to set up a tie with Tottenham. So it was perhaps no surprise when they left London with a 1-0 lead. In Amsterdam things went from bad to worse for Tottenham. With no Harry Kane up front, they were facing a mountain to climb when Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech made it 3-0 on aggregate before half-time. Lucas Moura inspired a magnificent comeback. The forward scored twice in the space of four minutes to leave the visitors needing one goal to go through, and after Jan Vertonghen had headed against the post, Moura's low drive completed his hat-trick to give his side victory on the away goals rule and set up an all-English final against Liverpool. Robert Lewandowski scored a first-leg treble as Borussia Dortmund knocked out Real Madrid in 2013 This was the first year Jurgen Klopp came to the attention of many in the UK, with Borussia Dortmund scoring twice in added time to beat Malaga in the previous round. Still, they weren't fancied to pull up too many trees against Real Madrid, but produced a remarkable first-leg display at the Westfalenstadion. Robert Lewandowski - who would leave a year later for free - scored four times as Real were routed 4-1. The Polish forward was too mobile for Pepe and Sergio Ramos, scoring a second-half treble in front of the yellow wall. Real needed a 3-0 win in the second leg to go through but a fine performance from Klopp's men looked to have done enough. However, two goals in the last 10 minutes, from Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos, ensured a nervy finale as Dortmund just about hung on. John Terry saw red as Chelsea held on to beat Barcelona in 2012 The first leg at Stamford Bridge saw Barcelona come close, but it was Chelsea, through Didier Drogba, who edged ahead 1-0. Back to the Nou Camp and it was the anchorman Sergio Busquets who popped up with a tap-in to level the aggregate scores. It was one-way traffic and soon Chelsea were seriously up against it when captain John Terry saw red for a knee in the back of Alexis Sanchez. Lionel Messi then teed up Andres Iniesta to make it 2-1 on aggregate and Chelsea needed a goal. Ramires was the unlikely man to find it, a superb finish to chip Victor Valdes - all before half-time. Messi then missed a penalty, planting it against the crossbar, before Barcelona, facing defeat on away goals, were caught on the break. Fernando Torres had the whole half to run into, rounded Valdes and rolled in to cap a remarkable win. Avram Grant led Chelsea to their first Champions League final Chelsea came up against their previous semi-final rivals Liverpool, who knocked them out in the last four in both 2004-05 and 2006-07. In a cagey first leg, Liverpool had a one-goal lead thanks to a close-range shot from Dirk Kuyt. However, Chelsea were offered a lifeline in the dying minutes as John Arne Riise nodded a clearing header into his own net. At Stamford Bridge, Didier Drogba gave the Blues the lead in the opening half but opposing forward Fernando Torres levelled after the break. Extra time was needed and Frank Lampard converted a penalty to put Chelsea 3-2 ahead on aggregate before Drogba stepped up again to score his second of the night. Ryan Babel's audacious effort reduced the deficit but it was not enough and Liverpool would not make another semi-final until 2017-18. Kaka scored three goals over the two legs A fantastic start to the tie for Manchester United saw Cristiano Ronaldo put them ahead in the first 10 minutes. But then Kaka entered the scene. The 2007 Ballon d'Or winner collected a pass and glided past United with ease before planting a fine low shot into the far corner. It was a Kaka masterclass and the Brazilian added a beautiful solo goal with his flair too much for United defenders Gabriel Heinze and Patrice Evra. Wayne Rooney did get a leveller and then powered in a superb shot from long range in stoppage time to give United a slender 3-2 lead at the halfway stage of the tie. At the San Siro, it was Kaka once again who proved the difference and his delicious left-footed drive put Milan back ahead on away goals early on. Clarence Seedorf then beat Edwin van der Sar from the edge of the area and Alberto Gilardino provided the coup de grace. Alessandro del Piero starred as Juventus squeezed past Real Madrid in 2003 The first leg was in Madrid and Ronaldo opened the scoring with a superb finish from the edge of the area. Juventus grabbed an away goal on the stroke of half-time when David Trezeguet stabbed in a deflected shot from Alessandro del Piero. Real were back in front when Roberto Carlos' piledriver went through a sea of players and it was on to Turin. Trezeguet spurred Juve's second-leg comeback as his close-range effort put the home side ahead on away goals. Real needed a goal, on came Ronaldo, and he won a penalty with a trademark body swerve. Up stepped Luis Figo, but Gianluigi Buffon saved his spot-kick. It was the key moment as within five minutes Pavel Nedved had outpaced Fernando Hierro to fire in, and while Zinedine Zidane scored against his old team, it was too late. Andrew Cole sealed Man Utd's memorable win against Juventus in 1999 The 1999 Treble win for Manchester United is etched into the public consciousness, even if the final against Bayern Munich was largely quite dull - until the incredible finale. The two-legged semi-final against Juventus was dramatic from start to finish. The first leg at Old Trafford saw future Chelsea boss Antonio Conte strike the Italian giants into an early lead before a second-half United siege finally bore fruit when Ryan Giggs hammered into the roof of the net in the last minute. With the tie all square at 1-1, Juve were favourites in the second leg, even more so when Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Game over? Nobody told Roy Keane. His header gave United hope and he led by example throughout, despite picking up a yellow card that would rule him out of the final. Dwight Yorke headed United level on the night - and ahead on away goals - before half-time in this classic encounter. Inzaghi had a hat-trick 'goal' correctly ruled out for offside, before Andrew Cole tapped in to seal a famous win for United.

    "title": "Fatal Supersport crash - what happened and what next?",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Drone footage of track where two riders died in motorcycle race Two riders died after an 11-bike crash during the British Supersport Championship race at Oulton Park on Monday. Owen Jenner, 21, and Shane Richardson, 29, werefatally injured in a \"major chain reaction\" incidenton the first lap of the race and a third rider Tom Tunstall, 47, sustained a broken neck and remains in a serious condition. The race was halted on the first lap after what series director Stuart Higgs later called a \"severe and catastrophic\" incident as he announced the event was cancelled. BBC Sport looks at what happened and what is next for the sport. Just moments after the start of the race, one bike wobbled before going down and skidding towards the middle of track as the riders exited the first corner. That led to a collision that eventually became an 11-bike crash with oncoming riders unable to avoid the fallen bikes. The race was being broadcast live on TNT Sports but cameras cut away from the track following the crash. Motorsport Vision Racing (MSVR), who are responsible for circuit operations at Oulton Park in Cheshire, said Jenner was treated at the track but died from \"a catastrophic head injury\". Richardson was also treated at the track and taken to Royal Stoke University Hospital with severe chest injuries but died prior to arrival. Simon Patterson, a MotoGP journalist, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It just seems there's been a chain reaction on the exit of turn one of Oulton Park, which isn't a particularly scary or aggressive corner. \"But unfortunately, as we've seen multiple times all around the world, as motorcycle racing has become safer, as organisers have done more to reduce the risk of injuries in bike racing, the one thing that is very, very difficult to protect against is when you get multiple riders falling together and the risk of people getting struck by oncoming machinery. \"I think that's exactly what's happened in this situation. It's super unusual to see so many riders fall together.\" Former rider and MLav Racing owner Michael Laverty told BBC Sport: \"Where the incident happened everyone's accelerating so you're probably about 90 to 100mph at that point, which honestly doesn't feel that fast when you're on a motorbike. \"But because it's a mass start, so everyone starts together, 30 or 32 riders on a grid, whatever the class numbers dictate. \"So as they come out of turn one, the rider who crashed was around about eighth or ninth place I think exiting turn one and unfortunately they've got 20 more riders behind and they're slightly blindsided by the rider in front. \"We've had it in MotoGP where it's been another rider hits a stricken rider on the ground. \"There's no way possible in our sport to mitigate for that circumstance. So unfortunately the two riders were prone in the track and got collected by the oncoming traffic.\" Tributes paid to two riders killed in motorcycle race Jenner and Richardson 'will never be forgotten' Englishman Owen Jenner and Shane Richardson, of New Zealand, died in the crash at Oulton Park, Cheshire British rider Jenner, from Crowborough in East Sussex, began his racing career in Junior Motorcross. He then progressed to the tarmac, winning the 2018 Team Green, 2020 Junior Supersport and 2023 Junior Superstock titles. He joined the Kramer Team for the 2024 British GP2 season, winning the title with 18 wins out of 20 race finishes. Jenner signed for Rapid Honda in November 2024 and in announcing his death, the team said it felt \"sadness beyond words\". Astro-JJR Hippo Suzuki rider Richardson grew up in the town of Lower Hutt, just north of Wellington on New Zealand's north Island, before moving to the UK. He has been a joiner since the age of 16 and ran a joinery business alongside his racing career. He began racing in 2013 and within four years was competing at international events such as the MotoAmerica championship in the United States. In 2019, he joined his girlfriend Hannah James in the UK, where his two children, Maddie and Max, were born. Tunstall, 47, is in the Royal Stoke Hospital with a broken bone in his neck while five riders suffered minor injuries and the other three were not injured. On Tunstall, MSVR said in a statement on Tuesday: \"While his condition is serious, he is stable and receiving the best possible treatment. \"Doctors are closely monitoring his progress and will determine in the coming days whether surgery will be necessary. At this time, a slow but hopefully full recovery is expected.\" After the crash, Tunstall was said to have \"significant back and abdominal injuries\". Riders Carl Harris, Max Morgan, Cameron Hall, Freddie Barnes and Morgan McLaren-Wood were treated for minor injuries at the circuit medical centre. Lewis Jones, Corey Tinker and George Edwards were also involved in the accident but did not suffer injury. The event at Oulton Park was the first of the 2025 British Superbikes season, with a further seven rounds set to take place across the UK before three 'showdown' events. Jenner and Richardson were racing in the Supersport Championship, which is a support class to the main British Superbike series. \"If you consider Formula 1's your pinnacle and in motorbike racing we have Motor GP that parallels, then you've got World Superbikes probably the second tier and then British Superbike is one of the top national championships in the world,\" former rider and MLav Racing owner Michael Laverty told BBC Sport. \"You've got the Superbike class and then the Supersport would be the second tier. \"So the riders are a very, very high calibre of rider, all completely aware and in control of their motorcycle.\" MSVR and the Motorcycle Racing Control Board said on Monday that they are \"investigating the full circumstances of the incident in conjunction with the Coroner and Cheshire Constabulary\". A Cheshire Police statement read: \"Police are investigating two deaths on behalf of the coroner following a multiple collision at Oulton Park this afternoon. \"Emergency services were called to the scene following the collision which resulted in two riders being fatally injured and another with serious injuries.\" Superbikes can reach speeds of up to 200mph and even the slightly less powerful bikes used in Supersport regularly clock well in excess of 100mph so there is inherently some risk in the sport. Fatalities are rare but sadly not unheard of. In 2022, British Superbikes riderChrissy Rouse died after a crash at Donington Park. Patterson added: \"I can't remember it happening to this level in top-level racing for a very, very long time but unfortunately it didn't go according to plan yesterday, and the outcome is absolutely tragic. \"There are always going to be inherent risks to racing motorcycles at speed and as much as we can do to find solutions to those problems and mitigate those risks, there will be some of them that still remain.\" Laverty added: \"We're not an outlier, it happens in other sports. Unfortunately, our sport is a little bit of a niche sport globally and especially in the UK, and then we get headlines whenever tragic incidents like this happen.\" There have been a number of changes made in recent times to try and make the sport safer. \"I've grown up with within the sport, I've lost a few friends. You accept the risk as part of the sport, it is inherently dangerous,\" Laverty said. \"We do everything we can to mitigate the risk in terms of our safety equipment, how the riders ride on track, how the event organizers prepare the riders, whether it's young riders on race track, how they look out for their fellow competitors, how they conduct themselves, how the marshalling is second to none.\" Patterson added: \"We've seen really important steps in the last few years in motorcycle racing. \"Things like all the riders now having airbag systems installed inside their suits that detonate immediately upon detecting an impact or before an impact to reduce internal damage. \"We've seen improved safety standards for things like helmets. We've seen more and more mandated top-quality rider protection equipment, both on the riders and on the side of the track.\" The next event of the British Supersport Championship season is at Donnington Park from 16 to 18 May. However, a number of riders will be travelling to Northern Ireland for theNorth West 200with qualifying getting under way on Wednesday. \"I think the best way we can respect the fallen is to go out there and do what we do best and what we love,\" Laverty added. \"Obviously honour them, respect them, support the families and teams that have been affected, but we'll be back on the race track in two weeks time at Donnington Park and we'll go and race with their memories in all of our hearts.\" Peter Hickman, a winner in the British Superbike Championship, North West 200 and Isle of Man TT, told BBC Sport NI: \"Yesterday was tragic, there are no other words to describe it. Both of the guys I knew fairly well and the whole paddock is in mourning. \"We've got to clear it out of our minds as riders and ride in their memory. If that's something we can do, that's something we will do.\"",

A see-saw match looked to have gone the way of Mumbai when a second rain delay stopped Gujarat's chase with another 24 runs needed from 12 balls - the visitors behind on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method. But the rain stopped and Gujarat's target was adjusted to 147, leaving them 15 to get from the final six balls as the match resumed moments before the cut-off at 00:30 local time. Rahul Tewatia hit the first ball for four and two balls later Gerald Coetzee slammed a straight six to leave four to get from three balls. Bowler Deepak Chahar then overstepped to gift the Titans another run, only for Coetzee to be caught off the penultimate ball with the scores level. New batter Arshad Khan scrambled the one run needed from the last ball for the Titans, although Mumbai skipper Hardik Pandya still could have forced a super over but missed with his throw from mid-on when a direct hit would have run out Arshad. The Titans won by three runs via the DLS method. \"It is quite remarkable,\" former England bowler Steven Finn said on BBC Radio 5 Live commentary. \"One over, 15 needed, Coetzee hammers it for six and the tables turned immediately. This game really did have everything apart from a super over.\" Titans captain Shubman Gill said: \"There were a lot of emotions, most of them frustrating because at one point we were ahead of the game and it felt like one of those Test match sessions that don't go your way. \"Everything worked out well for us. \"Even after this with so much chaos, wins like these are what get you through in a big tournament.\" Who needs what to reach IPL play-offs? IPL 2025 points table and top run-scorers & wicket-takers Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport That all came after the visitors were cruising at 107-2 in pursuit of 156 until the first rain delay, after which they lost 4-25 in four overs amid an electric spell of fast bowling from Mumbai's quicks. Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets, Trent Boult one and Ashwani Kumar the other - all of which was in vain for Mumbai who also would have topped the table with a win. Former England captain Jos Buttler scored 30 for the Titans before the rain with a partner of 72 with Gill helped by an 11-ball over from Hardik that included two no-balls and three separate wides. \"My no-balls, and the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20 it is a crime,\" said Hardik. \"It bites you. \"The ball kept getting wetter - I don't know if it helped us or not. It was difficult.\" Also wasted by Mumbai was 53 from 35 balls by England all-rounder Will Jacks in Mumbai's 155-8. Jacks, whose fifty was his first for the franchise, put on 73 with Suryakumar Yadav but Mumbai lost 6-58 after Suryakumar was dismissed for 35. The Titans move level on points with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, but sit top of the table courtesy of their superior net run-rate. Mumbai stay in the play-off places in fourth but, having played a game more than those below them, have work to do to qualify for the play-offs.

    "title": "Arsenal need 'big balls and magic moments' - Rice",
    "article_text": "Declan Rice scored in Arsenal's defeat by Bournemouth on Saturday Declan Rice says Arsenal need \"big balls\" and \"magic moments\" if they are to overturn their semi-final deficit against Paris St-Germain and reach the Champions League final. Mikel Arteta's side face the French champions in Paris on Wednesday (20:00 BST) afterlosing the first leg 1-0courtesy of Ousmane Dembele's early strike at Emirates Stadium last week. Arsenal are attempting to reach their first Champions League final since 2006. \"We need to have big balls and we need to go out there on the biggest stage and show that we're ready to play at this level,\" said Rice. He added: \"It's a semi-final, it's 90 minutes away from a final - I think that tells you everything you need to know. \"I think the manager spoke to us - us as a group of players know what we can achieve tomorrow night and it's a game of football. \"We can go out there and we can achieve something great for this club and that's what we want to do. We obviously know we're 1-0 down but we have full belief, full positivity that we're going to go out there and win tomorrow night.\" PSG's Dembele fit for second leg against Arsenal Why Arsenal can still reach Champions League final What Arteta and Arsenal learned from loss to PSG Arsenal struggled to contain PSG in the early stages of the first leg but Rice said, after Arteta made changes, he and his team-mates are full of confidence that they can get a result. \"You felt in the first leg there was a lot of movement in midfield. They [PSG] run around so much and create a lot of space for each other,\" he said. \"The way they move between the lines was really, really smart. But once we worked out how we could beat them - obviously we missed a few chances, but in terms of how we were driving with the ball, giving our winners one-on-one opportunities, chances started to open up. \"I think tomorrow night we need to do the same.\" Rice has played a big part in Arsenal reaching this stage of the competition. The England internationalscored two free-kicksin the 3-0 quarter-final first-leg victory over Real Madrid and received the player of the match award in both ties. He said manager Arteta speaks regularly to his players about producing in high-pressure situations. \"He always talks about having someone delivering a magic moment,\" Rice said. \"I think in that game against Madrid, obviously I was able to produce two free-kicks, which were incredible. \"But tomorrow night, a semi-final is set up for someone else to maybe get that magic moment. \"Hopefully it's me again, but you're going to need a moment of magic to win a game, and as a team we're going to need that. \"So tomorrow night hopefully we can deliver something special.\" The Champions League is Arsenal's last chance to win a trophy this season now that Liverpool have secured the Premier League title. Arsenal lost to Bournemouth in the Premier League at the weekend but Arteta says his team have \"huge enthusiasm and huge energy\" that they can progress to the European final. \"We are a win away from being in the Champions League final and in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, against a great opponent - it doesn't get much better than that,\" he said. \"We are here to make history - we have a big opportunity tomorrow. \"We bring a result [from the first leg] that gives us so much clarity about what we have to do. A lot of learning from the first leg as well and how small the margins are between the two teams. \"The result, in my opinion, should have been very different to that one. So tomorrow, another opportunity to prove that and the right to be in the final.\" When asked if this game was his biggest since he became Arsenal manager in 2019, Arteta said it is \"one of the most beautiful, for sure\". \"I mean, again, one win away from being in the final,\" he added. \"Let's not do the talking - let's do that tomorrow on that pitch at 9pm when the game starts to show [our] best, best, best, best version and win the game.\" Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views Get Arsenal news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Sudan to cut ties with United Arab Emirates over alleged RSF support",
    "article_text": "Sudan’s security and defence council has declared that it will break diplomatic relations with theUnited Arab Emiratesover its alleged backing of the paramilitary Sudanese Rapid Support Forces. During a televised speech on Tuesday, Sudan’s defence minister, Yassin Ibrahim, saidSudanwas “severing diplomatic relations with the UAE” and recalling its ambassador, claiming the Gulf nation had breached Sudan’s sovereignty through its RSF “proxy”, which has been fighting the army in a bloody civil war since April 2023. The UAE insists it does not provide arms to the RSF, and on Monday fended off an attempt to persuade the international court of justice in The Hague toexamine Sudan’s claims the UAE was complicit in a genocide in Darfur. The ICJ said it could not examine the claim because the UAE, a party to the genocide convention, had put in a reservation that prevented the ICJ adjudicating on claims that the UAE had breached the convention. Sudan’s diplomatic move came as alliance of aid agencies working in Sudan expressed deep concern about what it described as “the deliberate targeting of critical infrastructure in Port Sudan”, the main artery for aid into the north African country. A succession of drone and missile attacks, starting on 4 May, have hit Port Sudan international airport, fuel storage facilities, the maritime port and at least one hotel, as well as water and power facilities, in direct violation of the fundamental principles of distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law, the NGOs said. They said: “These assaults have caused widespread fires, heavy smoke over residential areas, and flight cancellations, further endangering the lives and wellbeing of thousands of innocent civilians.” Since the conflict’s outset, aid agencies have depended on Port Sudan – and particularly its airport and seaport – as the main conduit for international assistance. It has also become the home to many internationally displaced people relocated from different states. TheUnited Nationshas been forced to suspend humanitarian flights to Port Sudan after these strikes, a step that will inevitably limit the delivery of lifesaving aid. The agencies said damage to power stations was also forcing them to rely on generator power, raising concerns about looming fuel shortages. They said: “Further bombardment of energy and water infrastructure will deepen the risk of disease outbreaks, malnutrition, and protection crises among the most vulnerable, including women, children, and the elderly. It will also severely constrain aid agencies’ ability to respond to the growing needs in Sudan. “We urge all parties to the conflict to fully respect their obligations under the Geneva conventions, to differentiate between military objectives and civilian objects, and to facilitate unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas in need.” A British-led effort to set up a contact group among the external states both in the region and in the west to help take the first steps to create a broad roadmap for peace foundered at a London conference, partly due to differences between the UAE and Egypt.",

    "title": "Rwandan talks with US over deported migrants are chance to expand its influence",
    "article_text": "Talks between Rwanda and the US to host deported migrants are the latest move by the African country to position itself as a useful option for the anti-migration policies of allied governments. Previous high-profile attempts, however, including with the UK, Israel and Denmark, failed after becoming beset by controversy. On Sunday, the Rwandan foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe,saidthe talks with Washington DC were in the early stages. He told state TV: “Those reports are true. We are engaged in discussions with the government of the United States of America.” The US-based Handbasket newsletterfirst reporteddiscussions between Rwanda and the US last month, citing a US State Department cable saying Rwanda had agreed to take in deportees who were unable to be sent to their home countries for fear of persecution. Although details about the planned deal are scant, this is not the first time thatRwandahas explored such an arrangement for resettlement. In 2022, the countryentered an agreement with the previous Tory UK governmentto receive asylum seekers from Britain. Under the deal, asylum claims would be processed in Rwanda. Successful applicants would remain there, while unsuccessful ones would be given the option to leave Rwanda or receive residency. The agreement, which included plans for financial support for relocation and accommodation, faced legal challenges as well as criticism from opposition politicians and human rights activists. The previous government said it would tackle illegal migrationand aid Rwandan development. But critics said it was unlawful and posed risks for the safety of refugees. The deal, whichcost the UK hundreds of millions of pounds, eventually fell through when Keir Starmercancelled itafter the Labour party came into power last year. In his address on Sunday, Nduhungirehe acknowledged Rwanda’s previous experience with similar migration plans, saying the US idea was “not something new to us”. Rwanda was also previously involved in a programme between 2014 and 2017 to take African asylum seekers from Israel. The agreement was shrouded in secrecy, but details started emerging in 2018 as Israel’s supreme court weighed whether to approve a programme to give African migrants the option of a cash incentive for deportation or be detained indefinitely. In 2017, Volker Türk, the assistant high commissioner for protection at the UN refugee agency, said 4,000 people from Eritrea and Sudan had been relocated under the 2014-17 programme to two African countries “named in media reports as Rwanda and Uganda”. The scheme collapsed whenIsrael’s supreme court suspended deportations in 2018. Rwanda has also explored a migration deal with Denmark. After the European country’spassage of a lawto process asylum seekers outside Europe in 2021, the two countries announced that they were looking at establishing a programme for the transfer of asylum seekers arriving in Denmark to Rwanda for consideration of their asylum applications and protection, with the option of settling in Rwanda. They said: “The current global asylum and migration system is dysfunctional and a new approach is required.” Critics condemned it, saying Denmark was shifting responsibility for refugee protection. In 2023, the country paused the plan, seeking to work with other EU countries in a regional solution. Paul Kagame has in the past defended migration plans to send people to Rwanda. Speaking on state television in 2022, the Rwandan president said: “We are not involved in buying and selling of people, with the UK or anybody. It’s just a problem that needs to be solved and Rwanda is ready to help.” The latest talks with the US present an opportunity for the country to financially leverage the migrant crisis in the west as well as expand its geopolitical influence. Notably, the discussions are happening at a time when the US is pushing Rwanda and theDemocratic Republic of the Congoto enter bilateral economic agreements with the US that would bring western investment to support mining in the countries. The proposed deals are part of a US-led process to endfighting in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, where Rwanda has been accused of fuelling the conflict by backing rebels.",

    "article_text": "Nigerians, Pakistanis and Sri Lankans applying to work or study in the UK faceHome Officerestrictions over suspicions that they are most likely to overstay and claim asylum, Whitehall officials have claimed. The government is working with the National Crime Agency to build models to profile applicants from these countries who are likely to go on to claim asylum. Whether such a scheme would be successful depends on the strength of the models and the intelligence they work with, according to a migration expert. Nearly 10,000 asylum claimants who had arrived in the UK legally on work or study visas were living in taxpayer-funded accommodation, such as hotels, at some point last year. Datadisclosed by the Home Office in Marchshowed that of those asylum seekers who had originally entered on a visa but then ended up in government accommodation, the most common nationalities were Pakistan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka. The Guardianrevealedon Saturday that the government planned to reduce the numbers of UK student visa holders who make asylum claims. Officials will be instructed to use the bank statements submitted by visa holders as part of their assessment when deciding whether to grant them asylum accommodation. According tothe Times, the Home Office is attempting to build intelligence to enable caseworkers to spot patterns in the profiles of people who are most likely to abuse work and study visas as a loophole to claim asylum. They have earmarked Pakistani, Nigerian and Sri Lankan visa holders as the most likely to go on to apply for asylum. Officials are working with the NCA to build a model that would reject a visa claim from a person who fits the profile of someone likely to go on to claim asylum. Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said it was difficult to assess whether the government and the NCA would be able to create such a model. “The key question, and one that is hard to assess from the outside, is do they have the information to accurately decide who is likely to claim asylum after they arrive. Because obviously it can be quite difficult. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “Whether it’s effective will depend on whether patterns are obvious enough for them to accurately be able to do it, or whether it will lead to some more arbitrary outcomes. Without being on the inside, it really is difficult to know. “I could imagine scenarios where it could have quite a big impact. I can also imagine scenarios where it actually only affects a relatively small number of people,” she said. Asked if the government’s plans could lead to legal challenges on the grounds of discrimination, Sumption said: “I’m not a lawyer, but the government has a fair amount of discretion on work and study to decide whether someone gets a visa or not when someone’s coming from outside of the country. “There are cases when there are potentially some legal avenues, but broadly speaking the government is allowed to discriminate on many different grounds when granting work and study visas.”",

    "title": "Drone strikes hit Port Sudan airport and army base in third day of attacks",
    "article_text": "Drones have struck the airport and targeted an army base in PortSudan, officials said, the third straight day the seat of power of the government, which is aligned with the Sudanese army, has come under attack. The country’s main fuel depot was hit on Monday, causing a massive blaze just south of the eastern city that had until Sunday been considered a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of displaced people fleeing a two-year war. An Agence France-Presse correspondent reported loud explosions at dawn on Tuesday and plumes of smoke over the coastal city, one coming from the direction of the port and another from a fuel depot just south. One drone struck the civilian section of the Port Sudan airport, an airport official told Agence France-Press, two days after the facility’s military base was first attacked in drone strikes the army blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). All flights were grounded at the wartorn country’s main international port of entry, the source added. Another drone targeted the main army base in the city centre, an army source said, while witnesses reported a nearby hotel was hit. Both sites are close to the residence of Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who has been at war with his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the commander of the RSF, since April 2023. A third drone hit a fuel depot near the southern port in the densely populated city centre, where the UN, aid agencies and hundreds of thousands of displaced people have relocated from Khartoum. Witnesses in the city’s north reported anti-aircraft fire from a military base. The RSF has increasingly relied on drones since losing territory including nearly all of Khartoum in March, attacking deep into army-held territory. Explosions were heard early on Tuesday morning across Port Sudan, where the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday reports of paramilitary attacks were a “worrying development threatening the protection of civilians and humanitarian operations”. Nearly all humanitarian aid into Sudan, where famine has already been declared andnearly 25 million people are suffering dire food insecurity, arrives in Port Sudan. At the airport, where Sudanese airlines had resumed flights after Sunday’s strike, “fires broke out in multiple buildings” following the explosion, a traveller told AFP. The army source said the strike had also “targeted fuel depots at the airport”. The RSF has in recent weeks attacked civilian infrastructure across the army-controlled north-east, causing widespread blackouts for millions of people. Since it began, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 13 million and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. It has effectively split the country in two, with the army controlling the centre, north and east while the RSF holds nearly all of the vast region of Darfur and, with its allies, parts of the south. According to experts, the RSF’s increased reliance on drones since its loss of Khartoum has highlighted its reach and hindered the army’s supply line. The RSF has used both makeshift and highly advanced drones, which the army accuses the United Arab Emirates of supplying. The international court of justice on Mondaythrew out a case brought by Sudan against the UAE, accusing it of complicity in genocide by supporting the RSF.Sudan’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it “respected” the ruling, which came on the basis of the ICJ’s lack of jurisdiction due to the UAE’s 2005 “reservation” on the UN genocide convention.",

    "article_text": "Rwanda confirmed on Monday that discussions were “underway” with the United States regarding a potential agreement to host deported migrants. Rwanda’s foreign minister, Olivier Nduhungirehe, told state media on Sunday that the talks were in the “early stage.” When asked by the Associated Press on Monday, he confirmed the talks. Nduhungirehe did not disclose the specifics of the potential deal for Rwanda, but previous local media reports suggest that the US would likely fund a program to have migrants integrated into the society through stipends and job assistance initiatives. The minister said a migrant deal between Rwanda and the US would be consistent with Rwanda’s longstanding commitment to humanitarian cooperation and the pursuit of migration solutions. The US state department declined to comment on a potential deal with Rwanda, but said engagement with foreign governments was an important part of the US government’s policy to deter illegal migration. This wouldn’t be Rwanda’s first time hosting deported migrants. The east African nation previously had anagreement with the UKto host migrants. Plans for the initiative, including prepared accommodations, were in the final stagesbut the deal collapsedafter the Labour party took office in 2024. Asimilar plan in Australiaalso failed. Rwanda has faced allegations of human rights abuses and is in the process of brokering a peace deal with the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have been behind attacks in the mineral rich eastern Congo region. Nduhungirehe told state media on Sunday that Rwanda and Congo had already submitted their respective draft proposals, which will form the basis of a final peace agreement document expected to be signed in the US next month.",

    "title": "Identity of second man illegally deported to El Salvador prison revealed",
    "article_text": "The identity of a second man illegally deported from the US by theTrump administrationin defiance of a court order and now in detention inEl Salvadorhas been revealed. Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan, was deported to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot terrorism confinement facility in March under the White House’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act,Politico reported. His deportation came after authorities declared him, along with about 240 other men, to be a member of Tren de Aragua, aVenezuelangang that the US government has defined as a terrorist organization. Lozano-Camargo’s family members deny that he has gang affiliations. Politico revealed Lozano-Camargo’s identity after a Maryland judgelast month ruledthat the Trump administration had improperly removed him in violation of a 2024 legal settlement that forbade immigration authorities from deporting him while his application for asylum was pending. The judge, Stephanie Gallagher, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, ordered officials to “facilitate” Lozano-Camargo’s return to the US. So far, the administration has not complied. He is reported to have entered the US in 2022 as an asylum seeker, initially spending time in a facility for underage migrants until he turned 18. According to Politico, he was subsequently twice arrested for possession of cocaine, most recently last November, and was sentenced in January to 120 days in prison. It was from there that he was transferred to the custody of the Immigration, Customs and Enforcement authority (Ice), which filed an application for his detention, claiming that he was in the country illegally. In her ruling, Gallagher agreed with immigrant rights advocates that Lozano-Camargo should not have been deported until his asylum application was resolved. While withholding his identity by referring to him only by a pseudonym, “Cristian”, she said he was “fleeing danger and threats in Venezuela”. Politico said Lozano-Camargo’s identity was disclosed in metadata embedded in government court filings. A justice department court filing released on Monday disputed the judge’s assessment, saying he belonged to “a violent terrorist gang”, thus disqualifying him from asylum in the US. Bringing him back to the US “would no longer serve any legal or practical purpose”, justice department lawyers wrote. Gallagher was due to further rule on the matter in a Baltimore court on Tuesday. Lozano-Camargo’s case resembles that ofKilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland resident who was deported to El Salvador in March despite a previous court order issued in 2019 establishing that he had protected status because he was at risk of violence if he was returned to the country of his origin. Ábrego García is Salvadorian by birth. The US government, which has claimed that he is a member of the MS-13 gang – something Ábrego García denies – admitted that he had been deported by mistake but has defied court orders to return him to the US. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Ábrego García was removed from the US on the same set of flights as Lozano-Camargo but has been transferred from Cecot to another facility because of the international publicity surrounding his case. Lozano-Camargo’s family has tried to draw attention to his plight in social media posts. His mother, Daniela, has proclaimed his innocence in a tearful Facebook video. Possessing a valid work permit, he is said to have been living in Houston and washing cars for a living before his detention. His deportation was among thosehighlighted by the Guardianin March, amid speculation that he was one of hundreds of Venezuelans singled out for removal on the basis of their tattoos, which authorities claimed identified them as members of Tren de Aragua. Lozano-Camargo is said to have several tattoos, including one bearing the name of his father – who died when he was a child. Critics say Tren de Aragua members do not use tattoos to advertise their membership of the gang.",

    "title": "Trump says ‘we just want to be friends’ as Canada PM torpedoes 51st state idea",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumphas said he “just want[s] to be friends withCanada” after his first post-election meeting with the country’s prime minister,Mark Carney– who used the gathering to shoot down any prospect of his country becoming the 51st state. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump praised Carney – whose Liberal party won the federal election last week – for one of the “greatest political comebacks of all time”, and described the prime minister’s visit as “an honour” for the White House. The amicable tone of Tuesday’s meeting marked a stark contrast with Trump’s hostile rhetoric over recent months, as he launched a trade war against his northern neighbour, belittled Carney’s predecessor,Justin Trudeau, and made repeated threats to crush Canada’s economy with the aim of annexing it. Carney returned the praise, telling Trump he was a “transformational president” with a strong focus on the economy. But he shot down any idea thatCanadamight accede to joining the US as the 51st state – a proposal again floated by Trump in the meeting. “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Carney told Trump. “That’s true,” said Trump. “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign … it’s not for sale,” said Carney. “Won’t be for sale, ever.” “Never say never,” said Trump. Carney smiled and mouthed “never, never, never, never.” The meeting between the prime minister and president is probablythe most closely watched summit in Canada’s history, amid fears of further diplomatic and trading friction between two countries which have traditionally shared political and cultural values. Minutes before the meeting, Trump posted on social media that he “very much” wants to work with Carney, but revived a debunked figure that the US is “subsidizing Canada by $200 Billion Dollars a year, in addition to giving them FREE Military Protection”. “We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain,” he wrote. “They, on the other hand, need EVERYTHING from us! The Prime Minister will be arriving shortly and that will be, most likely, my only question of consequence.” Carney crafted much of his successful federal election campaign around a patriotic defiance to the US president’s threats to the nation’s sovereignty. The prime minister has repeatedly accused Trump of trying to “break” Canada so that he can “own” the country. Carney also used his first post-election press conference to once again quash any idea Canada was interested in becoming the 51st US state, a proposal repeatedly floated by Trump. “It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” Carney said last week. But Carney has throughout steered clear of criticizing the president personally, acutely aware the two countries also share a tightly integrated economy, with more than C$1tn (US$725bn) in trade – and that US diplomacy depends more than ever on the whims of its president. The country’s trade relationship came up during the meeting, with Trump signalling he was interested in renegotiating key aspects of USMCA free trade agreement, calling the prior deal, Nafta, the “worst in the history of the world”. “We’re dealing more with concepts right now,” Trump said later in the meeting, telling reporters he didn’t want Canadian cars or steel. “We want to do it ourselves.” Asked if there was anything Carney could say to him that would make him lift the tariffs on Canada, Trump replied: “No.” Carney pushed back on Trump’s characterization of the current deal, including the use of tariffs by US officials, but agreed the existing deal was a “framework” for future talks and a “bigger discussion”. The prime minister later described his discussions with Trump as “very constructive,” and said they would at the G7 summit in Canada next month. He also told reporters that he had asked Trump to stop referring to Canada as a part of the United States.

Trump was equally positive in his framing of the meeting, telling reporters after it went “very well” and set the stage for further talks. “We want to do what’s right for our respective peoples, and that’s what’s going to happen,” he said. “As far as calling him governor Carney, no, I haven’t done that yet, and maybe I won’t. I did have a lot of fun with Trudeau. But I think this is, this is a big step up, it’s a good step up for Canada.” Travelling with Carney were some of the country’s top trade and diplomatic officials, including the international trade minister, Dominic LeBlanc, foreign affairs minister, Mélanie Joly, public safety minister, David McGuinty and Canada’s ambassador to the US, Kirsten Hillman. Seated alongside Trump were his vice-president, JD Vance; the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the US secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick; and the US trade representative Jamieson Greer. Trump, who at times used the meeting to attack the former US president Joe Biden, also used the forum to criticize Trudeau and the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland. “She was terrible. Actually, she was a terrible person, and she really hurt that deal very badly because she tried to take advantage of the deal and she didn’t get away with it,” said Trump. Before Carney and Trump met at the White House, Canadian provincial leaders weighed in. “This guy drives me nuts,” Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said of Trump. “You see this guy on TV, ‘We don’t need Canada.’ Really?” he said, telling attenders that Canada’s largest trading partner desperately needed potash, nickel and uranium. Ford, a populist conservative who has embraced his role as a patriotic anti-Trump figure, said a growing number of US governors “totally disagree” with the president’s trade war with its northern neighbour. Ford pointed to fresh polling that shows a drop in Trump’s approval rating as the cost of tariffs hit American consumers. “I can’t wait for the midterms. Then we’ll fix his little red wagon,” he said.",

    "title": "Trump and Carney to meet at White House in closely watched encounter",
    "article_text": "Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, was due to meet with the US president,Donald Trump, on Tuesday in a closely watched encounter at the White House that could hint at the future relationship between the two countries and their two leaders. Over the weekend, Trump said it was “highly unlikely” he would use military force to annexCanada, a key trading partner and political ally. In recent months, the president has repeatedly threatened to use economic coercion to weaken Canada to the point that it accedes to Trump’s wish to make it the 51st state. “I think we’re not ever going to get to that point, something could happen with Greenland … I don’t see it with Canada, I just don’t see it, I have to be honest with you,” he said. Carney crafted much of his federal election campaign on Canada’s collective outrage over the US president’s threats to the nation’s sovereignty. During his victory speech last week, Carney used one of his campaign’s most frequently delivered lines, telling exuberant supportersTrump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”. “That will never, ever happen,” he added, to shouts from the crowd. Carney also used his first post-election press conference to once again quash any idea Canada was interested in becoming the 51st US state, a proposal repeatedly floated by Trump. “It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” Carney said on Friday. Colin Robertson, a former senior Canadian diplomat who has had numerous postings in the US, said Trump’s relatively cordial tone since the election bodes well for the Canadian delegation andmakes an Oval Office ambush less likely. Robertson speculated that Trump’s background as a property developer has helped frame his perception of Carney – who he last week referred to as a “very nice gentleman”. “Anybody I met in real estate, their favourite people are bankers. I suspect that immediately, Trump will look at Carney as a kind of ‘super banker’ and see him in a positive light,” he said. “And Carney’s also been very careful not to be personally critical of Trump, beyond talking about him that we’re a sovereign country, and this is how we’re doing stuff. That’s worked very well for him. He pushed back when Trump questioned our sovereignty, but that pushback would be something the president understands, because that’s how he behaves.” While much was made about Trump’sawkward handshakewith Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau, the pair had a famously frosty relationship. In Trudeau’s final days as prime minister, Trump repeatedly derided him as “governor” of Canada. And while the president had sometimes called the prime minister a “very nice guy”, Trump also called Trudeau “two-faced” afterhe was revealed on video leading the laughterat Trump’s expense at a Nato summit. Still, Carney’s “antagonistic” rhetoric towards Trump might be something he might regret when faced with the economic realities of Canada’s dependence on the United States, said Ryan Hurl, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “I suspect he backs away from the idea that our relationship with the United States is ‘over’ and he might modify it to say that our relationship is ‘changing’,” said Hurl. “Trade negotiations are never completely static and hopefully he can present his negotiations with Trump as something that is better for Canada, and not simply as bending the knee to President Trump.” The headwinds the prime minister faces in Tuesday’s White House meeting are already sufficiently strong, on both the economic and partisan fronts. “If Carney presents himself as making concessions to Trump to preserve the trading relationship between the two countries, the Conservative party will be able to take advantage of this,” said Hurl. “But if no agreements can be made, Canadians are going to start feeling the political the economic fallout very quickly.” Carney ran much of his brief federal election campaign on the idea that Canada needed to seek out new trade markets. And while a pledge to reshape Canada’s economic structure was welcomed by voters, many of the structural changes implied by such a policy shift – including eliminating internal trade barriers and getting more Canadian products to foreign markets – will take time. “You can’t just snap your fingers and change port capacity. That is a generational project,” said Hurl. Meanwhile, Trump is also starting to face domestic pressure: his decision to launch a trade war with allies and foes alikehas started to harm him in public opinionas US companies warn they are prepared to raise costs for consumers. “Trump has probably overreached on trade issues and we’re really starting to see the pushback now. With questions over consumer confidence and the direction of the country, we can be part of the solution to Trump’s self-inflicted problem,” said Robertson. He pointed to Canada’s “relatively strong” bargaining position as the two delegations meet at the White House. Canada’s federal government has invested in increased border checks, and fentanyl interceptions – the supposed pretext for Trump’s tariffs – have dropped further from a low starting point. Trade officials anticipate the United States will request changes to the USMCA free trade agreement, which is due for negotiations in 2026. And despite Trump’s repeated assertions that the United States doesn’t need Canada’s resources, experts say potash, steel and aluminum remain key purchases for American farmers and manufacturers. “And if, for example, they raisethe issue of dairyand supply management, we can ask, ‘What do you want here? Do you want more access for dairy products? Because you’re not using your quota right now. And you also practice supply management when it comes to rice and sugar and cotton. So if you want to negotiate this, then we’ve got the process,” said Robertson. “At the end of the day, what’s really important about this meeting, as my kids would say, is the ‘vibe’ between the two. That’s almost more important than whatever processes are committed to moving forward.” Those close to the prime minister say he is approaching the meeting like he did during debate preparations in the federal election: preparing for all possible iterations of the unpredictable president. “With Trump, you’re just never sure on any day where he is, what’s going on in his head and who was the last person to talk to him before in the meeting,” said Robertson. “But one thing we know about Carney, he has always been two things: disciplined and prepared.”",

    "title": "New Zealand’s prime minister proposes social media ban for under-16s",
    "article_text": "New Zealand’s prime minister has proposed banning children under 16 years old from using social media, in an effort to protect young people from harms such as exposure to violent content and cyberbullying. Christopher Luxonsaid on Tuesday the draft law would force social media companies to verify users were at least 16 before allowing them to create an account, or face fines of up to NZ$2m ($1.2m). While good things could come from social media, it was not always a safe place for young people and the onus was on tech companies to be socially responsible, Luxon said. “This is about protecting our children. It’s about making sure social media companies are playing their role in keeping our kids safe,” Luxon said. Teachers and parents had raised issues with him including cyberbullying, exposure to violent and inappropriate content, exploitation and social media addiction. “Parents are constantly telling us that they are really worried about the impact that social media is having on their children,” Luxon said. “And they say they are really struggling to manage access to social media.” The author of the bill, National MP Catherine Wedd, said there are no legally enforceable age verification measures for social media platforms in New Zealand and her bill would better support families to have oversight of their children’s online use. The proposed ban is closely modelled on that of Australia, which sits at theforefront of global efforts to regulate social media. Australiapassed landmark laws in Novemberbanning under-16s from social media – one of the world’s toughest crackdowns on popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X. The move sparked a fierce backlash from big tech companies who variously described the laws as “rushed”, “vague” and “problematic”. In December, a1News Verian pollfound more than two-thirds of New Zealanders supported restricting social media access for under-16s. The New Zealand bill was drafted by Luxon’s centre-right National party, the biggest member of the three-way governing coalition and would need the support of Luxon’s two coalition partners to pass. It is not yet clear when the bill will be introduced to parliament, but Luxon hoped the it would generate bipartisan support. “It’s not a political issue, it’s a New Zealand issue,” he said. Opposition Labour leader Chris Hipkins told Radio New Zealand he was open to the idea. “This is a conversation we need to have as a country. The Australians have been courageous and tackled it. I think New Zealand needs to do the same.”",

    "title": "‘A very real possibility of being detained’: LGBTQ+ Australians cancel travel to US for World Pride",
    "article_text": "Queer Australians are axing travel plans to Washington DC’s World Pride festival, as Donald Trump’s executive orders targeting LGBTQ+ rights lead to fears of discrimination at the US border and potential attacks. People skipping the international eventjoin other Australiansand travellers from around the world who areavoiding the USafter Trump’s inauguration and a string of controversial policies enacted in the early months of his second term as president. Washington DC will host the 2025 edition of World Pride from 23 May to 8 June, with tens of thousands of domestic and international tourists originally expected to travel to the capital for events including a parade, concerts, street festivals, lectures and a human rights conference. When Sydney hosted World Pride in 2023, more than 1 million people attended the festival, with about 100,000 tourists visiting the city, including 21,000 international travellers who injected more than $228m into the New South Wales economy,an analysis from Deloitte found. The Guardian was contacted by LGBTQ+ Australians, including trans and same-sex couples, who had scheduled trips to the US to incorporate World Pride but in recent weeks ditched their plans. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Mik Bartels is among them. The University of Canberra student, who is examining LGBTIQ+ discrimination in healthcare for their PhD, was offered a scholarship that covered travel expenses to attend World Pride’s human rights conference. Bartels had attended the conference at the 2023 World Pride in Sydney and found it valuable for their research. “It brings together people from all disciplines – community leaders, scholars, academics from around the world,” they said. “I got so much out of the 2023 conference, so when I got the offer, I thought this would be amazing to travel to Washington DC. So I accepted it. I hadn’t really read many reports of people being detained or denied entry at the time.” However, after anEquality Australia travel warningand recent reports of discrimination in the US, they decided to withdraw their acceptance of the funded trip. “Given my appearance as identifiably queer, my academic profile being centred on LGBTIQ+ discrimination, and my online presence where I am openly queer, I was not confident that I would be able to get into the US without being detained,” they said. “I’m conscious of theUS government’s list of banned words in academic research– my own research includes about 20 of those words. “I’m also hyper-aware of how I present myself online. I’m quite visibly queer in how I look and dress. I realised there was a very real possibility of being detained. I didn’t withdraw the acceptance lightly, but felt [that] for my own safety, I needed to.” Beyond the risk of discrimination from customs and border officials, Bartels said their partner had raised safety concerns about World Pride itself. “Even though Washington DC is quite progressive, you can be worried about gun violence at any queer event in the US.” Missing out on the conference and World Pride was a “double whammy”, Bartels said. “When you spend a lot of your life building the confidence to carve out a space for yourself, that becomes a lifelong journey. Opportunities to celebrate that journey and to demonstrate my relationship proudly are rare, so for this to be taken away, it can feel like a bit of a kick in the guts,” Bartels said. “The irony of not being able to attend a human rights conference due to a possible lack of human rights is not lost on me.” Reports of valid passport and visa holders being denied entry, and of mistreatment at the hands of customs and border officials, promptedEquality Australia in April to issue a specific warningto gender-diverse Australians and those with a record of LGBTQ+ or political activism. Equality Australia said travelling to the US carried “serious risks” of being denied entry, being mistreated or even being detained. World Pride organisers announced this week they were relocating events set to be hosted at the Kennedy Center –which Donald Trump took over this year– to an alternative venue because of“inhospitable” conditions, including the banning of drag performances. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion A Canberra trans woman, who asked not to be named, is another Australian who has cancelled their trip to the US. She and her wife had planned a holiday in California, where her wife grew up, before going to Washington DC for World Pride. “Even though the specific locations we were planning to visit are known for being progressive, the risks that I face as a trans woman in being arbitrarily turned back or detained at the border are too high,” she said. “Considering the hostile actions theTrump administrationis taking against queer and gender-diverse Americans, unfortunately we don’t envisage being able to visit any time soon.” Other Australian families have cancelled holidays to the US because of fears of how border officials would process their gay or trans children, they told Guardian Australiain response to a reader callout in April. The cancellations follow reports of gender-diverse and politically active travellers facing discrimination at the hands of US border officials. Separately, anAustralian man with a working visa who was detained and deportedon returning to the US, alleged border officials called him “retarded” and boasted “Trump is back in town”. An award-winning Australian comediancancelled a planned trip to the USafter receiving legal advice that she could be stopped at the border due to her previous jokes about the Trump administration. Australianacademics are refusing to attend US conferencesfor fear of being detained. Equality Australia legal adviser Heather Corkhill said Australians, particularly trans and gender-diverse travellers, “need to think carefully” before booking tickets to World Pride. “While Washington DC is generally more progressive, travellers to World Pride should be mindful that visiting other states comes with risks like being arrested or fined for using the ‘wrong’ bathroom,” Corkhill said “Even in the Capitol and its office buildings, trans people are unable to use single-sex bathrooms and changing rooms that align with who they are.” The president and CEO of Washington DC’s official tourism arm Destination DC, Elliott Ferguson, said millions of people were expected to attend World Pride 2025. He acknowledged the reports of some people abandoning trips but insisted they were in the minority. “We have not heard of any widespread cancellations and remain optimistic that turnout will be strong,” Ferguson said, speaking on behalf of World Pride 2025. “Our message is you are safe and welcome here. The concerns of the community are exactly why World Pride is so important. Washington DC is a place to advocate and make your voice heard.”",

    "article_text": "Germany’s new chancellorFriedrich Merzhas warned the US to “stay out” of his country’s politics after the far-right AfD received strong backing from allies of the US president, Donald Trump. Merz, 69, a conservative who waselected as chancellor of Europe’s biggest economy earlier in the day, also said he planned to speak by phone with Trump on Thursday. His CDU/CSU alliance won February’s elections ahead of the anti-immigration Alternative forGermany(AfD) party, which came second with more than 20% – a record for the group. During the campaign, the AfD won strong backing from Trump ally Elon Musk, the technology billionaire, and the US vice-president, JD Vance. Merz condemned recent “absurd observations” from the US, without specifying particular statements, and said he “would like to encourage the American government … to largely stay out of” German domestic politics. A politician with longstanding US ties, Merz said he had always felt that America “can clearly distinguish between extremist parties and parties of the political centre”. Merz, speaking with the public broadcaster ZDF on Tuesday, noted that he “did not interfere in the American election campaign” that elected Trump. Last week, after Germany’s domestic intelligence agencydesignated the AfD a “right-wing extremist” party, US secretary of state Marco Rubiocalled the move “tyranny in disguise” and said “Germany should reverse course”. At the time, the German foreign ministry pushed back, saying: “This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough and independent investigation to protect our constitution and the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.” Vance wrote on X: “The west tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt – not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.” Musk participated virtually at a January rally for the AfD, telling the crowd that “you really are the best hope” for Germany.",

    "title": "Front row? Dublin orders tourists to leave statue’s cleavage alone",
    "article_text": "Each time a tourist sidled up to the statue and reached for the most famous cleavage in Dublin, a voice called out: “No touching please.” Two city council stewards stood vigil over the landmark on Tuesday to notify would-be gropers that Molly Malone was to be left alone. After years of supposedly bringing good luck to whomever touched the breasts, they were now off-limits. To reduce damage to the statue, and to protect the dignity of a Dublin symbol, city authorities have posted the stewards in a week-long pilot project while they ponder other ways to shield the bronze figure from tactile appreciation. “I was here a few days ago and got to touch them then,” said Anders Oustid, 42, from Norway. “I don’t think they should stop people. It’s a fun gimmick that you can come here and touch the boobs. It’s good luck and apparently means that you’ll get to come back to Dublin.” Mars Masana, 33, from Barcelona, had also touched the cleavage on a previous visit to the statue on Suffolk Street and was hesitant about the prohibition. “I suppose in Spain we would feel the same if people were touching such a statue all the time.” Molly Malone – by many accounts a fictional 18th-century fishmonger’s wife – is the subject of a ballad, known as “cockles and mussels”, that is an unofficial anthem forIreland, sung at wedding, parties and sporting fixtures. The sculpture, by the artist Jeanne Rynhart, was first erected in 1988 and promptly labelled“the tart with the cart”in reference to the cleavage and rumours that Molly sold more than fish. A creative tour guide is credited, or blamed, with inventing the story that touching her breasts would bring luck and a return trip to Ireland’s capital. The result is discoloration where countless hands have passed – and indignation by some who consider it disrespectful. They include Tilly Cripwell, a music activist who last year launched a Leave Molly Alone campaign. Elaja Declercq, 17, from Belgium, obeyed, but regretted, the injunction to not touch. “I understand some think it’s inappropriate but it’s a tradition.” Her two friends – Erasmus students who had come to film themselves singing the ballad – agreed. Ray Yeates, the city council’s arts officer, said authorities were considering options, including leaving the statue in place and simply repairing the damage as needed, or erecting a fence, or moving it, perhaps indoors. The stewards’ interactions with people this week will inform the final decision. Yeates told the BBC that while a “worldwide phenomenon that statues are touched or rubbed” has become a custom, some people had noted that it mimicked undesirable behaviour. “It would be illegal in public, so why would we mimic it?” Naomi Smith, 70, from Australia, was struck by the statue’s revealing attire. “It makes me cold just to look at her. She would have been awfully cold going around like this.”",

    "title": "Denmark’s museum objects at risk from ‘extreme’ new mould, say conservators",
    "article_text": "A new type of “extreme” mould is sweeping through Denmark’s museums, threatening some of the nation’s most important paintings and cultural objects, conservators have warned. Described as an “epidemic for Golden Age paintings”, the highly resistant mould covers objects in a white coating and hasbeen detected in 12 of the country’s museums, including the National Museum of Denmark and Skagens Museum. Known asaspergillus section restricti, it belongs to a group offungi that can survive in extreme environmentssuch as the deep ocean or near volcanoes. “It’s quite a large problem because these fungi they deteriorate museum artefacts, materials, they decimate enzymes and assets, deteriorating museum objects, so it will damage them,” said Camilla Jul Bastholm, who is the head of conservation and collection storage at the National Museum of Denmark. Preliminary studies are now under way at 150 other cultural sites in Denmark to see if the mould is present there too. Jul Bastholm, who first noticed the substance when she was working at a museum in Roskilde, believes the white transparent mould is a global phenomenon, but usually goes undetected because it is difficult to find. By the time it is visible, she said, it was “too late”. She added: “I think it is worldwide. If we start looking for it with the right methods we will find it. I don’t think it’s just a Danish thing.” Unlike most fungi, which prefer a very high humidity, and will come as a result of water damage or humid buildings, this variety prefers dry environments. Jul Bastholm’s research centred around museums, but she has also seen the mould in churches, archives and libraries. “It seems they [the fungi] prefer cultural heritage. I’ve never seen them anywhere else,” she said. The mould is feared to be a potential health hazard, which means affected objects may then not be able to be exhibited to the public. “If you have a museum collection that can give health hazards to people then you can’t use it,” she said. “And then the collection will become a dead resource for the museums.” Skagens Museum, home to the work of members of the Skagen painters, a 19th-century Scandinavian artists’ colony, also reported finding the mould, describing it to broadcaster DR as a “whitish coating, a kind of bloom”. The Danish Museums Association said it was waiting for the results of further research at the end of the year to decide on how to tackle the problem. The National Museum is in the process of moving 116,000 shelf metres of cultural objects into a new staffed warehouse near Copenhagen which it is hoped will help fight the mould problem. But it is not known exactly what the humidity needs to be for it to stop growing.",

    "article_text": "Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow on Tuesday as the first foreign leaders landed in the capital ahead of a major military parade marking the end of the second world war. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, said Russian air defences shot down two drones en route to the capital on Tuesday evening. It was the second consecutive day of Ukrainian drone attacks, following two waves that temporarily shut several Moscow airports. Ukraine’s drone campaign in Moscow appeared aimed at unnerving the Kremlin before the 9 May parade, which about three dozen foreign leaders – including China’s Xi Jinping – are expected to attend. Vladimir Putin has proposed a three-day ceasefireto coincide with the 8-10 May second world war commemorations, which this year mark the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union and the allied forces. But the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the offer as self-serving and meaningless unless extended to 30 days, in line with a US-backed proposal that Putin has so far dismissed. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv about the latest drone attack. Zelenskyy earlier warned that Ukraine “cannot bear responsibility for what happens” to foreign leaders attending the commemoration parade in Moscow. Security has been tightened in Moscow before the Victory Day celebrations, with residents experiencing major internet disruptions. Russia’s state-run Tass news agency reported that critical facilities in the capital had been placed under reinforced protection, while some Telegram social media channels reported that air defence systems had been transferred to protect Moscow. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, previously accused Zelenskyy of directly threatening the 9 May events, while the former president Dmitry Medvedev said “10 May may not come for Kyiv” if there were any “Victory Day provocations”. Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s top foreign policy aide, said on Tuesday that 29 world leaders were expected to attend second world war Victory Day commemorations in Moscow in the coming days. Ushakov added that military units from 13 countries, including China, would take part in the parade along with Russian troops and military vehicles. However, Ushakov denied earlier media reports claiming that North Korean troops –whom Pyongyang acknowledged for the first time in Aprilhad fought alongside Russian forces in Ukraine – would join the parade. It will be the largest delegation of foreign leaders at the Red Square parade since Putin launched his full-scale invasion over three years ago – a show of support that Moscow will present as evidence it is not isolated. So far, there is no indication that Ukraine will accept Moscow’s proposed three-day ceasefire, which Zelenskyy has dismissed as an “unserious” stunt aimed at ensuring smooth 9 May celebrations. The US has been pressing Moscow to agree to a longer, one-month ceasefire though, on Monday, Trump appeared to tacitly support the Kremlin’s proposal. “As you know, President Putin just announced a three-day ceasefire, which doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a lot if you knew where we started from,”Trump told reportersin the Oval Office on Monday. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military said its forces had been engaged in combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region over the previous 24 hours, despite Moscow saying it had defeated a Ukrainian incursion into the area. In a daily update posted on Telegram, the military said its forces in the Kursk sector had fought off Russian attacks and come under fire from Russian artillery and air-dropped bombs. Local Russian authorities appeared to confirm on Monday evening that Ukraine’s military had made gains along the border. Vasily Khudyakov, the head of Glushkovo – a small settlement in the Kursk region – said Russian troops had begun evacuating all residents from the area. “Due to the worsening situation in the village, residents currently there must temporarily evacuate,” Khudyakov wrote on social media.",

The verbal order originated from the office ofPete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, according to TransCom records reviewed by Reuters. A TransCom spokesperson said the command received the order via the Pentagon’s joint staff. The cancelations came after Trump wrapped up a 30 January Oval Office meeting aboutUkrainethat included Hegseth and other top national security officials, according to three sources familiar with the situation. During the meeting, the idea of stopping Ukraine aid came up, said two people with knowledge of the meeting, but the president issued no instruction to halt it. The president was unaware of Hegseth’s order, as were other top national security officials in the meeting, according to two sources briefed on the private White House discussions and another with direct knowledge of the matter. Asked to comment on this report, the White House told Reuters that Hegseth had followed a directive from Trump to pause aid to Ukraine, which it said was the administration’s position at the time. It did not explain why, according to those who spoke to Reuters, top national security officials in the normal decision-making process didn’t know about the order or why it was so swiftly reversed. “Negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine War has been a complex and fluid situation. We are not going to detail every conversation among top administration officials throughout the process,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “The bottom line is the war is much closer to an end today than it was when President Trump took office.” The cancelations cost TransCom $2.2m, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. In response to a request for comment, TransCom said that the total cost was $1.6m – 11 flights were canceled but one incurred no charge. An order halting military aid authorized under the Biden administration went into effect officially a month later, on 4 March, with a White House announcement. The story of how flights were canceled, detailed by Reuters for the first time, points to an at-times haphazard policymaking process within theTrump administrationand a command structure that is unclear even to its own ranking members. The multiday pause of the flights, confirmed by five people with knowledge of it, also shows confusion in how the administration has created and implemented national security policy. At the Pentagon, the disarray is an open secret, with many current and former officials saying the department is plagued by internal disagreements on foreign policy, deep-seated grudges and inexperienced staff. Reuters couldn’t establish exactly when Hegseth’s office ordered the freight flights canceled. Two sources said Ukrainian and European officials began asking about the pause on 2 February. The TransCom records indicate that there was a verbal order from “SECDEF” – the secretary of defense – that stopped the flights and that they had resumed by 5 February. “This is consistent with the administration’s policy to move fast, break things and sort it out later. That is their managing philosophy,” said Mark Cancian, a retired US Marine officer and defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank. “That is great for Silicon Valley. But when you’re talking about institutions that have been around for hundreds of years, you are going to run into problems.” The stop in shipments caused consternation in Kyiv. The Ukrainians quickly questioned the administration through multiple channels but had difficulty obtaining any useful information, according to a Ukrainian official with direct knowledge of the situation. In later conversations with the Ukrainians, the administration wrote off the pause as “internal politics”, said the source. Ukrainian officials did not respond to requests for comment. The shipping of American weapons to Ukraine requires signoff from multiple agencies and can take weeks or even months to complete, depending on the size of the cargo. The majority ofUS militaryassistance goes through a logistics hub in Poland before being picked up by Ukrainian representatives and transported into the country. That hub can hold shipments for extended periods of time. It’s not clear whether the 11 canceled flights were the only ones scheduled that week in February, how much aid was already stockpiled in Poland and whether it continued to flow into Ukraine despite the US military’s orders. The revelations come at atime of upheavalin the Pentagon. Several of Hegseth’s top advisers were escorted from the building on 15 April after being accused of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The secretary continues to face scrutiny, including from Congress, about his own communications. Previously he’s attributed allegations of upheaval to disgruntled employees. The canceled flights contained weapons that hadlong been approvedby the Biden administration and authorized by lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Reuters couldn’t determine whether Hegseth or his team knew how the order to TransCom would play out or that the order would be a substantial change in US policy on Ukraine. Three sources familiar with the situation said Hegseth misinterpreted discussions with the president about Ukraine policy and aid shipments without elaborating further. Four other people briefed on the situation said a small cadre of staffers inside the Pentagon, many of whom have never held a government job and who have for years spoken out against US aid to Ukraine, advised Hegseth to consider pausing aid to the country. Two people familiar with the matter denied there was a true cutoff in aid. One of them described it as a logistical pause. “[They] just wanted to get a handle on what was going on and people, as a result, misinterpreted that as: ‘You need to stop everything,’” said one. According to two sources with knowledge of the meeting, Hegseth arrived at the 30 January Oval Office meeting with Trump with a memo drafted by some of his top policy advisers, advocating that their boss push the White House to consider pausing weapons deliveries to Ukraine to gain leverage in peace negotiations with Russia. The sources said the secretary attended the meeting with other top officials involved in Ukraine policy, including then national security adviserMike Waltzand Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg. The group broadly discussed US policy on Ukraine and Russia, including potentially tightening sanctions on Moscow. It’s not clear the extent to which Hegseth proposed stopping aid during the meeting, but the idea came up in discussions, said one of the sources and another person familiar with the meeting. Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the US had approved billions of dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine. Most was delivered under the Biden administration. But a few shipments remained in the pipeline, scheduled into this summer. Trump had threatened to freeze aid repeatedly on the campaign trail, but had yet to do so. And during the meeting, he again declined to stop aid to Ukraine or order Hegseth to implement any policy changes when it came to sending equipment to Kyiv, the sources said. An order effectively freezing any military support for an ally would normally be discussed intensively among top national security officials and approved by the president. It requires the coordination of multiple agencies and often multiple freight companies. None of that discussion or coordination happened when Hegseth’s office canceled the scheduled flights carrying American artillery shells and ammunition to Poland from al-Udeid military base in the United Arab Emirates and the Dover US military base in Delaware, three of the sources said. The pause came as Ukraine’s military was struggling to fend off Russian forces in eastern Ukraine and in the consequential battle for the Kursk region of Russia, where Ukrainian forces were losing ground and have since all but been expelled. Close Trump advisers were tipped off to the pause by Pentagon staffers and discussed with the president whether to restore the aid shipments, according to two sources. By then, TransCom had canceled 11 flights, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. Some media outlets, including Reuters, wrote about the pause but Hegseth’s role was previously unknown. It’s unclear whether Trump subsequently questioned or reprimanded Hegseth. One source with direct knowledge of the matter said then national security adviser Waltz ultimately intervened to reverse the cancelations. Waltz was forced out on Thursday and is expected to be nominated as US ambassador to the United Nations. When Trump entered office, aid to Ukraine continued flowing and he pledged to work with Ukraine and Russia to end the war – or at the very least broker a ceasefire. Two of his most prominent envoys, Kellogg, a supporter of Kyiv who worked with Trump in his first administration, and Steve Witkoff, a real-estate magnate and close friend of the president, set out to negotiate with both parties. Separately, at the Pentagon, some of Hegseth’s policy advisers privately started drafting proposals to pull back American support for Ukraine, according to two sources briefed on the matter. That group of staffers aligned themselves closely with the anti-interventionist philosophy. Some have previously advised Republican lawmakers advocating for an “America first” approach to foreign policy and have called publicly, in writings and talks, for the US to pull back from military commitments in the Middle East and Europe – a view similarly held by the vice-president, JD Vance. Several have advocated that the US instead focus on China. Supporters of the staffers have slammed those pushing back on the anti-interventionist movement in the administration, claiming Vance and others are merely trying to save the lives of people living in war zones such as Ukraine and prevent future American military deaths. The infighting has complicated the policymaking process, according to a person familiar with the matter and four other sources. At a time when Kellogg and Witkoff are trying to broker a peace deal with Russia and Ukraine, the staffers have advocated behind the scenes for the US to draw back its support for Kyiv – a policy that has angered Ukrainian officials and put pressure on European allies to fill the gap, five people with knowledge of the situation said. Washington hassigned a dealwith Kyiv for rights to its rare earth minerals – an agreement US officials say is an attempt to recoup money the US has spent to prop up Ukraine’s war effort. At least one of the staffers who had previously pushed for the administration to pull back its support for Kyiv, Dan Caldwell, was escorted out of the Pentagon for a leak he claims never happened. Caldwell, a veteran, served as one of Hegseth’s chief advisers, including on Ukraine. Despite the brief pause in February and the longer one that began in early March, the Trump administration has resumed sending the last of the aid approved under Joe Biden. No new policy has been announced.",

    "title": "Senior Tory MPs and peers break ranks to call for recognition of Palestine",
    "article_text": "More than a dozen senior Conservative MPs and peers have written to the prime minister calling for the UK to immediately recognise Palestine as a state, breaking ranks with their own party to do so. Seven MPs and six members of the House of Lords have signed the letter toKeir Starmerurging him to defy the Israeli government and give formal recognition to Palestine in advance of key UN talks next month. The letter, which has been seen by the Guardian, was written in late March soonafter Israel broke its peace agreementwith Hamas, diminishing hopes of an eventual two-state solution. On Monday, the Israeli cabinet went one step further, approvinga planto “conquer” the Gaza Strip and occupy most if not all of it. In the letter, which was organised by the former minister Kit Malthouse, the group writes: “For decades, the Palestinian people have endured occupation, displacement and systemic restrictions on their basic freedoms. “Recognising Palestine would affirm our nation’s commitment to upholding the principles of justice, self-determination and equal rights. It would send a clear message that Britain stands against indefinite occupation and supports the Palestinian people’s legitimate aspirations.” The letter continues: “Recognition should not be treated as a distant bargaining chip but as a necessary step to reinforce international law and diplomacy. Prime minister, we stand ready to offer our public support for this decision. “This is an opportunity for Britain to show leadership, to be on the right side of history and to uphold the principles we claim to champion. More than 140 UN member states have already recognised Palestine – it is time for the United Kingdom to do the same.” The letter was signed by several on the moderate wing of the party such as Malthouse himself, the father of the house, Edward Leigh, and Simon Hoare. But it was also signed by several associated more with the right, including John Hayes and Desmond Swayne. Members of the Lords including Hugo Swire, Nicholas Soames and Patricia Morris, the party’s deputy speaker in the upper chamber, also signed. The prime minister is understood not to have replied. Most UN countries formally recognise a Palestinian state, but the US and most European countries do not. France and Saudi Arabia will co-host a conference next month designed to boost support for a two-state solution, at which the French president, Emmanuel Macron,has suggestedFrance may grant formal recognition for the first time. David Cameron, the former prime minister and foreign secretary, made a key concession last year whenhe saidhe wanted to see Palestine recognised as part of peace negotiations with Israel, rather than at the end of them. A Conservative spokesperson said: “Our longstanding position has been that we will recognise a Palestinian state at a time that is most conducive to the peace process. We are not at that point now and we are clear that recognition cannot be the start of the process.” Starmer has used similar language, with the British government keen not to get too far ahead of the US. But David Lammy, the foreign secretary,said last weekthe government wasin talks with Franceabout its plans for next month. “We have always said recognition is not the end in itself, two states is the end in itself,” he said. “We would prefer recognition as part of that process towards two states so we will continue to talk to partners about that.” A Downing Street spokesperson said the government remained committed to a two-state solution, as highlighted by the recent meeting between Starmer and Mohammad Mustafa, the head of the Palestinian Authority.",

    "title": "Gaza will be entirely destroyed, Israeli minister says",
    "article_text": "An Israeli government minister has vowed that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed” as a result of an Israeli military victory, and that its Palestinian population will “leave in great numbers to third countries”, raising fears of ethnic cleansing in the occupied territory. The declaration on Tuesday by the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, came a day after Israel’s security cabinet approved a plan forOperation Gideon’s Chariots, which an Israeli official said would entail “the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories”. The Israeli threats to seize control of the territory permanently has stirred global outrage. “We strongly oppose the expansion of Israel’s operations,” the UK’s Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, said. “Any attempt to annex land inGazawould be unacceptable.” After the intensified offensive was announced,Hamassaid it was no longer interested in truce talks with Israel and urged the international community to halt Israel’s “hunger war” against Gaza, a reference to the total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza, which has been in place for more than two months. “There is no sense in engaging in talks or considering new ceasefire proposals as long as the hunger war and extermination war continue in the Gaza Strip,” Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, told AFP. Effie Defrin, Israel’s chief military spokesperson, said the planned offensive would include “moving most of the population of the Gaza Strip … to protect them”. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said the “population will be moved, for its own protection” in a video posted on social media, but gave no further details. Smotrich, speaking to a conference on Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, went further, making clear that many Palestinians would be driven out of the territory altogether, as part of a scorched earth offensive. “Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to … the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,” the minister said. Israel’s neighboursEgyptandJordanhave said they will refuse to allow an exodus of refugees on their territory, arguing that would make them party to the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. The international court of justice is assessing allegations of genocide against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza, and last year issued a series of provisional measures that included orders for Israel to “take all measures” to prevent genocide being committed or incited, and to allow the “unhindered provision” of humanitarian assistance across the territory’s southern border with Egypt. The international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and the ICC prosecutor is reported to bepreparing more warrant requests. “Smotrich has been saying similar things for some time now, but obviously this is very serious in the context of the call for more troops by the government,” Victor Kattan, assistant professor in public international law at the University of Nottingham, said. “Deportation and forcible transfer of civilians is a crime against humanity under the Rome statute [the ICC’s founding treaty], and that’s a clear call for that. If that’s occurring in the context of his ministerial position or as a result of deliberations in the cabinet, that could be very serious.” Late on Tuesday, at least 29 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people, medics said. Dozens more were wounded in the attack on Bureij camp in the centre of the territory, civil defence media officer Ahmad Radwan told AFP. The call for an intensification of Israel’s war in Gaza came as it carried out a second day of airstrikes aimed at Houthi forces in Yemen, severely damaging the country’s international airport in the capital, Sana’a. The strikes came after Israel launched similar attacks on Mondayin retaliation for aHouthi missile strike the previous day on Israel’s international airport. Nearly all of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced, often repeatedly, since the start of the war triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted another 250. More than 52,000 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive in Gaza that followed. A two-month ceasefire collapsed in mid-March when Israel reneged on a promise to implement a second phase. Faltering indirect talks have continued since, brokered by Qatar and Egypt, but with little sign of any significant progress. Any breakthrough appears unlikely as long as Israel remains committed to forcing Hamas to disarm, and Hamas refuses to release hostages without a ceasefire leading to a permanent end to hostilities as well as a total withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Some analysts suggest Israel’s threats of the new offensive, occupation of territory and massive displacement are designed to force concessions from Hamas, as well as shore up rightwing support for Netanyahu’s ruling coalition. Hamas on Monday described the new Israeli framework for aid delivery in Gaza as “political blackmail” and blamed Israel for the war-ravaged territory’s “humanitarian catastrophe”. A UN spokesperson said on Monday that António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was “alarmed” by the Israeli plan that “will inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza”. Humanitarian officials say the territoryis on the brink of catastropheas food and fuel runs out due to a total Israeli blockade imposed on 2 March. Military officials in Israel have given different versions of a plan reportedly agreed by ministers to allow a limited amount of aid into Gaza, which would be distributed from a small number of newly constructed hubs in the south of the territory staffed by private contractors but protected by Israeli troops. Humanitarian officials have dismissed the scheme as unworkable, dangerous and potentially unlawful. “The design of the plan presented to us will mean large parts of Gaza, including the less mobile and most vulnerable people, will continue to go without supplies,” ajoint statement by UN and other aid agenciessaid this week. “It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy. “It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarised zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.” Stephen Cutts, the interim head of Medical Aid for Palestinians, said: “Israel’s proposed military-controlled aid mechanism is a dangerous attempt to weaponise humanitarian aid, entrench further control over Gaza, and continue its ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.” US officials have not reacted directly to Israel’s threat of a new offensive, but Donald Trump said on Monday that his administration would help get food to “starving” Palestinians. He blamed Hamas for making it “impossible” by diverting humanitarian assistance for its fighters. “We’re going to help the people of Gaza get some food. People are starving, and we’re going to help them get some food,” Trump told reporters during an event at the White House. Israeli officials have said the new operation will not be launched before Trump concludes his visit next week to Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar.",

    "title": "US agrees ceasefire with Houthis in Yemen after dozens killed in airstrikes",
    "article_text": "The US will halt its bombing campaign against Yemen’s Houthis after the Iran-aligned group agreed to stop targeting shipping in the Red Sea. The halt – announced by the US president, Donald Trump, during an Oval Office meeting with Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, came on a day in which Israel claimed its jets had fully disabled Yemen’s main airport, including three civilian aircraft on the ground, in retaliation fora missile strike on Sundaythat hit within the perimeter of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport. “The Houthis have announced … that they don’t want to fight any more. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,” Trump said. He provided minimal details of the agreement and denied that he had struck a deal. “We just found out about that. So I think that’s very, very positive … I will accept their word, and we are going to stop the bombing … effective immediately,” he said. Oman, which has been mediating contacts between the US and the Houthis, confirmed the deal, which it said would ensure “freedom of navigation” in the Red Sea. Oman’s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said in an online statement: “Following recent discussions and contacts ... with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides.” He added: “Neither side will target the other ... ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping” in the Red Sea. There was no official comment from the Houthis, but the rebels’ political leader, Mahdi al-Mashat, said attacks against Israel would continue. The Houthi response would go “beyond what the Israeli enemy can withstand”, Mashat said in a statement. The agreement with the US follows a recent sharp intensification of air raids on Yemen,including with the participation of UK forces last week. Some of those strikes claimed civilian lives as well as those of Houthi fighters. The Houthis have been firing at Israel and at shipping in the Red Sea since Israel began its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group’s deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The Trump administration launched its operation in mid March, markedly increasing the number of air raids against Yemen, after a campaign of intermittent strikes. Since then the US military says it has “hit over 1,000 targets” in Yemen, claiming to have killed Houthi fighters and leaders, “including senior Houthi missile and UAV officials, and degrading their capabilities”. There has been a number of reported civilian deaths, including last week when local officials said theUS had struck a detention centre for nationals of African countries in Saada, reportedly killing at least 68 people. An 18 April raid on Ras Isa fuel portalso killed at least 80 people and wounded 150 others. The Trump administration has maintained that the strikes are in self-defence in response to Houthi strikes on US commercial and naval ships. They have denied the six-week campaign requires congressional approval. Attacks by the Houthis have prevented shipsfrom passing through the Suez canal – a vital route that normally carries about 12% of the world’s shipping traffic. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Tensions between the Houthis and Israel – against whom the group said it had begun the attacks – have been high since the Gaza war began, but have risen further since a Houthi missile landed near Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Sunday, prompting Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Hodeidah port on Monday and Sana’a airport on Tuesday. The UN special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, said the strikes carried out by both sides marked a “grave escalation in an already fragile and volatile regional context”. The Israeli military claimed on Tuesday that its airstrike on Yemen’s main airport had disabled it. “The strike was carried out in response to the attack launched by the Houthi terrorist regime against Ben Gurion airport,” the Israeli military said in a statement. “Flight runways, aircraft and infrastructure at the airport were struck,” it added. A Yemeni official said the airport had been “completely destroyed” by the strikes. “Three planes out of seven belonging to Yemenia Airlines were destroyed at Sana’a airport, and Sana’a international airport was completely destroyed,” the official said. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said the strike should be seen as a warning to the “head of the Iranian octopus”, which he said bears direct responsibility for attacks by the Houthis against Israel. The Houthi-affiliated al-Masirah television channel said three people had been killed and 38 people wounded in the airstrikes on the airport, as well as a cement factory, and the Haziz power station.

    "title": "How Trump’s walkaway diplomacy enabled Israel’s worst impulses",
    "article_text": "The Israeli plan to occupy and depopulate Gaza may not be identical to Donald Trump’s vision of a new riviera, but his inspiration and the US’s walkaway diplomacy have usheredBenjamin Netanyahuto the precipice of a dire new chapter in the Israel-Gaza war. The common perception in both Washington and Israel is that Trump has largely moved on, leaving an emboldened Netanyahu to his own devices, while his offhand proposals forturning Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”have provided cover for rightwing Israeli politicians to enthusiastically support the forced resettlement of the Palestinian population. “Part of the tragedy is that the only one who can actually save us, Trump, is not even seriously interested in that,” said Amos Harel, a prominent military and defense correspondent for the Haaretz newspaper. “Our only hope to get out of this crazy situation is that Trump would force Netanyahu to reach a hostage deal. But [Trump] seems disinterested. He was enthusiastic when the Riviera [idea] was proposed, but now he has moved on to Greenland, Canada and Mexico instead.” Trump’s interventions – specifically envoySteve Witkoff’s threats to Netanyahu during a tense Shabbat meeting– were instrumental in achieving a temporary ceasefire to the conflict in January. His influence on Netanyahu appeared to be greater than that of previous US presidents, including his rival Joe Biden. But since then the ceasefire has broken down, a two-month Israeli blockade on aid has sparked an even worse humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and, with few opportunities for a quick peace, the White House now appears uninterested and overstretched asIsrael signals an offensive and occupationthat critics have said will amount to a state policy of ethnic cleansing. It is a trend that has repeated with this White House: broad designs for a grand deal followed by frustration when diplomacy fails to yield instant results. Recently, the White House announced that it was also ready towalk away from negotiations over the Russia-Ukraine conflictif a quick deal was not achieved. That has incentivized Russia to wait out the Trump administration, observers have said, and bank on a policy of US non-engagement in the longer term. Netanyahu similarly appears to have been unleashed by the White House’s growing disinterest. The Israeli ultimatum comes as Trump is scheduled to tour the Middle East next week, with Israeli officials briefing that they will begin the operation only after he returns from a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Trump’s talks there are expected to focus on investment and a likely quixotic quest to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia andIsrael, but not on achieving a resolution to the war. On Tuesday, Maariv, an Israeli newspaper, reported that a Trump visit to Israel was not out of the question, but White House officials have not yet signaled that Trump is ready to go meet Netanyahu. Witkoff, the Trump envoy, still appears personally invested in a resolution to the conflict, but he isoverstretched by attempting to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, and also negotiate an Iran nuclear deal simultaneously. The US has continued negotiations with Israel over an aid delivery scheme that would create a new mechanism for aid distribution to avoid Hamas, they have said. But the UN and all aid organizations working in Gaza have condemned the plan as an Israeli takeover. “It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy,” the heads of all UN agencies and NGOs that operate in Gaza said in a joint statement on Sunday. The Trump administration’s budget and personnel cuts have also signaled a retreat from diplomacy. The state department was reportedly ready to cut the role of the security coordinator role for the West Bank and Gaza, a three-star general who was tasked with managing security crises between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, particularly with regards to growing tensions between settlers and local Palestinian communities. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion More importantly, Trump has given cover to Israeli officials who had sought more aggressive action in Gaza, including forced depopulations. Rightwingers in government have been particularly aggressive, with finance minister Bezalel Smotrich saying thatwithin months Gaza would be “totally destroyed” and the Gazan population would be “concentrated” in a small strip of land.“The rest of the strip will be empty,” he said. But other ministers have also become more radical using Trump’s rhetoric for cover, said Harel. “Once Trump said that, you could see how not only the radicals, but also Likud ministers and so on, have an excuse,” said Harel. “‘It’s not us. It’s the world, the free world’s leader is saying that, so we have to play along.’”",

    "title": "Gaza ‘to be entirely destroyed’ and people to leave ‘in great numbers’, claims far-right Israeli minister – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you can read ourfull report on this story here Iran has urged the US to end its support for Israel’s continuing strikes onYemen, claiming Israel is trying to use its conflict with the Houthi-led government to drive a wedge between Iran and the US in the negotiations over the future of Tehran’s civil nuclear programme.The strikes have been criticised by the UN-recognised Yemen government based in Aden, which said it had not been consulted and airstrikes alone were not an integrated plan to remove theHouthisfrom power. Yemen has been divided between the Houthis and the official government since the Houthis captured the capital, Sana’a, in 2015. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she told Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in a telephone conversation that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is untenable.“Humanitarian aid must resume immediately and should never be politicised. The new aid delivery mechanism should run through humanitarian actors,” she added in a statement on X. Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the Gaza Strip should be “entirely destroyed” and its inhabitants “leave in great numbers to third countries” after the war, in what would effectively amount to ethnic cleansing. Smotrich’s comments came after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for an expanded offensive which could see the forced displacement of most Palestinian people in Gazaand occupation of the territory on an indefinite basis. In response, Hamas said there was no sense in truce talks (for a temporary ceasefire agreement) withIsraeland urged the international community to halt Israel’s “hunger war” against Gaza, a reference to the total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza. However, a senior Hamas official said the Palestinian militant group would be open to a five to seven year truce with Israelif certain strict conditions were met. Israel is reportedly planning to take control of the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza, using private American security contractors, as a condition for lifting its two-month aid blockade into the territory. The UN has condemned the Israeli proposal to fundamentally alter the aid system in Gaza, which the UN’s humanitarian office said is “designed to further control and restrict supplies” flowing into the Strip. The Israeli military said it fired on Yemen’s main airport on Tuesday, a day after Israeli forces carried out airstrikes on Hodeidah port in Yemen in response to a Houthi missile landing near Israel’s main air hub on Sunday. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she told Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar in a telephone conversation that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is untenable. “Humanitarian aid must resume immediately and should never be politicised. The new aid delivery mechanism should run through humanitarian actors,” she added in a statement on X. Iran has urged the US to end its support for Israel’s continuing strikes onYemen, claiming Israel is trying to use its conflict with the Houthi-led government to drive a wedge between Iran and the US in the negotiations over the future of Tehran’s civil nuclear programme. The strikes have been criticised by the UN-recognised Yemen government based in Aden , which said it had not been consulted and airstrikes alone were not an integrated plan to remove theHouthisfrom power. Yemen has been divided between the Houthis and the official government since the Houthis captured the capital, Sana’a, in 2015. Israel claimed 20 of its warplanes on Monday had completely destroyed the Houthi-held port of Hodeidah, as well as a nearby cement factory. The Houthis said four people had been killed. On Tuesday,Israelstruck Sana’a international airport, warning civilians to leave the area. In launching the attacks, probably more extensive than those mounted by the US, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has been highlighting Iran’s role in arming the Houthis. The Shia group mounted an attack on Ben Gurion airport on Saturday that the Houthis said was an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel was shocked that its air defences were penetrated by a single Houthi missile, butIranbelieves Israel is escalating the crisis in an attempt to disrupt the negotiations between the US and Iran over its nuclear programme. The talks are due to resume on Sunday. The Houthis have responded to the Israeli military attacking Yemen’s main airport in the capital Sana’a. Israel’s military said earlier that its warplanes struck the capital, “fully disabling the airport”, after three civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway and a military air base were reportedly targeted in the strikes (see post at15.04for more details). There were no immediate reports of casualties. The Israeli “aggression will not pass without a response, andYemenwill not be discouraged from its stance in support of Gaza”, the Houthi political bureau said in a statement. Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the Gaza Strip should be “entirely destroyed” and its inhabitants “leave in great numbers to third countries” after the war, in what would effectively amount to ethnic cleansing. Smotrich’s comments came after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans for an expanded offensive which could see the forced displacement of most Palestinian people in Gaza and occupation of the territory on an indefinite basis. In response, Hamas said there was no sense in truce talks (for a temporary ceasefire agreement) withIsraeland urged the international community to halt Israel’s “hunger war” against Gaza, a reference to the total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza. However, a senior Hamas official said the Palestinian militant group would be open to a five to seven year truce with Israel if certain strict conditions were met. Israel is reportedly planning to take control of the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza, using private American security contractors, as a condition for lifting its two-month aid blockade into the territory. The UN has condemned the Israeli proposal to fundamentally alter the aid system in Gaza, which the UN’s humanitarian office said is “designed to further control and restrict supplies” flowing into the Strip. The Israeli military said it fired on Yemen’s main airport on Tuesday, a day after Israeli forces carried out airstrikes on Hodeidah port in Yemen in response to a Houthi missile landing near Israel’s main air hub on Sunday. The Israeli military has said it has struck Houthi targets in Yemen, including the airport in the capital Sana’a, along with several major power stations. Israel hadearlier warnedpeople to leave the area aroundSana’a international airport, one day after Israeli forces carried out airstrikes on Hodeidah port in Yemen in response to a Houthi missile landing near Israel’s main air hub on Sunday. Sources told Reuters that Tuesday’s airstrikes targeted three civilian airplanes, the departures hall, the airport runway and a military air base under Houthi control. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The IDFwrote in a post on X: The airport served as a central hub for the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons and operatives, clearly underscoring the Houthi terrorist regime’s brutal exploitation of civilian infrastructure. Furthermore, several central power plants were struck in, and surrounding, the Sana’a area. These plants were exploited by the Houthi regime for energy infrastructure and for the construction of underground tunnels. Bezalel Smotrich is one of the far-right leaders on whom Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile coalition depends. The finance minister is among those inIsraelwho considers the West Bank the biblical heartland of the Jewish people. He called the annexation of the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, “one of the most important challenges” for the Israeli leadership. Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to three million Palestinian people, and around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements that are illegal under international law. Smotrich told Channel 12 during a conference organised by the right-wing Besheva newspaper yesterday that Israelis should start to embrace the word “occupation”. It came after the Israeli security cabinet approved an expansion of its war on Gaza, which an Israeli official said would entail “the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories” (see post at08.50for more details). The far-right Israeli finance ministerBezalel Smotrichhas been speaking at a conference in the occupied West Bank settlement of Ofra. “Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to... the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries,” he said. Smotrich, who has recently said that Israel will not withdraw from Gaza even if there is another hostage deal, expressed his hope that the territory would be formally annexed during the current government’s term, which could last until late next year. Annexation and the acquisition of territory by military conquest is forbidden as one of the founding principles of international law including the UN charter. Israel’s plan to expand its Gaza offensive, displace people within the territory and take control of aid distribution has horrified Palestinians in Gaza who have already suffered multiple displacements and food shortages during 19 months of conflict. Israel has been blocking all aid from enteringGazasince 2 March, when a two-month ceasefire with Hamas that had improved access to food and medicine in Gaza and allowed many Palestinians to go home, fell apart. Reuters reported: For Aya, a 30-year-old Gaza City resident who returned home with her family during the ceasefire after months in the southern part of the strip, Israel’s announcement on Monday raised fears of being killed or indefinitely displaced. “Are we going to die this time?” she said in a message on a chat app. “Are they going to displace us again? Are we going to end up in Rafah, and will this be the last time, or are they going to force us out of Gaza after Rafah?” she said, referring to the Rafah area in southern Gaza, next to Egypt’s border. Attending a funeral on Monday for several people killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in Gaza City, Mohammed al-Seikaly said things were so dire it was hard to comprehend Israel’s plans to intensify its assault. “There is nothing left in the Gaza Strip that has not been struck by missiles and explosive barrels, and there are still threats to expand the operation,” he said. “I’m asking in front of the whole world, what’s left to bomb?” Israel’s military on Tuesday warned people to leave the area around the main airport in Yemen’s capital Sana’a, a day after it struck the port of Hodeidah in response to a Houthi missile that landed near Israel’s main air hub. Tensions have escalated between Israel and Yemen’s Houthis as the Iran-aligned group continues to launch attacks in response to Israel expanding operations in Gaza. “Not evacuating puts you in danger,” the military said. It published a map of the area surrounding Sana’a International Airport. Israel carried out strikes in the vicinity of Yemen’s port of Hodeidah on Monday which killed four people and injured 39, according to the South-run health ministry. We have some more quotes fromJens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN’s humanitarian office (OCHA), who has been speaking to reporters in Geneva. “The bottom line is that there’s no aid to distribute anymore because the aid operation has been strangled... There’s no more to give,” he said after news broke that the Israeli cabinet had approved a plan to deliver aid through private companies. InGaza“there’s a desperate need for food getting in; they’re getting bombs”, he said. “They need water, they’re getting bombs. They need health care, they’re getting bombs.” Israel needs to allow border crossings to reopen and for life-saving aid to go through to alleviate the suffering, Laerke said. “We have aid pre-positioned outside of Gaza, ready to go in,” he added. Israel is planning to take control of the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza, using private American security contractors, as a condition for lifting its two-month aid blockade into the territory, according to reports and officials. The UN’s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has responded to the plans, condemning the Israeli proposal to fundamentally alter the current aid system inGaza. “We do not accept a proposal and a plan that does not live up to the core fundamental humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independent delivery of aid,” OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said in Geneva. Israel’s plan is “designed to further control and restrict supplies, which is the opposite of what is needed,” Laerke said. Humanitarian officials say the territoryis on the brink of catastropheas food and fuel runs out due to a total Israeli blockade imposed on 2 March, which has also cut off critical vaccines and medical supplies. A group of mainly Democratic US senators wants Congress’ watchdog agency to investigate whether controls on humanitarian aid deliveries byIsraeland other foreign governments violate American law, according to a letter seen by Reuters. Here is some of the Reuters report: The six senators -Chris Van Hollen,Dick Durbin,Jeff Merkley,Bernie Sanders,Elizabeth WarrenandPeter Welch- wrote to comptroller general Gene Dodaro asking him to launch an investigation by the nonpartisan government accountability office of the US government’s implementation of laws regarding the delivery of humanitarian assistance… “In Ethiopia, Sudan, Ukraine, Burma, Syria, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Gaza, vital humanitarian assistance such as food, medical equipment, water purification systems, and other lifesaving goods have been blocked or restricted, directly and indirectly, by state and non-state actors,” they said in a letter, dated Monday and seen by Reuters, referring to Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act and the Leahy Laws. The Leahy Laws prohibit the supply of US assistance to any foreign security force unit implicated in gross violations of human rights, including torture and extrajudicial killing. Section 620I bars assistance for countries that impede delivery of humanitarian aid. Much recent concern has focused on Gaza. The United Nations and Palestinian representatives at the international court of justice have accused Israel of breaking international law by refusing to let aid into Gaza, after Israel began on 2 March to cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Palestinian territory. Israel has defended its blockade against aid entering Gaza, alleging that Hamas steals supplies intended for the civilian population anddistributes them to its own forces, an allegation that Hamas denies. As my colleague Jason Burke notes in this story, France’s foreign ministerJean-Noël Barrothas called Israel’s plan for an expanded offensive in Gaza “unacceptable”, and said its government was “in violation of humanitarian law”. Barrot was also quoted in an interview with France’s RTL Radio as saying that Paris was “working towards the recognition of a Palestinian state” (for context: Spain, Ireland and Norwayformally recognised a Palestinian state last year, provoking outrage in the Israeli government). He said: France’s voice is heard when it speaks on these issues. We want other countries to act alongside France, for commitments to be made and for France to help create the conditions for the very existence of the Palestinian state – which is far from guaranteed… The urgent priority is a ceasefire and unimpeded access to humanitarian aid… The risk of famine is real. Humanitarian access must be opened immediately. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have said four people were killed and 39 others injured in Israeli air raids that followed a missile strike by the group on Israel’s main airport. “Three citizens were killed and 35 others wounded” at a cement factory inBajil, while one person died and four were injured atHodeida port, the Houthis’ al-Masirah TV station said, quoting the health ministry. On Sunday, the Houthislaunched a missile from Yemen that struck an access road near Israel’s main airport, briefly halting flights and commuter traffic. Four people were lightly injured. It was the first time a missile had struck the grounds of Israel’s airport since the start of the war. The Houthis have targeted Israel throughout Israel’s war onGazain solidarity with Palestinians. The Trump administration has launched an intensified campaign of daily airstrikes targeting the Houthis since 15 March 2025 but many civilians are reported to have been killed in the attacks. Senior Hamas officialOsama Hamdanhas given aninterview to Drop Site News. Here are the main takeaways from what he said: Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, will reject any temporary ceasefire deal that does not feature a plan for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the end to Israel’s continuing assault on the territory. “What the Israelis are offering is: We will give you a ceasefire for a short while and then we will come back to kill you again. So what’s the idea of giving you food for 12, 40 days, two weeks or three weeks, and then coming back to kill you? It means that you endorse the genocide and you accept that for your own people,” Hamdan said. Hamas would be open to a five to seven year truce withIsrael, known as ahudnain Arabic, if certain conditions were met. “The main goal for this long termhudnais that each side has to believe that he will not be attacked by the other side, which can at least generate a kind of security. And it’s a chance to build trust that there may be a chance for a kind of stability and security,” he said. Hamas, which has been the sole ruler in the Gaza Strip since 2007, would be willing to hand power over to an independent body of Palestinians or a technocratic committee after the war. “There was a suggestion from the Egyptian side to have a committee of leaders, independent leaders, from Gaza, to take control in Gaza for a while and then we can go to general elections. We’ve said yes, because if they were nationalist and they are working for Gaza’s benefit and the people’s, why not have them?,” Hamdan said. Palestinians have a legal right to armed resistance. “You can’t talk about de-weaponizing the nation who is under occupation, while they are occupied by the most powerful army in the region,” Hamdan said.",

    "title": "UK and India agree ‘landmark’ trade deal after three years of negotiations",
    "article_text": "Britain andIndiahave agreed a long-desired trade deal that ministers said would cut tariffs and add £4.8bn a year to the UK economy by 2040. The agreement, which was finalised on Tuesday after more than three years of negotiations under successive governments, has long been touted as one of the biggest prizes ofBrexit. Keir Starmer said the “landmark deal” with India would “grow the economy and deliver for British people and business” after a call with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The deal promises a boon for the UK’s car and alcohol industries, which have suffered from the impact ofDonald Trump’s tariffsin the US. However, it has caused a row over a decision to exempt Indian workers who have been temporarily seconded to the UK and their employers from national insurance contributions (NICs) for three years. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, called it a system of “two-tier taxes”. The decision has also been criticised privately by some Labour MPs, given that NICs for UK employers have just been raised. The agreement, which is reciprocal and will apply to British workers temporarily seconded to India by companies with offices in both countries, was one of Delhi’s key asks in the deal and one of the longest-running sticking points up until last week. The Indian government described it as a “huge win” and “an unprecedented achievement” for its side. Yvette Cooper was not informed about the government’s plans to make it cheaper for Indian workers to come to the UK as part of the free trade agreement, the Guardian has learned. The home secretary was left in the dark over controversial elements of the agreement which will mean Indian workers and companies avoiding national insurance, even as those on British employers are being hiked. Home Office officials are said to have been confused by the process of agreeing the deal, having expected to be informed about anything which could increase migration to the UK. Jonathan Reynolds, the business and trade secretary, defended the move and told reporters that some people were “getting a little bit carried away as to what this actually means”. “We have 17 of these agreements with the EU, with South Korea, with the US and a whole range of partners, and what it is about is making sure when people are inter-company transfers between the UK and India – so for our people in India and Indian people in the UK – they don’t simultaneously pay into both social security systems,” he said. A Labour spokesperson also said Badenoch was “desperately seeking to distract from her failure with a made-up row about a standard tax agreement that will benefit British workers abroad”. “This deal will provide an annual £4.8bn boost for British businesses, create more jobs, raise wages by more than £2bn a year and bring down prices for hard-pressed consumers,” they added. Badenoch’s criticisms were also contradicted by several senior Tories who praised the deal. Oliver Dowden, who was deputy prime minister under Rishi Sunak and is still an MP, welcomed the news, writing on X that it “builds on significant progress made by [the] previous Conservative government”. Steve Baker, who dealt with trade as a Brexit minister under Theresa May, wrote: “This deal is great news. It further cements the path which I and others worked so hard to secure … the tax issue will likely turn out to be a red herring. “We should be celebrating that a Labour government has furthered free trade in the national interest outside the EU.” The deal is focused on tariff reductions for British and Indian goods across almost all sectors. India’s tariffs on British whisky and gin will be halved from 150% to 75% before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal. Tariffs on British cars will be reduced from about 110% to 10%, with quotas set on the number of British cars that can be exported to India and vice versa. India will cut tariffs across 90% of British product lines, including cosmetics, lamb, salmon, soft drinks, chocolate and biscuits, as well as medical devices, aircraft parts and electrical machinery. Based on 2022 figures, the tariff cuts will be worth £400m from the day the deal is implemented. The UK will lower tariffs on Indian clothes, footwear and food products. Ministers said this would give consumers access to cheaper products and more choice. Parallel talks to agree a bilateral investment treaty, which would establish legal protections for investments between the UK and India, have not yet reached resolution. As a result, the deal does not include the financial services or legal services sectors. The Law Society called it a “missed opportunity”. The deal does open up access for service firms to some Indian markets, including government procurement. It also involves reforms to customs procedures and rules of origin, allowing goods assembled in Britain to benefit from lower tariffs. Modi and Starmer are expected to meet in the coming months to sign off the deal before it is ratified by the two countries’ respective parliaments. Modi tweeted on Tuesday that India and the UK have “successfully concluded an ambitious and mutually beneficial free trade agreement” and that he was looking forward to welcoming Starmer to India soon. Officials said that by 2040 the deal would increase bilateral trade between the UK and India by £25.5bn, the UK’s GDP by £4.8bn and wages by £2.2bn each year. British negotiators said it was the most ambitious deal ever agreed by India. Officials said the deal involved no change to immigration policy but would facilitate visa routes for Indian professionals in certain sectors, and allow up to 1,800 visas for Indian chefs, musicians and yogis a year. There will be no exemption from the UK’s forthcoming carbon tax, although talks on this continue. There will be chapters on anti-corruption, gender equality, and environmental and labour standards. Reynolds held talks with his Indian counterpart, Piyush Goyal, in London on Tuesday last week, where the majority of outstanding issues were agreed. After a brief trip to Norway, Goyal returned to London and met Reynolds before returning to India. The pair agreed the final elements while walking in Hyde Park together on Friday. Negotiators have worked round the clock over the weekend to finalise the agreement. Reynolds relaunched the negotiations with India on a trip in March to Delhi, where the two sides agreed not to reopen the chapters agreed under the Conservatives. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The business secretary has led on negotiating this important trade deal. As you would expect, on a trade deal of such breadth and complexity, wide ranging discussions to have taken place right across government, with many departments, including the Home Office, involved.” The deal, which is the biggest and most economically significant trade deal the UK has done since leaving the EU, was pursued by a succession of Conservative prime ministers. Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both set Diwali deadlines to reach agreements but failed to get them over the line. Under Rishi Sunak, negotiators got close to finalising a deal but this was put on ice when the UK election was called. Reynolds said: “By striking a new trade deal with the fastest-growing economy in the world, we are delivering billions for the UK economy and wages every year and unlocking growth in every corner of the country. Mark Kent, the chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said it was “a once-in-a-generation deal and a landmark moment for scotch whisky exports to the world’s largest whisky market”. He said it could increase scotch whisky exports to India by £1bn over the next five years and create 1,200 UK jobs. Keshav R Murugesh, the chair of the Confederation of Indian Industry UK Business Forum, said the deal was “particularly important in a world where trade tensions are on the rise” and would help shield the British and Indian economies from external shocks.",

    "title": "India tries to halt auction of Piprahwa gems found with Buddha’s remains",
    "article_text": "The Indian government has issued a legal notice to halt the “unethical” auction of ancient gem relics, which it said should be treated as the sacred body of the Buddha. Its Ministry of Culture said theauction of the Piprahwa gemsin Hong Kong this week “violates Indian and international laws, as well as United Nations conventions”, and demanded their repatriation to India “for preservation and religious veneration”. The legal notice has been served on Sotheby’s Hong Kong and Chris Peppé, one of three heirs of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial landowner who in 1898excavated the gems on his estate in northern India, who are selling the relics. The auction, which has promptedan outcry from scholars and monastic leaders, is scheduled for 7 May, and the gems are expected to sell for about HK$100m (£9.7m). A letter,posted on the Ministry of Culture’s Instagram account, said Peppé, a Los Angeles-based TV director and film editor, lacked the authority to sell the relics. Sotheby’s, by holding the auction, was “participating in continued colonial exploitation”, it added. The ministry insisted on the immediate cessation of the auction, saying the gem relics “constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community”. It also called on Sotheby’s and Chris Peppé to issue a public apology to the Indian government and Buddhists worldwide, and for the full disclosure of all provenance documents and any other relics in the possession of William Peppé’s heirs or transferred by them to any other entity or individual. Failure to comply would result in legal proceedings in Indian andHong Kongcourts and through international bodies “for violations of cultural heritage laws”, the letter warned. The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby’s role “in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics”. The gems include amethysts, coral, garnets, pearls, rock crystals, shells and gold, either worked into pendants, beads and other ornaments, or in their natural form. They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funerary monument, called a stupa, in Piprahwa, in present-day Uttar Pradesh, India, between 240BC and 200BC, when they were mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480BC. The British crown claimed Peppé’s find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam. Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. Peppé was permitted to retain approximately a fifth of them, which were described as “duplicates” of some of the others. On the matter of the gems’ provenance and ownership, the ministry’s letter noted that under the Buddhist religion, materials in sacred funerary mounds are “sacred grave goods … inseparable from the sacred relics and cannot be commodified. “We beg to note that the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as ‘specimens’ but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha.” The ministry added that the sellers, who describe themselves as custodians of the gems, “had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset … an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics”. Its letter said the proposed auction “offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide”, violated ethics and disrupted sacred tradition. Peppé, who wrote a piece for Sotheby’sabout his family’s custodianship of the gems, said: “In light of the Indian government’s sudden interest in the gems, 25% of auction proceeds will be donated to the displaying of the main Kolkata collection of the Piprahwa gems for Buddhists and the larger public to enjoy. Another 25% will be donated to Buddhist institutions.” With regards to his and his two relatives’ right to sell the gems, he added: “Legally, the ownership is unchallenged.” Sotheby’s said the auction would proceed as planned. The auction house previously told the Guardian that it had conducted “requisite due diligence”, including in relation to provenance and legality.",

    "title": "Starmer beats Trump to the line in race for trade deal with India",
    "article_text": "It is not exactly the deepest and most comprehensive trade deal the UK has ever entered, but the timing of the announcement that Keir Starmer has clinched afree trade deal with Indiacould not be more fortunate. Over the weekend, the US president, Donald Trump, hinted he was on the verge of announcing his first trade deal, prompting speculation it could be with Japan, South Korea orIndia. Now Starmer has beaten him to it. The world’s biggest economic blocs are engaged in a complex dating game. Both the EU and UK are hoping to charm the US into a deal before it potentially strikes a deal with China, which would put the EU and UK into second-order negotiations. “This is welcome news and a coded reminder to Donald Trump that not all UK eggs are in the US basket,” said Mij Rahman, managing director of the Eurasia Group political consultancy. “The real test for Keir Starmer will be how far he can dismantle the trade friction with the UK’s biggest trading partner – the EU. That will require a bolder approach to the reset than we have seen so far,” he added. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, describedthe dealas an “historic milestone”, while the UK’s Labour government described it as “the biggest and most economically significant bilateral trade deal the UK has done since leaving the EU”, the kind of bragging rights a post-Brexit Conservative government only dreamed of. The deal will reduce tariffs on 90% of British goods currently attracting import taxes in India, with levies on British whisky and gin slashed from 150% to 75%, before reducing to 40% by the 10th year of the deal.Tariffson cars will be reduced from 100% to 10% in a quota system. Drinks company Diageo was delighted, with its chief executive, Debra Crew, describing the deal as a “huge achievement” that “will be transformational for Scotch and Scotland”. It will also open important markets such as aerospace, salmon, lamb, medical devices, electrical machinery, soft drinks, chocolate and biscuits. “The UK government may have gone for speed rather than substance to get a deal over the line in Trump-world. Negotiations with India have dragged on for years and stalled over immigration, which is not covered by this deal,” said Rahman. Legal services are not included either. In total, the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade between the UK and India – currently worth about £40bn – by £25.5bn a year. This is a fraction of the near £315bn trade between the UK and the US, but it is seen as a good starting point rather than the finished product. “This is a less ambitious deal than the last government hoped for, but that just reflects what was realistically available with India. As a step forward this makes sense, though not economically transformational,” said David Henig, UK director of the European Centre for International Political Economy. He said the UK could have tried to hold out for a bigger deal, but there was “little point … as it wasn’t going to happen anyway”. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion In India, economist Mihir Sharma said the small print, which was not yet available, was what mattered. Trade talks with India have in the past broken down over demands for more UK visa rights for Indian students and professionals, something that caused tension in previoustalks with Theresa May in 2016. Sharma said this deal “looks like a win for Starmer – India has made some pretty big concessions that it has not yet made to other countries”. Extra visas are limited to just 1,800 a year for yogis, musicians and chefs. In addition, Indian workers temporarily living in the UK – and moved there by their company – will not have to pay national insurance contributions for three years. The deal has its genesis in Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government, which opened talks with India in January 2022 with an ambitious target of agreement in 32 chapters. But legal and financial services have been omitted in what is by and large a tariff deal, while there is no mention of the bilateral investment treaty currently under negotiation. Miles Celic, chief executive of financial service body TheCityUK, welcomed the deal but said he was awaiting the “scope and details” as well as any hint of the “prospects for any future opportunities for new openings of trade in financial and related professional services, for which we have long advocated.”",

    "title": "Cornish tin was sold all over Europe 3,000 years ago, say archaeologists",
    "article_text": "In about 1300BC, the major civilisations of the eastern Mediterranean made a cultural and technological leap forward when theybegan using bronze much more widelyfor weapons, tools and jewellery. While a form of the metal had previously been used in smaller quantities by the Mycenaeans and Egyptians among others, bronze was now abundant – but how? Most bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, but while the former was widely available in antiquity, tin is a rare element, with no large sources within thousands of kilometres. This left one big question, referred to by archaeologists as the “tin problem”. Where were the bronze age societies of the Mediterranean getting the tin for their bronze? A British-led group of archaeologists believe they have solved the mystery. By scientifically analysing ore and artefacts from across Europe, they have established that tin from the abundant deposits inCornwalland Devon was being widely traded in the Mediterranean more than 3,000 years ago – and may have played a key part in the advances of sophisticated kingdoms and states more than 4,000km (2,485 miles) away. “This is the first commodity to be exported across the entire continent in British history,” said Dr Benjamin Roberts, an associate professor of archaeology at Durham University. The identification of the trade network “radically transforms” our understanding of bronze age Britain’s place in the wider world, he said. “The volume, consistence and frequency of the estimated scale in the tin trade is far larger than has been imagined and requires an entirely new perspective on what bronze age miners and merchants were able to achieve.” The study, the first major project of its kind, performed trace element, lead isotope and tin element analysis on tin ingots recovered from bronze age shipwrecks in the Mediterranean, including three that sank off the coast of Israel. Scientists also analysed ore samples and ancient tin artefacts from south-west Britain and the handful of other European sources. By comparing their results, the authors were able to establish not only that Cornish tin was being widely traded in the eastern Mediterranean, but also that “a whole chain of interconnected communities [were shipping] the tin through the rivers of France, through Sardinia, along the Mediterranean islands off Cyprus, and then to the coast of Israel”, said Roberts. Their findings are published in the latest issue ofAntiquity. The tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon are among the largest and most accessible in the world, and would later be mined extensively. But while the Greek writer Pytheas wrote of tin trading in Cornwall during the iron age, many experts had been sceptical that Britain’s earlier bronze age inhabitants – small farming communities that had neither towns nor writing – could be part of a widespread trading network with sophisticated Mediterranean societies, said Roberts. While the trade at the time was not exclusively in Cornish tin, “we believe it was the richest, the most easily accessible and the main source”, said Alan Williams, an honorary fellow of archaeology at Durham University. Williams said he had been “dreaming” of researching Cornish tin’s role in the bronze age since he was a student geologist at one of the county’s last working tin mines, 50 years ago. He will shortly join Roberts in an archaeological dig at St Michael’s Mount in Cornwall, which they believe may have been a centre for bronze age tin smelting and key link in the tin trading network.",

    "article_text": "The parole hearing for Charles Bronson, one of the UK’s longest serving and most notorious prisoners, will be held in private, a judicial Parole Board member has decided. The decision comes after the 72-year-old – who later changed his name to Charles Salvador –took part in one of the country’s first public parole hearingsin 2023. On Tuesday a document was published in which judicial Parole Board member Jeremy Roberts KC, on behalf of the board chair, said he had not granted the application for Bronson’s parole hearing to be made public. Bronson has spent most of the past 48 years incarcerated – apart from two brief periods, during which he reoffended – for numerous thefts, firearms and violent offences, including 11 hostage-taking incidents in nine different sieges. Victims included prison governors, doctors, staff and on one occasion, his own solicitor. Bronson – whose real name is Michael Peterson and who has been diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder – was handed a discretionary life sentence with a minimum term of four years in 2000 for taking prison art teacher Phil Danielson hostage at HMP Hull for 44 hours. Since then, the Parole Board has repeatedly refused to direct his release. The 2023 parole review was his eighth. Bronson was the first prisoner to formally ask for a public hearing after rules changed in 2022 in a bid to remove the secrecy around the parole process. In the document published on Tuesday, Roberts said the application for a public hearing was made on 9 February by the prisoner’s solicitor. Representations on Bronson’s behalf said he “feels that he is directly responsible for the change in law and Parole Board rules and so he should be allowed to participate in a public hearing”. He has a “legitimate expectation that his subsequent parole hearings will be held in public following his lengthy proceedings to instigate the change in the rules”. Roberts said the fact that Bronson is responsible for the change in the law “does not give him any legitimate expectation that his subsequent hearings will be held in public”. Bronson’s solicitor said the prisoner “is not vulnerable and, given his wish for a public hearing”, it could cause him undue emotional stress if the hearing was not held in public. They added: “He believes he will achieve best evidence and this will not be impacted by the hearing being in public.” But Roberts said: “The prisoner is obviously highly intelligent (albeit liable to some eccentric beliefs and attitudes) and I do not think it likely that he would suffer undue emotional stress if this hearing is held privately.

The solicitor added his client “believes that his risk has significantly reduced” and that a “discussion about risk and risk reduction in a public hearing would aid public confidence”. Roberts agreed that “there is a public interest in increasing the public’s understanding of the parole process and that transparency, where possible, is important for public confidence in the system”. He also said the Parole Board has, over the last few years, made “great efforts” to improve the transparency of its proceedings. Roberts said the introduction of public hearings is another step taken but added: “Public hearings and the arrangements for them are expensive and time-consuming, and unless and until the board is provided with the necessary funds to carry them out in more cases it must be selective in the holding of a public hearing only where it is likely to increase public understanding of the process or will benefit the public or victims in some other way.” The secretary of state’s representations were provided on her behalf by a senior official in the Ministry of Justice, who said Bronson’s “readiness to resort to violence continues to be evident, and the secretary of state is concerned that a public hearing would prompt a display of violence in a way that a private hearing might not”. Roberts said there had been a “marked improvement in recent years in the prisoner’s attitudes to (and relationships with) prison staff”.",

    "article_text": "Chris Pelkeywas killedin a road rage shooting in Chandler, Arizona, in 2021. Three-and-a-half years later, Pelkeyappeared in an Arizona courtto address his killer. Sort of. “To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,” says a video recording of Pelkey. “In another life, we probably could have been friends.” “I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have, and I still do,” Pelkey continues, wearing a grey baseball cap and sporting the same thick red and brown beard he wore in life. Pelkeywas 37 years old, devoutly religious and an army combat veteran. Horcasitas shot Pelkey at a red light in 2021 after Pelkey exited his vehicle and walked back towards Horcasitas’s car. Pelkey’s appearance from beyond the grave was made possible by artificial intelligence in what could be the first use of AI to deliver a victim impact statement. Stacey Wales, Pelkey’s sister, told local outlet ABC-15 that she had a recurring thought when gathering more than 40 impact statements from Chris’s family and friends. “All I kept coming back to was, what would Chris say?” Wales said. As AI spreads across society and enters the courtroom, theUS judicial conference advisory committee has announcedthat it will begin seeking public comment as part of determining how to regulate the use of AI-generated evidence at trial. Wales and her husband fed an AI model videos and audio of Pelkey to try and come up with a rendering that would match the sentiments and thoughts of a still-alive Pelkey, something that Wales compared with a “Frankenstein of love” tolocal outlet Fox 10. Judge Todd Lang responded positively to the AI usage. Lang ultimately sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.

As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,” Lang said. “I feel that that was genuine.” Also in favor was Pelkey’s brother John, who said that he felt “waves of healing” from seeing his brother’s face, and believes that Chris would have forgiven his killer. “That was the man I knew,” John said.",

    "title": "Woman says Boston hotel guard told her to leave bathroom because she ‘was a man’",
    "article_text": "A couple visitingBostonsays they were left confused and appalled after being forced out of the Liberty Hotel during a Kentucky Derby party on Saturday, following what they describe as being confronted and wrongfully accused in the women’s restroom. Ansley Baker and her girlfriend, Liz Victor, both cisgender women, said a hotel security guard entered the women’s bathroom and demanded Baker leave the stall she was using, claiming she didn’t belong there. “All of a sudden there was banging on the door,” Baker recalled toCBS News. “I pulled my shorts up. I hadn’t even tied them. One of the security guards was there telling me to get out of the bathroom, that I was a man in the women’s bathroom. I said: ‘I’m a woman.’” Victor, waiting by the sinks, heard the commotion and saw the security guard confronting Baker. “I looked down and I saw her shoes and that’s when I was like: ‘What is going on?’” she told the network. The couple said that once Baker was being escorted out, other women in line hurled insults, calling her “a creep” and demanding she be removed. Security staff then allegedly asked both women to show their IDs to confirm their gender. After a heated exchange, they were told to leave the hotel. In a statement shared with CBS, the Liberty Hotel accuse the two women of sharing one stall: “An incident occurred at the Liberty Hotel on Saturday, May 3 where several women alerted security of two adults sharing a bathroom stall. The bathroom was cleared out as two adults in one stall are not permitted. After leaving the bathroom, a member of the couple from the stall put their hands on our security team and it was then that they were removed from the premises. “The Liberty Hotel has a zero-tolerance policy for any physical altercations on our property. The safety of our guests and staff is our priority, and this event is under investigation. The Liberty Hotel is and always will be an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and a place where everyone is welcome and celebrated.” Later on Tuesday, the Liberty Hotel said it had now “concluded the investigation into the situation that occurred on May 3rd”, in a fresh statement shared with the Guardian that appeared to take a different stance on the incident. The security officer involved in the incident was being “suspended from their position immediately” following the hotel’s investigation. The statement also added that the general manager was reaching out to the individuals involved, and that the hotel was conducting “mandatory retraining for all staff on inclusive practices and guest interaction protocols, with a particular focus on creating a safe and welcoming space for LGBTQ+ individuals”. The statement went on: “In a reaffirmation of our values, the hotel is making a donation to a local LGBTQ+ organization that we have partnered with in the past, on International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT), on May 17.” It then repeated a point made in the earlier statement: “The Liberty Hotel is and always will be an ally of the LGBTQ+ community and a place where everyone is welcome and celebrated.” Baker and Victor had insisted in interviews with local media that they were never in the same stall and disputed the hotel’s initial account of events. “Once the stall door opened, and I’m the only one in there, it escalated further,” Baker toldBoston News 25. “I don’t think that aligns with what they’re saying.” The couple said they have made sure that Boston mayor Michelle Wu’s office was aware of their experience in hopes that they can stop a similar situation from happening to anyone else. They also hope their experience can spark awareness and change. “We know we’re not the only ones that face this kind of thing,” Baker said to CBS. Victor added: “It was a very scary situation, but trans women experience this every single day in the US and across the world.” The Guardian has not been able to reach the couple for comment. The incident comes at a time of heightened tension between the administration and the LGBTQ+ community. Some of Donald Trump’s earliest moves in office were to sign executive orders directing the prohibition of gender transitions for people underthe age of 19and banningtrans athletesfrom competing in women’s sports. On his first day in office, Trump signedan executive ordercalled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government”, instructing the federal government to remove “all radical gender ideology guidance, communication, policies, and forms”. Trump has also limited access and funding for LGBTQ+ arts, with orders that instruct arts organizations not to fund projects that promote “gender ideology” as well asappointing himselfchair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The incident also echoed an ongoing Republican talking point centered on bathrooms and gender identity. In November 2024, the South Carolina Republican Nancy Mace introduced a bill to ban the representative Sarah McBride from using the bathroom that corresponds with her gender identity. Speaker Mike Johnson hassupported and subsequently enforced that ban.",

    "title": "Inter defeat Barcelona by equalling Champions League semifinal record",
    "article_text": "Inter Milan substitute Davide Frattesi struck an extra-time winner to send his side into the Champions League final following abarnstorming 4-3 victoryover Barcelona after Francesco Acerbi had rescued them from the brink of elimination with a stunning equaliser deep in added time. Frattesi’s goal and a string of stunning saves by goalkeeper Yann Sommer secured Inter a rip-roaring and record-equalling 7-6 aggregate victory in a semifinal for the ages, which finished with the Italian side reaching the Munich final.  They will later this month face either Paris St Germain or Arsenal, who meet on Wednesday. It was a tale of two halves as Inter dominated the first 45 minutes and opened a two-goal lead thanks to a Lautaro Martinez goal on the counter in the 21st minute, before Hakan Calhanoglu extended the lead with a penalty right before the break. However, Barca woke up in the second half with Eric Garcia and Dani Olmo netting within six minutes to level the scoring and, even though Sommer worked his magic to help keep the hosts alive, the Catalans thought they had scored the winner through Raphinha who struck from close range in the 87th minute. But as Inter made a desperate run for an equaliser, Denzel Dumfries found 37-year-old Acerbi inside the box, who fired a first-time effort into the net to score his first European goal in his 20th season and take the game to extra time. In the 99th minute, Marcus Thuram made a brilliant run from the right and played the ball into the area for Frattesi, who set himself up before neatly guiding a curling shot into the bottom corner to send the delighted home fans into raptures. Sommer made two world-class saves from teenager Lamine Yamal to secure the hard-fought win for Inter, who will bid to claim their fourth Champions League title and their first in 15 years after losing to Manchester City in the final two years ago. “I’m lucky to have finished the game. I screamed so much that I saw everything black,” Frattesi told Sky Sport. “I have to thank the physiotherapists because, in recent days, I was not well, I dedicate the victory to them. It’s incredible, I don’t know what to say. Tonight, the incredible happened.” Barcelona, who were chasing a treble after winning the Copa del Rey by beating Real Madrid in extra-time, will now have to focus on LaLiga, where on Sunday, they host their old rivals who are in second place and trail them by four points. “Football has been very cruel to us,” Barca defender Eric Garcia told Movistar Plus. “We were down 2-0 again, and the character this team showed was remarkable. “We are a team full of young players and this has been a great year. We still have the [Spanish] league to play for.” The previous standalone record score for a semifinal was Liverpool’s 7-6 aggregate win against Roma during the 2017-2018 season.",

    "article_text": "In recent years, California – home to America’s film industry – has slipped to become the sixth most preferred location to shoot and produce movies. Hollywood producers are moving to cities in Canada, the United Kingdom, Central Europe and New Zealand, lured by a range of financial benefits on offer. US President Donald Trump wants to reverse this trend and says he wants to “make movies in America, again”. And he’s using the stick to do so. Trump has ordered 100 percent tariffs on imported movies and those made outside the United States. The move has confused Hollywood and the European film industry. So, how will the tariffs be implemented? Will a movie partly produced outside the US be punished? And what about films made for streaming platforms? And how will the tariffs affect the movie industry globally?

    "title": "India launches ‘Operation Sindoor’, missiles hit several sites in Pakistan",
    "article_text": "India’s military says it launched “Operation Sindoor“, striking nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, after which Islamabad said it had retaliated by striking Indian military targets, including downing several warplanes. The Indian strike and counterattack by Pakistan come amid soaring tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours after adeadly attacklast month on tourists in Indian-administeredKashmirthat New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, which denied any involvement. India’s government said in a statement early on Wednesday that its military had attacked “terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed”. “Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” it said. Pakistani officials said at least eight people were killed and more than 35 injured in India’s attacks. The missiles struck locations in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the country’s eastern Punjab province. Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, said the cities of Muzaffarabad and Kotli, both in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, were among the targets of the Indian strikes. “Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to a foreign TV network, confirmed that at least five Indian aircraft have been shot down and that a number of Indian soldiers have been taken prisoner,” Hyder said. “Pakistan said that it would respond to any Indian attack against Pakistan, and Pakistan is now responding to that Indian attack,” he said. “Heavy shelling has now resumed on the Line of Control that separates Pakistan-administered Kashmir from Indian-administered Kashmir,” he added. A Pakistani military spokesman had earlier told the broadcaster Geo that at least five locations, including two mosques, had been hit. He had also said that Pakistan’s response was under way, without providing details. In Punjab, missiles hit a mosque in the city of Bahawalpur, killing a child and wounding two civilians, the military said. Following India’s attacks, the armies of the two sides exchanged intense shelling and heavy gunfire across their frontier in disputed Kashmir in at least three places, the Reuters news agency reported, citing police and witnesses. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for maximum restraint from both sides. “The secretary-general is very concerned about the Indian military operations across the Line of Control and international border. He calls for maximum military restraint from both countries,” the spokesperson said. “The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.” United States President Donald Trump said the clashes were “a shame”. “I just hope it ends very quickly,” Trump said at the White House. The eruption of violence comes amid heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in the aftermath of anattackon tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. India blamed Pakistan for the violence, in which 26 men were killed, and promised to respond. Pakistan denied that it had anything to do with the killings. Nitasha Kaul, the director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy, said the strikes are “very concerning”. “Once again, the worst affected are going to be the people in the region, the Kashmiris, who are caught between the competing and proprietorial and rival postures and attitudes of India and Pakistan,” Kaul told Al Jazeera. Still, she said, the escalation is “not that surprising, because within India … there has been a domestic pressure building up for a more militarist response, given the fact that there is a particularly hyper-nationalist government in power. “In that sense, sadly, this was a countdown to a greater escalation, and hopefully it won’t proceed much further beyond what has already happened with these strikes,” Kaul added.",

    "title": "Key takeaways from Donald Trump’s meeting with Canada’s PM Mark Carney",
    "article_text": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has made his much-anticipated first visit to the White House, as his country and the United States continue to spar over trade, tariffs and the prospect of reimagining their shared borders. Seated across from Carney in the Oval Office on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump continued to advocate for Canada becoming part of its southern neighbour. But Carneyreiterated his firm commitmentto defending Canadian sovereignty, though he spoke only briefly during his half-hour appearance with Trump in the Oval Office. “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” Carney told Trump, in a gesture to the president’s background as a real-estate developer. He then referenced his mandate from Canada’s recent federal elections, which reflected growing anti-Trump sentiment among Canadian voters. “Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign these last several months, it’s not for sale — won’t be for sale — ever,” Carney said of his country. Overall, however, the meeting was cordial, with the two leaders exchanging warm words and Trump teasing a breakthrough with the Houthis, an armed group in Yemen. Here are five key takeaways from their meeting. Carney’s appearance at the White House comes just over a week after his country’s federal elections on April 28, which saw Trump emerge as a defining force. While the research firm Ipsos found that affordability and the cost of living topped the list of voter concerns in Canada,24 percentof respondents identified Canada’s increasingly fractious relationship with the US as a leading issue as well. A separate Ipsospollfound that more voters trusted Carney to handle Trump than any other candidate. The centre-left Liberals ultimately won 169 seats out of 343, enough to form a minority government — and enough for Carney, the Liberal leader, to remain Canada’s prime minister. But that was a stark reversal from the Liberal Party’s sagging poll numbers at the start of the year. Experts believe Trump’s second term, which began on January 20, helped propel the Liberal Party’s comeback. His remarks about Canada becoming a US state and his aggressive tariff policy alienated many Canadians, who felt their country’s close ties with the US had soured. And some voters feared that Canada’s Conservative Party — which had previously been the frontrunner in the elections — might capitulate to Trump’s demands. As Trump opened his sit-down on Tuesday with Carney, he gave a nod to the Liberals’ come-from-behind victory, joking that he took partial credit for the party’s electoral success. “I think I was probably the greatest thing that happened to him,” Trump said of Carney. “But I can’t take full credit. His party was losing by a lot. And he ended up winning. So I really want to congratulate him. It was probably one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics. Maybe even greater than mine.” Trump proceeded to shower Carney with praise, calling him a “very good” and “very talented person” with whom he had “a lot of things in common”. By contrast, the US president launched barbs at Carney’s predecessor, fellow Liberal Justin Trudeau, who served as Canada’s prime minister from 2015 until March of this year. “I didn’t like his predecessor,” Trump said shortly. He also hinted at other tense relationships with other world leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with whom he had anOval Office shouting matchin February. “ This is very friendly. This is not gonna be like we had another little blow-up with somebody else. It was a much different. This is a very friendly conversation,” Trump said. Carney, for his part, responded with compliments of his own for Trump. “You’re a transformational president,” Carney said at the outset, praising the US president’s “relentless focus on the American worker”. He also drew a parallel between Trump’s leadership and his own, saying he had been elected “to transform Canada, with a similar focus on the economy” and “securing our borders”. “The history of Canada and the US is we’re stronger when we work together, and there are many opportunities to work together,” Carney said. “I look forward to addressing some of those issues that we have, but also finding those areas of mutual cooperation so we can go forward.” The two leaders’ conversation, however, quickly shifted to one of the most contentious issues facing their countries’ ties: Trump’s threats to make Canada part of the US. Since December, Trump has made regular remarks that Canada should be absorbed into the US as a 51st state, owing to an imbalance of trade. According to the US government, Canada is the largest destination for US exports and one of its top three sources for imports. But Canada exports more to the US than it imports, creating a deficit of $63.3bn in Canada’s favour. Experts say trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing: They can indicate a stronger consumer base or differences in currency value. But Trump has repeatedly framed the US’s trade deficit with Canada as a “subsidy” that keeps the country’s economy afloat. In the lead-up to Tuesday’s meeting, the US president pledged to broach the issue of statehood with Carney. “I’ll always talk about that,” he told the TV news programme Meet the Press on Saturday. But during the public portion of their meeting, Trump took a more subdued approach, saying that, while he believed statehood to be a boon for Canada, he would not force the issue. “I still believe that, but it takes two to tango, right?” Trump told reporters. He later added, “I do feel it’s much better for Canada. But we’re not gonna be discussing that unless somebody wants to discuss it.” He nevertheless revisited familiar arguments for combining the two countries, including that statehood would allow Canada to avoid the steep 25-percent tariffs the US has placed on many of its exports, including steel and aluminium. “I believe it would be a massive tax cut for the Canadian citizens. You get free military, you get tremendous medical care and other things. There would be a lot of advantages, but it would be a massive tax cut,” he said. When Carney responded that Canada was “not for sale”, Trump doubled down, saying, “Never say never.” But Carney scrunched up his face with a cheeky look and appeared to mouth the word “never” multiple times to the journalists circled around them. He also attempted to steer the discussion to more neutral ground, praising Trump for pushing Western powers to invest more in military defence. Still, reporters continued to press the two leaders about the controversial remarks. One asked Trump whether he would accept the will of the Canadian people not to become a 51st state. “Sure, I would,” Trump replied. “But this is not necessarily a one-day deal. This is over a period of time they have to make that decision.” Carney once again chimed in with a brief but blunt response. “Respectfully, Canadians’ view on this is not going to change.” Later, outside the Canadian embassy in Washington, DC, Carney described the Oval Office meeting as a turning point for their bilateral ties. “ Today marked the end of the beginning of a process of the United States and Canada redefining that relationship of working together,” Carney said. “The question is how we will cooperate in the future.” In the Oval Office, Trump was unwavering in his commitment to imposing tariffs on Canada, describing the import taxes as essential to protecting US industries from competition. “Is there anything he can say to you in the course of your meeting with him today that can get you to lift tariffs on Canada?” a reporter in the Oval Office asked. Trump responded with uncharacteristic brevity: “No.” He later explained that it was his hope to create US industries that relied on no outside support, not even from close allies like Canada, whose economy is intimately interwoven with that of its southern neighbour. Trump referenced the decline of the American auto and steel industries as motives for his tariffs. “We want to make our own cars. We don’t really want cars from Canada, and we put tariffs on cars from Canada. At a certain point, it won’t make economic sense for Canada to build those cars,” Trump said. “And we don’t want steel from Canada because we’re making our own steel, and we’re having massive steel plants being built right now as we speak.” He also repeated his false assertion that the US trade deficit with Canada amounted to a “subsidy” — and he appeared to cast doubt about whether Canada’s economy would survive without US support. “They have a surplus with us, and there’s no reason for us to be subsidising Canada,” Trump said. “Canada will have to be able to take care of itself economically. I assume they can.” Carney, meanwhile, highlighted the close relations the US and Canada have enjoyed in the past, arguing that cross-border trade has made both of their economies stronger. “We are the largest client of the United States in the totality of all the goods. So we are the largest client in the United States,” he said. “Fifty percent of a car that comes from Canada is American. That’s not like anywhere else in the world.” Both leaders agreed that the current United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) needed to be renegotiated. Canada has framed Trump’s tariffs as a violation of the free-trade agreement, which was signed under the US president’s first term in 2019. “ The USMCA is great for all countries,” Trump said during Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting. But he added that the deal was a “transitional step” that would “get renegotiated very shortly”. Carney echoed that assessment, saying that the USMCA would be a launchpad for broader discussions. “It is a basis for a broader negotiation. Some things about it are going to have to change,” he said, offering measured criticism of Trump’s tariff policy. “Part of the way you’ve conducted these tariffs has taken advantage of existing aspects of USMCA, so it’s going to have to change.” While much of the Oval Office discussion revolved around trade, Trump briefly veered into the topic of international conflicts, saying that the war in Ukraine would feature heavily in his closed-door discussions with Carney. He also announced his administration would end its nearly two-month-long bombing campaign in Yemen, where the US military has beenattackingHouthi strongholds. The US Central Command has said more than 800 targets have been bombed since Trump began the US’s latest round of strikes on March 15, known as Operation Rough Rider. But the effort has been riddled with controversy. Aid groups have warned of civilian casualties, including the suspected bombing of amigrant centrein Saada, in Yemen’s north. And details of the initial strikeswere accidentally leakedto a journalist on the messaging app Signal, spurring questions about mismanagement within the Trump White House. But on Tuesday, Trump announced a shift in the ongoing fight with the Houthis. “We had some very good news last night,” Trump said. “They’ve announced — to us, at least — that they don’t want to fight anymore. They just don’t want to fight. And we will honour that. And we will stop the bombings.” The Houthis had been launching attacks against commercial vessels and naval ships in the Red Sea, as part of the group’s opposition to Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 52,615 Palestinians. “They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore. And that’s the purpose of what we were doing,” Trump added. “We are going to stop the bombing of the Houthis effective immediately.” Shortly thereafter, a senior Houthi official posted on social media that the deal stillneeded to be “evaluatedon the ground first”.",

    "title": "Trump says bombing of Yemen to stop as Oman confirms US-Houthi ceasefire",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has announced the United States is abandoning its daily bombing campaign of Yemen based on an understanding with the Houthis as Oman confirms that it has brokered a ceasefire between Washington and the armed group. “The Houthis have announced to us that they don’t want to fight any more. They just don’t want to fight, and we will honour that, and we will stop the bombings,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Tuesday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump claimed that the Iran-aligned Yemeni group “capitulated” and has promised not to carry out attacks on shipping. It launched those attacks in October 2023 shortly after the war in Gaza started, saying the attacks were in support of Palestinians. “I will accept their word, and we will be stopping the bombing of Houthis, effective immediately,” the US president said. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the two sides have agreed to a ceasefire. “Following recent discussions and contacts conducted by the Sultanate of Oman with the United States and the relevant authorities in Sana’a, in the Republic of Yemen, with the aim of de-escalation, efforts have resulted in a ceasefire agreement between the two sides,” he wrote in a post on X. “In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.” Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council, wrote in a post on X that “Trump’s announcement of a halt to America’s aggression against Yemen will be evaluated on the ground first.” “Yemen operations were and still are a support for Gaza to stop the aggression and bring in aid,” he added, suggesting that the group would not halt its attacks on Israel. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said that the US State Department clarified that the agreement did not relate to the conflict between Israel and the Houthis. “It was made very clear by the US State Department that the deal relates directly to Houthi operations in the coast of Yemen, specifically in regard to US shipping,” he said. The ceasefire announcement comes hours after the Israeli military launchedair strikes on the airport in Sanaa, inflicting devastating damage and rendering it inoperable. Dozens of Israeli warplanes also launched several waves of large-scale overnightstrikes on Yemen’s vital port of Hodeidahin what Israel said was a response after the Houthis hit the perimeter of Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport with a ballistic missile. The US military has beenlaunching daily air strikes across Yemenfor nearly two months, destroying infrastructure and killing dozens of people, including children and civilians. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem said it was “possible” that Iran helped to convince the Houthis to de-escalate their attacks. “The Omanis have also been the main mediators between the US and Iran, and now the Houthis and the Americans. There are indications that the nuclear talks are advancing, with a framework shaping over sanctions lifting in exchange for nuclear restrictions,” he said. “It is possible that the Iranians have helped in convincing the Houthis to de-escalate, especially if we see this reflected on the Iranian-American talks. It could have been an incentive for the nuclear talks to be done quicker.”",

    "title": "Palestine and the decline of the US empire",
    "article_text": "It has been 19 months now since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza. The International Court of Justice is investigating a “plausible genocide”, while the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes. Scholars of genocide, major human rights organisations, and United Nations experts have identified what is going on in Gaza as genocide. People across the world have marched to call on their governments to act to stop it. There is a single power that stands in the way of putting an end to this genocide: the United States. One administration has handed over to another, and yet there has been no change in policy. Unconditional support for Israel seems to be a doctrine that the US political establishment is unwilling to touch. Various analyses have suggested that at the root of this “special relationship” are Judeo-Christian values and a shared democratic path; others have argued that it has to do with the two-party system and the donor class dominating US politics. But the reality is far simpler. The US views Israel as a critical ally because it helps promote US global supremacy at a time when it is facing inevitable decline. Israel’s survival in its current settler-colonial form – the US elites believe – is closely tied to maintaining US supremacy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the US has been leading a unipolar world as the sole superpower. As a continuation of Western imperial global dominance, the US empire holds much sway over global economic, political, and cultural matters, often with devastating consequences for the lives of millions of people around the world. Like all empires, the US solidifies and expands its position of supremacy and hegemony in the world through its overwhelming military force. Through the US infrastructure of organised imperial violence, it is able to secure access to and control of resources, trade routes, and markets. This, in turn, guarantees continuous economic growth and dominance. But in recent years, we have seen signs that US supremacy is being challenged. The momentum to do so built up in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 US financial crisis, which turned into a global one. It demonstrated the negative impact of US supremacy on the world economy and motivated powers such as China and India to take action to protect themselves from it. The BRICS coalition of economies emerged as their shared response on the economic front. In the following years, various US foreign policy mishaps, including the US failure in Afghanistan, its waning influence in Africa and its inability to prevent the Russian invasion of Ukraine, also demonstrated the limits of US global power. The rise of US President Donald Trump and far-right populism in the United States reflected the fact that cracks were appearing in the very core of the US-led so-called liberal order. No empire has ever easily accepted its decline, and neither will the US. It intends to hold onto its status as the unquestionable superpower, and for that, it needs imperial outposts to stand loyally by its side. Throughout the Cold War, Western Europe and Israel stood as the US’s junior partners in its confrontation with the Soviet Union in Europe and the Middle East. Today, while the decades-old transatlantic alliance seems to somewhat falter, the US-Israeli relationship appears as strong as ever. Israel has demonstrated loyalty as an imperial outpost. It has played a key role in supporting US imperialism in two ways. First, Israel helps the US secure its access to and control over one of the most critical markets for any empire: the energy market. The Middle East is an important force in the global energy trade, and its oil and gas policies can have a tremendous impact on the world economy. What the US fears the most is losing its dominance in the global energy markets to a competing power, which is why it wants to secure its interests by establishing a regional order in the Middle East that overwhelmingly favours its imperial power. This new order is about giving the US a major advantage over any competitor seeking to make inroads into the region, namely China. For the administration of former US President Joe Biden and its successor, the Trump administration, the Israeli genocide of Palestinians and aggression against neighbouring countries are about establishing this new security reality in the region by eliminating hostile groups and governments. That is why US support for them has not stopped. Second, Israel plays a critical role in advancing US military supremacy. The US provides Israel with billions of dollars in aid, which is in fact a form of self-investment in developing military capabilities and expanding sales. The Israeli state uses these funds to buy weapons from US arms manufacturers, which then use Israel’s deployment of that weaponry in the Middle East as testing and marketing tools. The US military-industrial complex is thus able to sell more weapons and continue to innovate and grow to ensure the US has a military edge over its rivals. In this sense, Israel is one of the most critical parts of the US imperial machinery. Without it, the US would find it challenging to maintain its imperial power in the Middle East. It is for this reason that Biden once famously proclaimed that if Israel did not exist, the US would have to invent it. Over the past year, we have witnessed an unprecedented attack on the Palestine solidarity movement in the US, which has affected all public spheres, including education and healthcare. We have also seen an intensification of US threats against states, such as South Africa, for their support for Palestine. Based on the magnitude of the resources and energy that the US empire expends on the elimination and subjugation of Palestinians, one has to wonder, what is it about a stateless people with no economic and diplomatic capital or military power that terrifies the world’s sole superpower? The answer is that the US empire views a free Palestine as the beginning of its own end. The US is actively working to prevent the world from doing the right thing and isolating the Israeli state economically and politically because it fears what may come next. Such isolation would make it difficult for Israel to continue its existence as a settler colonial project, and ultimately could lead to a decolonisation process. The end result of that would be Palestinians and Israelis living together under a new decolonial political system that would be integrated into the region and would no longer serve imperial power. A decolonised entity in Palestine/Israel would be a major step in the decolonisation of the world order itself and its liberation from US imperial power. And this is what the US dreads. In this sense, it is in the self-interest of the overwhelming majority of the world’s nations to follow this path. The future of Palestinians, who are facing the real threat of elimination and total subjugation today, depends on this. And the future of many other nations, if they wish to avoid the current unspeakable brutalities that Palestinians are facing all on their own, also depends on this. As much as the US needs a settler colonial Israel to stave off its decline, the world, particularly the Global South, needs a decolonised Palestine to hasten US decline. Palestine, not just metaphorically but literally, stands in the way of US and Western imperialism’s onward march towards continued global supremacy.

    "title": "Pakistan blames India after seven soldiers killed in Balochistan blast",
    "article_text": "Seven Pakistani army soldiers have been killed when their vehicle was targeted by an improvised explosive device in the southwestern province of Balochistan, Pakistan’s military says, blaming India for the attack amid rising tensions. Pakistan’s military said members of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) armed group targeted the vehicle carrying the soldiers in the province bordering Iran and Afghanistan on Tuesday. It described the group as an “Indian proxy”, but it did not provide any evidence to support its claim. There was no immediate comment from New Delhi or the BLA. An unnamed senior local government official told the AFP news agency the vehicle that was hit was part of a convoy on its way to a security operation. He said five people were wounded and taken by helicopter to a military hospital in the provincial capital, Quetta. More than 200 people, mostly members of the security forces, have been killed in 2025 by armed groups in Balochistan and neighbouring Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, according to an AFP tally. At least 31 people, many of them soldiers, were killed in March when theBLA hijacked a traincarrying more than 400 passengers while travelling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar. The bombing of the military convoy was carried out amid heightened tensions between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India after a shooting attack inIndia-administered Kashmir’s Pahalgam region on April 22 that killed 25 Indian tourists and one Nepalese citizen. India blamed Pakistan for backing the “terrorist” group that carried out the attack, a charge Islamabad has denied. After the Pahalgam attack, India and Pakistan have taken a series of steps against each other with Pakistan warning that India may be preparing to launch military attacks. The two countries have suspended trade, shut down a land border crossing, closed off their airspace to one another, expelled citizens and diplomats, and India has suspended a keywater treaty. On Tuesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif along with the deputy prime minister, foreign and defence ministers, and the military chiefs visited the headquarters of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, the country’s top spy agency, to attend a security briefing. Pakistan has conductedtwo missile tests in three dayswhile India has announced plans for civil defence drills across several states on Wednesday that will include air raid sirens and evacuation plans. The two countries also aired their grievances during a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York on Monday. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has emphasised the need toavoid a military confrontationthat could “easily spin out of control”. “Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink,” he said on Monday.",

    "title": "Canada trade shifts away from US amid trade tensions",
    "article_text": "Canada’s trade with the United States has tumbled in March, but a surge in exports to other countries have helped make up the downward shift. Exports to the US dropped by 6.6 percent during the month while imports from the US fell by 2.9 percent amid growing public discontent towards Canada’s longstanding ally and top trading partner, according to data released by Statistics Canada on Tuesday. Total exports fell by 0.2 percent in March mainly on lower prices whereas imports tumbled by 1.5 percent. Canada’s tradedeficit shrank from 1 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.4bn) in February to 367 million Canadian dollars (US$506m) in March. Its trade surplus with the US fell to 6.1 billion Canadian dollars (US$8.4bn) . “This decline was almost entirely offset by a significant rise in exports to countries other than the United States,” the agency said, highlighting a 24.8 percent surge in overseas shipments. Canada increased exports of gold to the United Kingdom, crude oil to the Netherlands and various goods to Germany. Exports ofmotor vehicles and parts also increasedamid US tariffs targeting the auto sector. Exports of pharmaceuticals and uranium to the US as well as pork to Asian markets declined. Natural gas exports also fell. Steel exports dropped while aluminium exports rose for a fourth straight month. Imports of steel declined, but imports of aluminium grew as both products face 25 percent US tariffs. Analysts have warned that the full effects of the tariffs have yet to be seen. Canada should “brace for increasing headwinds to trade as the worst of the trade conflict is expected to take place over the coming quarters”, TD Economics analyst Marc Ercolao said in a research note. Carney and Trump meet The trade data was released the day Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC, to discuss strained trade and security ties. Carney won last week’s electionson a pledge to stand up to Trump and his America First agenda. He said the strained relationship between the two countries can never be the same again. The US imposed broad tariffs on Canadian goods at the beginning of March before announcing several reductions and exemptions even as tariffs on cars, aluminium, steel and potash stayed in place. Canada has hit back with countermeasures. “Canada and the United States are strongest when we work together – and that work starts now,” Carney said on the social media platform X as he arrived in Washington, DC, on Monday night.",

    "title": "India, UK agree ‘historic’ trade deal including tariff cuts",
    "article_text": "India and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that comes after three years of negotiations and that they say will boost their economies amid the fallout fromUS President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The British government said on Tuesday that the deal “is expected to increase bilateral trade by 25.5 billion pounds [$34bn], UK GDP by 4.8 billion pounds [$6.4bn] and wages by 2.2 billion pounds [$2.9bn] each year in the long run”. “Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 percent of tariff lines, with 85 percent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.” The British alcohol and car industries are some of the main beneficiaries, with tariffs on whisky and gin getting halved to 75 percent before reducing to 40 percent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 percent to 10 percent under a quota. Tariffs will also be reduced on British exports including cosmetics, medical devices, aerospace parts, lamb, salmon, chocolate, and biscuits. India’s Trade Ministry said 99 percent ofIndian exportswould face no import duty under the deal. “This brings us closer to our goal of becoming a global economic powerhouse. It protects our core interests while opening doors to India’s greater participation in global value chains,” Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said. The deal introduces a “Double Contribution Convention” that exempts Indian workers in the UK from national insurance payments for up to three years, and vice versa. Advanced negotiations on a separate bilateral investment treaty and further discussions on labour and environmental standards are ongoing as well. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Keir Starmer spoke on the phone on Tuesday to mark the agreement, and Modi invited Starmer to visit the country. “These landmark agreements will further deepen our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and catalyse trade, investment, growth, job creation, and innovation in both our economies,” Modi said in a post on X. “Strengthening our alliances and reducing trade barriers with economies around the world is part of our Plan for Change to deliver a stronger and more secure economy here at home,” said Starmer, hailing what the government says is theUK’s largest trade agreement since leaving the European Union in 2020. The two leaders are expected to meet in the coming months to sign and finalise the deal. India also sought to receive an exemption from the UK’s forthcoming carbon tax – a climate policy tool set to be implemented from 2027 – but officials did not elaborate on the details in their statements on Tuesday. The deal comes as countries around the world are pondering new strategies and negotiating trade deals to make up for thecosts of tariffs imposed by the Trump administrationin the United States.",

    "title": "Yemen’s Houthis vow retaliation after Israeli attacks on Sanaa",
    "article_text": "Yemen’s Houthi rebels have pledged to respond to the latest Israeli strikes that targeted parts of the capital Sanaa and the main international airport, saying the attacks “will not go unanswered”. Tuesday’s strikes killed at least three people and wounded 35 others, according to the Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV. In a statement, the Houthi political bureau denounced the attacks as “further evidence” of Israel’s “bankruptcy”. “Targeting Yemeni ports, Sanaa airport, cement factories, and power plants aims to impose a blockade on the Yemeni people,” the statement said. The Houthis added that Israeli and US attacks on Yemen “will not deter Yemen from continuing its support for Gaza”. The Israeli army said in a statement that it targeted Sanaa’s airport, “fully disabling” the civilian facility. Tuesday’s attacks that also targeted a concrete factory and several power stations in and around the rebel-held capital came in response toSunday’s ballistic missile strikenear Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport, the Israeli military statement said. The army claimed that “the airport served as a central hub for the Houthi terrorist regime to transfer weapons and operatives”. “The operation was approved by the Commander of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff,” it said. The military added that it would “continue to act and strike with force” any group that poses a threat to Israel. Reporting from Sanaa, Al Jazeera’s Mohammed al-Attab said the impact of the attacks on infrastructure remains unclear. Sultan Barakat, a professor in public policy at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, says Sanaa International Airport is “not a big strategic target” and that Israeli claims it is being used to receive supplies from Iran are “simply not true”. “I think it’s pure vandalism, to be honest. The airport in Sanaa is not a normal airport. It’s under a huge restriction from the United Nations, from the Saudis, from the coalition – it’s under sanctions,” Barakat told Al Jazeera. He added that attacking the airport will only hinder the operations of the United Nations and humanitarian agencies in one of the poorest countries in the world. Footage of the aftermath of the airport attack, verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking unit, shows large clouds of dark smoke rising into the air over the capital. Earlier, the Houthi-affiliated Al Masirah TV confirmed that among the sites targeted is a cement factory to the north of the capital and a power station in the Bani al-Harith area. The attacks come less than 24 hours after Israelbombedthe country’s key Hodeidah port, killing at least one person and wounding 35 others. The Houthi media office said at least six strikes hit the crucial Hodeidah port. Others hit a cement factory in the district of Bajil, 55km (34 miles) northeast of Hodeidah, the group added. The Israeli military said the strikes sought to undercut the Houthi military industry, claiming the factory is an “economic resource” for the Houthis and “used to build tunnels and military infrastructure”. Since November 2023, the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks targeting vessels they said are linked to Israel in the Red Sea. The group says that it acts in support of the Palestinians in Gaza and that its attacks will stop only when there is a permanent ceasefire in the enclave. Although the Houthis paused attacks during a fragile ceasefire in Gaza this year, they resumed their operations after Israel cut off humanitarian aid to Gaza and resumed its offensive in March. The United States military under US President Donald Trump has launched an intensified campaign of air strikes on war-torn Yemen since March 15. Israel has repeatedly struck Yemen, killing dozens of people, including women and children.",

    "title": "‘No safety guarantee’: Could Ukrainian drones target Putin’s Victory Day?",
    "article_text": "Waves ofUkrainian droneshave hit Moscow in recent days as the Russian capital prepares for the country’s most important national holiday,Victory Day, this week. Russia celebrates May 9 as Victory Day to mark the defeat of Nazi forces in World War II. The day involves a major military parade, with leaders of Russia’s allies often in attendance. But this year, the run-up to the day has been clouded by a warning from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has said Kyiv cannot guarantee the safety of the foreign leaders attending the parade in Moscow. Here is more about Ukraine’s attacks, Victory Day and why it is significant. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Russia’s air defence systems shot down 19 drones flying towards Moscow from different directions. Drones were shot down for the second night in a row and Sobyanin wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app that there were no reports of injuries or damage, but the city’s airports were closed out of safety concerns. Russian officials also reported that 17 drones were intercepted over the Bryansk region and five more were intercepted over Kaluga. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week called for a72-hour ceasefireto mark the occasion from May 8 to May 10. Meanwhile, local leaders of multiple Ukrainian cities also reported on Tuesday that Russia carried out drone attacks on civilian targets. Zelenskyy has rebuffed the proposal. “This is more of a theatrical performance on his part. Because in two or three days, it is impossible to develop a plan for the next steps to end the war,” the Ukrainian presidenttolda small group of journalists on May 2. Ukraine, instead, wants a 30-day truce, eventually leading to a permanent ceasefire and ending the war that Russia imposed on its smaller neighbour with a full-scale invasion in February 2022. “The Russians are asking for a ceasefire on May 9 and are themselves firing at Ukraine every day. This is cynicism of the highest order,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Sunday. Marina Miron, a postdoctoral researcher at the defence studies department at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine’s drone attacks are not surprising. “Ukraine doesn’t really have any other plan of action because the situation on the battlefield is not favouring Ukraine,” Miron said, explaining that it is uncertain whether Ukraine will continue to receive support from the United States. While the US has been Ukraine’s largest ally through this war, President Donald Trump and his allies in Washington have repeatedly called for a rethink on the military aid Washington sends Kyiv. In March, Trumpannounced a pauseon military aid to Ukraine. Miron added that Europe is unable to support Kyiv “at least to the extent that Ukraine would need to be supported”. Ukraine is also experiencing manpower shortages on the battlefield as its soldiersdesert the army. The drone attacks allow Ukraine to show that it still has the will to fight, Miron said. “In the grand scheme, it’s not going to make any major strategic changes.” Victory Day is commemorated in Russia and many other former Soviet countries on May 9. The day marks the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War II, also called the Great Patriotic War in Russia. On the day, a largemilitary paradepasses Moscow’s Red Square. The war formally began in 1939 when Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland, having cut a secret deal with the Soviet Union that the two countries would divide the Soviet Union’s western neighbour. Britain, in a bilateral defence treaty with Poland, declared war against Germany. However, in 1941, the German army began Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union faced millions of casualties, losing the highest number of lives in World War II globally. During the war, the number of civilian and military deaths in the Soviet Union reached 24 million, including an estimated 8.7 million military personnel. But the Soviet Union also led the pushback against Nazi Germany, marching on Berlin in May 1945 to mark the end of the war in Europe. Japan surrendered only in August after the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The US and its European allies celebrate Victory in Europe Day on May 8. In 2023, Zelenskyy signed a law, moving Ukraine’s remembrance of the World War II victory to May 8. Victory Day is significant for Putin because, ever since the war with Ukraine started, Putin has drawn parallels between the ongoing war and World War II. During his 2022 Victory Day speech, months after the war begun, Putin said Russian troops fighting in Ukraine were “fighting for the motherland, so that no one will forget the lessons of World War II and there will be no place in the world for hangmen, executioners and the Nazis”. Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, Vietnamese President To Lam, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico are expected to attend the Victory Day parade. The attendance of these world leaders is also important for Putin as a demonstration of the West’s failure to isolate him despite a barrage ofsanctionsthe US and its allies have imposed on Russia during the war with Ukraine. “Our position is very simple for all countries travelling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,” Zelenskyy told reporters, Ukrainian news agency Interfax reported on May 3. “They provide you with security; therefore, we won’t give you any guarantees. Because we don’t know what Russia will do these days,” said Zelenskyy, claiming that Russia could also order provocations such as “arson, bombings and so on, only to blame us”. On the same day, Russia hit back by warning Ukraine against violence on May 9. Former president and deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, called on Zelenskyy to stop “verbal provocations” and said, “In the case of a real provocation on Victory Day, no one guarantees that May 10 will come in Kyiv.” Despite the presence of leaders like Xi and Lula, that could not be ruled out, experts said. “As far as May 9th, the V-Day in Russia, is concerned, it’s very possible that Ukrainian military intelligence is going to do something,” researcher Miron said, adding that it is unclear what the scale or location of this action by Ukraine could be. “There is a pattern that things have usually happened around the May celebrations.” In early May 2023, Russia said its defence system had thwarted adrone attack on the Kremlincitadel near Putin’s residence. “We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the president’s life, carried out on the eve of Victory Day, the May 9 Parade, at which the presence of foreign guests is also planned,” the Kremlin had said in a statement, declaring it would retaliate. On May 8, 2023, Kyiv saidRussia launched dronesat Ukrainian targets, killing four people. It said its air defences downed Iranian-made kamikaze Shahed drones. Trump had declared he would negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine while on the presidential campaign trail. About a month after his inauguration, starting in February, the Trump administration held multiple meetings with Russian and Ukrainian representatives separately to try to broker a deal. Several meetings and exchanges later, all sides were able to get on the same page, announcing a30-day ceasefireon attacks on Russian and Ukrainian energy infrastructure on March 19, and aBlack Sea dealon March 25, halting the military use of commercial vessels and the use of force in the Black Sea. However, both sides have since then traded blame for violating the terms of those agreements.",

PSG and Arsenal continue their quest to win a maiden UEFA Champions League title when they clash in the second leg of their semifinal in Paris. PSG’s away victory over the Gunners in the opening leg at Emirates Stadium on April 29 has the Parisians firming up as the favourites to progress to the final. The Gunners face the daunting – but not impossible – task on Wednesday of needing to beat the French champions on the road if they want to reach the Champions League final for just the second time in their history. Here is all to know before the semifinal decider between two of Europe’s most talented football clubs: PSG took a big step towards reaching the final when Ousmane Dembele’s early goal sealeda 1-0 win at Arsenalin a tense first leg of the semifinal. Dembele fired home off the post in the fourth minute as PSG dominated the opening stages, and manager Luis Enrique’s side held firm to take a precious advantage back to the French capital. Neither side have won Europe’s premier football competition, but both have lost a final. PSG made their only final appearance in the 2019-2020 season, losing to German side Bayern Munich 1-0 at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal. Arsenal’s participation in a UEFA Champions League final was 19 long years ago for Gunners fans, and they lost to Barcelona 2-1 in the 2005-2006 season at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France. Star striker Dembele, who limped off with a minor hamstring strain after scoring the game winner against Arsenal in the first leg in London, has been passed fit to play in the return leg, Enrique said on Tuesday. Dembele, 27, is PSG’s top scorer this season with 33 goals in all competitions. PSG’s regular squad is otherwise injury-free with Desire Doue tipped to re-enter the attacking winger role at the expense of France international Bradley Barcola. Key midfielder Thomas Partey returns to the side after sitting out the first leg against PSG with a suspension, restoring manager Mikel Arteta’s preferred midfield trio with Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. Jurrien Timber is questionable for this match as he continues to battle back to full fitness after a knee injury. But in some good news for the club, the Dutch defender was seen training with the Gunners squad on Tuesday shortly before they departed for France. Sidelined stars Kai Havertz, Riccardo Calafiori and Jorginho are all likely to play before the end of the Premier League season, but none of them is in contention for Champions League selection unless Arsenal make it to the final at the end of May. Gabriel, Gabriel Jesus and Takehiro Tomiyasu are all out until next season. Arsenal possible XI:Raya; Timber, Saliba, Kiwior, Lewis-Skelly; Partey, Rice, Odegaard; Saka, Merino, Martinelli PSG possible XI:Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Pacho, Nuno Mendes; Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz, Joao Neves; Kvaratskhelia, Dembele, Doue The teams have played on six prior occasions across all competitions: Arsenal’s Arteta:“If you want to be in the Champions League final, you have to do something special. We’re going to have to do something special in Paris to be there.” PSG’s Enrique:“We’re bound to suffer because our opponents don’t have a favourable result. We need to match our performance as closely as possible in the first leg to win the return leg and stay true to our ideas.” The winner of this semifinal heads to Germany on May 31 for the Champions League final. European football’s largest annual showpiece will be played at the 75,000-capacity Allianz Arena in Munich.",

    "title": "Germany’s Merz elected chancellor in second round of voting",
    "article_text": "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has been elected Germany’s chancellor in a second round of parliamentary voting after his new alliance with the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) was dealt a surprise defeat in the first attempt. Merz’sfailure to win parliamentary backing in the first roundof voting was a first for post-war Germany. Merz received 325 votes in the second round of voting on Tuesday. He needed a majority of 316 out of 630 votes in a secret ballot, but only received 310 votes in the first round, well short of the 328 seats held by his coalition. After the vote, the 69-year-old headed to the nearby Bellevue Palace to be formally nominated by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Later, Merz will return to the historic Reichstag building in the heart of Berlin to take the oath of office to become Germany’s 10th chancellor since the end of World War II. The Merz-led conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) had topped in the national elections in February with 28.5 percent of the vote, but it still required at least one coalition partner to form a majority government. On Monday, the CDU/CSU reached an agreement with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) , which secured 16.4 percent in the elections after the collapse of Olaf Scholz’s government last year. Their agreement has mapped out plans to revive growth, such as reducing corporate taxes and lowering energy prices. It is also promising strong support for Ukraine as it battles to repel Russia’s invasion, and higher military spending. The new chancellor’s in-tray would also include the confrontational trade policy of US President Donald Trump and domestic issues such as the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane, reporting from Berlin, said Merz’s failure to win in the first round of voting suggests that “all is not well in those three … now governing parties”. “He [Merz] starts in this new position, knowing that members of his own coalition voted against him,” he said. Experts say Merz’s failure to win backing for his chancellorship at the first attempt is an embarrassment for a figure who has promised to restore German leadership on the world stage. “The whole of Europe looked to Berlin today in the hope that Germany would reassert itself as an anchor of stability and a pro-European powerhouse,” said Jana Puglierin, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. “That hope has been dashed. With consequences way beyond our borders.” Party insiders said on Monday that Merz would swiftly secure a majority despite grumbling in both coalition parties about cabinet nominations, policy compromises and a huge borrowing package pushed through the old parliament in its final days. “This shows that the coalition is not united, which could weaken his ability to pursue policies,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London. The abrasive and erratic style of Merz, who has never held government office, has also failed to convince some that he is chancellor material. “The relationship between the parties will be severely damaged because of this and [it will] exacerbate the conflicts that are already bubbling beneath the surface,” said Philipp Koeker, a political scientist at the University of Hanover.",

    "title": "What are the Piprahwa gems, and why is India trying to stop their auction?",
    "article_text": "The Indian government has condemned an auction of ancient Indian gems and issued a legal notice to stop the “unethical” sale of the relics, which it said should be treated as the sacred body of the Buddha. New Delhi’s Ministry of Culture said the auction of the Piprahwa gems in Hong Kong, scheduled for Wednesday, “violates Indian and international laws as well as United Nations conventions” and demanded their repatriation to India “for preservation and religious veneration”. The legal writ was served to the Sotheby’s auction house and Chris Peppe, one of three heirs of William Claxton Peppe, a British colonial landowner who in 1898 excavated the gems on his northern Indian estate and kept them as family heirlooms. A letter posted on the Ministry of Culture’s Instagram account said Peppe, a Los Angeles-based TV director, lacked the authority to sell the relics. Sotheby’s, by holding the auction, was “participating in continued colonial exploitation”, it added. The ministry does not believe the relics should go under the hammer, saying the gems “constitute inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community”. The Piprahwa gems date back to the Mauryan Empire, circa 240 to 200 BC. They have been described by Sotheby’s as “one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era” and “of unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance”. The precious stones consist of thousands of pearls, rubies, topazes, sapphires and patterned gold worked into jewels and maintained in their natural forms. They were originally buried in a dome-shaped funeral monument called a stupa in Piprahwa in modern-day Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state. They are believed to be mixed with some of the cremated remains of the Buddha, who died about 480 BC. The British crown claimed William Peppe’s find under the 1878 Indian Treasure Trove Act, and the bones and ash were given to the Buddhist monarch King Chulalongkorn of Siam in present-day Thailand. Most of the 1,800 gems went to what is now the Indian Museum in Kolkata. But Peppe was permitted to retain about a fifth of them, some of which were described as “duplicates” by British colonial administrators at the time. The gems are expected to sell for 100 million Hong Kong dollars (US$13m) at Sotheby’s in Hong Kong on Wednesday. But the sale has raised eyebrows. Commentators argued that the Piprahwa gems are the heritage of both the Buddha’s descendants and of Buddhists worldwide. “Are the relics of the Buddha a commodity that can be treated like a work of art to be sold on the market?” Naman Ahuja, a Delhi-based art historian, told the BBC. “And since they aren’t, how is the seller ethically authorised to auction them? “Since the seller is termed the ‘custodian’, I would like to ask – custodian on whose behalf? Does custodianship permit them now to sell these relics?” he asked. For its part, India’s government has called on Sotheby’s and Chris Peppe to halt the sale of the gems, issue a public apology to Buddhists worldwide and to provide a full disclosure of the provenance of the relics. Failure to comply, according to the letter on the Ministry of Culture’s Instagram page, would result in legal proceedings in Indian and Hong Kong courts and through international bodies “for violations of cultural heritage laws”. The ministry added that it would launch a public campaign highlighting Sotheby’s role “in perpetuating colonial injustice and becoming a party to [the] unethical sale of religious relics”. It said the sellers “had no right to alienate or misappropriate the asset, … an extraordinary heritage of humanity where custodianship would include not just safe upkeep but also an unflinching sentiment of veneration towards these relics”. The letter also noted that “the relics of the Buddha cannot be treated as ‘specimens’ but as the sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body of the Buddha” and the proposed auction “offends the sentiments of over 500 million Buddhists worldwide”. Earlier this year, Chris Peppe told the BBC that his family explored donating the ancient gems. However, he said an auction seemed the “fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists”. He also wrote a post on Sotheby’s website in February in which he said: “I wanted the power of these gems to reach everyone, Buddhist or not.” After this week’s private sale, he said, “I hope that many people will be able to see the gems and connect with the Buddhists who gave them over two thousand years ago, with our shared human experience of wonder and awe and with the Buddha and his teachings.” Museums in the West have rarely been forced by legal rulings to give up artefacts taken from the Global South during colonial rule. However, some have handed stolen objects back to their countries of origin under public pressure In 2022, for instance, six artefacts looted by British soldiers 125 years ago from Benin City in what is now Nigeria were repatriated from the Horniman Museum in South London to Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments. That same year, Germany handed over two Benin Bronzes and more than 1,000 other items from its museums to Nigeria. “It was wrong to take the bronzes, and it was wrong to keep them,” said Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister. But instances of successful repatriations are far outnumbered by private auctions of stolen artefacts. In 2020, for instance, Christie’s went ahead with the sale ofIgbo statuesthat Nigerian museum officials said were stolen during the country’s civil war in the 1960s. Another high-profile case was the sale of a 3,000-year-old quartzite head of the Egyptian “boy king” Tutankhamun, auctioned off in theUnited Kingdomdespite an outcry inEgypt, which claimed the piece was likely removed from the country illegally. Countless antiquities are sold off every year by exclusive auction houses, denying many developing countries their historical patronage.",

    "title": "Seeking funds to rebuild, Lebanon government works to regain donor trust",
    "article_text": "Beirut, Lebanon– More than five years into an economic crisis that sent inflation spiralling andsaw the Lebanese lira plummet, Lebanon’s government is facing its biggest infrastructure project in years: Post-war reconstruction. After 14 months of war with Israel, Lebanon needs $11bn to rebuild, according to World Bank estimates. But, experts say, donors do not trust the Lebanese political class, which has a track record of funnelling construction contracting money to politically connected businessmen. In addition to more than4,000 deaths, the war took a vast material toll on the country already reeling from a multi-year economic crisis. About 10 percent of the homes in Lebanon – some 163,000 units – were damaged or destroyed, to say nothing of the more than $1bn in infrastructure damage. Most observers, and the new government formed in February, say Lebanon will again need foreign aid, as it did after a previous war with Israel in 2006. But that aid has been slower to arrive than in 2006, with donor attention divided between Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza, and major donors like the United States pushing for theHezbollah group’s disarmamentas a precondition. Hezbollah, until recently the most powerful political and military force in the country, suffered severe blows during the war and has seen its power curtailed, although many Lebanese continue to support it. The country’s south, east, and Beirut’s southern suburbs bore the brunt of Israel’s offensive. Together, they are home to most of Hezbollah’s constituents, so restoring their homes and livelihoods is a priority for the party. That translates into leverage for foreign donor states. Politically connected companies overcharged the state’s main infrastructure buyer, the Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), by 35 percent between 2008 and 2018, a 2022 study by local think tank The Policy Initiative found. And the primary contracting regulation was so riddled with exceptions that as little as 5 percent of tenders were under the Central Tenders Board’s oversight. All that came to a head in 2020, when a huge blast in Beirut’s port tore through much of the capital and donors decided they wanted nothing to do with the state, according to Khalil Gebara, economist and former World Bank consultant who previously advised the Lebanese government. “Donors stopped transferring money to national authorities or to the treasury,” he said, because they had “a total lack of trust in national mechanisms”. Instead, donors controlled spending directly or via a World Bank-managed trust fund, or worked through NGOs, Gebara added. That year, the state, which was stalling on implementing International Monetary Fund conditions in exchange for a partial bailout, spent just $38m on its physical investments, down from more than $1.1bn in 2018, the year before the economic collapse, according to Ministry of Finance data. A year later, Lebanon passed what many considered a landmark reform to state contracting, one of the few reform laws passed in recent years. It dragged virtually the entire public sector into one unified framework, abolished a classification system that had frozen out contractors without political connections, and created a new regulator – the Public Procurement Authority (PPA). As crisis-ridden state agencies were corralled into the new system, public investment continued to fall, hitting below $10m in 2022. “Procurement is going to be a big thing … and absolutely the test for the procurement system and for the regulatory authority,” said Lamia Moubayed, head of an in-house research and training institute at Lebanon’s Finance Ministry. Rana Rizkallah, a procurement expert at the same institute, says the law is solid, but it’s up to the government to implement what it promised, adding that a crucial part of that is staffing the regulator. The PPA is supposed to be a board of five members backed by a team of 83 staffers but, three years after the law went into effect in 2022, it has a single member and five employees overseeing 1,400 purchasing bodies. A four-member complaints board that the law established also has yet to be formed, so complaints still go to Lebanon’s slow, overburdened courts. Jean Ellieh, the regulator’s president and sole member, says the state doesn’t have the “logistical capacity” to recruit dozens of regulators in one fell swoop, but he’s put in a request for new hires. “We will work with determination and resolve, regardless of our capabilities,” Ellieh told Al Jazeera. “We will not give anyone an excuse to evade the application of the law.” He added that donors have expressed “satisfaction” with the PPA’s abilities. After several lean years in which the state had to keep spending to a bare minimum, the contracting scene remains dominated by the large companies that built up enough resources from earlier rounds of investment to stay afloat. Wassim Maktabi, economist and co-author of the 2022 report on cartel behaviour in construction contracting, said it would be a tall order to ensure that reconstruction isn’t another bonanza for the well-connected. “Rest assured that these political elites will not let this slip,” he said. In addition, years of high-value contracts mean politically connected firms have accumulated the capital to be, in most respects, bigger and more experienced than competitors. “Even if political influence was not a factor and you awarded these contracts purely based on merit,” he said, these firms “would still get a large piece of the pie”. Regardless, Maktabi says, reconstruction is simply too important to stall in pursuit of perfection. Al Jazeera has identified 152 reconstruction contracts totalling more than $30m that are already under way, via the PPA’s onlineportal. Of the top four contract winners in dollar terms, two have political connections mentioned in media reports. The top four companies, Beta Engineering and Contracting, Elie Naim Maalouf Company, Al Bonyan Engineering and Contracting, and Yamen General Trading and Contracting, have won contracts totalling $10.6m, $4.7m, $1.8m, and $1.4m, respectively – 60 percent of the total amount awarded in the PPA contracts examined. The new government isnegotiatingwith the World Bank on a $980m plan, known as LEAP, to kick-start reconstruction and be funded by a World Bank loan and foreign assistance. But LEAP would only take care of a fraction of the total reconstruction costs. The government also started hiring for a long-stalled electricity regulatory board and new faces on the CDR board. Moubayed says refreshing the CDR board is a World Bank requirement to approve LEAP, which would be a vital win for a government pushing to gain reformist credibility. The World Bank declined to comment on whether refreshing the CDR board is a requirement. It’s still unclear how the programme might be structured, but the government has endorsed the creation of a trust fund for post-war reconstruction, “characterised by transparency”. But, Beirut residents were unhappy with a similar model used in 2020 for the Port blast reconstruction, architect and urbanist Abir Saksouk of Public Works Studio says. A lack of equity between residents, based on which organisation took over repairing each area, further eroded a sense of shared citizenship, she says, calling it an experience that shouldn’t be repeated. She is one of many calling for an inclusive reconstruction process led by all stakeholders, including people who have suffered damages, and with the involvement of relevant ministries, because they are a vital part of the process. “We need a reconstruction framework where state institutions are present… But we also need other representation,” she said.",

    "title": "Ugandan activist reportedly held by military chief shows signs of torture",
    "article_text": "An opposition activist whom Uganda’s military chief, Muhoozi Kainerugaba,claimedto have held captive in his basement has appeared in court “visibly weak” and showing signs of torture, according to the justice minister. Eddie Mutwe, who acts as the chief bodyguard for Uganda’s leading opposition figure,Bobi Wine,went missing on April 27 after being grabbed near the capital, Kampala, by armed men, according to Wine’s National Unity Platform (NUP) party. Chief of Defence Forces Kainerugaba, longtime PresidentYoweri Museveni’seldest child, said last week that he had detained Mutwe, writing on X that he had captured him “like a grasshopper” and was “using him as a punching bag”. Kainerugaba also alluded to Mutwe being tortured, saying he had beaten him and shaved his head. “If they keep on provoking us, we shall discipline them even more,” he said of the opposition. Mutwe was presented in court on Monday and remanded into custody on robbery charges, his lawyer said. In a statement released late on Monday, Justice Minister Norbert Mao said Mutwe appeared in court “in a visibly weak condition and showing signs of having been tortured”. “Bringing illegally detained, brutalised and tortured suspects before the courts of law is an abuse of judicial processes,” said Mao, the leader of an opposition party who was appointed justice minister in 2022. Mao did not say who was responsible for Mutwe’s condition but called on the courts to deal swiftly with the opposition figure’s case. Mutwe’s lawyer, Magellan Kazibwe, told reporters outside court on Monday that his client had been tortured daily and electrocuted while being detained. He is in my basement. Learning Runyankore. You are next!https://t.co/8pMgdGCru2 — Muhoozi Kainerugaba (@mkainerugaba)May 1, 2025 The court case comes amid an escalating crackdown on the Ugandan opposition as Wine has been preparing to launch a “protest vote” campaign in advance of a general election in January. On Friday, Wine – aformer singerwhose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi and who has become Museveni’s leading opponent – said on X that security forces had “just raided and cordoned off our headquarters”. He also condemned the abduction of Mutwe, telling the AFP news agency that it was “a reminder to the world as to how law and order has broken down in Uganda”. Kainerugaba, who is widely viewed as being groomed to succeed his 80-year-old father, frequently makes incendiary comments on social media and has written on X that he wanted to behead Wine. The Ugandan government has faced international condemnation over the abduction of opposition figures, including veteran leader Kizza Besigye, who wasseized in Kenya last yearand forcibly returned to face treason charges. Museveni, who has ruled since 1986 and plans to seek re-election in January, has denied allegations of human rights abuses. But the Uganda Law Society said the abduction of Mutwe was not an isolated incident. Instead, it is “part of a systematic campaign to silence dissent and crush the aspirations of young people yearning for freedom”, the group said in a statement. The Uganda Human Rights Commission, which is tasked with investigating abuses and monitoring the government’s human rights record, said it issued an order on Friday directing the authorities to release Mutwe.",

    "article_text": "Ahem, $TRUMP.﻿ Ahem, $TRUMP.﻿ byTina Nguyen After abruptly pulling their support from what would have been the Senate’s first stablecoin regulatory bill, Senate Democrats announced Tuesday that they would introduce a new bill that would prevent federal officials and their families from issuing digital assets – a bill directed at Donald Trump and his family’s current stablecoin and meme coin holdings. “Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), who introduced the bill to the Senate floor,in a press release. “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let’s end this corruption immediately.” The End Crypto Corruption Act comes in response to concerns inside the Democratic party that the GENIUS Act, which previously had strong bipartisan support, was inadequate at preventing corruption. Though the Senate Banking Committee passed the bill in March with a bipartisan vote, two subsequent developmentsreportedly pushed the Democrats to change course. First,aNew York Timesreportlast week revealed that the Trump family could potentially earn $2 billion from a stablecoin transaction with a Dubai-based investment firm under the current regulatory framework. Second,Trump announced a contestin April wherein the top holders of his meme coin would win a private dinner with the president, and the top 25 holders would win an additional guided tour of the White House. According to a report from Chainalysis, the meme coin’s issuers, Official Trump, have earned $320 million from trading fees from the contest alone. Though they admitted that there’s not much they can do to stop the president right now (see: no laws), Senate Republicans alsoexpressed skepticism over the $TRUMP contest to NBC, and at least one staunch Trump ally, Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, offered to partner with the Democrats on efforts to regulate lawmakers holding digital assets. “Even what may appear to be ‘cringey’ with regard to meme coins, it’s legal, and what we need to do is have a regulatory framework that makes this more clear, so we don’t have this Wild West scenario,” she told NBC.

The update rolled out between April 16th and 17th to address a risky situation that could arise when the vehicle operating at over 40mph closed in on another vehicle that approaches its lane from a perpendicular driveway before stopping. In a press release on Tuesday, Zoox said there was only minor damage to both vehicles and no injuries were reported. Zoox shared how the incident played out in the voluntarysafety recall reportit sent to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on May 1st: The incident involved a passenger car quickly approaching the lane where our purpose-built robotaxi was traveling. Anticipating that the passenger car would proceed forward, the Zoox robotaxi slowed down and steered to the right. Instead, the car came to a stop, fully yielding to the Zoox robotaxi and remaining in the shoulder lane. The Zoox robotaxi braked hard, but contact was unavoidable. The report states that, prior to the update, the company says, “In situations where Zoox vehicles are operating at speeds greater than 40mph, and a vehicle incrementally encroaches from a perpendicular driveway approaching the Zoox vehicle’s lane, the Zoox vehicle may make an inaccurately confident prediction that the vehicle is going to proceed into the Zoox vehicle’s lane.” Reacting based on that inaccurate projection could cause a crash, as happened here. AMarch recall noticefrom Zoox also notes that after two incidents where its Toyota Highlander-based robotaxis performed sudden hard braking,causing approaching motorcyclists to rear-end them, it rolled out a software update to address the problem last November.

From simple fitness bands and rugged sports watches to rings, these are the best trackers you can get. byVictoria Song If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else. Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them. Compared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there area few extra considerationsyou’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2025 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle. The spiffy Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for its budget-friendly price. It offers a wide array of health tracking features, built-in GPS, and up to 10 days of battery life. The Fenix 7S Pro remains a great intro to Garmin’s platform. It features an updated optical heart rate sensor, excellent battery life, solar charging, and built-in multiband GPS. The Pixel Watch 3 adds a host of new fitness features, a brighter display, and several nifty Google integrations — including the ability to unlock your phone. It’s also available in a 45mm size. The latest Apple Watch features a larger, wide-angle OLED display and a thinner design than prior models, yet it charges faster and offers the same fitness and wellness features. Fitness trackers are meant to help you keep track of your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life. Who is this fitness tracker for? The ideal fitness tracker for hardcore athletes will look different than the best one for casual users looking to get a few more steps in. A fitness tracker should be able to go at least two to three days between charges. If it’s a flagship smartwatch, it should at least offer quick charging. Is it a band or a smartwatch? Is it comfortable to wear 24/7? What metrics does this device track? We prioritize active minutes over steps and calorie burn, but health metrics like resting heart rate, VO2 Max, and sleep quality are plusses. Accuracy is nice, but it’s more important for measuring progress that your device delivers consistent results for heart rate, distance tracking, and steps. Certain trackers are limited to specific phone ecosystems — others will work regardless of what your phone is.

At $99.99 for the standard version, and $129.99 for the premium version, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. The hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. As far as health features go, you get all the basics like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included. I don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. 8 Verge Score Bright displayLong battery lifeTonsof training and health featuresNo subscriptions Cluttered appProprietary USB-A charger Sizes:40mm w/ 20mm straps /Weight:38g /Battery life:Up to 11 days /Display type:OLED touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:4GB (for Music Edition) The $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their agingFitbit Versa 2, 3, or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life. Garmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.) If you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch. What I like most about this watch, however, is that it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in,freetraining program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. None of these existing data features are locked behind a paywall; however,Garmin recently introduced a premium tierthat provides personalized AI-powered insights and additional features for $6.99 a month (or $69.99 a year). One note: there is aVenu 3, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’sForerunner 165— it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its userswas an eight-year-old Garmin! 8 Verge Score Hands-free flashlightLong battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate monitor The improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7 Sizes:7S Pro: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps /Weight:7S Pro: 63g (Solar), 58g or 65g (Sapphire Solar, titanium or stainless steel); 7: 79g (Solar), 73g (Sapphire Solar); 7X: 96g (Solar), 89g (Sapphire Solar) /Battery life:7S: up to 11 days, 14 w/ Solar; 7: up to 18 days, 22 days w/ solar; 7X: up to 28 days, 37 w/ solar /Display type:MIP touchscreen /GPS:All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:10ATM /Music storage:Up to 32GB Garmin’sflagship Fenix 7 seriesis no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting. Garmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches. I appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean. Although the screen is brighter,MIP displaysstill aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on theGarmin Epix 2and the Epix Pro are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price. Personally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price. (You can also check out ourGarmin buying guideif you’d like even more alternatives.) Technically, there’s anew Fenix 8 serieson the block. That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. TheFenix 8adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350. That’s tough to swallow, especially since retailers may offer discounts on older models to get rid of existing inventory. 9 Verge Score More sizesSlimmer designExpanded auto workout detectionRedesigned appBetter battery life Subscription required to get all featuresI still wish this had a charging case Sizes:12 proprietary sizes, 4–15, sizing kit needed /Weight:4–6g (depends on size) /Battery life:Up to seven days /Display type:None /GPS:None /Connectivity:Bluetooth /Water resistance:Up to 328 feet /Music storage:None The vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349Oura Ringisn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone. The new Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a new all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has a new sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of the new software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now. While smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, blood oxygen levels, chronotypes to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called Circles, improved stress tracking, and cardiovascular age and capacity metrics. More recently, it’s added an AI chatbot, meal logging, and glucose tracking, though you’ll have to purchasea $99 Dexcom Stelo CGMto take advantage of the latter. It’s rolled out a more accuratesleep stages algorithmas well, and the app has been entirely revamped to better organize the new features and metrics. The Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned — but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data. If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99Galaxy Ring. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend theUltrahuman Ring Airfor folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription. You can read my experiences witha bunch of other smart rings, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished with the best overall experience. 7 Verge Score Super affordableGood feature set for the priceOLED display looks niceComfortable and lightweightLong battery life Hard to put on one-handedSome app quirksGPS can be wonky Size:42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps /Weight:28g /Battery life:Up to 18 days /Display type:OLED /GPS:Tethered /Connectivity:Bluetooth /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:None It’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank. No one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well. You also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps. Amazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95Fitbit Charge 6is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment. 7 Verge Score Long battery lifeAlso gets you lots of complimentsComfortable to wearGreat priceAdds period tracking Has fewer sensors than the ScanWatch 2Again, the OLED display is tiny Sizes:37mm with 18mm straps /Weight:45g /Battery life:Up to 39 days /Display type:OLED display /GPS:Tethered GPS /Connectivity:Bluetooth /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:N/A The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life. As its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $349.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial. Another option I like is the $179.99Garmin Vivomove Sport, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch. 8 Verge Score Bigger display but not bulkyWide-angle OLED is neatMuch faster chargingSleep apnea detection has potential Lack of blood oxygen (in US) may impact your upgrade plansAnother year of minor updates Sizes:42mm, 46mm /Weight:29.3g (42mm), 35.3g (46mm) /Battery life:Up to 18 hours /Display type:Always-on LTPO OLED /GPS:Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou /Connectivity:LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:Up to 50 meters /Music storage:32GB If you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade. With watchOS 11, there’s a new suite of training features. There’sTraining Load, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a new Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you canfinally pause your ringsfor rest days. The software update also brings some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can now surface the Shazaam widget. It also now supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also now have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. Of course, we also have to addressthe Apple Watch ban. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the new sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however. If you’re a first-time buyer, you can also opt for the second-genApple Watch SE. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on theApple Watch Ultra 2. It’s more expensive at $799, but it does have the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. There’s alsoa fetching new black color. 7 Verge Score Longer battery life than the regular Galaxy WatchDouble pinch is usefulAdds dual-frequency GPS and sleep apnea detectionCheaper than the Apple Watch Ultra Where is Samsung in this?The squircle chonk doesn’t fit small wristsSleep apnea feature is limited to Galaxy phonesAGEs metric is baffling Sizes:47mm /Weight:60.5g /Battery life:Up to 100 hours /Display type:Always-on OLED /GPS:Built-in GPS /Connectivity:LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:10ATM, IP68 /Music storage:32GB Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy. While I prefer theGalaxy Watch 7myself, I can’t say it’s the best for fitness tracking. There was too much of a gap between it and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. But what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. It’s simply night and day, and the Galaxy Watch 7 really struggled in this arena. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.) The caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button, and the screen doesn’t get quite as bright. With both watches, you get a faster processor, a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The newer hardware makes for a more futureproof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users. 8 Verge Score Upgraded chip and sensorAfter the Ultra, I appreciate the design more Battery life is still middlingThe new AI health updates are meh But if the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find theGalaxy Watch 6 series, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 7 may have newer hardware, but as far as actual use goes, it’s not a massive update over the Watch 6. And if you’re into a physical rotating bezel, just go ahead and snag a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. 8 Verge Score We finally get a bigger size!Moderate battery improvementsLots of neat Google integrationsGood running updatesReadiness and Cardio Load scores not locked behind paywall It’s best with a Pixel phone Sizes:41mm, 45mm /Weight:31g /Battery life:Up to 24 hours /Display type:Always-on OLED /GPS:Built-in GPS /Connectivity:LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /Water resistance:5ATM /Music storage:32GB With the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up. There are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability. Battery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original. Software is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. If you’re locatedin the USor Europe, you can also take advantage Google’s new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse. The Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone. That said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $299.99OnePlus Watch 2is a strong alternative. You’re giving up LTE, but it’s a handsome-looking watch with surprisingly long battery life and Google Assistant from the get-go. 7 Verge Score Tracking isn’t limited to the wristSo much recovery data!Comfortable for all-day wearCan wear the tracker in multiple ways Expensive monthly subscriptionChanging straps is tediousDoesn’t track much beyond recoveryNot great for non-cardio exercise Sizes:43mm by 28mm by 10mm /Weight:18g /Battery life:4–5 days /Display type:None /GPS:None /Connectivity:Bluetooth /Water resistance:Up to 10 meters /Music storage:None TheWhoop 4.0is not for the casual enthusiast. Not only does it come with an expensive monthly subscription, but the information it provides is only useful if you’re actively training for a cardio-intensive sport. If strength training is your main form of exercise, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Like the Oura Ring, this is a distraction-free tracker that specializes in sleep and recovery. The main difference is this has a more athletic bent. For instance, you’ll get way more insight into how much strain you’ve taken on in the past week. Whoop also providesa lot of novel ways to wear its tracker, including in underwear and arm/knee sleeves. This makes it an appealing option if you’re one of those unicorns who needs asecondarytracker to supplement another form of fitness tracking. Again, this is a tracker best appreciated by people who go hard and aren’t afraid to experiment. Plus, Whoop recentlylowered its subscription pricesin certain tiers, so while it’s still expensive, it’s notquiteas pricey as it used to be.

    "article_text": "﻿An article said a movie was in development, but the piece was pulled soon after it was published. ﻿An article said a movie was in development, but the piece was pulled soon after it was published. byJay Peters On Tuesday, a publication calledNexus Point Newspublished a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news: “EXCLUSIVE: Alex Garland Set To Direct ‘Elden Ring’ Film For A24.” The article claimed thatElden Ring“is expected to be Garland’s next film” and that shooting is expected to start in 2026. But don’t get your hopes up: soon after the article was published,Nexus Point Newspulled it, and the publication won’t say why. How this article made the rounds is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet. We first saw theNexus Point Newsarticle from a Wario64 post on X. Generally, Wario64 is a great account to follow to see breaking news in video games almost as soon as it happens. And the account is quite popular, with more than 1 million followers on X. But none of us atThe Vergehad ever heard ofNexus Point News, let alone recognized it as a place that reliably breaks entertainment news, so something didn’t seem right. (Another recentNexus Point News“exclusive” includes a potential cast member “being eyed”for one of the male leadsofStar Wars: Starfighter, but the article includes an update that says “a LucasFilm spokesperson has denied this reporting.”) So I messaged Wario64, asking why he reposted it. He said that the person who posted a thread on the gaming forum ResetEra claimed the site was reliable and that “I guess I’m sharing cause I too think it’s absurd lol.” That thread appears to bethis one, where the poster says, in a reply tosomebody asking“bro what the fuck is this source lmaooo,”that“Nexus point news is pretty reliable, they are breaking more and more news before the traditional trades.” Soon after, I refreshed theNexus Point Newsstory and saw that it had been taken down. I told Wario64 that we were looking into the story on our end and about its removal. Soon after, Wario64 postedabout the removaland deleted the original tweet. Then, I emailedNexus Point News’press line to see if somebody could say what was going on. Demet Koc, the publication’s editor-in-chief, replied two minutes later but declined to comment. A24’s Sophia Shin also declined to comment on the record. The possibility of anElden Ringadaptation seems likely. FromSoftware said in early 2022 that ithoped toexpand the franchise “beyond the realm of games.” George R.R. Martin, who providedthe “mythos”for the world ofElden Ring, hintedlast yearthat some kind of adaptation might be in the works. And FromSoftware is about to releaseElden Ring Nightreign, a multiplayer-focused spinoff, so announcing a film around now would make some sense. But for the moment, there’s nothing official about anElden Ringmovie. A ResetEra admin locked thethreadabout the article and another one. “For a site no one’s heard of, they sure have a lot of exclusives,”the admin said.

The proposal could endanger consumers’ search privacy and slow innovation, Google’s head of search testified. byLauren Feiner The government’s proposal to make Google share its search data with competitors would “deeply undermine user trust” by putting queries in the hands of potentially less secure rivals, the company’s search chief Elizabeth Reid testified Tuesday. TheJustice Department has proposed forcing Googleto syndicate its ranking signals and other search data to competitors, something it says will level the playing field and endGoogle’s search monopoly. But Reid argued that exporting that data would shake users’ faith that their searches would stay private, and its value would create an incentive for hackers to go after small competitors. “Once it’s turned over to a qualified competitor, there’s no further protections we can give,” she said. “A startup is generally not a target because it’s small, but now it has this huge treasure trove of data.” Google is fighting the DOJ’s sweeping proposals, which also includeforcing it to sell its Chrome browser, by arguing for more limited changes to its search distribution contracts (it plans to appeal the monopoly ruling, but can’t do so until Judge Amit Mehta issues a remedies decision). Reid’s testimony follows that of other executives,including CEO Sundar Pichai, who claimed the government’s proposals could drastically change Google and the larger web. The DOJ says its proposals are all necessary to restore competition to the search market, and it’s argued that Google is exaggerating their dire effects. “Maybe they decide to not use Google altogether, [or] maybe they decide they’re not going to search for certain categories” Turning over information that powers Google’s search would not only make its competitors targets for hacks, Reid said, but it could undermine trust in Google’s products and search more broadly. Today, many people turn to Google to ask questions they may not even feel comfortable asking a friend, she said. “If suddenly they’re worried that data might go somewhere else … maybe they decide to not use Google altogether, [or] maybe they decide they’re not going to search for certain categories.” During its case-in-chief, by contrast, the DOJ brought in a privacy expert who testified search information could be safely shared with certain protections in place. Reid echoed testimony from Pichai last week that the government’s data-sharing proposals could help rivals or spammers “reverse engineer” its systems, making it easier for them to get spam or misinformation ranked in Google results. Fighting these bad actors is “always a cat and mouse game, but it suddenly becomes a cat and mouse game where your hands are really tied behind your back,” she said. Building the tools needed to follow the government’s proposals would divert engineering talent toward tedious compliance work instead of innovation, Reid continued. She testified that more than 20 percent of the search engineering force would need to focus on compliance “because it’s so extensive and invasive.” Even incremental changes to small features could trigger extra steps, so Google would likely shift its focus to areas “less covered by the remedies because that’s where we can stand out,” she said, though she didn’t get into specifics. On top of all of this, Reid said maintaining the tools needed to distribute all the information the DOJ wants it to share with rivals would slow down its ability to ship features that improve users’ search experiences. “It’s just an incredibly large amount of work because these modules are constantly changing,” Reid said. “The business value of syndication versus the cost just doesn’t work out.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. Whether you want everything but the kitchen sink or top-tier performance for a midrange price, you’ve got options. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The Android ecosystem is all about choice. While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half!Imagine. On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.) As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has becomeso routine that it’s mostly painless. A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates. The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life. Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well. Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices. If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone. 8 Verge Score Updated design feels more secure in handFast fingerprint sensorSeven years of software and OS updates No telephoto cameraAI features are inconsistentWhat is a photo?

But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get. The Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The camera is as reliable as ever, and if you’re into AI photo editing tricks,boy does this phone have ‘em. There’s a new Screenshots app that acts as a place to store all of the information that would otherwise be lost at sea in your camera roll, and it uses AI to parse information out and make it searchable. Kinda handy. Even without AI, this is an excellent phone. It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it. Its potential for long-term value and the quality of the hardware make it an easy recommendation for anyone who just wants a nice Android phone that works. 8 Verge Score Excellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfier ExpensiveBulkyAI is (still) hit or miss Screen:6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:5,000mAh /Charging:45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) /Weather resistance:IP68 There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy. The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents. All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was. 8 Verge Score The last reasonably sized Android phoneSeven years of OS upgradesVery good camera Samsung software is as cluttered as usualAI is still a mixed bag Screen:6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED /Processor:Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 EliteCameras:50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfieBattery:4000mAh /Charging:25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)/Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25. That’s theregularS25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS. The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bitmuch, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with. 8 Verge Score Excellent battery lifeSix years of security updatesStrong IP rating for dust and water resistance Big phone is bigNot as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer Screen:6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED /Processor:Snapdragon 8 Elite /Cameras:50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie /Battery:6,000mAh /Charging:80W wired, 50W wireless /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 and IP69 There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience. The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility. 8 Verge Score Excellent outer screen formatInner screen is lovely to useSeven years of OS updates ExpensiveMain camera isn’t as good as slab phonesLong-term durability?

Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen. The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach. That said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding. There are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.

The App Store Freedom Act would also prevent companies like Apple and Google from barring developers from using third-party payment systems. byEmma Roth Representative Kat Cammack (R-FL) introduced a bill Tuesday that would require “large app store operators” like Apple to let users install third-party app stores and set them as their default. The bill, calledthe App Store Freedom Act, aims to “promote competition and protect consumers and developers in the mobile app marketplace,” according to apress release on Tuesday. Though the bill doesn’t mention Apple by name, it carves out rules for “large app store operators,” which it defines as app stores having more than 100 million users in the US. The bill would target Google’s practices as well, as it would force major app stores to let developers use third-party payment systems. It would also require Apple and Google to offer developers “equal access to interfaces, features, and development tools without cost or discrimination,” as well as allow users to remove or hide pre-installed apps. Violations of the bill would result in penalties from the Federal Trade Commission, along with an additional civil penalty of up to $1 million for each violation. The European Union has introduced similar legislation that has forced Apple to let usersdownload third-party app storesandchange their default apps. Last week, Apple started allowingdevelopers to link to outside paymentsin response toa ruling in theEpic v. Applecase. Google has also made changes after the EU’s regulations went into effect, including adding anew browser choice screenwhen users set up their device for the first time. “Dominant app stores have controlled customer data and forced consumers to use the marketplaces’ own merchant services, instead of the native, in-app offerings provided by the applications and developers themselves,” Cammack said in the press release.

Mojang announced last year that Minecraft would stop supporting VR headsets after March 2025, and per today’sMinecraft: Bedrock Edition1.21.80 Updatepatch notes, that support has been removed,as reported byPCWorld. When Mojang announced the end of support for VRin October, it said that you’ll still get updates on your PC, you’ll still be able to play without a VR / MR device, and that you’ll be able to continue building worlds or use any Marketplace purchases. At the time, Mojang’s reasoning for removing supportwas that“our ability to support VR / MR devices has come to an end.” However, there are still ways to playMinecrafton a VR headset, if you’d like. If you have the Java version of the game for PC, you can use a mod likeVivecraft, which works on many VR platforms, orQuestCraft, a port specific to Meta Quest headsets.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 6, 2025 / 5:17 PM EDT/ CBS News In the eyes of U.S. Catholics, thenext popeis going to have big — if notred— shoes to fill. Most say the Church is in touch with the needs of Catholics, a view that's higher today than whenPope Francis(who famously wore simple black shoes) became pontiff in 2013. Just beforeFrancis' papacy, which today gets 76% approval, most U.S. Catholics said the Church was out of touch. As such, many U.S. Catholics would see the next pope continue Francis' teachings, and others would move toward still more progressive ones. Those who'd continue Francis' teachings tend to be younger. And by two to one, more U.S. Catholics overall say Francis' papacy left them feeling more connected to the Church than less. While most say it doesn't matter where the next pope comes from, plenty of U.S. Catholics — if given a choice — would like the next Pope to come from the U.S., their top choice out of other countries or regions. Hispanic Americans — who make up a third of US Catholics — also favor the U.S., but South America, Mexico and Central America are also noted. Most also want the next pope to be outspoken on world political issues. What kinds of changes are Catholics looking for? Most U.S. Catholics would look for a pope who is in favor of letting priests marry; of letting women be ordained as priests; and — overwhelmingly — for the use of birth control. But here again there are differences between the (smaller group of) regular churchgoers, and the larger group of U.S. Catholics who rarely or never go. These majority views are driven much more by the latter group, who also say the Church is out of touch with Catholics' needs — which may be one reason they'd seek a new pope in favor of changes such as these. Most U.S. Catholics want the next pope to continue to prioritize tradition in general, even as some specific things draw calls for change. And they have at least some confidence (if not a great deal) theconclavewill choose a pope in touch with the needs of Catholics — this view is especially the case among the most frequent attendees. Those who think the Church is currentlyoutof touch have comparably less confidence that the conclave will pick a pope whois. But the next pope will oversee a U.S. Catholic laity with some pronounced differences in views between a smaller group who say they attend Mass at least a few times per month — most of whom do think the Church is in touch — and a majority who say they attend only a few times a year or never, and think the Church isoutof touch. And U.S. Catholics say they'll be paying attention. Most plan to follow news about the process and selection of a pope at least somewhat closely. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,298 adult Catholics living in the U.S.  interviewed between April 30-May 5, 2025. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and Mass attendance according to the2023-24 Pew Religious Landscape Study. The margin of error is ±3.8 points.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 6, 2025 / 5:10 PM EDT/ CBS News WithMother's Dayapproaching, you may be looking to buy a bouquet of flowers — and prices could be higher due totariffsenacted by President Trump. \"We're going to do the best we can to sort of keep those prices where they need to be. But people can definitely expect to be paying a little bit more,\" said Jody Costello, a florist in Royal Oak, Michigan. While Mr. Trumppaused hefty tariffshe announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere. Last year, the U.S. imported $2.2 billion worth of cut flowers and greenery, the bulk of which came from Colombia and Ecuador, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. \"The fact that they can grow year-round gave them a natural advantage,\" said Kate Penn, CEO of the Society of American Florists. Penn said domestically, small growers — many of whom have an acre or less — have flourished since the COVID-19 pandemic, selling at farmers' markets and to a blossoming wedding industry. \"The consumer does want to buy local, especially brides,\" she said. \"They love to be able to have local flowers featured.\" But even small growers like Moonshot Farm in East Windsor, New Jersey, aren't immune to the fallout from tariffs. Moonshot Farm owner Rebecca Kutzer-Rice said some of the bulbs she uses to grow flowers are imported from Italy and Holland. She just received her first few shipments to be hit with the 10% tariffs. \"We're estimating it could cost our small business anywhere from $40,000 to $50,000 a year, which for a small farm is almost the equivalent of like a salary of another employee,\" she said. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers. Mistine Boren, a florist in Austin, Texas,told CBS affiliate CBS19, she's waiting until after Mother's Day to decide if she'll raise prices. \"It's tough,\" she said. \"Our margins are so thin already, and especially when it comes to buying fresh flowers, it's a big splurge and expense for people.\" Boren said she's also trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs. Consumers may just need to be a little more flexible about what types of flowers they buy, but they can still get quality bouquets, Penn said. \"There literally are countless substitutions and florists are just masters at creating something that's still gonna make a big impact,\" she said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 6, 2025 / 3:18 PM EDT/ CBS Chicago President Trump took shots at former President Barack Obama'sPresidential Centerin Chicago while meeting with new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney Tuesday, calling it \"a disaster\" and blaming \"woke\" construction workers. Most of theOval Office meetingfocused on tariffs and the relationship between Canada and the U.S., with Carney emphatically telling Mr. Trump that Canada is \"not for sale\" and \"won't be for sale, ever,\" while Mr. Trump called the border between the U.S. and Canada \"artificial\" and again raised the idea of Canada joining the U.S. But part way through the meeting, the president digressed to talk about the Obama Presidential Library, which is being built in Chicago's Jackson Park. In his comments, he derided the project and blamed \"DEI\" and \"woke\" for it being \"a disaster.\" \"I mean look, President Obama — and if he wanted help, I'd give him help because I build on time and on budget — he's building his presidential library in Chicago. It's a disaster,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And he said something to the effect, 'I only want DEI, I only want woke.' He wants woke people to build it. Well, he got woke people and they have massive cost overruns, the job is stopped. I don't know, it's a disaster.\" According to updatesposted on the Obama Foundation website, work has continued to close the exterior of building and install glass and granite finishing, and instal interior windows on the museum levels. The foundation said insulation has also been installed in several other buildings at the complex. However, Mr. Trump claimed the center is \"millions of dollars, like many, many — I mean, really, millions of dollars over budget,\" and said the problems were because Pres. Obama \"wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love.\" \"He wanted people that, like, never did it before and he's got a disaster on his hands,\" he said. A spokesperson for the Obama Foundation said the president's comments were not based in fact and said they believe he was referencing \"a relatively common dispute between two subcontractors over work that has already been completed.\" \"Everyone who sees the Obama Presidential Center is blown away by its beauty, scale and the way it will be an economic engine for Chicago and a beacon of hope for the world,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"We look forward to welcoming all visitors to the 19.3-acre campus next spring, to experience a presidential center that not only honors the Obamas' legacy but also lifts up the next generation of leaders.\" The center's website touts their use of union labor to build the center, which is privately funded and does not use taxpayer dollars. Construction has been ongoing throughout the often-harsh Chicago winter, and the foundation continues to expect that the Obama Presidential Center will open to the public in 2026. The Obama Presidential Center is a large complex on the city's South Side that includes a fruit and vegetable garden, athletic and events facility, a museum, an auditorium, a branch of the Chicago Public Library and more.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 6, 2025 / 1:45 PM EDT/ CBS News Grand Theft Auto 6 has dropped a surprise second trailer just days after Rockstar Games said it'spushing backthe game's much-anticipated release until May 2026. The second trailer provides more details about the game's storyline, which involves its first-ever female protagonist, Lucia. The roughly 3-minute clip shows her partner, Jason, as he meets her when she's released from prison. The two are shown engaging in some criminal activities, such as holding up a business while wearing masks and carrying weapons. \"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them,\" states Rockstar's description for the second trailer. \"But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.\" The game, known as GTA to fans, had originally been slated for a 2025 release, but Rockstar said last week that it would push that back to May 26, 2026. Fans have already been waiting more than a decade for a new title, with the most recent version of the game, GTA 5, released in 2013. With GTA 5 having sold more than 200 million copies, expectations are high for GTA 6, with Wedbush Securities forecasting sales of $6.35 billion in sales for fiscal year 2026. The second trailer, which was released about17 months after the game's first trailer, introduces more of the backstory between its main characters, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Jason is described as growing up \"around grifters and crooks,\" but after some time in the Army, he moved to the Keys to work for local drug runners. Lucia, meanwhile, ended up in the Leonida Penitentiary after \"fighting for her family,\" the websitesays. Other characters include Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, and Boobie Ike, who has used his street smarts to build a business empire including \"real estate, a strip club and a recording studio,\" the site says. Along with the trailer, Rockstar Games also released new screenshots of the game on its website, featuring new characters and a number of locations, including Vice City — the fictional city inspired by Miami — and Leonida Keys, which bears a resemblance to the Florida Keys. \"Literally the best graphics I've ever seen,\" wrote YouTuber Jake Randall on X about the new trailer.

    "title": "Thorny issues await the new pope, and the men about to choose him",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 6, 2025 / 9:46 AM EDT/ CBS News Vatican City— All the Vatican staff who will be involved in the2025 conclaveto pick the late Pope Francis' successor — from the cleaners to the cooks and custodians — have taken their oath of secrecy. The punishment for leaking information about the ancient Catholic Church ritual is immediate excommunication. The 133 cardinal electors tasked withelecting the next pontiffwill take their own oath on Wednesday, inside the Sistine Chapel, as the conclave gets underway. They have all arrived at the Vatican for the gathering, and they've been seen this week going in and out of meetings every day, where they discuss the merits of the men among their own ranks — any one of whom could be chosen as the next pope. From Wednesday, the cardinal electors will gather in the chapel, beneath Michelangelo's renowned Last Judgement fresco, to decide who should lead the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. Among the issues that differentiate thepresumed frontrunnersfor the job are some extremely controversial topics for Catholics, including exactly how far the church should open its doors — if at all — to people like Andrea Rubera, his husband, and their three children. Rubera, who has been in his same-sex relationship for years, told CBS News that \"when Pope Francis died, I cried.\" A decade ago, Rubera and his husband were struggling over whether they could raise their kids Catholic. Then he got a phone call. \"So I answered, and it was: 'Mr. Rubera, are you busy at the moment, because I see you are you are not answering my calls, and this is Pope Francis.'\" He recalled his surprise as the late pontiff asked if he could make time to talk. He did, and Francis encouraged the couple to behave like any other Catholic family. Rubera said he's worried that the next pope may not be as eager to welcome him and his family into the church. \"My personal fear is that our lives, our families, our rights, could be ... canceled,\" he said. Another big issue facing the next pope will be the role of women in the church. There has been fierce debate within the Catholic community for years about whether women should be allowed to become deacons, and eventually even priests. That door, even during the relatively progressive reign of Pope Francis, remained firmly closed. But Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, told CBS News that, \"on this question, women are not going to wait much longer.\" \"Certainly there's a tipping point that we're facing,\" she said, predicting that if the Catholic Church doesn't offer new opportunities soon, \"I think women will vote with their feet — they will no longer go and participate in the life of the church.\" When the new pope is chosenbehind the closed doors of the conclave, he'll adopt his chosen papal name and then be taken to an antechamber in the Sistine Chapel to put on his papal white robes. That fitting room is called \"La Stanza delle Lacrime,\" or, in English, \"the room of tears\" — for all the popes who have cried there over the centuries as the gravity of their calling sinks in.

    "title": "When will the 2025 conclave bring a new pope?",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 6, 2025 / 7:46 AM EDT/ CBS News This week, 133 Catholic cardinal electors willchoose a new popein a secretive, centuries-oldritual called a conclave. On Wednesday, the electors — among the church's most senior officials — will be locked inside the Vatican's Sistine Chapel to hold as many rounds of voting as prove necessary to select the next pontiff. Here's what you need to know about the process and how long it might take. Theconclavebegins on Wednesday, May 7 — 16 days afterPope Francis' death. It's one of the oldest methods of electing a head of state that's still in use today, and its basic protocols have barely changed for 800 years. In order to become a pope, a candidate need only be Catholic and male. However, for centuries, popes have only been chosen from among the Catholic cardinals, the church's most senior officials. The conclave takes place in the Sistine Chapel, behind sealed doors. Along with all Vatican staff involved in the process, the cardinal electors take an oath of secrecy, and the chapel is swept for listening devices. The 133 electors participating this time around can hold one round of voting in the afternoon of the first day of the conclave, which consists of two ballots. To be elected pope, a candidate must garner two-thirds of the votes plus one. If the first round isn't conclusive, voting continues into a second day. From the second day onward, there are two rounds of voting each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. If there is no two-thirds majority after three days of voting, the process is paused for a day to allow time for the cardinals to pray and discuss their options. There is no time limit set for how long a conclave can take. The cardinal electors continue to vote until a two-third-plus-one majority is achieved. The shortest conclave on record was in 1503, when it took the cardinals only 10 hours to choose Pope Pius III as the new pontiff. The longest conclave on record took nearly three years. The election of a successor to Pope Clement IV in 1268 dragged on for so long — about 1,000 days — that locals in the town of Viterbo, where it was held, locked the cardinals in the room where they had gathered until they reached a decision. That is where the name still used for the process of selecting a new pope — \"conclave,\" which translates to \"under lock and key\" — came from. After that marathon conclave, Pope Gregory X was finally elected in September of 1271. There is no way to predict how long a conclave will take, but guidance can perhaps be taken from recent history. The last three popes have been elected in two or three days. In 2013, Pope Francis was elected after five ballots held over two days. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI was elected after four ballots. In 1978, Pope John Paul II was elected over two days after eight ballots. After each round of voting, the paper ballots are burned. If a pope has not been elected,black smoke risesfrom the chimney above the chapel. If a pope has been elected, white smoke rises. Initially, only black smoke was part of the conclave tradition, rising from the chimney as a result of ballots being burned after an unsuccessful round of voting. White smoke was first used in 1914, when Cardinals decided the light colored smoke should announce the selection of a new pope, Georgtown University reported. Now, to ensure the result of each ballot is clear, chemicals are burned alongside the ballots in each round to color the smoke black or white. The Associated  Presscontributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentand U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer will meet with theirChinesecounterparts inSwitzerlandthis weekend to discuss economic and trade matters, their offices announced Tuesday. “We have shared interests,” Bessent said later on Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle.” The current tariff war “isn’t sustainable,” said Bessent, “especially on the Chinese side. And, you know, 145 percent [tariffs], 125 percent, is the equivalent of an embargo. We don’t want to decouple, what we want is fair trade.” Bessent and Greer will meet with their Chinese counterparts on both Saturday and Sunday, the Treasury secretary said. The meetings appear to be a major step toward Washington and Beijing beginning negotiations to potentially resolve the ongoingtrade warignited by PresidentDonald Trump. “My sense is that this will be about de-escalation, not about the big trade deal,” Bessent told host Laura Ingraham. “But we’ve got to de-escalate, before we can move forward.” Trump ratcheted uptariffslast month on Chinese imports to 145% even as he scaled back so-called reciprocal tariffs on almost all other U.S. trading partners.China, which is one of America’s largest trading partners, retaliated with steep tariffs on U.S. goods. Stock futures, which opened in the red Tuesday evening, turned sharply higher immediately following news of the meetings. Both Bessent and Greer plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter during their visit, their offices said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that Vice Premier He Lifeng, Beijing’s top official for China-U.S. economic and trade matters, will meet with Bessent in Switzerland, NBC News reported. “Economic security is national security, and President Donald J. Trump is leading the way both at home and abroad for a stronger, more prosperous America,” Bessent said in a statement announcing the meetings. “I look forward to productive talks as we work towards rebalancing the international economic system towards better serving the interests of the United States,” Bessent said. Greer’s office said he “will also meet with his counterpart from the People’s Republic of China to discuss trade matters” while in Geneva, his office said. “At President Trump’s direction, I am negotiating with countries to rebalance our trade relations to achieve reciprocity, open new markets, and protect America’s economic and national security,” Greer said. “I look forward to having productive meetings with some of my counterparts as well as visiting with my team in Geneva who all work diligently to advance U.S. interests on a range of multilateral issues,” Greer said. Trump earlier Tuesday said that China wants to meet, and the U.S. will do so “at the right time.” “They want to negotiate and they want to have a meeting and we’ll be meeting with them at the right time,” Trump said at the White House during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump also expressed frustration at people “asking how many deals are you signing this week?” despite the fact that his administration had said other countries were asking forbilateral trade talkswith the United States. “Everyone says, ‘When, when, when are you going to sign deals?’” Trump griped at the White House. “We don’t have to sign deals, they have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don’t want a piece of their market,” Trump said. Bessent also said earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. was negotiating with 17 trading partners, and China was not one of them. “China, we have not engaged in negotiations with as of yet,” Bessent said before a House appropriations subcommittee.",

    "title": "Supreme Court allows Trump to implement transgender military ban",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump to implement his ban ontransgender peopleserving inthe military. The justices granted an emergency request from the Trump administration to lift a nationwide injunction blocking the policy while litigation continues. The court'sbrief ordernoted that the three liberal justices dissented. Follow live politics coverage here \"No more trans @ DoD,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegsethsaidon X. In a separateDefense Department postearlier Tuesday, before the decision was issued, Hegseth said in a video: \"No more dudes in dresses. We are done with that s---.\" Just over 4,000 transgender peoplecurrently servein the military, according to Defense Department data, though some activists put the figure much higher. There are around 2.1 million active service members in total. Among those affected with be the seven individual transgender service members, led by lead plaintiff Emily Shilling, a Navy commander, who had sued to block it. \"Transgender service members have served this nation with courage, skill, and selflessness for years,\" Shilling said in a statement Tuesday. \"We’ve flown combat missions, led sailors, commanded troops, and stood watch. We are not a theory. We are not a policy debate. We are real people, doing real jobs, in defense of a nation we still believe in, even when it struggles to believe in us.\" \"I know this decision will cause fear and doubt in the ranks. To those feeling shaken, I say this: stand tall. You are not alone. You are part of a community that will fight for you, stand beside you, and never stop pushing forward,\" she added. Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, two groups representing the plaintiffs, said in a joint statement that the Supreme Court decision was a \"devastating blow\" to transgender service members. The policy “has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,” they added. In a separate case, a judge in Washington, D.C., also blocked the policy nationwide, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put that ruling on hold temporarily while it heard arguments on whether to block it more permanently.The court has yet to rule. The policy, announced in February, is much more comprehensive ban than a similar proposal implemented during the first Trump term. It \"generally disqualifies from military service individuals who have gender dysphoria or have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in court papers. In asking the Supreme Court to intervene, Sauer said that judges are required to show \"substantial deference\" to the Defense Department's judgment on military issues. In implementing the policy, the government relied on a Pentagon report from the first Trump term that said people with gender dysphoria are a threat to \"military effectiveness and lethality.\" The challengers argued in court that the ban violates the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which requires that laws apply equally to everybody, as well as other constitutional provisions. Transgender service members have shown in recent years that they can serve just as well as anyone else, their lawyers said in court papers. Then-President Joe Biden had rolled back Trump's earlier restrictions. \"An unprecedented degree of animus towards transgender people animates and permeates the ban: it is based on the shocking proposition that transgender people do not exist,\" the lawyers wrote. A federal judge in Washington state blocked the policy March 27, saying “it is not an especially close question.” The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put the ruling on hold, prompting the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.",

    "title": "U.S. intelligence agencies contradict Trump's Tren de Aragua claims",
    "article_text": "A declassified memo drafted by U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Donald Trump's claims that Venezuela's government controlsthe Tren de Aragua gang, an argument he has used to deport immigrants toan El Salvador prison. The National Intelligence Council memo states thatthe Venezuelan regime of Nicolás Maduroallows criminal gangs to operate in its territory but that it is not orchestratingTren de Aragua’s operationsin the United States. “While Venezuela’s permissive environment enables TDA to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,” according to the April 7 memo. The National Intelligence Director's Office released the memo in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a nonprofit organization. The foundation provided a copy to NBC News. Titled \"Venezuela: Examining regime ties to Tren de Aragua,\" the declassified version of the five-page memo included some blacked out-words and passages. The New York Timesfirst reported on the memo Monday. Trump invoked the1798 Alien Enemies Actafter declaring Tren de Aragua an invading force. The lawhad only been used in wartime. He and administration officials have said that the Tren de Aragua gang is operating under the guidance and direction of the Venezuelan regime. “TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela,”Trump wrote in his proclamationinvoking the act. The law has been used to summarily deport Venezuelans and other immigrants to a prison in El Salvador. The prison isnotorious for its brutal and abusive conditions. The intelligence community said it based its judgment about Tren de Aragua on “Venezuelan law enforcement actions demonstrating the regime treats TDA as a threat; an uneasy mix of cooperation and confrontation, rather than top down directives characterizing the regime’s ties to other armed groups; and the decentralized makeup of TDA that would make such a relationship logistically challenging.” The memo noted that FBI analysts took a slightly different view even though they agreed broadly with the assessment of the other intelligence agencies. FBI analysts “assesssomeVenezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members’ migration from Venezuela to the United States and use members as proxies in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and the United States to advance what they see as the Maduro regime’s goal of destabilizing governments and undermining public safety in these countries,” the memo said. The Washington Post first reported on the existence of the memo, and before thatthe Times reportedthat intelligence called into question assertions about the cartel and its ties to the Venezuelan government. The Trump administration has sharply criticized media coverage of the issue as misleading and announced leak investigations related to the Post and Times reporting. The Justice Department cited the media reporting as an impetus toroll back limits on leak investigations. Lauren Harper of the Freedom of the Press Foundation said the memo undermines the administration’s claims that the information in the document could pose a danger to public safety. “The Trump administration claimed that the leak of this memo was so dangerous that it necessitated opening criminal investigations and creating new, stricter rules around leaks to the media,” Harper said in an email. “We wanted to see if that was true — or if the Justice Department was weakening journalists’ protections to help hide a document that the public has an obvious right to see.” The declassified memo “not only shows that the Maduro regime does not direct Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, it shows the DOJ’s new media rules are an excuse to target journalists,” she said. But the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said that the news media is “twisting” and “manipulating” intelligence assessments about foreign criminal gangs operating in the U.S. “to undermine the President's agenda to keep the American people safe.” “Illegal immigrant criminals have raped, tortured, and murdered Americans, and still, the propaganda media continues to operate as apologists for them,” she said in an email relayed by a spokesperson. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence later issued a statement saying it “fully supports the assessment that the foreign terrorist organization, Tren De Aragua, is acting with the support of the Maduro Regime, and thus subject to arrest, detention, and removal as alien enemies of the United States.” At a House Intelligence Committee hearing in March, Gabbard told lawmakers that there were conflicting findings on the ties between the gang and the regime. “There are varied assessments that came from different intelligence community elements,” she said. The ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, and Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas, also a member of the committee, welcomed the memo’s release and said they had written a letter last month to Gabbard asking her to declassify it. The lawmakers argued that the declassified assessment reinforced the finding of a federal judge last week that the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act related to the Tren de Aragua gang “was illegal.” The Democratic congressmen also wrote that “Director Gabbard should explain why her public descriptions of this intelligence failed to correspond with the IC’s findings.” They added: “The most basic responsibility of the Director of National Intelligence is to speak truth to power and, where possible, the American people.” Asked about the declassified memo, the Republican chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, said in an email that he “fully supports President Trump’s tireless efforts to protect Americans from brutal thugs who seek to invade our homeland and terrorize the American people.” Cotton added that he looks forward to journalists' \"questioning his Democrat friends as to why they continue to defend foreigners who seek to do harm to their constituents.\" Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the memo showed that the Maduro regime is not a sponsor of Tren de Aragua. “It’s extremely concerning to see the DNI misrepresent nonpartisan Intelligence Community assessments,” he said in a statement. “It’s even more alarming to see this happening as part of an effort to give legs to Donald Trump’s unconstitutional attempts to expulse migrants without due process.” Secretary of StateMarco Rubio wrote in an op-ed on Fox News’ websitethat it was irrelevant if Tren de Aragua was acting on the orders of the Maduro regime, arguing the regime had “fostered its growth.” “Whether TdA exclusively murders, smuggles drugs, and traffics illegal immigrants over our borders on the orders of Venezuelan leaders, or freelances for self-enrichment is beside the point,” he wrote. “It has killed on behalf of a hostile foreign government, that government has fostered its growth, and that government has encouraged it to invade the United States to advance its interests.” CORRECTION(May 6, 2025, 7 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the last name of the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. He is Mark Warner, not Warren.",

    "title": "Trump's Cabinet members warn FIFA World Cup visitors not to overstay their visas",
    "article_text": "Members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet said Tuesday that while they look forward to the United States’ co-hosting next year’sFIFA World Cup, they want to make sure foreign visitors don’t stay longer than they’re allowed. The quadrennial tournament, which the United States will host alongside Mexico and Canada, is expected to attract millions of fans from dozens of countries. The Department of Homeland Security has indicated it’s ready to handle the influx of international travelers. “Of course, everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event,” Vice President JD Vance said at a World Cup task force meeting led by Trump that included several top administration officials, as well as Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, the world organizing body of soccer. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to Secretary Noem,” Vance said, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has helped lead the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy echoed Vance’s warning. “If you’re coming to see some soccer ... go on a road trip. See America,” he said before he changed his tone. “Don’t overstay your visa. Don’t stay too long.” Follow live politics coverage here Of the tournament’s 104 games, 78 will be played in the United States, with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Other match venues in the United States include Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City and Miami. Two factors could affect the number of tourists who travel to North America for the tournament next summer. For the first time in the World Cup’s 95-year history, it will be expanded to 48 teams. In recent years, only 32 have participated. While the expanded format is expected to attract more tourists, Trump’s hard-line immigration policies may have a cooling effect. Asked whether people who have taken part inpro-Palestinian protestsshould be concerned about attending the World Cup in the United States, Trump said: “I think people are allowed to protest. You have to do it in a reasonable manner, not necessarily friendly, but reasonable. Otherwise, Pam will come after you, and you’re going to have a big problem.” Attorney General Pam Bondi participated in Tuesday’s meeting of the task force, whose executive director is Andrew Giuliani, son of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. Infantino has estimated that between the FIFA Club World Cup, which is being hosted solely in the United States this summer, and next year’s World Cup, the country will draw 10 million international tourists. Noem struck a more inviting tone Tuesday than some of her administration colleagues. She cast the tournament as “an opportunity for the world to become a friendlier place.” “We will take care of their documentation and travel documents, and it will go smoothly. And we will make sure that they can come and enjoy and bring their families and friends and make memories together,” she said.",

    "title": "Man accused of kidnapping toddler at Georgia Walmart released on bond",
    "article_text": "MARIETTA, Ga. — Mahendra Patel, a 57-year-old Georgia man facing charges of attempted kidnapping at an Atlanta-area Walmart, has been released on bond after spending six weeks in jail. A superior court judge of the Cobb County Judicial Circuit set the bond at $10,000 Tuesday morning. Patel was accused in March of ripping a 2-year-old away from his mother, 26-year-old Caroline Miller. He was charged with criminal attempt to commit kidnapping, assault and battery, according to court documents. Miller toldlocal television station WSB-TV Atlantathat she and Patel were “tug of warring” with the child. However, surveillance footage released in April contradicts Miller’s account, Patel’s attorney Ashleigh Merchant said. Patel told reporters outside the detention center that he was elated to be out of law enforcement custody. “I’m a positive guy, so you got to take it one day at a time. Lot of ups and downs,” Patel said. “But I knew we had a team outside helping me. One day we’ll see the light, and then we see today.” According to the arrest warrant, Miller’s 2-year-old had been sitting in her lap while they were in a shopping cart for people with disabilities. Patel had allegedly grabbed and pulled the child away from Miller. Miller was able to regain control of her child by “wrestling” him back from Patel, the warrant said. “This act placed the mother in fear for her and her child’s safety,” the warrant said. Surveillance footage of the interaction shows Patel speaking to Miller while she’s in the scooter. Miller, who is not disabled, has said that her children enjoy riding in the scooter. At one point, the 2-year-old slips from Miller’s lap. Patel told law enforcement that he had asked Miller where Tylenol could be found, and attempted to help stabilize the toddler. “Mr. Patel offered to hold the baby while she got up to show him where the Tylenol was,” Merchant said during the hearing. “He believes fully that she’s handicapped and she’s got two young children.” Patel appears to have a second interaction with Miller, during which he shows her the bottle of Tylenol that he had found. “Mr. Patel went, got the Tylenol, and the video couldn’t be clearer,” Merchant said during the hearing. “Mr. Patel did not try to kidnap this child.” Since Patel’s arrest, he’s drawn support from across the internet. A petition for his release has gotten more than 47,200 signatures as of Tuesday. Patel is still fighting the case but, for now, he said he is excited to have a home cooked meal. A trial date has not yet been scheduled. “I’m picky about food, but I told my daughter and wife, I said, ‘I don’t care. Better than what I got over there.’”",

    "title": "Motown legend Smokey Robinson is accused of sexual assault by 4 housekeepers in lawsuit",
    "article_text": "Four former housekeepers for Motown legend Smokey Robinson have accused him of sexual assault, alleging in a lawsuit that he repeatedly abused some of them for years. The suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleges that the assaults largely occurred at Robinson’s home in Chatsworth, California, northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The plaintiffs, identified in the 27-page complaint as Jane Does 1-4, seek damages totaling no less than $50 million, according to the complaint. “Obviously, no amount can compensate these women for what Mr. Robinson subjected them to,” one of their lawyers, John Harris, told reporters Tuesday. But given the gravity of Robinson’s alleged misconduct, Harris said, “this amount is clearly warranted.” Representatives for Robinson, whose real name is William Robinson Jr., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wearing masks to protect their privacy, three of the women appeared in person at a news conference in Los Angeles. A fourth attended remotely. Harris said there was a common thread between them. They “were Hispanic women employed as housekeepers earning below minimum wage,” Harris said. “As low-wage workers in vulnerable positions, they lacked the resources and options to protect themselves.” They did not come forward previously because they feared missing a paycheck, he said. Some of the plaintiffs worked for Robinson at the same time, Harris said, though they were too embarrassed to reveal the alleged assaults. Breaking that silence prompted an “avalanche of emotion,” he added. The suit alleges that Robinson assaulted one woman at least 23 times from May 2014 to February 2020, often in places in his home without security cameras. The suit alleges that he assaulted another former employee at least 20 times during the 12 years she worked for him, beginning in 2012. According to the suit, Robinson would force her into his bedroom and perform a “ritual” of leaving his bathroom naked or nearly naked. According to the suit, Robinson would then place a towel on his bed so the linens would not be soiled “for what was about to occur.” The suit says he subjected two other plaintiffs to the same behavior. One of the former housekeepers worked for Robinson for 13 months, during which, she alleges, he assaulted her at least seven times. “In a desperate attempt to him to stop his sexual assaults,” the suit says of this plaintiff, “she would proclaim ‘you’re married.’” The suit accuses Robinson of ignoring her pleas. According to the suit, another plaintiff said that if she refused to have sex with Robinson, he would threaten to have his wife, Frances Robinson, be “mean” to her. All of the plaintiffs accused Frances Robinson, who is also named as a defendant, of perpetuating a hostile work environment by screaming at them and using ethnically pejorative language. Another former housekeeper who later worked as Frances Robinson’s personal assistant, cook and hairdresser accused Smokey Robinson of first assaulting her in 2007 at his Las Vegas home, according to the suit. The suit accuses Robinson of assaulting the woman, identified as JD4, more than a decade later, at a temporary home in Bell Canyon and at his home in Chatsworth. “When the other housekeeper(s) would leave the residence, Defendant Smokey Robinson would summon her to his blue bedroom while sitting naked on his bed,” the suit says. “He would then lock the door and place a towel down on the bed. After doing so, he would pull JD4’s clothes off, and against her protestations, push her down on the bed and proceed to rape her.” Robinson never wore a condom during the assaults, according to the suit. In addition to losing their incomes, the suit says, the plaintiffs did not report Robinson to authorities for fear of reprisal and public embarrassment. Three said they were worried about possible adverse effects on their immigration statuses. Robinson was a pioneer for Motown Records, founding the vocal group the Miracles in the 1950s and later releasing albums as a solo artist and working as a record executive for the label. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.",

    "article_text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. — A Kentucky woman was in a sticky mess when she found stacks of boxes containing lollipops on her front doorstep. The surprise delivery was ordered by her young son while he played on her phone. Holly LaFavers says she tried stopping 8-year-old Liam’s Amazon order for about 70,000 Dum-Dum suckers before the treats arrived, but it was too late. Amazon had already delivered 22 cases to her home. “He told me that he wanted to have a carnival, and he was ordering the Dum-Dums as prizes for his carnival,” LaFavers said. “Again, he was being friendly, he was being kind to his friends.” The surprise got worse after a quick check of her bank account. She owed about $4,000 for the order. “When I saw what the number was, I just about fainted,” LaFavers said. Then she found out that eight more cases from the order were unaccounted for, she said. After a trip to the post office, those cases were returned to sender, she said. Her efforts to get a refund took a bit more time, but she got her money back. “After a long day of working with the bank and talking to a few news stations Amazon called and they are refunding my money,” she said in a social media post. LaFavers said she was changing some settings on her phone to make sure there’s never another surprise delivery at home.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Allan Smith interviews a Democratic congressman from battleground Pennsylvania who’s trying to grab the mantle of economic populism. Plus, Megan Lebowitz and Rebecca Shabad recap President Donald Trump’s first meeting with Canada’s new prime minister, who was boosted by anti-American sentiment in last month’s election. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about the latest from the White House, Congress or the campaign trail? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. At one time not so long ago, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was maybe seen as too progressive for most swing-district Democrats to appear with. Not anymore. When Sanders went through Pennsylvania over the weekend, one such Democrat, Rep. Chris Deluzio, was by his side on his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. Deluzio argued in an interview that the old intraparty divide of moderate vs. progressive is over. Deluzio has himself straddled that divide at times. But he has also sought to grab the left’s mantle of economic populism as he has won two terms in a district just outside of Pittsburgh. Now, in President Donald Trump’s second term, he sees the real battle not as between the center and left but as between those who are fighters and those who are passive. Deluzio argued that more populist positioning, citing his own push for an anti-corruption, anti-corporate and anti-monopoly platform, “is uniting more Democrats across the old ideological labels who understand that one, now is not the time to be a wimp, and that two, we’ve got to put the economic fight front and center.” That Deluzio, who represents a D+3 district, according to the Cook Political Report, would appear with Sanders would’ve raised eyebrows in past cycles. He said that, while he’s not sure how many Democratic officials feel differently about appearing on the trail with Sanders now, he doesn’t see much difference between his messaging and Sanders’. Appearing with him in Harrisburg and Bethlehem over the weekend — on the other side of the state from his congressional district — Deluzio railed against “bootlicker politicians,” “the oligarchs in the White House and the boardroom” and “these phony patriots” he sees “waging a war on the American Dream.” And he called on Democrats to rally around a congressional stock trading ban as part of an anti-corruption push. “Donald Trump understood that anger,” Deluzio said in Bethlehem of working-class disenchantment with the status quo. “He saw that wound in the American psyche. What does he offer? Snake oil of hate, division and autocracy. That’s not the way forward. We’re here to call out that bulls---.” Read more from Allan → President Donald Trump’s first meeting with Canada’s new prime minister was far less confrontational than his interactions with the country’s previous leader, Justin Trudeau, even as Mark Carney reiterated that there is no way the country will become part of the United States. “As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,” said Carney, a former banker whose electoral victory last month was fueled in part by backlash to Trump’s annexation and tariff agenda for Canada. Asked later what was going through his mind during Trump’s remarks inside the Oval Office, Carney said, “I’m glad that you couldn’t tell what was going through my mind.” “The president has made known his wish about that issue for some time,” Carney told reporters at the Canadian Embassy in downtown Washington. “I’ve been careful always to distinguish between wish and reality. I was clear there in the Oval Office, as I’ve been clear throughout on behalf of Canadians, that this is never going to happen. Canada is not for sale. It never will be for sale.” Carney also told reporters he asked Trump to stop saying he wants Canada to become the 51st state. The two leaders complimented each other multiple times during the meeting, a stark contrast from Trump’s icy relationship with Trudeau, whom he regularly taunted as “Governor Trudeau.” Trump said that he had “a lot of respect” for Carney and that “we’re going to be friends with Canada.” And Carney said, “I feel better about the relations.” But it remains to be seen whether the comity will last and whether Carney will be able to use the initial goodwill to turn down some of Trump’s pressure on his country when it comes to trade and Canada’s sovereignty. Even as Carney insisted his country would never be for sale, Trump replied, “Never say never.” Trump also told reporters that there was nothing Carney could say during their meeting that would persuade him to lift the tariffs. Asked why, he said, “That’s just the way it is.” Read more from Megan and Rebecca → That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Ben Kamisar.

    "title": "Newark air traffic control lost contact with pilots at least twice before, source says",
    "article_text": "The communications breakdown last week that resulted in air traffic controllers losing radar and radio contact with the pilots of planes they were guiding into Newark Liberty International Airport has happened at least two other times since August, a current veteran controller told NBC News on Tuesday. And at least eight or nine times in recent months, controllers lost radio contact with pilots flying into one of the nation's busiest airports, said the Newark airspace controller who asked not to be identified. “We lost all radios! No backups!\" the controller said. \"Everything went down.\" The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the claims Tuesday. This comes a week after controllers in Area C of the Philadelphia TRACON, which guides flights in and out of Newark, lost all communication on April 28 with the pilots bound for that airport — a near-disaster that is now under investigation. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday that contact between the air traffic controller and planes was lost for “30 seconds.” He told Fox News no planes were in danger of crashing. Since then, the estimates for how long there was no communication have climbed to 90 seconds. “That’s 90 seconds of a wholly filled-up sky of planes literally flying blind over one of America’s busiest airports,” New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said Tuesday in Washington. “Thank God nothing happened, but we tempt fate if no changes are made.\" Recordings released Tuesday by LiveATC.net offered some insight into how the air traffic controllers and pilots were able to work through the crisis and avert what could have been a major tragedy outside one of the nation’s busiest air travel hubs. “I am going to move you here because I just got told that the approach lost all the radars,\" an air traffic controller could be heard telling the pilot of United Airlines Flight 2243 on one of the recordings. \"Three of the four radar screens went black, and they have no frequencies.” “Alright, we’re ready to move,\" the pilot replied, his voice calm. This back-and-forth does not convey the fear air traffic controllers were feeling at the moment they were trying to get 15 to 20 flights safely into the airport while the systems were down, the whistleblowing controller said. “It was like time stood still for a while,\" the controller said. “It was a scary moment when we tried to reach these planes and we couldn’t.” The controller said the communications breakdown did not feel as long as 90 seconds but \"felt like 45 seconds to me,\" as they dealt with the crisis calmly. \"We went to back up radios, that didn’t work, nothing worked,\" the controller said. \"The fear of panic and being scared came afterwards.” \"These planes with people, with lives in them are flying — and no one is talking to them — they were flying in the dark,\" the controller said. \"It was like a cone of silence. We couldn’t hear them, but I’m sure they were calling us.\" The after-effects from what happened last week were still being felt Tuesday at Newark Airport. For a ninth straight day, travelers trying to fly out of Newark Airport had to contend with massive delays as the FAA tries to find replacements for the air traffic controllers out on a 45-day trauma leave. Incoming flights to Newark were delayed by more than four hours Tuesday. United Airlines, a major carrier at the airport, canceled 35 daily roundtrip flights at Newark and was waiving change fees for its customers wishing to change their flights to LaGuardia or Philadelphia airports. While the FAA has not said how many controllers are out on medical disability for stress, the controller who spoke with NBC News said the control tower is struggling to keep up with the flights because four experienced controllers and a trainee are now on leave. Replacing them will take time, an FAA spokesperson said, because any certified controller that applied or volunteered to move to the to the Philadelphia TRACON that guides planes into the Newark airspace would have to do additional training at the FAA's air traffic control training center in Oklahoma City. After which they would be required to do on-the-job training in Philadelphia. On average, it takes about a year and a half to be certified as an air traffic controller in any facility, the spokesperson said. The FAA moved the controllers who are responsible for aircraft arriving and departing from Newark from a facility on Long Island to Philadelphia last year. The move was meant to reduce the workload of the controllers in that facility who were also handling traffic for New York City’s major airports. United CEO Scott Kirby said Monday the Philadelphia TRACON “has been chronically understaffed for years.” “Newark airport cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there in the weeks and months ahead,\" Kirby said. Duffy said the shortage in air traffic controllers is an ongoing, nationwide problem. He said there are 3,000 vacant positions nationwide and that he plans to roll out a strategy to offer incentives to the labor force. “Decades of underinvestment in the maintenance of critical air traffic control infrastructure, delays in upgrading to modern 21st century air traffic control technology, and inadequate air traffic control staffing have resulted in a frail system nationwide,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy added Monday. The FAA said in a statement Monday that “our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our workforce” and that it is working to improve the reliability of communications in the New York City area. But in the interest of safety, the FAA had to slow arrivals into Newark until they can find enough air traffic controllers to handle the workload. “We will keep the public updated as we work through these issues. The FAA will continue to be transparent with the public about the status of Newark and every airport,” it said, directing peopleto its website.",

    "title": "Meta wins $168 million verdict against spyware company NSO",
    "article_text": "Meta Platforms won a $168 million verdict against the Israeli surveillance firm NSO, the company said Tuesday, capping a six-year arm wrestling match between America’s biggest social networking platform and the world’s best known spyware company. Meta hadalready won a December rulingfinding that NSO had unlawfully exploited a bug in its messaging service WhatsApp to plant spy software on its users’ phones. On Tuesday, a jury in California ruled that NSO owed Meta $444,719 in compensatory damages — and $167.3 million in punitive damages, Meta said. “Today’s verdict in WhatsApp’s case is an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone,” Meta said in a statement. In its statement, NSO said it would “carefully examine the verdict’s details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal.” NSO, an Israeli firm that first drew global attention in 2016, has become “a poster child for the surveillance industry and their abuses and impunity,” said Natalia Krapiva, a senior lawyer with the human rights group Access Now. NSO has long argued that its software is used to track terrorists and pedophiles, but the firm has been implicated in abusive surveillance in countries around the world, includingSaudi Arabia,Spain,Mexico,Poland, andEl Salvador. WhatsApp’s lawsuit — which wasfiled in 2019and at one point made its way to theSupreme Court— has been closely followed both by NSO’s competitors in the surveillance technology space and by human rights advocates critical of the industry. Victims of state-backed hacking have struggled to hold suppliers of spy software accountable for what their customers do with their tools, while hacking firms have long worried that their products could draw legal sanctions. The WhatsApp verdict was a sign that both outcomes were possible, said Krapiva. “This is something that will hopefully show spyware companies that there will be consequences if you are careless, if you are brazen, and if you act in such a way as NSO did in these cases,” she said. Beyond sending a message to spyware merchants, the case also pulled back the curtain — ever so slightly — on the inner workings of NSO itself. The court heard about NSO’s140 person-strong research team, whose $50 million budget was in part devoted to exploiting security vulnerabilities in smartphones. An attorney for the companydisclosedthat its customers included Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico — rare on-the-record names from NSO’s closely guarded client list. Much about the spyware company’s targets and clients remains unknown, in part because the firm refused to hand over evidence. In her December ruling, District Judge Phyllis Hamiltonaccused NSOof having “repeatedly failed to produce relevant discovery and failed to obey court orders regarding such discovery.” The Guardian newspaper reported last year that Israeli officials hadseized documents from NSOin an effort to prevent the files from making their way to U.S. court. “This whole case is shrouded in so much secrecy,”Hamilton saidduring the trial. “There’s so much that’s not known.”",

In the snapshot, Archie can be seen holding onto a deck railing as he stares into the distance to see the sun setting. “Our son. Our sun. Happy 6th birthday to Archie!” Meghan captioned her post. “Thank you for all of the love, prayers, and warm wishes for our sweet boy. He’s six! Where did the time go?” The mother of two continued her post and mentioned a party she recently threw for the birthday boy. “And for all of you who came to celebrate with us at his party last weekend, thank you for making his birthday so incredibly special ❤️,” she wrote. While Meghan opted not to show Archie’s face in the photo, that’s nothing new for the protective mother. The Duchess of Sussex has shared several photos of her children in recent months but blocked their faces from view. In one recent post, Meghan shared a photo of her husband holding Archie’s hand while walking with the couple’s daughterLilibet, who turns 4 in June, on his shoulders. Archie is also catching up on his mom when it comes to her height, as can be seen in one recent photo of the duchess in her garden. In the picture, Archie can be seen holding on to his mother’s leg while she holds his younger sister on her hip. Archie and Lilibet don’t appearin their mom’s new Netflix series,“With Love, Meghan,”but she does talk about them on multiple occasions. In one scene, she recalls how her son caught two trout for his family while fishing. “They loved it. It was very sweet,” she said, while saying they ended up eating the fish for dinner. Meghan also said both her children love the smell of the fruit preserves she makes. “I think my kids will now connect this to coming home from school and smelling the sweetness that wafts through the house when you are slow cooking fruit. There she is. Oh, mom’s making preserves again,” she said.",

    "title": "Why oil prices are falling, and what it means for the economy",
    "article_text": "Camila Domonoske A man stops to fill up his car at a gas station in Washington, D.C., in November. Gas prices have fallen this spring, despite the fact that they typically rise this time of year, largely because of lower oil prices. That saves drivers money and also brings down the costs of goods.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North Americahide caption President Trump promised that during his presidencygasoline prices would drop and U.S. oil production would boom. One of those things is happening. Prices at the pump have indeed gone down, largely because the price of crude oil has dropped by nearly 25% since the start of January. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, dropped from a peak of around $80 a barrel in mid-January to just under $60 today. But that's not because U.S. producers areopening the spigot. Indeed, prices are now low enough that, on average, U.S. producers cannot profitably drill new wells, according to thelatest survey datafrom the Dallas Federal Reserve. Here's a breakdown of the forces that are buffeting oil prices, and what it means for individuals and the economy. Sweeping tariffs have raised concerns that trade barriers could slow down the global economy. Oil demand is closely correlated with economic prosperity: When economies are booming, companies are opening factories, and people are buying things and going places, oil consumption climbs. When economies slump, so does oil demand. And although environmentalists say that oil consumption must drop if the world is to meet climate goals, demand is still expected to rise this year — even with a trade war. The question ishow much. Analysts at Rystad Energy, a research company, have said that a trade war extending through 2025 could halve the expected growth in Chinese oil demand. Rystad's global head of oil commodity markets, Mukesh Sahdev, wrote that the tariff situation is so atypical that comparing this year to last year \"has become largely irrelevant.\" Meanwhile, while there are concerns about a drop in oil demand, production is actually set to rise. The oil cartel OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, have made a series of announcements over the last few months, each increasing the group's oil production. Most recently, on May 3, some members of the oil cartel that had previously volunteered to cut their production announced that they would unwind some of those cuts. The news immediately sent the oil market downward; prices touched 4-year lows Monday before recovering. In a press release, OPEC+ emphasized that its decision is based on \"current healthy market fundamentals\" — essentially, pointing out that while fears about the future have led to falling oil prices, demand today remains unwavering. Analysts think there's more than that going on. OPEC+ member countries agree to production quotas; when everyone sticks to them, it keeps supply limited and prices high. Butdata showsthat some of the group's members have been exceeding those quotas. This is a recurring problem for OPEC+; each individual country has an incentive to produce more, even as the group as a whole benefits if they all produce less. Before the most recent OPEC+ gathering, analysts at Clearview Energy Partners predicted in a note that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC+, could urge the group to increase production and bring down prices \"in an effort to pressure OPEC+ member countries including Iraq and Kazakhstan to comply with quotas.\" And indeed, the group did order a production increase. Meanwhile, Trump has explicitly asked OPEC+ to produce more oil to bring down prices — although it's not clear what influence that may have had. A boon to consumers and a blow to producers Lower oil prices mean lower prices at the pump. Gasoline prices usually go up in the spring, but went down in April, and could fall further. That means more money in the pockets of American drivers. Lower fuel prices also lower the prices of goods in general, because it makes shipping cheaper. Pantheon Macroeconomics estimates that recent drops in oil prices will bring headline consumer prices down by about 0.3%, relative to where they would be otherwise. But Pantheon also estimates that this benefit will be canceled out — on a national level — by the hit to oil producers, who will cut spending and hiring, sending ripples through the economy. The U.S. is the largest oil producer in the world. And while companies in the U.S. are not party to OPEC+ negotiations, they are very much affected by OPEC+ decisions. The combination of tariffs and OPEC+ production hikes has brought prices low enough to hamper U.S. production. In fact, U.S. oil producer Diamondbacktold investors this weekthat \"it is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter.\" This runs counter to Trump's vision of an expanding U.S. oil industry, summed up by his oft-repeated phrase: \"Drill, baby, drill.\" That's a tension that's been at the heart of the president's energy policy all along. The low prices he's promised consumers and the boom he's promised oil companies are simply incompatible. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Hegseth says he's a change agent at DoD. But details are scarce",
    "article_text": "Tom Bowman The Pentagon in Arlington, Va., is seen from above.Jen Golbeck/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Imageshide caption Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethhas announced he will trim the number of senior admirals and generals and also transform the Army to focus on homeland defense and deter China. But with both efforts, there's little detail, only a pledge to remove redundant military structure and streamline leadership through the cuts to the number of senior officers. And with the Army? Getting rid of \"outdated\" programs and spending more on long-range missiles, missile defense, as well as cyber, electronic warfare and counter-space capabilities. Hegseth this week directed the Pentagon to reduce the number of four-star admirals and generals by a minimum of 20 percent, while also cutting the number of general officers in the National Guard by the same percentage. \"Through these measures, we will uphold our position as the most lethal fighting force in the world, achieving peace through strength and ensuring greater efficiency, innovation and preparedness for any challenge that lies ahead,\" he wrote. There are now more than 800 active duty generals and admirals, a number that has increased during the last five decades. From 1965 to 2023, the number of generals and admirals increased by 31 percent, according to areport last yearby the Congressional Research Service. \"We shouldn't have any more than we need,\" said Greg Williams, director of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO). Still, as far as Hegseth's memo, \"There's not a lot of detail. The half-page memo doesn't articulate a timeline.\" POGO has been writing about the steady increase in the number of admirals and generals since the 1980s, laying out the number of all officers to enlisted personnel. Inone report, they pointed out: In 1939, there was one officer for every 11.7 enlisted men. In 1986, there was one officer for each 5.9 enlisted men. Between 1965 and 2023, the percentage of generals and admirals increased by 31 percent. The Congressional Research Service said while some argue the increased proportion of generals and admirals is \"wasteful,\" others counter that the increases are more linked to the military's greater emphasis on working collectively with other services and allies, along with management, budgeting and program requirements, as well as the use of automated, highly lethal weapons systems that may require fewer personnel. Williams says one concern is if the cuts in the number of admirals and generals will amount to a \"partisan litmus test\" to remove those seen as disloyal or those who the Trump Administration claims got their jobs by their race or gender. Hegseth firedJoint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown, the second African American to hold the job, questioning in his bookThe War on Warriorswhether Brown got the job by merit or his race. Hegseth also fired Adm. Lisa Franchetti, thefirst woman to hold the Navy's top uniformed job. In both cases, no explanation was given for their removal. \"Secretary Hegseth has shown an eagerness to dismiss military leaders without cause,\" said Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee in a statement. \"And I will be skeptical of the rationale for these plans until he explains them before the Armed Services Committee.\" Reed said personnel decisions \"should be based on facts and analysis and not arbitrary percentages.\" And he worried that eliminating positions of experienced officers without such analysis \"would not create 'efficiency' in the military – it could cripple it.\" Meanwhile, last week Hegseth sentanother memothat centered on transforming the Army. \"I am directing the Secretary of the Army to implement a comprehensive transformation strategy, streamline its force structure, eliminate wasteful spending, reform the acquisition process, modernize inefficient defense contracts, and overcome parochial interests to rebuild our Army, restore the warrior ethos, and reestablish deterrence,\" Hegseth wrote. But Hegseth was directing the Army to take on a plan that had already been in the works before his arrival, said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the Army plan. The plan calls for the fielding of long-range missiles capable of striking moving land and maritime targets by 2027. That's the year officials say that China will have the military capability to invade Taiwan. The plan also calls for the Army to field drones in every division by the end of 2026, as well as equipment that can counter enemy drones. More recently, the Army already has been focusing on how to purchase more drones, and deal with the threat of enemy drones. Last fall,NPR went on an Army training missionto Louisiana, where soldiers and an opposition force played a cat and mouse game with drones. At the same time, the Army plan calls for scrapping outdated drones as well as what it deems obsolete or redundant, including excess ground vehicles such as Humvees and some manned aircraft. As far as cuts, the plan calls on the Army to \"divest outdated formations,\" including armor and aviation units through the active force as well as the Guard and Reserve. Those units have not been named but once they are it will likely incur the wrath of lawmakers – who prize having such units in their states. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Andrew Limbong On Tuesday, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on President Trump's attempt to dismantle the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Above, the building that houses the offices of the IMLS in Washington, D.C.Jacquelyn Martin/APhide caption A federal judge has halted President Trump's attempt to eliminate theInstitute of Museum and Library Services– the agency which provides federal funding to libraries and museums across the country. On March 14, Trump issued an executive order calling for the elimination \"to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,\" of seven government entities, including the IMLS. In response, attorneys general from 21 states sued the president to stop him from dismantling three of those agencies – the IMLS, the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. District court Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who was nominated to the court by President Obama in 2011, issued an injunction on the EO Tuesday, stating that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act. \"It also disregards the fundamental constitutional role of each of the branches of our federal government; specifically, it ignores the unshakable principles that Congress makes the law and appropriates funds, and the Executive implements the law Congress enacted and spends the funds Congress appropriated,\" McConnell wrote. Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha called the preliminary injunction a \"win for the public interest\" in a statement Tuesday. \"When the Trump Administration attempts to dismantle these agencies, it is making a targeted, concerted effort to prohibit everyday people from accessing their full potential.\" NPR has reached out to lawyers from the Trump administration, but has yet to hear back. The IMLS was established by Congress in 1996. It is the main source of federal funding for public libraries. Through itsGrants to Statesprogram, it particularlyhelps small and rural librariesprovide services for its patrons. In 2024 the IMLS budget was $294 million. Shortly after President Trump issued his EO, he installed Keith E. Sonderling as the IMLS's new acting director. And on March 31, the agency's employees were put onadministrative leavewith pay for up to 90 days. Some states also had their grants rescinded, while others were left in limbo with no one staffed at the agency to process grants. There is currently a separate lawsuit against President Trump to stop the dismantling of IMLS, coming from the American Library Association and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the largest union representing museum and library workers.

Data loss has made it impossible to continue operation,\" a notice on the site's homepage read on Monday. \"We will not be relaunching. Any website claiming this is fake. This domain will eventually expire and we are not responsible for future use,\" the page said, adding that the message would be removed in about a week. The website was popular for allowing users to upload nonconsensual, digitally altered, explicit sexual content — particularly of celebrities, though there were several instances of nonpublic figures' likenesses being abused as well. The motivations behind these deepfake videos included sexual gratification, as well as the degradation and humiliation of its targets, according to a 2024 study by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, San Diego. \"As of November 2023, MrDeepFakes hosted 43K sexual deepfake videos depicting 3.8K individuals; these videos have been watched more than 1.5B times,\"the research paper says. Of those videos, 95.3% of the targets are celebrity women. The research also showed that despite purportedly banning such content, there were hundreds of documented instances of private individuals being targets and more than 1,000 videos with violent scenes depicting rape and abuse. Federal regulators and other institutions have grappled with how to tamp down on this new frontier of disinformation. Last week, the U.S. House of Representativesvoted overwhelminglyin support of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which stands for: Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks. The act would establish strict penalties and fines for those who publish \"intimate visual depictions\" of people, both real and computer-generated, of adults or minors, without their consent or with harmful intent. It also would require websites that host such videos to establish a process for victims to have that content scrubbed n a timely manner. The bill passed the Senate earlier this year and has been sent to President Trump for his signature. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Ashley Lopez Frank Bisignano, President Trump's nominee to be commissioner of the Social Security Administration, testifies at his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on March 25.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption Ina 53-47 votealong party lines, the U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed the nomination of tech CEO Frank Bisignano to be the commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA). Bisignano, a donor to President Trump and the former CEO of payments technology company Fiserv, will lead the federal agency that runs programs providing retirement, survivor and disability benefits, as well as supplemental income for the very poor. Former commissioners and advocates for older and disabled Americans have raised serious concerns about proposed widespreadrestructuring and mass layoffsat the agency, which has a staff of more than 55,000 employees and serves more than 73 million Americans. Those advocates say changes like new requirements for beneficiaries, regional office closures, cuts to overtime pay and plans to cut 7,000 jobs from the agency will lead to longer wait times for services for millions of Americans. Democrats in the Senate have also raised concerns about Bisignano's alleged communication with members of billionaire Elon Musk's team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,accusedBisignano of lying \"about his actions and communications with DOGE and the Social Security Administration prior to his hearing.\" During Bisignano's confirmation hearing before the Finance Committee, Wyden said a whistleblower told his office that the nominee \"personally intervened to get DOGE officials installed … and got basically approved in the middle of the night as a result of [Bisignano's] insistence.\" Bisignano denied multiple timesduring the hearingthat he has been in contact with leaders at the Social Security Administration, as well as DOGE. \"I was not involved in onboarding anybody in the middle of the night,\" he said. Former and former SSAemployeeshavesaidthat the agency's recent problems stem from DOGE's involvement in the agency. On April 2, a group of disability advocatesfiled a federal lawsuitagainst SSA leaders, Musk and DOGE. In the lawsuit, they say agency leaders, \"under the direction of Elon Musk and DOGE\" have \"systematically dismantled, and continue to dismantle, the core functions of SSA, abandoning millions of Americans to poverty and indignity.\" On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama,deniedthe group's request to block the Trump administration's proposed changes at the agency. In his ruling, he said the plaintiffs in the case \"have not carried their burden to demonstrate irreparable harm.\" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said in a statement during the Senate's consideration of the nomination that \"Social Security needs a commissioner whose loyalty is to beneficiaries, not Elon Musk.\" She said Bisignano is not that person. \"Bisignano describes himself as 'a DOGE person,'\" Altman said. \"That's something he has in common with the current acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, who has slashed staff and services at the direction of Elon Musk's DOGE. … He is not only unqualified, with no expertise regarding this vital program — he is dangerous to it.\" During his hearing, Bisignano told senators that he thinks the issues plaguing the agency right now stem from the interim commissioner, Dudek, who has been working closely with Musk's team, not the DOGE team itself. \"We have somebody in the acting role and you hear him in the papers every day,\" Bisignano said. \"I don't know if this is a DOGE issue. I think we have a leadership issue, and that's why I'm hopeful, if I'm to be confirmed, that I will be in charge of the agency.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Supreme Court upholds Trump's ban on transgender military members while appeals continue",
    "article_text": "By Nina Totenberg , Christina Gatti The Supreme CourtAndrew Harnik/Getty Images North Americahide caption The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed the Trump administration to begin executing its ban on transgender military service members, at least for now. The justices blocked a lower court order that temporarily halted the ban's enforcement. The court's three liberals said they would have denied the application. Shortly after President Trump was sworn in for the second time, he signed an executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. The Defense Department promptly barred transgender individuals from enlisting and discharged active duty soldiers as well. The new policy mimics a previous transgender military ban established during the first Trump Administration. The Supreme Court allowed that controversial Trump policy to remain in place in 2019, but it was reversed by President Biden shortly after he took office. This time, however, by discharging active duty transgender service members in addition to banning their enlistment, the policy goes further than the policy enacted during the first Trump administration. The justification for the ban has also changed. Rather than explicitly banning all transgender service members from the military, the Defense Department listed \"gender dysphoria\"-- the \"marked incongruence\" between a person's experienced gender and their gender assigned at birth--on its list of medical conditions that disqualify people from military service. According to the Pentagon, about 0.2% of the U.S. military members experience gender dysphoria. The challenge to the ban was brought by a group of current and aspiring transgender service members, including lead plaintiff Emily Schilling, a Navy pilot who has flown more than 60 combat missions over her nearly two decades of service. The group argued that the ban denied them their constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The government countered that because the Pentagon's policies were directed at those with gender dysphoria as a \"medical condition,\" rather than targeting transgender individuals outright, the ban did not discriminate against anyone based on their transgender status. Judge Benjamin Settle, a George W. Bush appointee who serves in Washington state, rejected that argument. He called the policy \"a blanket prohibition on transgender service.\" And he temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing the policy while he considered the case further. Settle said the administration could not hide behind its assertion that banning those with gender dysphoria was any different than banning someone because they are transgender. \"Common sense\" showed that these were one in the same, he said. A federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to intervene, and the Trump administration then appealed to the Supreme Court, seeking reinstatement of the ban. In response, the service members contended that the ban is unconstitutional because it was motivated by hostility toward transgender people. In addition they cited studies previously conducted by the Defense Department and the military, indicating that transgender service members are not a threat to national security, a conclusion that they contend was echoed by four years of experience with transgender individuals in the military during the Biden administration. On  Tuesday, however,  the Supreme Court  ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing it to proceed with its anti-trans ban, at least for now.  The order  is a  strong indicator that the administration is ultimately likely to prevail. In a statement Tuesday, Lambda Legal and Human Rights Campaign, the groups that brought the lawsuit on behalf of the service members, called the \"ruling ... a devastating blow to transgender servicemembers.\" \"By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the Court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,\" the groups said in a statement.

    "title": "The company with the world’s largest aircraft now has a hypersonic rocket plane",
    "article_text": "\"Hypersonic systems are now pushing the envelope beyond what can be done by the human body.\" Stratolaunch has finally found a use for the world's largest airplane. Twice in the last five months, the company launched a hypersonic vehicle over the Pacific Ocean, accelerated it to more than five times the speed of sound, and autonomously landed at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Stratolaunch used the same vehicle for both flights. This is the first time anyone in the United States has flown a reusable hypersonic rocket plane since the last flight of the X-15,the iconic rocket-powered aircraftthat pushed the envelope of high-altitude, high-speed flight 60 years ago. Stratolaunch announced the results of its two most recent test flights Monday. In December and again in March, Stratolaunch's Talon-A2 rocket plane launched from the belly of an enormous carrier aircraft over the Pacific Ocean and flew several hundred miles to Vandenberg, a military spaceport about 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles. There, the aircraft touched down on a concrete runway that NASA and the Air Force once considered for Space Shuttle landings. Zachary Krevor, president and CEO of Stratolaunch, spoke with Ars on Monday afternoon. He said the Talon test vehicle advances the capability lost with the retirement of the X-15 by flying autonomously. Like the Talon-A, the X-15 released from a carrier jet and ignited a rocket engine to soar into the uppermost layers of the atmosphere. But the X-15 had a pilot in command, while the Talon-A flies on autopilot. \"Why the autonomous flight matters is because hypersonic systems are now pushing the envelope in terms of maneuvering capability, maneuvering beyond what can be done by the human body,\" Krevor said. \"Therefore, being able to perform flights with an autonomous, reusable, hypersonic testbed ensures that these flights are exploring the full envelope of capability that represents what's occurring in hypersonic system development today.\" Stratolaunch's Talon-A is a little smaller than a school bus, or about half the size of the X-15. Stratolaunch performed the two recent Talon-A test flights under contract with Leidos, a defense contractor tapped by the Pentagon to manage the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonics Test Bed (MACH-TB) program for the Defense Department's Test Resource Management Center and Naval Surface Warfare Center. \"Demonstrating the reuse of fully recoverable hypersonic test vehicles is an important milestone for MACH-TB,\" said George Rumford, director of the Test Resource Management Center, in a statement. \"Lessons learned from this test campaign will help us reduce vehicle turnaround time from months down to weeks.\" Krevor said Talon-A carried multiple experiments on each mission but did not offer any details about the nature of the payloads, citing proprietary reasons and customer agreements. \"We cannot disclose the nature of those payloads, other than to say typical materials, instrumentation, sensors, etc.,\" he said. \"The customers were thrilled with their ability to recover the payloads shortly after landing.\" Stratolaunch completed the first powered flight of a Talon-A vehicle last year, when the rocket plane launched over the Pacific Ocean and fired its liquid-fueled Hadley engine—produced by Ursa Major—for about 200 seconds. The Talon-A1 vehicle accelerated to just shy of hypersonic speed, then fell into the sea as planned and was not recovered. That set the stage for Talon-A2's first flight in December. Military officials previously stated they set up the MACH-TB program to enable more frequent flight testing of hypersonic weapon technologies, including communication, navigation, guidance, sensors, and seekers. Stratolaunch aims for monthly flights of the Talon-A rocket plane by the end of the year and eventually wants to ramp up to weekly flights. \"These flights are setting the stage now to increase the cadence of hypersonic flight testing in this country,\" Krevor said. \"The ability to have a fully reusable hypersonic flight architecture enables a very high cadence of flight along with a lot of responsiveness. The DoD can call Stratolaunch if there's a priority program, and we can have a hypersonic flight next week, assuming the readiness of all the other technologies and payloads.\" Pentagon officials in 2022 set a goal of growing US capacity for hypersonic testing from 12 to 50 flight tests per year. Krevor believes Stratolaunch will play a key part in making that happen. So, why is hypersonic flight testing important? The Pentagon seeks to close what it views as a technological gap with China, which US officials acknowledge has become the world's leader in hypersonic missile development. Hypersonic weapons are more difficult than conventional missiles for aerial defense systems to detect, track, and destroy. Unlike ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons ride at the top of the atmosphere, enhancing their maneuverability and ability to evade interceptors. Hypersonic flight is an unforgiving environment. Temperatures outside the Talon-A vehicle can reach up to 2,000° Fahrenheit (1,100° Celsius) as the plane plows through air molecules, Krevor said. He declined to disclose the duration, top speed, and maximum altitude of the December and March test flights but said the rocket plane performed a series of \"high-G\" maneuvers on the journey from its drop location to Vandenberg. Engineers know less about the conditions of the hypersonic flight regime (in excess of Mach 5) than they do about lower-speed supersonic flight or spaceflight. The only vehicles that regularly fly at hypersonic speeds are missiles, rockets, and spacecraft reentering the atmosphere. They spend just a short time flying in the hypersonic environment as they transition to and from space. There are two things you should know about hypersonic missiles. First, rockets have flown at hypersonic speedssince 1949, so when officials talk about hypersonic missiles, they are referring to vehicles that operate in the hypersonic flight environment, instead of just transiting through it. Second, hypersonic vehicles come in a couple of variations. One is a glide vehicle, which is accelerated by a conventional rocket to hypersonic speed, then steers itself toward its destination or target using aerodynamic forces. The other is a cruiser that can sustain itself in hypersonic flight using exotic propulsion, such as scramjet engines. The military recently tested anintermediate-range hypersonic weapon, known by the Army as Dark Eagle and by the Navy as Conventional Prompt Strike, using the glide vehicle architecture. The Army's version could be operational later this year. Meanwhile, the Air Force is working on a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile, but it likely won't be ready for combat for a few more years. Not only must a vehicle operate in the extreme hypersonic flight regime, but any operational hypersonic weapon must be \"affordable\" and \"manufactured at high rate,\" two Pentagon officials wrote in prepared testimony to the House Armed Services Committee last year. \"Our goal is to enable the nation’s industrial base to manufacture hypersonic systems at a cost comparable to traditional weapon systems and at the capacity necessary to achieve a decisive advantage for the warfighter on the battlefield,\" the officials wrote. The Pentagon has spent about $12 billion on hypersonic weapons development and testing since 2018. None of the weapons are operational yet. All of these initiatives aim to match China's hypersonic capabilities. US officials believe China's first hypersonic weapon, using the glide vehicle architecture, became operational in 2019. Russia's government claimed it deployed a hypersonic weapon named Avangard the same year. China began testing a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile in 2018. The Pentagon's emphasis on hypersonic weapons is relatively new. After the X-15's final flight in 1968, the government lacked any major hypersonic flight test programs for several decades. NASA flew the autonomous X-43 test vehicle to hypersonic speed two times in 2004, and the Air Force demonstrated an air-breathing scramjet engine at Mach 5.1 with the X-51 Waverider aircraft in 2013. While some of the X-43 and X-51 test flights failed, they provided early-stage data on hypersonic propulsion systems that could power high-speed aircraft and missiles. But these were expensive government-led programs. Together, they cost nearly $1 billion in 2025 dollars, with only a handful of flight tests to show for it. The military now wants to lean heavier on commercial industry. Since its founding 14 years ago, Stratolaunch has pivoted its mission from the airborne launch of satellites to hypersonic testing. Stratolaunch was one of the first US launch companies to capitalize on the US military's growing interest in hypersonic technology. Rocket Lab now flies a suborbital version of its Electron satellite launcher to carry hypersonic experiments. ABL Space Systems, now known as Long Wall, last year announced it was walking away from the space launch business entirely to focus on hypersonic testing. The military's MACH-TB program offers a lucrative source of revenue for these rocket companies. Through its subsidiary Dynetics, the defense contractor Leidos manages the first phase of the MACH-TB program, which aims to develop and demonstrate commercial hypersonic test vehicles. In January, the Pentagon awarded a nearly $1.5 billion contract to Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for MACH-TB 2.0, which will transition the program from flight demonstrations to hypersonic test services. Stratolaunch and Rocket Lab will launch hypersonic experiments under MACH-TB 2.0, while a range of government, commercial, and academic institutions will develop the materials and technologies to be tested. Quilty Space, a space industry research firm, estimates the market for hypersonic testing is worth between $6 billion and $7 billion. It has taken a long time for Stratolaunch to find its footing. At one time, Stratolaunch partnered with SpaceX to use an air-launched version of the Falcon 9 rocket to deliver satellites to orbit. When that partnership fell through, Stratolaunch worked with Orbital Sciences, now part of Northrop Grumman, to design an air-launched rocket. Stratolaunch's founder, Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen, died in 2018, putting the company's future in doubt. Stratolaunch flew its huge carrier aircraft, namedRoc, for the first time in April 2019 but ceased operations the following month. Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm, purchased Stratolaunch from Allen's heirs later that year and redirected the company's mission from space launch to hypersonic flight testing. Through it all, Stratolaunch continued flyingRoc, a twin-fuselage airplane with a wingspan of 385 feet (117 meters). For a time, it appearedRocmight share a fate with Howard Hughes' \"Spruce Goose\" flying boat, which held the record as the airplane with the widest wingspan, untilRoc(officially designated the Scaled Composites Model 351) took off for the first time in 2019. The Spruce Goose flew just once after its business prospects faded in the aftermath of World War II. Now, the Pentagon's hunger for hypersonic weapons seems likely to feed Stratolaunch's coffers for some time to come. The company is building a second rocket plane, Talon-A3, scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of this year. It will launch from a Boeing 747 carrier aircraft that Stratolaunch acquired from Virgin Orbit after it went bankrupt in 2023. The longer range of the 747 will allow Stratolaunch to stage hypersonic tests from other locations beyond the West Coast.

    "title": "Trump and DOJ try to spring former county clerk Tina Peters from prison",
    "article_text": "Trump directs DOJ to help secure release of Peters from Colorado prison. President Donald Trump is demanding the release of Tina Peters, a former election official who parroted Trump's 2020 election conspiracy theories and is serving nine years in prison for compromising the security of election equipment. In aposton Truth Social last night, Trump wrote that \"Radical Left Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser ignores Illegals committing Violent Crimes like Rape and Murder in his State and, instead, jailed Tina Peters, a 69-year-old Gold Star mother who worked to expose and document Democrat Election Fraud. Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment.\" Trump said he is \"directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action to help secure the release of this 'hostage' being held in a Colorado prison by the Democrats, for political reasons.\" The former Mesa County clerk wasindicted in March 2022on charges related to the leak of voting-system BIOS passwords and other confidential information. Peters was convicted in August 2024 and latersentencedin a Colorado state court. \"Your lies are well-documented and these convictions are serious,\" 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barretttold Petersat her October 2024 sentencing. \"I am convinced you would do it all over again. You are as defiant a defendant as this court has ever seen.\" After Peters' August 2024 conviction, Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswoldsaidthat \"Tina Peters willfully compromised her own election equipment trying to prove Trump's big lie.\" Peters appealed her conviction in a Colorado appeals court and separately sought relief in US District Court for the District of Colorado. Sheasked the federal courtto order her release on bond while the state court system handles her appeal and said her health has deteriorated while being incarcerated. Trump's Justice Department submitted afilingon Peters' behalf in March, saying the US has concerns about \"the exceptionally lengthy sentence imposed relative to the conduct at issue, the First Amendment implications of the trial court's October 2024 assertions relating to Ms. Peters, and whether Colorado's denial of bail pending appeal was arbitrary or unreasonable under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\" The DOJ urged the federal court to give \"prompt and careful consideration\" to Peters' petition and said the Peters case is being examined as part of a broader review of \"abuses of the criminal justice process.\" The DOJ said its \"review will include an evaluation of the State of Colorado's prosecution of Ms. Peters and, in particular, whether the case was 'oriented more toward inflicting political pain than toward pursuing actual justice or legitimate governmental objectives.'\" Weiserresponded in a March 11 filingthat the Trump administration's intervention \"appears to be a naked, political attempt to threaten or intimidate either this Court or the attorneys that prosecuted this matter,\" and that the US \"cites not a single fact to support its baseless allegations that there are any reasonable concerns about Ms. Peters' prosecution or sentence, or that the prosecution was politically motivated in any way.\" The Weiser filing continued: While serving as the Clerk and Recorder of Mesa County, Ms. Peters deceived county employees to obtain credentials that allowed an unauthorized person to access Mesa County's voting system after the 2020 election. A Mesa County jury convicted Ms. Peters of three counts of attempt to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, and one count each of: first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty, and failure to comply with requirements of the Secretary of State. Ms. Peters sought an appeal bond, which the trial court denied because Ms. Peters demonstrated repeatedly that she believed she was above the law—from deceiving county employees, to violating the State's rules governing its election systems, to appearing (with a camera crew) at a voting site in violation of a protection order issued by the trial court. At no point during the proceedings did Ms. Peters exhibit any indication that she understood the gravity of her criminal conduct. Instead, even after her conviction, she reaffirmed her position that her conduct was justified by her conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Weiser's brief said he is unaware of the US ever previously \"filing a statement in a habeas application challenging the State of Colorado's criminal proceedings.\" US Magistrate Judge Scott Varholak appears ready to dismiss some of Peters' claims because she hasn't exhausted potential remedies in state courts. Varholak yesterdaywrotethat Peters hasn't exhausted appeals for her claim \"that she was denied due process under the Fourteenth Amendment\" and her claim that \"she was denied the right to immunity under the Supremacy Cause and Privileges and Immunities Clause.\" By contrast, Varholak found that Peters has exhausted her claim that the denial of bond pending appeal violated her First Amendment right to free speech. This makes her complaint in federal court a \"mixed petition\" that contains both unexhausted and exhausted claims. A mixed petition would have to be dismissed in its entirety, but Varholak said Peters can continue in federal court by dropping the unexhausted claims and going forward with the exhausted one. Doing so \"likely will bar her from seeking review of the unexhausted claims in a second or successive application,\" he noted. Peters can alternatively \"request a stay of this action while she attempts to exhaust the unexhausted claims in state court.\" Weiser's office said in astatement to Colorado Public Radiotoday that he will continue to fight the Trump administration. \"Tina Peters is in prison because of her own actions,\" Weiser's statement said. \"A grand jury indicted her and a trial jury found her guilty of breaking Colorado's criminal laws. No one is above the law. The Colorado Attorney General's Office will continue to defend this criminal conviction in post-conviction proceedings and on appeal. We are firm in pursuing justice for the people of the state of Colorado, protecting free and fair elections, and standing up for the rule of law.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump admin picks COVID critic to be top FDA vaccine regulator",
    "article_text": "Vinay Prasad is known for Twitter fights, comparing COVID responses to rise of Nazis. Oncologist Vinay Prasad, a divisive critic of COVID-19 responses, will be the next top vaccine regulator at the Food and Drug Administration, agency Commissioner Martin Makaryannounced on social media Tuesday. Prasad will head the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which is in charge of approving and regulating vaccines and other biologics products, such as gene therapies and blood products. \"Dr. Prasad brings the kind of scientific rigor, independence, and transparency we need at CBER—a significant step forward,\" Makary wrote on social media. Prasad, a professor in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, is perhaps best known for his combative social media postings and criticism of the mainstream medical community. He gained notoriety amid the COVID-19 pandemic for assailing public health responses, such as masking and vaccine mandates. In an October 2021 newsletter, titled \"How Democracy Ends,\" Prasad compared the country's pandemic responses to the rise of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. The post led New York University bioethicist Arthur Caplan to rebuke Prasad, writing in The Cancer Letter that the comparison is \"ludicrous, dangerous, and offensive,\" before adding \"imbecilic.\" Prasad has also criticized the FDA for approving COVID-19 booster vaccines. Last year, he accused his predecessor as the head of the CBER, Peter Marks, of being \"either incompetent or corrupt\" for allowing the approvals. More recently, Prasad has heaped praise on new FDA Commissioner Makary, while continuing to criticize Marks. In early March,Prasad called Makary\"smart, thoughtful, and disciplined\" and \"exactly what we need at the FDA.\" Later in the month, he continued to take shots at Marks, writing: \"You could replace Peter Marks with a bobblehead dollthat just stamps approval and you would have the same outcome at FDA with lower administrative fees. Maybe something DOGE should consider.\" The next week, Marks was pushed out of the FDA.In a resignation letter, Marks wrote: \"It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the [health] secretary, [anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.], but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.\" Ina subsequent interview with The Associated Press, Marks said he was forced out after he refused to give Kennedy's team unrestricted access to a critical vaccine safety database. Instead, Marks offered to give them the ability to read the database but not directly edit it. “Why wouldn’t we [give them full access]? Because frankly we don’t trust [them],” Marks told the AP. \"They’d write over it or erase the whole database.\" The AP reported that Marks used profanity in the comment, but did not indicate where. Since the removal of Marks, concern has only grown that the FDA, under Makary and Kennedy, will thwart vaccines and vaccine approvals. Last week, news broke that the FDA will imposenew clinical trial requirementsfor updating vaccines, whichmay make it impossible for COVID-19 boosters to be approvedin the tight timeframe needed for seasonal shots. Prasad supports the move, suggesting that treating seasonally updated COVID-19 booster doses the same way it treats seasonally updated flu shots is \"absurd,\" and calling those who disagree \"anti-vaccine, anti-science, and pro-corporate.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "FAA green-lights Starship launches every other week from Starbase",
    "article_text": "If SpaceX can clean up Starship's reliability issues, the company is free to fly. Although we are still waiting for SpaceX to signal when it will fly the Starship rocket again, the company got some good news from the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday. After a lengthy review, the federal agency agreed to allow SpaceX to substantially increase the number of annual launches from its Starbase launch site in South Texas. Previously, the company was limited to five launches, but now it will be able to conduct up to 25 Starship launches and landings during a calendar year. \"The FAA has determined that modifying SpaceX’s vehicle operator license supporting the increased launch and landing cadence of the Starship/Super Heavy launch vehicle would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment,\" states the document, known as aMitigated Finding of No Significant Impact. This finding was signed by Daniel P. Murray, executive director of the FAA's Office of Operational Safety. This ruling follows a draft finding issued six months ago that indicated this would be the final outcome. Among the impacts considered were increased trucking operations to deliver water and various propellants needed to support Starship launches. An earlier analysis by the FAA found that, to support a cadence of 25 launches a year, the vehicle presence on State Highway 4 to Boca Chica Beach will grow from an estimated 6,000 trucks a year to 23,771 trucks annually. Because of this, the FAA is requiring SpaceX to undertake dozens of mitigating actions. For example, for trucks, it has sought to reduce employee miles driven on the primary artery leading to the Starbase launch site. \"The Proposed Action would increase annual truck traffic, but mitigation measures like employee shuttles and limiting water truck deliveries to daytime hours would help reduce traffic impacts to wildlife,\" the FAA document states. The FAA considered all manner of fish, wildlife, and environmental impacts, as well as those that could affect resources for residents of Brownsville and other nearby communities. For example, the FAA found that the increased water use would not affect supplies available for the area's residents. \"While water use for launches would increase by 10.27 million gallons annually, this represents only 0.1% of the City of Brownsville’s 2018 usage and remains well within capacity,\" the document states. Although the new finding permits SpaceX to significantly increase its flight rate from South Texas, the company still has work to do before it can fly Starship again. The company's engineers are still working to get the massive rocket back to flight after its eighth mission broke apart off the coast of Florida on March 6. This was the second time, in two consecutive missions, that the Starship upper stage failed during its initial phase of flight. The FAA is still investigating this mishap and has not yet issued a launch license for a ninth test flight. After two consecutive failures, there will be a lot riding on the next test flight of Starship. It will also be the first time the company attempts to fly a first stage of the rocket for a second time. The stage designated for the upcoming test flight, Super Heavy \"Booster 14,\" flew successfully on the rocket's seventh test flight in January 2025. The upper stage, \"Ship 35,\" has undergone test firings at Starbase, but there may have been some issues during this process. SpaceX has not definitively said the ship is ready to fly. However,according to some sources, if additional testing of this upper stage goes well, Starship could launch as early as May 19. This date is also supported by a notice to mariners, but it should be taken as notional rather than something to be confident in.

    "title": "Apps like Kindle are already taking advantage of court-mandated iOS App Store changes",
    "article_text": "Epic v. Applelitigation ushers in minor but user-friendly changes. Last week, a federal judgeruledthat Apple was in \"willful violation\" of a court injunction that required the company to refrain from \"anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing\" in its tightly controlled iOS App Store. Part of theongoing litigationbetween Epic Games and Apple, the injunction specifically forbade Apple from \"denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct purchasers to, other purchasing mechanisms.\" Following the ruling, Apple said it would comply with the court's injunction while the company continued to appeal the decision. The day after the ruling was handed down, Apple altered several of itsApp Review Guidelinesto grant developers permission to do things they hadn't been allowed to do before. As summarized in an email to developers,reported by MacRumors: 3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited from including buttons, external links, or other calls to action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned by others. 3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition on an app including buttons, external links, or other calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do so. 3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the United States storefront. 3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required for apps on the United States storefront to include buttons, external links, or other calls to action. We're already beginning to see new versions of apps that take advantage of these changes. Case in point: Amazon's Kindle app for iPhones and iPads, which from its original launch in 2009 up until yesterday wouldn't actually let anyone buy books in the app. Users instead needed to navigate on their own to Amazon's store in Safari or on their PC and Mac and buy the books they wanted, at which point the books would be available in the Kindle app. As of an update released today, the iOS app still doesn't allow books to be purchased directly in the app, but you can search Amazon's virtual bookstore inside the app and tap a new \"Get Book\" button that automatically pops you over to Amazon.com in your phone or tablet's default browser. This is not as convenient for users as allowing them to purchase digital goods or services directly in the app, but it does make things a lot more friendly for users of apps whose developers don't want to pay Apple a cut. Apple's position on its App Store commissions has generally been, to write a high-level summary, that these third-party app developers benefit from the size and reach of Apple's platform, the work Apple does to maintain the App Store and to make apps discoverable, and Apple's payment processing services, among other benefits. Even when it complied with a court order to allow third-party developers to use alternate payment processors in their apps, Apple stillinsisted on a 12 to 27 percent cut(rather than the usual 15 to 30 percent) to cover these other less-tangible benefits of offering apps and services on Apple's devices. (Apple's method of complying with that ruling, including onerous filing requirements for developers who used third-party payment services, was one of many things Judge Gonzalez criticized Apple for in last week's ruling.) Apple is appealing last week's ruling, and it may well succeed in the end, giving the company the ability to roll back these rule changes and once again force developers to either use Apple's in-app payments or force users to buy goods and services externally. But even if this change is only temporary, it still creates new potential PR headaches for Apple. That's because, from 2009 until yesterday, the lack of simple user-friendly features like those redirect buttons was just the way these apps worked. It seemed silly, and it was a minor pain, but at this point, I'm so used to working around it that it doesn't even occur to me to try to buy Kindle books from within the Kindle app. But for as long as Amazon, Spotify, and other longtime critics of Apple can take advantage of the changed rules, they'll be helping to create a new baseline expectation: that apps that don't offer direct in-app purchases can still easily redirect you to a place where youcanmake those purchases. It may also lead to some apps that currentlydooffer in-app purchases to change that to a redirect button instead to get around giving Apple a cut of their revenue. If Apple wins the appeal, this puts the company in a position oftaking something awayfrom developers and users, rather than preserving the status quo.Loss aversionamong Apple's users could result in a fresh wave of user complaints and negative coverage, even though this \"new\" situation would be the same as it was in the very recent past, and Apple would have to weigh any potential blowback against whatever revenue it earns from locking developers into its own in-app purchasing system.

    "title": "2025 Alfa Romeo Tonale Turbo review: Italian charm that cuts both ways",
    "article_text": "Lighter and cheaper than the PHEV, engaging to drive—some rough edges, though. They say that with age comes wisdom, so it should come as no surprise that on the eve of Alfa Romeo’s 115th anniversary, the company that originally made its name competing in endurance races like the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia with flame-spitting sportscars is currently looking to increase its market share with a sensible, high-riding crossover. Produced in Stellantis’ Pomigliano d'Arco assembly plant near Naples, Italy, alongside its mechanical twin,the Dodge Hornet, theTonale plug-in hybridintroduced last year helped the Italian automaker find a foothold at a time when many of the auto conglomerate’s brands have been struggling. Now, a non-hybrid version of Alfa’s answer to models like the BMW X1 and Audi Q3 has joined the fray, sporting turbocharged power, standard all-wheel drive, and the same sharp styling at a significantly lower base price. But old habits die hard, and as I discovered over the course of a few days with the latest iteration of the Tonale, even Alfa Romeo’s most pragmatic offerings have their fair share of quirks. The new base model comes with a double overhead-cam 2.0 L inline four-cylinder engine producing 268 hp (200 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm) of torque. The turbocharged mill is paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission and an all-wheel drive system that can send up to 50 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels. While those numbers are down a bit compared to the Tonale Hybrid, at 3,715 lbs (1,685 kg), the 2.0 L Turbo is more than 400 lbs (181 kg) lighter than the PHEV model. The 2.0 L Turbo offers more precise handling as a result, while its mid-five-second sprint to 60 mph (98 km/h) is similar to the hybrid’s, despite the latter’s power advantage. EPA fuel economy figures of 21 mpg city (11.2 L/100 km), 29 mpg highway (8.11 L/100 km), and 24 mpg combined (9.8 L/100 km) indicate that the 2.0 L Turbo is thirstier, though. On a drive from LA to Palm Springs and back—which included a bit of canyon driving along the way—I saw an average of about 26 mpg (9 L/100 km). Lengthy stints behind the wheel have a way of revealing things about a car that might not be as obvious during a quick jaunt around town and some spirited driving out in the hills. For example, I was surprised to discover that even with the driver’s seat in its lowest position, there’s limited headroom for folks over 6 feet, 3 inches (1.9 m). My tester had a power moonroof, and skipping this extra could win you back some space, but I also never landed on a seating position I was entirely happy with. I think this has to do with the limited range of adjustability offered by the steering column, which essentially forces you to make your seat adjustments based on the column’s position rather than the other way around. Steering column aside, the cabin is a nice place to do the business of driving. Customizable ambient lighting and big aluminum shift paddles (which come as part of the $2,000 Premium Package and $1,000 Veloce Package, respectively) help give the interior a premium vibe, while a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, a 10.25-inch Uconnect 5 touchscreen infotainment system with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, and a wireless charging pad are all standard equipment. Although there are a few low-rent touchpoints (like the flimsy shifter, for example), and despite the audio system stuttering on several occasions, the Tonale feels well put together overall and more upscale than most of its competitors in the segment. Around town, the Tonale 2.0 L offers a solid balance between taut reflexes and compliant ride quality, thanks in part to the dual-mode active dampers that come as part of the Veloce Package, and the cabin is well insulated against both road noise and the four-cylinder’s occasionally buzzy operation. It’s a plucky motor with plenty of passing power, though touchy tip-in throttle response results in more head toss in stop-and-go traffic than I’d prefer, even when adaptive cruise control is running the show. While it’s nice to see that this feature is standard equipment, the ACC system can be a bit overeager to close the gap between you and the car in front of you, and it has a bad habit of braking later than it should. This resulted in several panic stops where the adaptive cruise control’s behavior triggered the forward collision warning system despite the fact that I was plodding along at just 15 mph (24 km/h) stop-and-go traffic. Out in the canyons, I switched to the Dynamic drive mode, which sharpens the Tonale’s reflexes and adds more urgency to the proceedings. The dampers’ added stiffness in this mode cleaned up the crossover’s body control to a tangible degree, but the transmission’s ongoing search for more efficient gears was only alleviated by switching to manual mode and taking over control of the gearbox with the paddles. While the overall tuning is a bit softer than some enthusiasts will prefer, the Tonale’s performance is buoyed by a gutsy powerplant and the confident stopping power delivered by the four-piston Brembo brakes equipped up front. With a starting price of $36,495 ($48,130 as-tested, with destination fee), the Tonale 2.0 L Turbo is roughly $10,000 cheaper than its hybrid counterpart, and it also undercuts other European premium compact crossovers like the Mercedes-Benz GLA and BMW X1 by thousands. The Tonale’s extroverted character is also a nice change of pace in a segment filled with anonymity, and given the negligible compromise in straight-line performance, the lower curb weight, and the significant cost savings, I’d choose the 2.0 L Turbo over the PHEV model without hesitation. The Tonale 2.0 L Turbo’s biggest rival is arguably the Dodge Hornet GT, which offers a similar driving experience but starts at a base price that’s roughly $6,000 lower. The premium you’ll pay for the Tonale largely comes down to its Italian aesthetic and the sense of occasion that the Alfa Romeo name imparts. Those attributes may seem trivial at first glance, but one should never underestimate the value of style. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "New mainstream card has hardware upgrades but is still stuck with 8GB of RAM. Nvidia will release theGeForce RTX 5060on May 19 starting at $299, the company announced via press release today. The new card, a successor to popular past GPUs like the GTX 1060 and RTX 3060, will bring Nvidia's DLSS 4 and Multi Frame-Generation technology to budget-to-mainstream gaming builds—at least, itwouldif every single GPU launched by any company at any price wasn't instantly selling out these days. Nvidia announced a May release for the 5060 last month when it released the RTX 5060 Ti for $379 (8GB) and $429 (16GB). Prices for that card so far haven't beenasinflated as they have been for the RTX 5070 on up, but the cheapest ones you can currently get are still between $50 and $100 over that MSRP. Unless Nvidia and its partners have made dramatically more RTX 5060 cards than they've made of any other model so far, expect this card to carry a similar pricing premium for a while. Compared to the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 adds a few hundred extra CUDA cores and gets a big memory bandwidth increase thanks to the move from GDDR6 to GDDR7. But its utility at higher resolutions will continue to be limited by its 8GB of RAM, which is already becoming a problem for a handful of high-end games at 1440p and 4K. Regardless of its performance, the RTX 5060 will likely become a popular mainstream graphics card, just like its predecessors. Of the Steam Hardware Survey's top 10 GPUs, three are RTX xx60-series desktop GPUs (the 3060, 4060, and 2060); the laptop versions of the 4060 and 3060 are two of the others. If supply of the RTX 5060 is adequate and pricing isn't out of control, we'd expect it to shoot up these charts pretty quickly over the next few months.

Last month, Nintendo and its third-party partners revealed thatmanyof the \"physical\" games on the Switch 2 would be made availableonly as \"Digital Key Cards.\"Unlike traditional physical Switch games—which contain flash memory with the necessary data to play the game on the card itself—these key cards will simply enable the holder to download a copy of the game to their system and play that copy if and when the transferable key card is inserted in the system. Already, many players are thinking ahead to what this means for their ability to play Game Key Card releases well into the future. It's not hard to find potential Switch 2 owners publicly worrying about games\"disappear[ing] into the void\"or becoming \"effectively a worthless piece of plastic/e-waste\" when Nintendo eventually disables its Switch 2 game download servers. Some go even farther, calling a Game Key Cardan \"eighty dollar rental\"rather than a real game purchase. While these are valid long-term concerns, I think some players are underestimating the likely timeline for when Game Key Cards will become \"useless e-waste.\" As it stands, we already have an example of Nintendo supporting continued downloads of games purchased nearly two decades ago and counting. When Nintendo launched the Wii in November 2006, it also launched the Wii Virtual Consolewith 30 downloadable titlesranging fromSuper Mario 64toUrban Champion. And it may surprise you to learn that Virtual Console purchases made the day the Wii launched can still be redownloaded from Nintendo's servers to this day. I know it surprised me when Iread about itinvarious forum threadsin recent weeks. I've beenwritingaboutthe shutdownof the Wii's various online services for years, not to mentionthe high-profile shutdown of the 3DS and Wii U eShopsin 2023. By now, I figured that Nintendo had pulled the final plug on whatever aging server was letting Wii Virtual Console (andWiiWare) downloads limp along. True, Nintendo shut offnewdownloadable game purchases on the Wii in 2019, likely to avoid the financial and customer support hassles of providing payment services for a vanishingly small market of players still actively buying games on the Wii. But when it comes to downloading old purchases, the company'sofficial support sitestill says that \"as long as you are using the same Wii console you used to originally download the game, you will be able to re-download it should the game be lost or deleted.\" Sure enough, just yesterday, I was able to plug in my aging Wii U, flip over to Wii mode (which still containsmy recovered and transferred Virtual Console games licenses) and download fresh copies of games likeActraiserandBonk's Adventurelike it was still 2006 (the same goes for redownloading previous Wii U and 3DS game purchases on those consoles, by the way). When it comes to the longevity of a downloadable purchase, Nintendo now comes close to rivaling Steam, where players can still redownloadthe copy ofHalf-Life 2they purchased over 20 years ago. And while those Wii downloads are frustratingly tied to the original hardware used to make the purchase, the Switch 2's Game Key Cards ensure any future downloads will be easily portable to different hardware units. Keep in mind, too, that Nintendo has kept the game download servers for the Wii active even though it hasn'tsoldany new downloadable Wii games for roughly six years. At this point, any server hardware and bandwidth Nintendo is using to support Wii downloads is nothing but a financial loss for the company (unlike Steam, where Valve is at leaststill selling fresh copies ofHalf-Life 2to new generations of PC gamers). The fact that Nintendo is still willing to provide those downloads with no direct financial upside suggests good things about its future commitment to Game Key Cards. You could even argue that Nintendo ismorelikely to offer longer-term support for Game Key Card downloads sincebackward compatibility seems to be a priority for the Switch hardware line. If we presume that future Switch systems will remain backward compatible, we can probably also presume that Nintendo will want players on new hardware to still have access to their old Game Key Card purchases (or to be able to use Game Key Cards purchased on the secondhand market). There are no guarantees in life, of course, and nothing lasts forever. Nintendo will one day go out of business, at which point it seems unlikely that a Game Key Card will be able to download much of anything. Short of that, Nintendo could suffer a financial malady that makes download servers for legacy systems seem like an indulgence, or it could come under new management that doesn't see value in supporting decades-old purchases made for ancient consoles. As of this writing, though, Nintendo has kept its Wii game download servers active for 6,743 days and counting. If the Switch 2 Game Key Card servers last as long, that means those cards will still be fully functional through at least October 2043. I don't know what I will be doing with my life in 2043, but it's comforting and extremely plausible to imagine that the \"eighty dollar rental\" I made of a Switch 2 Game Key Card back in 2025 will still work as intended. Or, to put it another way, I think it's highly likely that I will become \"e-waste\" long before any Switch 2 Game Key Cards.

    "title": "Trump administration cuts off all future federal funding to Harvard",
    "article_text": "Odd letter ostensibly about funding asks Harvard \"why is there so much HATE?\" Theongoing warbetween the Trump administration and Harvard University has taken a new twist, with the government sending Harvard a letter that, amid what appears to be a stream-of-consciousness culture war rant, announces that the university will not be receiving any further research grants. The letter potentially suggests that Harvard could see funding restored by \"complying with long-settled Federal Law,\" butearlier demandsfrom the administration included conditions that went well beyond those required by law. The letter, sent by Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, makes it somewhat difficult to tell exactly what the government wants, because most of the text is a borderline deranged rant written in florid MAGA-ese. You don't have to go beyond the first paragraph to get a sense that this is less a setting of funding conditions than an airing of grievances: Instead of using these funds to advance the education of its students, Harvard is engaging in a systemic pattern of violating federal law. Where do many of these \"students\" come from, who are they, how do they get into Harvard, or even into our country—and why is there so much HATE? These are questions that must be answered, among many more, but the biggest question of all is, why will Harvard not give straightforward answers to the American public? Does Harvard have to answer these questions to get funding restored? It's unclear. From there, the letter changes topic so often that it gets difficult to remember that billions of dollars of funding to some of the world's most prominent researchers is at stake. On the first page alone, the letter complains that a math class Harvardset up to handle COVID-driven gapsin incoming students' math skills is a remedial course that shouldn't be needed, given the university's supposedly high standards. The resignation of Harvard's former president, as well as its faculty hires, also make appearances. (Said hires being compared to \"Hiring the captain of the Titanic to teach navigation.\") The first page closes with complaints that some of Harvard's leadership includes Democrats. The second page continues in kind, suggesting the university is engaging in fiscal mismanagement and accusing its diversity programs of being \"ugly racism,\" before finally getting to the point: The university should no longer seek federal grants and should figure out how to get by on its endowment. \"You have an approximately $53 Billion head start,\" the letter suggests, \"much of which was made possible by the fact that you are living within the walls of, and benefiting from, the prosperity secured by the United States of America and its free-market system you teach your students to despise.\" The letter wraps up by saying that the administration would have kept funding Harvard if it \"committed to complying with long-settled Federal law,\" seemingly unaware that the Supreme Court decision thatsettled the status of diversity programswas only issued in 2023. It is also seemingly unaware of its own earlier letter to Harvard, which demanded conditions that are not spelled out by federal law, such as government approval of faculty hiring in order to ensure \"viewpoint diversity.\" It's clear that this letter is not a good-faith attempt to resolve the ongoing fight. And, while the letter is written in a style that seems intended to rally the Trump faithful, it's pretty unlikely that many of them will both read it and cheer on its messages. Instead, it seems like the only purpose of the letter is to ratchet up the pressure on Harvard by increasing the threat it faces. The letter's style is presumably a product of a culture that only knows how to communicate this way. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Find my… bicycle?",
    "article_text": "Knog's Scout gives bikes a motion-sensitive alarm and Bluetooth tracking. We've reviewed somepretty expensive bikeshere at Ars, and one of the consistent concerns we see in the comments is the fear of theft. That's a widely shared fear, based on a whole bunch of videos that describe how to hide an AirTag tracker where a potential bike thief won't notice it. There are also a number of products available that will hold a hidden AirTag in a reflector, a bike bell, or the head tube. But Apple has also made it possible for third parties to plug their devices into its \"Find My\" system, and a company called Knog has made aBluetooth bike tracker called the Scoutthat does just that. The Scout goes well beyond tracking, though, providing a motion-sensitive alarm system that will alert you if anybody tries to move your bike. The Scout can be attached to the frame using the screw holes normally used for a water bottle holder. Security screws make it considerably more difficult to remove. Once there, it uses Apple's Find My network to keep the owner apprised of the bike's location (Android users need not apply at the moment). If you're leaving your bike in a high-risk location, you can also use Knog's phone application to set an alarm that will be triggered if the bike is moved. Externally, the scout is a nearly featureless flat plastic oval. Inside this water-resistant case are a number of key components: a rechargeable battery that Knog says will last two to six months when fully charged, Bluetooth hardware, an accelerometer, and a speaker. There's also a small rubber piece on one side that flips aside to reveal a USB-C charging port and two holes with recesses that are designed to protect the security screws that come with the Scout. The hardware itself weighs just 25 grams (less than an ounce), so it should be irrelevant to all but the most weight-conscious rider. All of this—the Scout itself, the security screws, a small screw driver to work them, plus a soft rubber cover—comes in a bit of ingeniously designed, recyclable cardboard packaging. The security screws have two small indentations on opposite sides of the screw head, meaning you need a screwdriver with a U-shaped business end of a specific width to turn them (see the photo above if this description isn't clear). While these tools aren't that difficult to obtain, they're sufficiently rare that they'll probably serve as an impediment for casual thieves and at least ensure the tracker will stay on the bike for a while if it's lifted by less casual thieves—though there's no guarantee that any thief wouldn't just take a hammer to it and wreck the electronics. To attach it to the frame, however, you may need to give up one of your water bottle spots. I tried to install three different plastic water bottle cages beneath the scout and, in each case, the scout stuck out in a way that would make it more difficult or impossible to fit a water bottle in. The alternative is to install the Scout beneath the water bottle cage, but in that case, the heads of the security screws stick out where they can simply be grabbed and turned with some pliers. Only one of my 30-year-old aluminum bottle holders had a recess that nicely fit the Scout. When installed this way, the Scout is nicely unobtrusive. And, of course, there's nothing stopping you from hiding it somewhere else on the bike, though it's considerably more bulky than an AirTag. And if you're indifferent to obtrusiveness, you could always stick the bright yellow cover on and let people who are aware of the product know your bike has theft protection. When the Scout is nestled in the recess of a water bottle cage, it's impossible to stick a USB-C charging cable into it, so you'd have to remove it to recharge it, which will add to the hassle. Otherwise, charging is as simple as getting the bike within a cable's length of a socket or laptop. Knog provides software that helps you pair your iPhone with the device. Once that's done, it can be added to the Find My system, where it will appear just like an AirTag. The process worked smoothly in my tests, and in an iOS-heavy suburban environment, there was never any problem knowing where the bike was. But what sets this device apart from an AirTag is its motion-sensing capabilities. If you're within Bluetooth range, the Knog application will let you turn on the alarm system and switch between audible and silent modes. In sound-on mode, moving the bike produced a series of very audible tones. In both audible and silent mode, my watch and phone immediately vibrated, with the phone continuing to make audible beeps until the alarm was disabled. You have to be within Bluetooth range to get these alerts, though, which is probably a severe limitation for people like bike commuters, who may work some distance from where their bike is parked. Given its piercing tones, it's a good thing that the alarm eventually shuts off on its own. When I triggered the alarm while my phone was out of Bluetooth range, however, bringing the phone back into range gave me no indication that the alarm had ever been triggered. That's not ideal, as there are many contexts where it would be good to know if someone had moved your bike or if the alarm had made a nuisance of itself. The Scout's nuisance potential is a product of its sensitivity. An accelerometer, not the GPS, triggers the alarm, so it will go off if the bike is simply lifted up and set down but not moved anywhere. If your bike ends up sitting in a crowded communal bike parking area, there's a good chance other cyclists will move it around enough to trigger the alarm. Depending on your parking situation, you (and anyone within hearing range of the bike parking) may have to deal with a lot of false alarms. So it's not a perfect protection system. Of course, the perfect protection system against bicycle theft doesn't exist; people who steal bikes have managed to stay ahead of every form of lock and device that has been thrown in their way so far. All you can really hope for is something that helps shift the odds in your favor a bit, and the Scout should do that. Its audible alarm will be enough to scare many potential thieves away, and the software can alert you to possible trouble if you happen to be within range. The tracking might help with recovery. And its presence alone may be enough to convince some would-be thieves to choose a different bike. All this should make it clear that the Scout does considerably more than an AirTag, and all of those extra features act to keep a theft from ever happening rather than making a post-theft recovery more likely. It's possible to find it for under $50.00, or about the price of two AirTags—if theft is a major concern, the extra features might make this worthwhile.

    "title": "Musk’s politics see Tesla sales collapse in Europe",
    "article_text": "Last month, Tesla sold just 512 cars in the UK and 885 cars in Germany. Tesla is in deep trouble in Europe. The electric vehicle maker, which once dominated EV sales in the region, is facing sales declines of more than 50 percent in France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and the UK. Sales in Germany weren't quite as bad—they fell by 46 percent in April, with slightly smaller decreases in Portugal and Spain. Only Italy and Norway saw any kind of sales growth. The headwinds were already looking unfavorable for Tesla even before CEO Elon Muskthrew his lot inwith Donald Trump and hisauthoritarian makeoverof the US government. A small and outdated product portfolio was already looking stale compared to the influx of EVs from Chinese brands and European automakers, but Musk's hard-right turn and the US government's ongoing antagonism toward the rest of the world has soured the brand entirely. And a recent styling refresh for the Model Y has failed to arrest the slide. The UK has been one of Tesla's biggest markets in Europe, and it's seeing something of an EV boom, with 8.1 percent more BEVs registered in April 2025 than the year before, even as overall car sales have dropped by 10.4 percent year on year. But Tesla's sales fell by 62 percent—the automaker registered just 512 cars all month. For context, 120,331 new cars were registered in the UKlast month, of which 24,558 were BEVs. In Germany, the overall car market fared much better, with new registrations decreasing by just 0.2 percent in April. Of those new cars, 45,535 were BEVs—a 53.5 percent increase year over year. In the context of those rising BEV sales, Tesla's 46 percent year on year decline should have alarm bells ringing. Some other European countries are smaller markets for Tesla but have seen even more significant sales declines. In Sweden, Tesla sales dropped 81 percent. In the Netherlands, sales were down 73.8 percent. In Denmark, sales fell by 67 percent, and in France, they fell by 59 percent. With a claimed annual capacity of 375,000 vehicles, Tesla's factory on the outskirts of Berlin seems likely to be underutilized for some time. In its Q1 financial report, Tesla said it has a global capacity of 2.35 million cars a year and sold1.8 million cars in 2024.

    "title": "Data centers say Trump’s crackdown on renewables bad for business, AI",
    "article_text": "Without renewables, it's nearly impossible to meet growing power demand from AI. The US data center industry has warned that the Trump administration’s crackdown on renewable energy could slow its growth and undermine Washington’s goal to win the global artificial intelligence race. Renewables have become a flashpoint since Donald Trump re-entered the White House, with his administration suspending clean energy developments on federal land, pausing federal loans, and last month canceling high-profile projects such as Equinor’s $5 billion Empire Wind site. For tech companies struggling to secure reliable energy supplies to power and train AI, a clampdown on renewables could create power bottlenecks, drive up costs, and push operators towards dirtier energy, experts said. Simon Ninan, senior vice-president at Hitachi Vantara, which builds equipment and infrastructure for data centers, said the Trump administration’s “antagonistic approach” towards renewable energy could make it “impossible to satisfy the data growth that’s happening.” “Strategically, the US could risk undermining its current pole position in the global AI race... China, on the other hand, has taken a proactive approach towards grid modernization and efficient power distribution.” Energy shortages could “result in cancellation or delays in data center build-outs or infrastructure upgrades,” he said. The Trump administration has warned that losing the AI race to China is a bigger threat to the world than global warming and has advocated increasing the use of fossil fuels to power them. But experts warn it will be difficult to meet surging demand without adding a lot more renewable energy capacity, which is faster and cheaper to deploy than building gas power plants. The assault on renewables has alarmed Democratic leaders in northeastern states, which are relying on the expansion of wind energy to meet future electricity demand. On Monday a coalition of Democratic attorneys-general from 17 states sued the Trump administration in an effort to block its attempt to end the development of wind energy. Data centers are expected to add 83.7 gigawatt of energy demand by 2030, equivalent to adding a new state the size of Texas to the grid, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. While many companies are investing in nuclear small modular reactor technologies, it may be years before they are operational. Credit:\n\n          \n          Financial Times “We’ve seen increased competition for green energy over the last couple of years,” said Nick Hertlein, a managing director at Stonepeak, an alternative investment firm specializing in infrastructure and real assets. “If US AI development is a priority, [policymakers] need to find ways to accommodate the data center industry’s growth.” While large-scale gas generation projects are being fast-tracked by major grid operators such as PJM, MISO, and ERCOT, this may come at the expense of cheaper sources such as renewables. Gas turbine suppliers such as Siemens and GE Vernova have warned lead times can stretch to 2029 for larger models. “If we can’t bring on new, lower-cost resources when demand is increasing, we’ll have to rely more and more on higher-cost resources,” said Rich Powell, chief executive of the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “We just need to flood the zone with new electricity as quickly as we can.” Although big participants in the technology industry may be able to lobby the administration to “loosen up” restrictions on new power sources, small to medium-sized players were in a “holding pattern” as they waited to see if permitting obstacles and tariffs on renewables equipment were lifted, said Ninan. “On average, [operators] are most likely going to try to find ways of absorbing additional costs and going to dirtier sources,” he said. Amazon, which is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally, said carbon-free energy must remain an important part of the energy mix to meet surging demand for power, keep costs down, and hit climate goals. “Renewable energy can often be less expensive than alternatives because there’s no fuel to purchase. Some of the purchasing agreements we have signed historically were ‘no brainers’ because they reduced our power costs,” said Kevin Miller, vice-president of Global Data Centers at Amazon Web Services. Efforts by state and local governments to stymie renewables could also hit the sector. In Texas—the third-largest US data center market after Virginia, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence—bills are being debated that increase regulation on solar and wind projects. “We have a huge opportunity in front of us with these data centers,” said Doug Lewin, president of Stoic Energy. “Virginia can only take so many, and you can build faster here, but any of these bills passing would kill that in the crib.” The renewables crackdown will make it harder for “hyperscale” data centers run by companies such as Equinix, Microsoft, Google, and Meta to offset their emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. “Demand [for renewables] has reached an all-time high,” said Christopher Wellise, sustainability vice-president at Equinix. “So when you couple that with the additional constraints, there could be some near to midterm challenges.” Additional reporting by Jamie Smyth. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "Lighter, cheaper Surface Laptop saves a little money but gives up a lot",
    "article_text": "$899 laptop looks fine, but the cost savings might not be worth it. Microsoft is releasing a pair of new Surface devices today, both models that undercut last year's Surface Laptop and Surface Pro on price but also take a pretty big step down in specs. One of the devices is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which we'vecovered in more detail here. The other is a new 13-inch Surface Laptop, whose specs and price straddle the narrow gap between the current seventh-generation Surface Laptop and the original price of the aging Surface Laptop Go 3. The new Surface Laptop starts at $899, and preorders open today. It will be available on May 20. The new laptop shares many specs in common with last year’s entry-level seventh-generation Surface Laptop, including an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM, and support for Windows 11’s expanded Copilot+ capabilities. It’s also smaller and lighter than the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop. But the CPU has eight cores instead of 10 or 12, the screen is smaller and lower resolution, and you’re more limited in your upgrade options; we’ve outlined the key differences in the table below. Microsoft plans to continue selling both the new 13-inch Surface Laptop and the older 13.8- and 15-inch Surface Laptops simultaneously, and the company doesn't plan to change the pricing for those older laptops at all. This leaves the new Laptop in a somewhat precarious position: just $100 cheaper than the flagship Surface Laptop, with a noticeable downgrade in screen size and resolution and a small downgrade in performance. It's superior to the old Surface Laptop Go 3—which Microsoft isn't totally discontinuing yet—but also more expensive than its former $799 starting price and a bit larger and heavier besides.Credit:\n\n          \n          Microsoft The laptop has two USB-C ports on the right side, seen here, and a USB-A port and headphone jack on the left. Surface Connect is gone. For those reasons, it seems like most individual buyers would still be better off going for the 13.8-inch Surface Laptop, with the new one only really making sense for companies buying these in bulk if the 13.8-inch Surface goes up in price or if the 13-inch Surface happens to be discounted and the 13.8-inch version isn't. The 13.8-inch Laptop is also obviously still the one you want if you want more than 16GB of RAM or 512GB of storage, or if you need more CPU and GPU speed. The new 13-inch Laptop has most of the same basic ports as the 13.8-inch version, just arranged slightly differently. You still get a pair of USB-C ports (both supporting 10 Gbps USB 3.2 speeds, rather than USB 4), one USB-A port, and a headphone jack, but the USB-A port and headphone jack are now on the left side of the laptop. As with the 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Connect port has been removed, so this is compatible with all existing USB-C accessories but none of the ones that use Microsoft's proprietary connector. The new Surface Laptop doesn't seem to regress on any major functional fronts—unlike the 12-inch Surface Pro, which throws out an 11-year-old keyboard fix that made the Surface Pro's keyboard cover much more stable and laptop-like—but it's still an odd refresh. But inflation, supply chain snarls, and the Trump administration's rapidly changing tariff plans have made pricing and availability harder to predict than they were a few years ago. Though PCs and smartphones are (currently) exempted from most tariffs, Microsoft did recentlyraise the prices of its years-old Xbox Series S and X consoles; it's possible these new Surface devices were originally designed to be budget models but that world events kept them from being as cheap as they otherwise might have been.

    "title": "Microsoft’s 12-inch Surface Pro is cheaper but unfixes a decade-old design problem",
    "article_text": "New Surface Pro undoes a key improvement first used in 2014's Surface Pro 3. Microsoft is introducing a pair of new Surface devices today, both aimed slightly down-market from the11th-generation Surface Pro tablet and 7th-generation Surface Laptopthat the company released last spring. One is a 13-inch Surface Laptop, which we'vecovered in more detail here. The second (and more notably changed) device is a new 12-inch Surface Pro tablet, which is the first significant design change we've seen in the Surface Pro lineup since thefirst ARM-based Surface Pro Xwas released in 2019. Preorders for both new Surface devices begin today, and they begin shipping on May 20. The 12-inch Surface Pro starts at $799, and the keyboard cover remains a separate purchase, available for $149. The 12-inch Surface Pro is a cheaper alternative to the $939-and-up 13-inch Surface Pro (which Microsoft is continuing to sell), and the smallest Surface Microsoft has tried since the10.5-inch underspecced Surface Go series. In addition to the smaller screen, the base model includes a bunch of other minor downgrades from the flagship 13-inch tablet, as outlined in the table below. But it's also nearly half a pound lighter, and its 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor should still deliver solid performance and compatibility with the extra Windows 11 features available on Copilot+ PCs. That Microsoft intends this partly as a midrange budget model is clear both from the basic specs and from the limits on how much this tablet can be upgraded. It starts with 16GB of RAM, which is generous enough for most people, but high-end users can't get more than that. The 10- and 12-core Snapdragon X Plus and Elite chips aren't available. And storage is limited to either 256GB or 512GB based on the UFS standard rather than the removable NVMe SSDs that the larger Surface tablet uses. The design looks pretty similar to the existing 13-inch Surface Pro overall but with some significant tweaks. The 12-inch Surface still supports the Slim Pen and other Surface styluses, but there's now a magnet on the back of the tablet that the pen can be stuck to for storage, rather than a divot on the keyboard. The tablet still has a pair of USB-C ports, each of which supports 10 Gbps USB 3.2 speeds rather than full USB 4. But the Surface Connect port is gone, and because it's physically smaller, the new Surface Pro isn't compatible with any of the keyboard accessories made for past Surface Pro or Surface Go tablets. But the biggest downgrade is a fundamental change to the tablet's design. The 12-inch Surface Pro's keyboard case (still a separate purchase, frustratingly) lies flat against whatever you have the tablet sitting on, whether that's a desk, a table, or your lap. If the surface your Surface is resting on is level and stable, that's mostly fine. If the surface is soft or uneven, like a lap or a couch, this introduces extra instability and floppiness, and your keyboard will wobble around more as you type on it. This is the same approach used as the first two generations of Surface Pro (and the ill-starred Surface RT), and it was also a perennial complaint about those designs from reviewers and users. In 2014, the Surface Pro 3 tweaked the keyboard design so that the top of it would fold flat against the bottom of the device's screen, giving the keyboard some rigidity and stability that persisted no matter what it was resting on. All subsequent Surface keyboards, including those for the tiny 10.5-inch Surface Go, used the same design, until this one. The iPad keyboard case I use—a Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Folio with a built-in trackpad and kickstand—also uses the flop-against-the-table design, which hasn't been the end of the world. But solving this problem was a major turning point in the evolution of the Surface Pro, and it's frustrating to see that signature improvement undone here.

    "title": "Tuesday Telescope: After spacewalking, an astronaut strikes lightning",
    "article_text": "\"I am so amazed by the view we have up here of our Earth’s weather systems.\" Welcome to theTuesday Telescope. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light—a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. Most astronauts these days are fairly anonymous, and chances are you have never heard of Nichole Ayers. And that's OK. But sometimes it's worth pausing for a moment to reflect on just how accomplished these people are. Ayers, 36, flew the supersonic F-22 stealth aircraft in the international war against the Islamic State and rose to become a major in the US Air Force before being selected as a NASA astronaut in 2021. Oh, yeah, she also completed a master's degree in computational and applied mathematics at Rice University. For her first spaceflight, Ayers launched on the Crew-10 mission to the International Space Station in March. This flight got a fair amount of media attention, but that was largely because the arrival of Crew-10 allowed the Crew Dragon spacecraft to which Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were assigned to return home. Since then, Ayers has spent 50 days in space, astronauting. This included a spacewalk last week, her first, alongside veteran astronaut Anne McClain. As they returned to the airlock, the Earth below started to put on a lightning show, and Ayers took note, mesmerized. A day later, she picked up a camera and captured some additional lightning strikes, saying, \"I am so amazed by the view we have up here of our Earth’s weather systems.\" I've chosen my favorite of these photos for today's post.

    "article_text": "Fake image-generating app allowed man to download 1.1TB of Disney-owned data. A California man has pleaded guilty to hacking an employee of The Walt Disney Company by tricking the person into running a malicious version of a widely used open source AI image-generation tool. Ryan Mitchell Kramer, 25, pleaded guilty to one count of accessing a computer and obtaining information and one count of threatening to damage a protected computer, the US Attorney for the Central District of Californiasaid Monday. In a plea agreement, Kramer said he published an app on GitHub for creating AI-generated art. The program contained malicious code that gave access to computers that installed it. Kramer operated using the moniker NullBulge. According to researchers atVPNMentor, the program Kramer used was ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which purported to be an extension for the legitimateComfyUIimage generator and had functions added to it for copying passwords, payment card data, and other sensitive information from machines that installed it. The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic. The Disney employee downloaded ComfyUI_LLMVISION in April 2024. After gaining unauthorized access to the victim’s computer and online accounts, Kramer accessed private Disney Slack channels. In May, he downloaded roughly 1.1 terabytes of confidential data from thousands of the channels. In early July, Kramer contacted the employee and pretended to be a member of a hacktivist group. Later that month, after receiving no reply from the employee, Kramer publicly released the stolen information, which, besides private Disney material, also included the employee’s bank, medical, and personal information. In the plea agreement, Kramer admitted that two other victims had installed ComfyUI_LLMVISION, and he gained unauthorized access to their computers and accounts as well. The FBI is investigating. Kramer is expected to make his first court appearance in the coming weeks. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Thunderbolts Almost Had Its Own Wild Red Hulk",
    "article_text": "As the roll out forThunderboltshas revealed that the rag-tag team of mercenaries are now your New Avengers (or Avengerz, as Red Guardian put it), more is coming to light about how the film was assembled. Co-screenwriter and story writer Eric Pearson has given post-release interviews talking aboutTaskmaster‘s original role in the film, as well as the decision not to includeÂ Baron Zemo. Another major change just came to lightâthis time, regarding Wyatt Russell’s character, John Walker/U.S. Agent. Speaking tothe Wrap.Pearson said the film’s line-up before Sentry’s inclusion rested on a reveal that Walker was going to turn into a Red Hulk as the film’s big bad as a fail-safe put in by Valentina. Pearson shared, âPart of Valentinaâs manipulation was that she had tricked him into thinking he needed constant medication but what she was really doing was planting a time bomb in him if she needed to set him off.” That was intended to break the would-be team apart but instead would serve as another team-building challenge, he said. âTaking Walker, the most antagonistic member of the team, the most abrasive, and then turning him into something that they choose not to kill, but to try and save.â He continued that the idea “did not feel right” and Walker as the second Red Hulk right after Harrison Ford inCaptain America: Brave New Worldwas scrapped. This line of thinking led to including a new character and Pearson suggested Sentry, a character he’d learned about during his time in the Marvel Writers Program. âI always remember loving the kind of idea of, what if Superman had a version of himself with that was as bad as it was good?â Pearson said of the role Lewis Pullman ended up taking over; it has a similar heel turn that mirrors the inner conflict all the anti-heroes grapple withâ”heroic ambition versus self-loathingââbut without a repeat character.

    "title": "The Best Tech Gifts for Mother’s Day 2025",
    "article_text": "Kudos to you if you’ve already bought a gift for the mom in your life and just need to wrap it ahead of Mother’s Day this Sunday, May 11. But if you’re still looking for gift ideas and don’t want to wait until the very last minute and be forced to grab something from the gas station, we’ve got you covered with gifts that’ll fit any budget under $100, under $300, and over $300 (for you really generous folks). Table of Contents Roku Streaming Stick 2025 ($30) The latest Roku streaming sticks, whether you opt for the lower-cost HD or one that supports 4K TVs, are great small gifts to turn any television into a smart TV. It also lets mom project Roku content onto other screens in the house over Wi-Fi. Frameo Digital Picture Frame ($50) No mom has time to scroll through hundreds or thousands of photos scattered in Apple Photos or Google Photos. A Frameo digital picture frame is easy to set up, and once loaded with photos sent from your phone over Wi-Fi, the 10-inch screen will uplift the mood in any room. Lego Botanical Collection Flower Bouquet ($48) Real flowers will wilt and die within a few days. But a bouquet of Lego flowers? They’ll get dusty like all completed Lego sets inevitably do, but they’ll last forever. For an added touch: get her favorite scent and give the plastic bouquet a light spritz. Harmonies ($35) Harmonies, with its evocative art style, is the kind of game that builds relationships rather than tearing them down. It’s simple to teach, but it maintains a surprising depth as each player tries to build a habitat for a number of cutesy animals. You’ll never end up in a situation where players rage against each other, as you’ll be working on your own board to make the most out of your habitats. Split Fiction ($47) WhileIt Takes Two, Hazelight Studios’ other co-op adventure game, is still a great gift for couples,Split Fictionoffers a similarly zany and imaginative adventure for two players. It’s the kind of game where sitting side by side with your mom might bring you a little closer. Super Mario Jamboree ($52) Mario Partygames are the perfect after-dinner romp (yes, you should be cooking dinner for a mom on this special day).Super Mario Party Jamboreehas just the right amount of backstabbing to make sure the mother in your life will still want to talk to you the next morning. Logitech Lift It takes a few days to adjust to using a vertical mouse like the Logitech Liftâyou grip it like you’re shaking someone’s handâbut once you do, your wrist will be in heaven. If mom is spending all day at the computer, this could help alleviate some wrist pain. Ridge Magnetic Power Bank ($70) Magnetic iPhone battery cases are a dime a dozen. The 10,000mAh Ridge Magnetic Power Bank stands out with two built-in cables (USB-C and Lightning), an Apple Watch charger, and a kickstand. It’s truly a versatile all-in-one battery pack. Anbernic RG35XXSP ($80) If the mother you’re celebrating grew up with a Game Boy in her pocket, this gift will pack plenty of nostalgia. Modern retro handhelds like the Anbernic RG35XXSP offer the right amount of portability and excellent controls. Just be sure to fill it with her favorite old games first. Satechi OntheGo 3-in-1 Charger ($90) For moms who travel often, Satechi’s OntheGo 3-in-1 Charger can charge up an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at once. When not needed, the whole thing folds up for easy storage. AirPods 4 ($100) If mom is still using wired earbuds or headphones, it’s time to go wireless. Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two models: with and without active noise cancellation. There’s no going wrong with either, unless mom prefers wireless earbuds with in-ear tips; in which case, consider the AirPods Pro 2. Slay the Spire ($102) Moms who game may already be very familiar with theSlay the Spirevideo game. But whereas that single-player title isn’t a great option to spend quality time together, Slay the Spire in board game form is perfect for a lengthy co-op session with players trying to build decks to defeat a number of wacky and weird beasties. Fujifilm Instax Mini 41 ($120) Sure, mom can snap photos with a smartphone, but can she hang them on the fridge or stash them in a wallet to show friends and family? Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 41 prints business card-sized photos, and mom will look rad with the vintage-looking camera slung around her chest. Keychron K4 HE ($145) Besides helping to stave off carpal tunnel syndrome, a mechanical keyboard is just a damn more enjoyable typing experience. With rosewood accents and quiet switches, Keychron’s wireless K4 HE is a computer upgrade plenty of moms will appreciate. JBL Flip 7 ($150) Whatever mom’s music tastes are, the JBL Flip 7 will deliver. This compact Bluetooth speaker cranks out big sound, can survive a tumble, and has long-lasting battery life. It’s great for parties indoors and outside. Nintendo Switch Lite ($200) If you weren’t able to snag a Switch 2 for mom (and it’ll arrive late, starting on June 5), the Switch Lite is still a great device to play the handheld’s massive library of games. Everything fromSuper Mario WondertoAnimal Crossing: New HorizontoThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomwill run great. The Lite also comes in more fun colors and fits better in purses or smaller bags. Kindle Colorsoft ($225) It only took 17 years for Amazon to release a Kindle e-reader with a color E Ink display, but the Colorsoft is here, and it’s glorious, especially if mom is into reading comics. Black and white is fine, but color ebooks just have an extra pop. Ninja Swirl by CREAMi ($348) The Ninja Swirl by CREAMi is the perfect way to make sure there’s always a special treat handy. The device can make several different kinds of soft serve or frozen yogurt with any ingredients you have on hand. Plus, its main controls look like a face that’s just as surprised as you will be when mom tries to make peanut butter mint-flavored ice cream. Dyson Airwrap i.d. Multi Styler ($600) Dyson’s Airwrap is one of the most popular products of its kind, for a good reason. It’s a multi-tool for curling hair, but unlike other similar products that use heat to do the job, the Airwrap uses powerful airflow to help create a variety of styles. It also comes with a fanless hairdryer attachment. Roborock S8+ ($760) A robovac is the kind of gift that just keeps on giving. Not only does the Roborock S8+ vacuum and mop floors for you, it even self-empties up to 7 weeks’ worth of debris into a dust bag. This little bot is basically a Rosey the Robot you can own today. GamingGift GuideGiftsLegoMother's Day Longing for some more Lego that reminds you of your youth? New sets based onSpider-Man 2andBatman Foreverare here to provide.

    "title": "Trump’s New Streaming Service Truth+ Is a Conspiracy Theorist’s Dream Come True",
    "article_text": "No one would fault you for not knowing that Donald Trump’s “technology” company, Trump Media and Technology Group, has a streaming service. But now that you do know that, aren’t you curious what is on it? Lucky for you, arecent report from Talking Points Memodug into the content over on Truth+ and it is every bit as batshit as you were probably imaging. Truth+ appears to be big on two things: religion and conspiracy theories. That seems like it is right in line with the MAGA crowd’s hobbies, but these conspiracies seem to be less of the “Trump had the election stolen from him” variety and more of the “Jesus Christ was a secret alien” kind. No, really. Per TPM, one of the films on the platform is called “Conspiracy Chronicles,” and it throws some incredible claims out there, including the possibility that Jesus, Buddha, and Krishna were all from a different planet. It also apparently claims that the Moon is “hollowed out” and serves as a base for aliens. Are they the same aliens sending us our most revered religious figures? Hard to say. What is clear, per the film, is that the US government has been covering all of this up. Luckily, the guy who runs the streaming service spewing these theories now has the power to debrief all that information! Surely he will, right? It’s only one of many films on the platform that are all in on out-there claims. Another, titled “Lizard People: Rulers of Time and Space,â claims that there is a race of lizard-like aliens who created humans and developed religious systems to control them. Frankly, it’s kinda wild how close these things get to acknowledging some form of reality (organized religionbeing used as ameans of control, for instance) only to swerve and blame it on aliens instead of like, people who desirepower and wealth. There are actual explanations for these things, but the only way for them to be digestible to a certain crowd is for those explanations to have some sort of otherworldiness sprinkled on top. Now, it would be fair to say that every streaming service has its fair share of bonkers titles that end up available through wide-reaching rights deals, and no one is actually watching them. And there are likely very few people watching Truth+ in general. But those who do are apparently eating up these conspiracies. TPM reported that the âLizard Peopleâ movie was in the top 10 on the platform this week. That programming doesn’t exactly seem in line with the ânews, Christian content, and family-friendly programming that is uncancellable by Big Techâ that Trump’s companypromisedwhen it launched the streaming platform last year.

    "title": "Andor‘s Twin Ghorman Massacres Are a Perfect Way to Re-Canonize Legends",
    "article_text": "Ever since itwas first teasedthatÂAndor‘s second season was preparing to show the tragedy that set the stage for theformal formation of the Rebel Alliance, there’s similarly been discussion of the fact that there areÂtwoGhorman Massacres. The one we are about to learnÂmuchmore about in this week’s batch of episodes, and the very different version of events that took place inÂStar Wars‘ old Expanded Universe. Would we be getting something new, or something inspired by the story that had come before?ÂAndorsimply responded: why not both? Although this week’s episodes are primed to ignite the simmering tensions for what will becometheGhorman Massacreâthe one that sparks Mon Mothma to publicly rail against Palpatine’s authoritarianism, flee the Senate, and call for the Alliance to Restore the Republicâlast week’s actofAndorseason two took us to Ghorman early to explore the planet’s resistance to the Empire. We learn pretty quickly during that exploration that while tensions between the Ghor and the Empire are at an all time high at the moment (thanks to a campaign the Empire’s enacting to fulfill its secret desire to mine the world for resources it needs to build the Death Star), disdain for the regime is not just contemporary feeling on the world. There has already been a massacre on Ghorman once. TheÂTarkinone. This Tarkin massacre matches many of the details of what was the primary Ghorman Massacre inStar Wars‘ old EU: it took place relatively early on in reign of the Empire, it involved a young Tarkin slaughtering hundreds of unarmed Ghorman protestors by landing a cruiser on them, it sparked wider public blowback to the Imperial regime. It is, for all intents and purpose, the EU’s Ghorman Massacre reconstituted into currentStar Warscontinuity. But crucially, it is no longerÂtheincident that takes that name. The new story doesn’t erase the EU one, it weaves it into history, and creates thematic and narrative depth by choosing to say that it was not one or the other, but both. Now, Ghorman’s history of resistance holds up a mirror to the cyclical conflict echoed throughout the widerÂStar Warssagaâand crucially, the Empire’s cruelty, the Tarkin Doctrine of fear crushing dissent, is given a fatal flaw. Ghorman didn’t break in the wake of this first Imperial atrocity, it remembered its pastand fought regardless, and although we’re only on the cusp of learning the full details of this latest one, we know the planet’s resistance will inspire greater pushback against the Empire in the wake of it, laying the groundwork for open galactic civil war and the Empire’s fall in its wake. It’s a brilliant parallel to the first season’s lessons with Nemik, the idea that fascist control through power can be broken if only people try, and keep trying, to not bend in the face of it. And most importantly, it’s texture that matters more than just checking off a known name or event.ÂAndordoesn’t nudge and point when it makes note of the Tarkin massacre; if you weren’t already familiar that this was a known thing from the EU it might as well just have been an organic piece of background information. It’s woven into the narrative in the moment, not to disrupt the current story, but further enrich it. It’s something the series has done a surprising amount of, from offhand mentionsof the Rakatansto the oodles of Easter eggs in Luthen’s antiques collections: it treatsStar Wars‘ “legends” as history, something to provide color and context but not to necessarily dictate the story it’s telling in the here and now. The point of evoking the Tarkin massacre is not simply to say “here is that thing from that other time” and call it a day, but to recognize the storytelling potential of recognizing these twinned versions of this same event, and realizing it’s more interesting to have both co-exist rather than cancel out one or the other. After all, there should always be a little truth in legends. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "53-Year-Old Soviet Spacecraft Will Plummet Back to Earth This Week",
    "article_text": "Kosmos 482 has been trapped in Earthâs orbit for 53 years but its wandering journey is coming to an end. The failed Venus mission is expected to reenter through the atmosphere in a dramatic fall toward its home planet, where it may remain intact or scatter its bits across a still unknown location on either side of the equator. The Soviet-era spacecraft will plunge through Earthâs atmosphere sometime between May 8 to 12. As of now, the exact location of where Kosmos 482 will crash-land on Earth is still unknown, with a preliminary estimate that stretches across large parts of the world on either side of the equator. Itâs also unclear whether the spacecraft will remain in one piece or if it will break apart during reentry, raining down bits of debris. Kosmos 482 launched on March 31, 1972 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport in what is know Kazakhstan. The mission was an attempt by the Soviet space program to reach Venus, but it failed to gain enough velocity to enter a transfer trajectory toward the scorching hot planet. A malfunction resulted in an engine burn that wasnât sufficient to reach Venusâ orbit, according toNASA. Since then, the spacecraft has been stuck in an elliptical orbit around Earth. The spacecraft entered a higher orbit measuring 130 by 6,089 miles (210 by 9,800 kilometers). Astrophotographer Ralf Vandebergh recently captured images of Kosmos 482 in space ahead of its projected descent, and made a note of what appeared to be a parachute deployed from the spacecraft. âAt this point nothing is sure,â Vandebergh told Gizmodo in an email. âIn 2014 I had a first sign of this in my images but I didn’t think seriously about this possibility. But when I processed the 2024 images taken 10 years later and saw the same thing, I thought I needed to report this possibility.â #Cosmos482Note about the parachute possibility. Although still speculation as mentioned before, technically the images are correct. There are no tracking issues, scope issues and I not expect a similar atmosperic effect in images taken 10 years apart, if that would be the case.pic.twitter.com/DiCMzqNY0Z — Ralf Vandebergh (@ralfvandebergh)May 6, 2025 Even if the spacecraftâs exposed parachute is hanging out in space, itâs unlikely that it would still do its job of slowing down Kosmosâ descent toward Earth. After failing to reach Venus, the spacecraft broke apart into four different pieces, with two of the smaller fragments reentering over Ashburton, New Zealand, two days after its launch. The two remaining pieces are a carrier bus and a lander probe, which together form a spherical pressure vessel weighing more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms). Today, itâs hard to determine where the remainder of the heat-resistant spacecraft will reenter Earth’s atmosphere. Its current orbit indicates it should be anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, according to Marco Langbroek, a satellite tracker based in Leiden, the Netherlands. That barely narrows it down as this area includes the United States, South America, Africa and Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. The spacecraftâs landing zone will become more clear as it approaches its doomed reentry. Another question is how much of it will survive the heat of atmospheric reentry. âAs this is a lander that was designed to survive passage through the Venus atmosphere, it is possible that it will survive reentry through the Earth atmosphere intact, and impact intact,â Langbroekwrotein a blog update. Langbroek suggests an impact speed of around 150 miles per hour (242 kilometers per hour) if the lander does not break apart or largely burn up during reentry. The kinetic energy at impact is similar to that of a 15- to 21-inch-long (40- to 55-centimeter) meteorite fragment, according to Langbroek. Since our planet is mostly made up of water, the spacecraft will likely end up at the bottom of an ocean floor. The chances of it impacting an inhabited area, however, are not zero so it does pose some form of risk especially as its reentry date and location remain uncertain.

The spacecraft suffered an engine anomaly that left it stuck in Earth's orbit for decades, and now it's slated for an uncontrolled reentry. The recoverable spacecraft reentered off the coast of Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Indian Ocean, and therefore could not be recovered. A proposed mission seeks to retrieve Vanguard-1 and display it as an ancient relic of the space age. The U.S. is worried Russia may be testing a space weapon.

    "title": "Trump’s Latest NIH Purge Kills the National Cancer Hotline",
    "article_text": "The federal government is continuing to hollow out its research centers. The National Institutes of Health has carried out a second, unexpected round of layoffs across its various departments, including staff at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The layoffs werefirst reportedlate Monday evening by CBS News, based on interviews with current and recently fired employees. Around 200 people have or are soon expected to be fired, including 50 at the NCI. The cuts were made despite previous assurances about no further layoffs, according to CBS News. “We thought the worst was behind us, and we were transitioning into this new phase, and the rug was just pulled out from underneath us,” a laid-off employee told CBS. The White House has implemented acataclysmic fire saleof its federal research institutes in the wake of Donald Trump’s return to the presidency. Guided by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and overseen by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has hemorrhaged some 10,000 jobs in the past few months, including 1,200 jobs at the NIH. Trump has also dictated sweeping budget cuts and he’s tried to revoke billions in federal research and public health funding promised by the previous administration, though these attempts are being legally challenged by affected states and organizations. Trump Signs Executive Order to Limit Funding for Controversial Gain-of-Function Research This tightening of the belt has gone about as smoothly as you might expect, with senior officials like RFK Jr. seeminglynot even being awareof major funding cuts. In some cases, the administration has alsobacktrackedand tried to rehire staff who weren’t supposed to be fired or whose jobs are simply too important to easily terminate. These rehires are reportedly one of the reasons behind the latest round of layoffs. Two people told CBS News that the firings are intended to balance out the people who were brought back, in order to make sure that the NIH still meets its expected layoff targets. How Trumpâs Proposed Budget Will Gut Public Health in America The new layoffs at the NCI largely involved staff who work at the NIH’s Office of Communications and Public Liaison. But these employees play a vital role in corresponding with the public and other doctors about relevant NIH programs; they also maintain the NCI’sCancer Information Service, which helps answer the public’s cancer-related questions. The NCI has already previously lost 150 employees in other departments, including those involved in outside contracting and human resources. According to the NCI, the Cancer Information Service has been in operation since 1975, providing updated information on everything from support services for cancer patients and their families to clinical trials testing out experimental treatments. The CIS hosts a literal hotline that patients, family members, and doctors alike can reach five days a weekâfor now at leastâwell as live chat and an email address. It even connects people to counselors who help those who want to quit smoking (smoking being one of the largest lifestyle risks for cancer). All of this chaos might only be a prelude to the true disaster looming ahead. In its proposed budget, the White House has called for Congress to cut NIH funding by 40%, while it also plans to eliminate or collapse most of the NIH’s divisions as part of a grand restructuring. In addition to the widespread harm these cuts are causing to public health, they could soon trigger a major exodus of scientists from the U.S. Just this week, the European Unionannounceda $555 million initiative aimed at luring U.S.-based scientists overseas, with the plan’s architects subtly citing Trump’s attacks on government-led science as a key motivator. Given enough time and damage, Trump could very well oversee the U.S. losing its status as one of the world’s leaders in scientific research.

    "article_text": "WhenThe Fantastic Four: First Stepshits thebig screen this summer,superhero fans will finally welcomeMarvel’s first family into the MCU. Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach star in Matt Shakman’s feature introduction of the iconic team who become protectors of the Earth when they return from their monumental space mission with special powers. Along for the adventure is Herby, the trusty robot belonging to Reed Richards (Pascal). Herbie is prominently featured in the latest trailer for the film while cooking with Thing (The Bear’sMoss-Bachrach) in a fun meta “yes chef” moment. In an interview withEmpire, director Matt Shakman talked more about Herbie’s role. âHeâs absolutely as important and as alive as any other member of the cast,â he said. âHeâs sometimes a slightly put-upon robot, but he is definitely a member of the family. Heâs just so charming and adorable.â The filmmaker continued, âHe is really Reedâs right hand in the lab, capable of assisting him on any sort of experiment, always by his side, whether in New York City or out in space.â When Sue Storm (Kirby) reveals she’s pregnant, there’s a sort of poignancy in the shot of the family’s unofficial fifth member joining in with an emotional reaction. For the film, it was important to feature a practical robot. âOur âprimeâ one has fully moving head and arms,â SFX supervisor Alistair Williams told Empire. âWeâve had him driving around the set, cleaning, picking up toys, serving martinisâ¦â âHeâs charming, heâs funnyâbut he also will break your heart,â Shakman said of veteran voice actor Matthew Wood’s performance as Herbie, âWhich I hope is emblematic of the movie.â The Fantastic Four: First Stepsopens in theaters July 25.

    "title": "Mattel Says It’s Going to Raise Prices After Trump Says Americans Don’t Need So Many Dolls",
    "article_text": "In an appearance on CNBCâs âSquawk Boxâ on Tuesday, Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz cast doubt on the notion that Mattel might move its manufacturing to the United States in light of President Trumpâs tariffs on Chinese goods. âWe donât see that happening,â Kreiz said. But what Matteldoessee happening is rising prices in the US. During the interview, Kreiz cited three key strategies the company is deploying to mitigate the costs of Trumpâs trade war, with âpricing action,â among them.Â Â The conversation came just one day after Mattel withdrew its annual financial forecast, explainingin its first quarter earnings reportthat, âGiven the volatile macroeconomic environment and evolving U.S. tariff landscape, it is difficult to predict consumer spending and Mattelâs U.S. sales in the remainder of the year and holiday season.â In that report, Mattel also said it had raised its cost savings target for the year from $60 million to $80 million, part of which would be achieved by cutting promotions and discounts. (In another cost-cutting move, the company also laid off more than one hundred employees from its Headquarters in El Segundo, CA, at the end of March.) As far as its efforts to address tariffs, Kreiz said that the company is also focused on diversifying its global supply chain to reduce its reliance on China. The Mattel chief claimed in the conversation today that in two years, no single country will represent more than 25% of Mattelâs sourcing.Â Outside of China, Mattel also imports products (which include Barbies, Hot Wheels, and American Girl Dolls) from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Those countries were also the targets of reciprocal tariffs announced by the Trump administration in early April before being paused for 90 days. Kreizâs âSquawk Boxâ appearance also comes less than a week after President Trump addressed the impact tariffs would have on the toy industry (80% of global toy production takes place in China), saying in a cabinet meeting that, âWell, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.â When asked today if Christmas is at risk, Kreiz emphasized that Mattel is committed to producing a steady supply of product at a âwide range of affordable price points.â Roth analyst Eric Handler told CNBC that Mattel expects to keep between 40% and 50% of its products under $20. The Toy Association, a trade group representing the US toy industry, has pushed hard for an exemption from Trumpâs tariffs since they were announced. Kreiz expressed his support for the groupâs advocacy in the interview, saying that toys are âan essential part of childrenâs lives.âÂ Kreiz came to Mattel in 2018 from Maker Studios, a content creation company that was acquired by Disney in 2016. He is credited with leading the company through a successful turnaround effort. The Barbie brand posted its best full-year sales results of all time in 2021 under Krezâs leadership. Last week, speaking to reporters during a cabinet meeting, President Trump said that “maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” this Christmas season. He insisted that Americans will be happy to make sacrifice presents for… whatever he considers the end goal of his trade war. No one’s quite sure what that is, but maybe we’ll know by Black Friday.

    "title": "The Next Wave of 17-Year Cicadas Is About to Party, Scream, and Die",
    "article_text": "A special brood of cicadasâan ancient lineage of the periodical insectsâis set to burst from the soil this May and June, covering more of the United States than any other 17-year brood. These bugsâcollectively known as Brood XIVâhave been biding their time underground since the last Bush administration, biding their time and counting the years go by. Now theyâre back with two goals: Get loud and get laid. This isnât just any swarm. Brood XIV is considered theoriginal brood, from which all other 17-year cicada broods split off, according toYaleEnvironment360. This is the motherlode of massive, crunchy, droning insects. For a few wild weeks to come, the skies will fill with their raspy mating calls, as the insects rise up simultaneously. The synchronized emergence isnât just for flair. Itâs a numbers game: By surfacing in the billions, cicadas overwhelm their predatorsâbirds, squirrels, snakes, you name itâwho are so sated by the plenty that the cicadas’ arrival sends waves through the food chain. When cicadas emerge, populations of cuckoos, blue jays, and some woodpecker speciesswell. But not all the effects are good: Because the birds are busy eating cicadas, caterpillar populations can gounchecked, allowingÂthosebugs to damage oak trees to a greater degree. Most of the insects will get eaten, but enough will survive to keep the brood going. Once the survivors lay their eggsâtheir purpose fulfilledâthey die. The brood’s tiny offspring disappear underground for another 17 years, from which they will rise again in 2041. The cicadas are expected to appear as far west as Kansas, as far north as Wisconsin and Michigan, down through the Mississippi Delta to New Orleans, and along much of the East Coast from Georgia and South Carolina up to Connecticut.Â You can review a detailed map of broods, including where they historically have emerged and are expected to emerge again, at this University of Connecticutsite. And as with everything else these days, climate change could be messing with the cicada clock. A Japanese studyfoundthat warming temperatures are pushing some cicadas to emerge earlier in the year. Over time, hotter conditions might even shrink their 17-year underground snooze. But those are longer term forecasts, and Brood XIV’s timing is imminent. In the next weeks, if you hear droning and you’re not near a construction site, there’s no need to panic: Itâs just billions of bugs on a once-in-a-generation bender. animal behaviorAnimalsInsects Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Luigi Mangione’s Legal Defense Fundraiser Tops $1 Million",
    "article_text": "A fundraiser for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in New York last year, has raised over $1 million. The fundraiser surpassed that milestone on Tuesday, Mangione’s 27th birthday, and comes as his legal defense has sought to get much of the evidence obtained by police when Mangione was arrested tossed out. The $1 million has come from over 28,000 individual contributions, with a median donation of about $20, according to a press release from the fundraisers atGiveSendGo. Other fundraisers started on more mainstream crowdfunding sites like GoFundMe wereshut downfor violating their terms of service. Mangione is accused of shooting Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, on the morning of Dec. 4, 2024, when the health care executive was walking to a conference in Manhattan. The death of Thompson was captured on security camera footage at the Hilton hotel in Midtown and kicked off a manhunt over the course of the next week before Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police say Mangione was arrested with a gun and a so-called “manifesto,” though the alleged manifesto appears to have been just262 wordslong. The note was obtained by independent journalist Ken Klippenstein and describes people who, “abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed [sic] them to get away with it.” The killing kicked off a national conversation about health care in the U.S., which is the most expensive in the world, while delivering some of the worst health outcomes among all wealthy countries. Many Americans empathized and justified the killing of any health care CEO, while others qualified their support by saying that while they don’t condone murder, they understood what would drive someone to do that. The latestlegal filingfrom Mangione’s defense team in the New York state case is quite a revelation. The accused killer’s lawyers say that cops in Pennsylvania conducted a warrantless search of Mangione’s backpack, admitted screwing that up verbally, which was captured by bodycam, then tried to retroactively justify the search as being necessary because they were worried about potential explosives. The police then put that backpack, which cops say had a gun, into a patrol car for 11 minutes, where no bodycam footage is available. From the shockinglegal filing: The officers continued their warrantless search through Mr. Mangione’s backpack at McDonald’s even after he was removed from the restaurant by other officers and driven to the precinct. During this continued search at McDonald’s, Patrolwoman Wasser recovered a gun magazine loaded with bullets. Now realizing she had made a potentially devastating mistake by thoroughly searching the backpackofa murder suspect in a significant New York press case without a warrant, she suddenly stated that she was searching through the backpack at McDonald’stomake sure there“wasn’ta bomboranything in here” before putting the backpack in the car. The falsityofthat comment was made clear seconds later when another officer at McDonald’s stated”Nowthat we found that [i.e., the loaded magazine], let’sjustbring it back” to the precinct. Suddenly not concerned about a “bomb,” Patrolwoman Wasser placed all the items back into the backpack and stopped searching. Patrolwoman Wasser repeated her comment that she was making sure there were no bombs in the backpack,asanother officer commented that “at this point we probably need a search warrant for it.” Without calling for the bomb squad, evacuating the McDonald’s or even searching for a bomb, Patrolwoman Wasser placed the backpack in her police car and brought it to the precinct. Patrolwoman Wasser left McDonald’s at10:04 a.m. There is no body-worn camera footage from her for the next11minutesasshe drives to the precinct with the backpack. At10:16a.m., one minute after arriving at the precinct, Patrolwoman Wasser continued her warrantless searchofthe backpack. Patrolwoman Wasser first re-opened the same backpack compartment that she had started searching at the McDonald’s before immediately closing that compartment and opening the front compartmentofthe backpackasifshe was specifically looking for something. Instantly, she “found” a handgun in the front compartment. Mangione’s lawyers also write that he wasn’t read his Miranda rights, a violation of the Fifth Amendment. And they also want the terrorism charges dismissed because a grand jury, “failedtoestablish the required element that Mr.Mangione intended to intimidateorcoerce a civilian population, influence the policiesofa unitofgovernmentbyintimidation or coercion or affect the conductofa unitofgovernmentbymurder, assassination or kidnapping.” Mangione faces both state and federal charges. Attorney General Pam Bondi, an appointee of Donald Trump who has purged the U.S. Department of Justice of anyone who doesn’t demonstrate fealty to the president, has instructed prosecutors to seek the death penalty. âLuigi Mangioneâs murder of Brian Thompsonâan innocent man and father of two young childrenâwas a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,” Bondi said in a statementlast month. “After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trumpâs agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.â Brian Thompsonhealth carehealthcareLuigi Mangioneunited healthcareunitedhealthcare Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "TheConjuringUniverseis heading into its endgameâSeptember’sfinalConjuringfilmis literally subtitledLast Ritesâbut it won’t be borrowing a page fromAvengers: Endgameto assemble all the monsters we’ve met in its moviessince 2013. However, and amazingly, thatwasactually briefly considered at one point. In a newEntertainment Weeklyfeature that highlightsThe Conjuring: Last Ritesbut also serves as a look back at the franchise as a whole,Last Ritesdirector Michael Chavesâwho also helmedThe Curse of La Llorona,The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, andThe Nun IIâspoke about the brainstorming sessions that informed the fourthConjuringfilm starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren. “Even as we were developing it, we were throwing a bunch of ideas out: ‘How shamelessly big can we make it?’ ‘How epic can we make it?’ ‘Is this the culmination of all the demons coming to face them?” Chaves told EW. The magazine added that “he admits the team briefly entertained the idea of about a dozen Doctor Strange portals opening to reveal everyConjuringentity assembled together for an endgame of sorts” before deciding to go in a more emotional, personal direction. Ok. We understand that Lorraine and Ed’s bond is the heart of theConjuringseries. These two have stuck together despite being routinely imperiled by supernatural horrors galore. But imagine for just a moment that series creator James Wan, an executive producer onLast Rites, had decided to bid farewell to theConjuringwith a giant monsterpalooza? The Nun and Annabelle would obviously be leading the charge, but you could also include the beasties who were introduced throughout the series as potential spin-off characters that never came to be, most notably the Crooked Man fromThe Conjuring 2. While the movie was very eager to set that scenario up, as executive producer Peter Safran tells EW, a stronger contender won out in the end. “We thought the Crooked Man was basically going to be the Annabelle forConjuring 2,” Safran told EWâbut “when the audiences saw the movie, they wanted to know more about the nun. That’s what they gravitated toward.” The Crooked Man won’t be returning for that not-to-beEndgameshowdown that will forever live rent-free in horror fans’ minds, but Wan hasn’t given up completely. “I still have a movie in my head that I would hopefully love to get off the ground one day, but we’ll see,” he told EW. “I get fans that reach out to me every now and then, begging us to make a Crooked Man movie. Just as a fan, I would love to do it one day, if I can convince the studio to do so.” We’re begging you now, James Wan: mega-monster crossover movie. You have the power! Make it happen!

    "title": "Freight Company Tells SEC It Needs Millions in $TRUMP to Get Access to the President",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump has promised to have dinner with the top holders of his cryptocurrency memecoin $TRUMP, creating a pretty clear-cut opportunity for buying access to the leader of the free world. Freight Technologies Inc., a North American-based shipping company, wants to take advantage. The firm’s CEO Javier Selgas recentlyannouncedâpublicly, on purpose, with zero consequenceâthat it intends to purchase as much as $20 million worth of $TRUMP so that he can try to influence the president’s policies on tariffs. According to aSecurities and Exchange Commission filingmade by the company, it has tapped an institutional investor to provide financing for an initial purchase of $1 million worth of $TRUMP, with the possibility of an additional $19 million. Basically, it’s borrowing up to $20 million to get a seat at the table with Trump. The company isn’t shy about that goal, either. In apress release, Selgas said the purchase is part of the company’s “promotion of productive and active commerce between the United States and Mexico.” The Trump Coin team recently announced that the top 220 holders of the $TRUMP token would be invited to participate in a private dinner with Trump on May 22, with a VIP reception and tour for the top 25 holdersâa prospect that immediatelyset off alarm bellsfor any reasonable person who believes that you shouldn’t be able to get a trip to the White House for lining the pockets of the president. It wasn’t hard to imagine that someoneâa CEO, crypto insider, foreign actorâwould buy up some $TRUMP in order to get a seat at the table with him for a night. It probably was a little less expected for a company to issue a press release about enacting that strategy. Per theleaderboard on the Trump Coin website, the $1 million investment should be enough to get Selgas and Freight Technologies in the door for dinner. The current top holder of $TRUMP is Justin Sun, the founder of crypto platform TRON, which was investigated by the SEC forallegedly manipulating the price of the cryptocurrency. He holds approximately $1.2 million worth of $TRUMP, and is one of only two people who currently have more than $400,000 worth of the token. Trump, for his part, is acting like he doesn’t know anything. During an appearance on NBC News’ÂMeet the Pressover the weekend, Trumpsaid“I haven’t even looked” when asked if he had profited off his cryptocurrency, which launched shortly before he took office for the second time.Â âIf I own stock in something, and I do a good job, and the market goes up, I guess Iâm profiting,â he said, which is a pretty good encapsulation of just how deep his understanding of the crypto space. He doesn’t have to look to profit, of course. Around 80% of all $TRUMP coins are owned by two entities: CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital. So the vast majority of the tokens are already in Trump’s pockets. When people buy the token, like, for instance, when there is an announcement that holding the coin could get you a private dinner with the president, the price goes up, and so does the value of Trump company holdings. They also âreceive trading revenue derived from trading activities,â per the Trump Coin site, so they’re cashing in on each transaction, too. Trump has always been a transactional person. Now it just happens to be logged to the blockchain. CryptocurrenciesDonald TrumpTariffstrump coin Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Murderbot‘s Creators on Letting AI Be the Good Guy for Once",
    "article_text": "Upcoming Apple TV+ seriesMurderbottakes place in a future where survey missions on distant planets are required to bringa Security Unitâa hulking robot created using mechanical and organic partsâas protection. Required, that is, by the all-powerful company that controls all the commerce in the galaxy. It’s a scary situation to contemplate, especially the part about being on an isolated planet with a powerful AI that has guns tucked into its arms. ButMurderbottakes a surprising approach to that sci-fi trope. Adapted from theMurderbot Diariesbooks by Martha Wells, the show makes its potentially terrifying artificial construct the protagonist of the story (played by Alexander SkarsgÃ¥rd), and imagines that even after it hacks itself and gains free will, it would still look out for the puny humans in its midst. In a recent chat with io9 ahead ofMurderbot‘s debut, creators, writers, directors, and executive producers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz said there’s certainly optimism to be taken away from this storyâand quite a bit of humor to go with that. “To some degree we were looking at this as a post-dystopian world, meaning like, yes, there’s a dystopia, corporations are pretty much running the show,” Paul Weitz said. “But at the same time, we have objective evidence that almost everything is half-assed. Like the moment that somebody achieves totalitarian power, they screw up on some level, and there’s still flowers growing through the cracks and weeds. In this case, there’s Murderbotâs sense of humor. The idea that a sense of humor is evidence of personhood and individuality and is going to exist in various manifestations. It was a core thing, I think.” When io9 suggested one of the show’s biggest themes revolve around what it means to be human, Chris Weitz modified that slightly. “It’s more like what it is to be a person, because I think we’re about to deal with people who aren’t human as AGI becomes more of a reality,” he said. “And AGI, you know, large language models being fed on data which is produced by humans in the first place, means that it’s going to be related in some way.” “I think that Martha throughout the [book] series presents different kinds of consciousness and different kinds of being who are still people. There’s a loose analogy, because I don’t want it to be too direct, to people who are on various positions along various spectrums of neuroatypicality and various people can identify with that character to various degrees.” “I [identify with the character] along the kind of axis of social anxiety, and certainly Martha sort of felt that she was discovering her neuroatypicality while she was writing the character. I think what it has to say is that there are various ways of being a person, and that as Paul really likes to say, people aren’t reducible, not to be seen as a group or just in terms of what their psychological characteristics are, but that the uniqueness of every individual is really important.” Murderbot‘s first two episodes arrive May 16 on Apple TV+.

    "title": "A New GTA VI Trailer Is Here, but We Still Don’t Know if the Game Is Coming to Switch 2",
    "article_text": "Grand Theft Auto VIwonât arrive in 2025, but as a consolation prize, Rockstar Games dropped a video featuring a few snippets of gameplay for whatâs still one of the most anticipated games set to arrive next year. That slice-of-life trailer cements just how little we know about Rockstarâs ultra-hyped open world. The big question on everyone’s mind: willGTA VIever launch onNintendo Switch 2,and if there are plans, will it arrive on the May 26, 2026 release date, or sometime after? Rockstarâs new page forGTA VIoffers a few scant details about the gameâs story and its expansive cast of criminal characters. Players will terrorize Vice City and the surrounding state of Leonida Keys as Jason Duval, a military vet working for drug dealers. His partner in crime, Lucia Caminos, is an ex-con who wants to make her dreams of a good life a reality by any means necessary. At the top of the page, Rockstar says the upcoming open-world game will be available onPlayStation 5andXbox Series XandSeries Sat launch. It makes no mention of PC or Switch 2 availability. Rockstar normally takes a full year before it publishes its games to other platforms, like it did forGrand Theft Auto VandRed Dead Redemption 2on PC (these ports are reportedlymore complicatedthan they seem). Still, the company has worked with Nintendo to launch past titles like the firstRed Dead Redemptionon the original Switch (though not the recent remastered version). Judging byanalyst expectationsand itsmassive wave of preorders, the Switch 2 is set to be the biggest console release of the past several years. The video game industry is relying onGTA VIto be a similarly landmark release. Publishers also hope GTA publisher Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar will sell the game for $100, setting a new price ceiling for game prices beyondtodayâs burgeoning $80 AAA game standard. One industry analyst who spoke to Gizmodo mentioned Nintendo may not appreciate the press of the ultra-violentGrand Theft Autoseries finally coming to its largely family-friendly platform. Still, Take-Two has every reason to wantGTA VIon Switch 2, and Strauss Zelnick, the company’s CEO, said as much during arecent earnings call. Zelnick hedged his bets, telling investors that Nintendoâs consoles arenât just geared for younger players. He cited games likeCivilization VIIbeing on the Switch 2 as an example of the handheldâs aging demographic. He added that his company âactually would fully expect to support Switch [2].â Zelnick recently had toassuage shareholders’ disappointmentÂ at theGTA VIdelay. A Switch 2 announcement would do a lot to help in that regard, though we’ve not heard anything official. “Weâve hadâobviouslyâa long-standing relationship with Nintendo,â Zelnick said during his February earnings report. âWeâve supported the platform when it made sense for the individual release.â There’s also the matter of whether or not the Switch 2 is up to snuff to runGTA VI.The console’s Nvidia-made chipset is speculated to have performance roughly between a PlayStation 4 and PS4 Pro. That being said, the Switch 2 is powerful enough to playCyberpunk 2077, though only at 1080p when docked and hooked up to a TV. CD Projekt Red worked directly with Nintendo on the port, and developersrecently saidon a Nintendo Creator’s Voice video the port may be âthe most cyberpunk wayâ of playing the game thanks to the addition ofmouse and motion controlson the new Joy-Cons 2. CD Projekt Red VP of business development Jan Rosner toldThe Game Businessthat it makes sense forCyberpunk 2077to be on Switch 2 since âNintendoâs audience is growing and broadening.â Cyberpunk 2077will fit on a 64GB game card, though thatâs not the norm. Many other large,third-party games will be loaded on game-key cards, which are essentially a download code for players to get the title on Nintendoâs eShop.GTA VIwill likely be a massive title, and it could easily eat up a huge chunk of the systemâs 256GB built-in storage.Cyberpunk 2077will be a slightly different experience than on PC, especially considering the difference in the size of the game, though Rosner stressed that coming back to Night City will still be as engrossing and violent as before. Even if CD Projekt Red had an easy time porting to Switch 2, there are other technical aspects to consider. Rockstarâs games run on the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, though we donât know how much stress it might put on both modern consoles, especially when playing at 4K. The only upscaling tech the game will have access to is the still-limited, AMD-based PSSR onPlayStation 5 Pro, so Rockstar would be better off makingGTA VIaccessible with the Nvidia-made upscaling on the Switch 2. There’s still plenty of time for Rockstar to finally let us hold up drugstores on Nintendo’s family-friendly console.

    "article_text": "In 2023,Influencermade io9’s year-end list ofthe best movies you might have missed, and we’vecontinued to recommend itever since. It’s definitely one you don’t want to knowtoomuch about before watching it for the first timeâbut the title hints at the subject matter, and it’s not a spoiler to sayInfluenceris a cautionary tale about putting too much of yourself online. You never know who might be paying an unhealthy amount of attention, especially when, say, you’re on a solo vacation in Thailand. It’s a twist-filled and satisfyingly twisted tale. After a festival run, it streamed on genre platform Shudder, where it built up a following though didn’t quite, ahem, go viralâbut today comes news worth 1,000 “likes”:Influenceris getting a sequel! And it’s titled, naturally,Influencers. Even better, asDeadlinereports,Influencershas actually already wrapped. It’s once again from writer-director Kurtis David Harder, and brings back the first film’s memorable Cassandra Naud, with the addition of Georgina Campbell(Barbarian). This time around, the thrills unfold across southern France; according to Deadline, “the sequel watches as a young womanâs chilling fascination with murder and identity theft sends her life into a whirlwind of chaos. Pic deepens a cinematic universe built around themes of deception, online identity, and the darker sides of curated personas, offering an expanded canvas compared to the original.” The trade also has a quote from Harder: “WithInfluencers, I wanted to revisit the themes of control and illusion, but from a new angleâone thatâs more seductive, more dangerous, and more unhinged,” said Harder. “Itâs a film that plays with perception. Fans ofInfluencerwill feel something familiar beneath the surface, but the real fun is discovering just how deep those connections run.” Yes, he did indeed promise the sequel ismoreunhinged than the original, and we can’t wait to see how he pulls that off. Shudder once again picked up the rights in English-speaking countriesâthere’s no release date yetâand the film will seek international distribution at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

If you’re the type of person who likes to run, bike, or walk outdoors with music but doesnât want to tune out the world completely, the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 is probably exactly what youâre looking for. They keep your ears open, which is an interesting (but understandably odd) feeling, and they sound a bit different, but still good. They’re designed to make sure you get the sound you’re looking for without having to deal with muffled sound or uncomfortable, stuffed up ears. See at Amazon Right now, you can get them on sale from Amazon too, so it’s a good excuse to try them out.They’re $140 right now, down from their usual price of $180, which means they’re $40 off. That’s a discount of 22%. The OpenRun Pro 2 headphones use bone conduction technology to transmit sound through your cheekbones.That might sound a little weird, but in practice it works surprisingly well. You still get crisp audio and clear vocals, but your ears are free to hear traffic, voices, or anything else happening around you. Itâs perfect if you want to try to stay aware and safe while out and about. But they’re also interesting if you have problems with sweaty, itchy ears after earbuds or other similar problems. The fit is lightweight and secure, too. These headphones are designed to stay put no matter how active you are. Plus, they’re also sweat- and water-resistant with an IP55 rating, so you donât have to worry about rain or intense workouts. They won’t get ruined just because you’re sweating a little. They offer up to 12 hours of battery on a single charge too, so unless you’re marathon listening all the time, you should be able to reliably listen when you need. If youâre in a rush, a quick 5-minute charge gives you around 2.5 hours of playback. Thatâs great for those last-minute âI forgot to charge itâ moments. Their Bluetooth 5.3 support means fast connectivity to your devices too. You can even pair the headphones with two devices at once, like your phone and your laptop, without needing to constantly disconnect and reconnect. Thereâs also a companion app if you want to tweak EQ settings or check for firmware updates, but you never have to open it if you don’t want to. No, youâre not going to get booming bass or noise cancellation here. Thatâs not what these are built for. But if comfort, safety, and convenience are top priorities, the OpenRun Pro 2 delivers.At 22% off, you may as well give them a try even if they don’t immediately seem like your cup of tea.

    "article_text": "Hopefully, you’ve seen and are generally familiar with the originalHow to Train Your Dragon. If so, then you are in for a treat with a brand new trailer that was just releasedfor its upcoming live-action remake. The trailer, which is centered on the fact the film was filmed for andwill be released in IMAX, is wildly epic. It soars through the mountains of Berk, blasting John Powell’s unforgettable score, and features not just the loving relationship between Toothless and Hiccup, but big scenes from the film’s final battle. Those scenes in particular are very much geared toward fans of the original because anyone who hasn’t seen or doesn’t remember the original is going to look at them and be like “Oh, wow, so that’s what happens at the end of the movie.” So watch if you dare, but if you do, you are going to want to see this movie on the biggest screen possible. Yes, those scenes versus that mountain of a dragon are from the end of the movie. And yes, Hiccup does fall into a billow of flames with Toothless going down to save him. Those are certainly spoilers. However, it’s everything before that which really grabs us in this trailer. We get so much more of the Hiccup and Toothless relationship here. More of their playful beginnings, more of their mid-air bonding, and more of how that relationship changes not just Hiccup, but his Viking culture in general. Look, if you know and loveHow to Train Your Dragon, odds are you are going to love this movie. It’s very, very similar. And, if for some reason you don’t know that original movie, wow.

    "title": "Android Is Getting Weird Again as iOS Gets More Boring",
    "article_text": "The best word to describe Googleâs self-leaked Android UI is âfunky.â According to a now-removed blog post, Android is getting a visual refresh in the form of a “Material 3 Expressive” design language, a bold, a little brash, and very in-your-face design with its odd shapes and massive fonts. Love it or hate it, at the very least we may finally experience a stint where Google and Appleâs smartphone interfaces arenât carbon copies of each other. The folks at9to5Googlefirst spotted a blog post from Google published ahead of its annual Google I/O conference detailing the new Material 3 Expressive redesign. TheWayback Machinestill has the text and header video, but the blog managed to grab shots of this new UI before Google pulled it down. Google describes this look as âthe most-researched update to Googleâs design system, everâ and further claims it will make it up to four times faster to spot key UI elements. You can be the judge of whether larger bubbles with bold text make it easier to navigate your phone. Otherwise, Google implies this redesign across the Android user experience is meant to âconnect with people on an emotional level.â That includes using various colors and shapes to highlight important buttons or UI elements, rather than the âboringâ lists youâve come to expect from most baseline Android apps. âCoolâ is the name of the game here. Google even included charts that showed that Material 3 Expressive enhanced the âcoolnessâ of an app. Those âcoolâ features include a pill-shaped âfloating toolbarâ that you can find at the bottom of several apps. Google claimed its research found that stressing size and contrast made the UI easier to use for most people, especially younger folk. Google even threw shade at Apple: âWe found that well-applied expressive design is strongly preferred by people of all ages over non-expressive design that followed the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.â Speaking of iOS, Apple is reportedly running in the opposite direction of Google with its upcoming iOS 19. Recent reports from reliable leakers at Bloomberg suggestApple is trying to unify its interfacesacross its iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. This would include adding circular, bubble-shaped app iconsâmuch like the look of the Vision Proâs âspatialâ interface. Weâre still waiting to see if Apple will finally unveil more of itslong-promised Apple Intelligence features. The company reportedly went through amajor restructuring periodafter internal tests proved the promisedAI-ified Siri wasnât up to snuff. I canât say I prefer the new Android design language. Those screenshots displayed on the now-deleted Google blogâespecially the image for âYour Mixââlook more like poster advertisements than a clean UI where I can actually select what I want. The clock, payments, and wallet apps look a little easier to parse, but thatâs because they need to display the most important informationâthe time and your account balanceâfront and center. The leaked screenshots show off the traditional keyboard in Gmail compared to a redesigned interface with the âsendâ button front and center, though it takes up nearly half the phoneâs screen. There are other signs Google will copy Apple in other ways.Android Authorityrecently reported that there’s code in Googleâs upcoming Android 16 for resizable and modular Quick Setting tiles, very much like what Apple added to iOS 18âs modular Control Center. Now that everybody has a smartphone and the software has matured, itâs now normal to expect Android will copy iOS, and that Apple will return the favor in kind during every yearâs OS update cycle. But Android is going all-in on aesthetics with its upcoming release. Whether or not that actually makes it more usable is another matter entirely.

    "title": "AI Identifies Author of Charred Scroll Buried by Vesuvius for 2,000 Years",
    "article_text": "For the first time, researchers have identified the author and title of a document thatâs been locked inside a charred scroll for nearly 2,000 yearsâwithout peeling back a single layer. The scroll, PHerc. 172, was recovered from the ruins of Herculaneum, the ancient Roman town buried by the ash and debris of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE. The scroll is one of three Herculaneum scrolls that now reside at Oxford’s Bodleian Libraries. Thanks to high-resolution scans and some seriously clever machine learning, scholars were able to virtually âunwrapâ the papyrus and read the name inside:On Vices, by the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus. The treatiseâits full name beingOn Vices and Their Opposite Virtues and In Whom They Are and About What, according toFine Books Magazine, is basically ancient self-help, exploring how to live a virtuous life by avoiding vice. Philodemus wrote the work in the first century BCE and it is now being read for the first time since it was buried in the devastating volcanic eruption nearly 2,000 years ago. The discoveryâconfirmed by multiple research teamsâearned the projectâs collaborators the $60,000 First Title Prize from the Vesuvius Challenge, an open-science competition thatâs been making ancient texts readable using AI. In recent years, artificial intelligence has been instrumental in deciphering the ancient, carbonized scrolls from Herculaneum, a Roman town buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79. These scrolls, first discovered in the 18th century in what is now known as the Villa of the Papyri, comprise one of the only surviving libraries from the classical world. Due to their fragile, charred condition, traditional (read: manual) methods of unrolling the scrolls often destroyed them. Now, researchers are using advanced imaging and machine learning to read these texts without ever opening them. How AI Is Deciphering Lost Scrolls From the Roman Empire The turning point came in 2015, when scientists used X-ray tomography to read a different ancient scroll from En-Gedi, creating a 3D scan that could be virtually âunwrapped.â Building on this, researchers at the University of Kentucky developed the Volume Cartographer, a program that uses micro-CT imaging to detect the faint traces of carbon-based ink on the scrolls. Because the ink contains no metal, unlike many ancient writing materials, a neural network had to be trained to recognize subtle patterns indicating ink on the carbonized papyrus. In 2019, researchers successfullydemonstratedÂ this technique, setting the stage for broader applications. These breakthroughs culminated in theVesuvius Challenge, launched in 2023 to crowdsource the decoding of unopened scrolls. Participants use AI toolsâparticularly convolutional neural networks and transformer modelsâto identify and reconstruct text within the scrolls. In October 2023, the first word (âpurpleâ) was read from an unopened scroll, earning a $40,000 prize. The challenge continues, with prizes offered for deciphering additional text and improving the technology. Brent Seales, a computer scientist at the University of Kentucky and co-founder of the Vesuvius Challenge, toldThe Guardianthat the team’s current bottleneck is cleaning, organizing, and enhancing the scan data so that researchers can actually interpret the carbonized ink as text. Importantly, the digital unwrapping process is guided by human expertise. AI highlights likely areas of ink on the ancient documents, but scholars interpret the patterns to determine if they form coherent words or phrases. The goal is not only to recover lost philosophical texts, many of which are possibly by Epicurus or his followers, but also to establish a scalable system for digitizing and decoding ancient textsâtransforming our understanding of the classical world.

    "title": "I really don't want to cosplay as Darth Vader in Destiny 2, so I'm even more queasy about the announcement of a whole Star Wars-themed expansion",
    "article_text": "If lightsabers in Destiny is what keeps Bungie going, I guess I'll suck it up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Let me state from the start that I don't like fictional universe crossovers. Whether it's aMagic The Gathering set themed around Doctor Whoor riding aChocobo in Assassin's Creed Origins, if it involves smushing two entirely different universes together, I'm not into it. I feel the same way about melding worlds as I do fusion cuisine: Just because youcansmush two independently great things together, very much does not mean that youshould. Which brings me to today, and Bungie's livestreamedinfosplosiondetailing what to expect from the next year of expansions and updates in Destiny 2. The major news is covered in the link above, but the topic that everyone's discussing in the aftermath is, weirdly, Star Wars. Destiny has already dallied with Lucasfilm, releasing a set of (paid, of course) Stormtrooper-themed armor skins alongside the Heresy episode. I could just about accept that, if I squinted and pretended I couldn't see half a platoon of the Empire's finest emoting in the tower, because Destiny has done gear crossovers with other games before. God of War, The Witcher, and Assassin's Creed (becauseUbisoftreally does love this stuff) have all appeared in Destiny 2 as paid armor skins, but those sets took inspiration from the source material, whereas the Star Wars stuff looks close to 1:1 copies. And as of today it got even crazier. If you pre-order theDestiny 2: Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition(for a mere $99), you will immediately receive a basket of digital goodies, including a set of three Star Wars 'Dark Side Legends' skins, which will enable you to dress as eye-wateringly accurate facsimiles of Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and General Grievous. Yes,thatDarth Vader. And no, I don't think those Titan-style shoulder pads are working for him. Now, before I open fire with a blaster under the table, a couple of caveats: 1) I have a Star Wars-loving clanmate who is more excited about this than any of the other announcements today, and could not care less about in-universe accuracy. 2) If I am being completely candid Ididbuy the Stormtrooper set, because I love creating Destiny fashion and the hoodless hunter cloak is superb. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It doesn't so much feel like the thin end of a very commercial wedge as it does lobbing a brick through the art team's window. And look, if the Vader and Kylo outfits were all that was happening, I could probably make my peace with it. Just try to ignore the multiple Sith Lords in my raid group in the same way I've had to pretend those stupidmini sparrowsweren't a thing as part of my strict head canon. After all, Bungie desperately needs Destiny to keep making money, and these things clearly sell like ewok cakes. What I can't yet wrap my head around though, is that Bungiealsoannounced that the December expansion, which is called Renegades, is going to be entirely themed around Star Wars. We're talking lightsabers, blasters, speeders and a dusty planet that looks very much like Tatooine. Now, let the record state that this doesn't mean the action takes place literally in the Star Wars universe. This is still just billed as 'inspired by'. But in terms of maintaining the integrity of Destiny's own setting, it doesn't so much feel like the thin end of a very commercial wedge as it does lobbing a brick through the art team's window. That's what I think is making me feel so uneasy about all this: Destiny is a game, which over a decade and many thousands of hours, I have loved intensely,sometimes to a fault. And whatever you might think about the studio's mistakes or failings in that time, the universe has always been brilliantly drawn, from iconic imagery like The Traveller hanging in low orbit over earth, to the brilliance of the Guardians being essentially warmongering zombies that the other races are terrified of. Hell, Destiny's own alien factions—Hive, Fallen, Cabal—are interesting enough to warrant writing reams of lore about. And now what, we're just going to dump a bucket of George Lucas in there and call it good? If this is the Faustian pact required to keep the lights on at Bungie I guess I'll suck it up. More than anything it feels disrespectful to what the studio itself has created. I imagine plenty of people inside Bungie have serious reservations about playing quite so fast and loose with their universe. But I guess it's also a sign of how dire times must be if this kind of nuclear option is required to balance the books. Ultimately, the money men will have done the calculus and concluded that for every player Star Wars turns off, there will be more waiting to ring the register. Ultimately I do get it. I might not be a Star Wars guy—beyond the original trilogy, Andor and maybe some of The Mandalorian I really can take it or leave it—but lightsabers are cool and if this is the Faustian pact required to keep the lights on at Bungie I guess I'll suck it up. Even my non-Destiny playing colleagues have been rolling their eyes in disbelief at this collab, calling it another step in the Fortnitification of all service games. And I get that too. But if you were hoping that this would be the straw that broke the chocobo's back, and I would be dramatically abandoning the game, well, no chance. I've long made my peace that I will be there on the last day as the servers go dark. Just don't expect me to be wearing Han Solo's trousers.

    "title": "The GTA 6 trailer shows Jason and Lucia working out: is Rockstar bringing back some of San Andreas' RPG-lite features?",
    "article_text": "Jason lifts weights, Lucia works a heavy bag… are these just cutscenes or will exercise improve our stats? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even though we got the bad news that GTA 6 was delayed until May 2026 (on console, that is, we still have no idea when it might eventually land on PC), at least there was a ray of sunshine to go along with the clouds of disappointment. Rockstar surprise-dropped a new trailer today which gave us a nice long look at the game—and left us with a few questions. Hidden among the crime, cars, and clubs ofthe GTA 6 trailer… could that be a few RPG-lite elements we see? There's not a ton of evidence, but it's hard to see Jason using a bench press in the trailer and not think: is weightlifting just part of a cutscene, or something more? A screenshot of Lucia working a heavy bag in a gym has me wondering if practicing a skill, like unarmed combat, makes her a better fighter. We also see Jason's hair change during the trailer, ranging from a bit of stubble to a short beard, his hair style is longer at times, and at some points he looks more suntanned than others, too. Look, this could mean nothing. In GTA 5 you can change your hairstyle and facial hair by visiting the barber, and there are a few minigames like golf that serve as activities but don't have a wider impact on gameplay. Weightlifting, punching bags, and Jason's changing facial hair might not signify anything, really. But this is Rockstar, which has dabbled a bit with light RPG elements, like nutrition, weight, and exercise, in the past: most notably in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, where food wasn't just something you scarfed down to restore some health. In GTA:SA, food was a necessity, and players had to make CJ eat every few days of in-game time or he'd lose weight and muscle mass. If he didn't eat at all, CJ would actually die from starvation. Eating too much also meant he would gain an unhealthy amount of weight, leaving him unable to leap as high or run for as long as a more fit version of CJ could, and spending time working out would make him stronger and more agile. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That system wasn't carried over to GTA 4 or GTA 5, but there was a touch of it in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2. Arthur's weight would fluctuate depending on what and how often you ate, and have a small effect on some aspects of the game. For instance, a heavier Arthur would have a bit less stamina than a slimmer Arthur, but have a bigger health bar. Conversely, a skinny Arthur could run for longer but take less damage than a thicc Arthur. Arthur's hair and beard would also grow over time in RDR2, meaning that if you wanted to be smooth shaven you'd actually have to go to the barber and get a shave. Your hair could even be influenced by items like hair tonics, letting you grow long locks and a big bushy beard. It's not clear if that's the case in GTA 6, but I wouldn't be surprised if Jason's hair grew over time. It's a cool feature that makes characters feel more real, so why not include it? And even if there aren't light RPG systems like the GTA:SA's in GTA 6, weightlifting could still have a gameplay effect, like yoga did in GTA 5. For Michael (the only playable character who could do the yoga activity), practicing yoga was one way to slightly increase his special ability (bullet time), so it was more than just a minigame or a time-killer. Maybe Jason pumping iron (and he's benching 265 lbs, which ain't bad at all) actually makes him stronger in GTA 6, and Lucia working a bag makes her a better fighter. I personally doubt Rockstar will bring us back to San Andreas-levels of food, nutrition, and exercise: GTA isn't a survival game, and I don't think most players were all that enamored with having to constantly manage CJs weight and fitness. But I wouldn't be surprised if some of these systems were given a light touch in GTA 6, more along what we saw in RDR2.

    "title": "Well that didn't pan out: Former Rockstar boss said in 2018 that he was glad not to be releasing GTA 6 in the Trump era, but here we are with GTA 6 releasing in the Trump era",
    "article_text": "Nobody saw this coming—not even Dan Houser. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's not easy to predict the future. You do the best you can with the information on hand, sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. Case in point: Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, who said in 2018 that he was thankful the studio wasn't releasing a new Grand Theft Auto gameamidst a Donald Trump presidency, because the political climate in the US made it \"really unclear what we would even do with it, let alone how upset people would get with whatever we did.\" \"Both intense liberal progression and intense conservatism are both very militant, and very angry. It is scary but it’s also strange, and yet both of them seem occasionally to veer towards the absurd,\" Houser said at the time, which I will again remind you was in 2018—seven years ago. \"It’s hard to satirize for those reasons. Some of the stuff you see is straightforwardly beyond satire. It would be out of date within two minutes, everything is changing so fast.\" It is deeply ironic then that GTA 6 is going to drop smack in the middle of a Trump presidency—a second one (yet not a second consecutive term), which was all but unthinkable when Houser made his comment, and at the same time prophetic: Everything is indeed changing so fast, and if satire isn't dead it's at the very least taking a brutal ass-kicking with no end in sight. Absurdity has become the norm. But it's also interesting that, intentionally or otherwise, Rockstar may have figured out a way around that difficulty: Ignore it entirely. Neither of the GTA 6 trailers we've seen so far, including thenew one that dropped today, have made any visible reference to Trump, much less any sort of direct parody, or to other relevant political hot points. The game is pretty clearly set in the here-and-now, but there's no mention of the Covid-19 pandemic, no mask jokes or Fauci gags, and no overt MAGA imagery or anything that cleaves close to the actual real world. It's quite possible that GTA 6 will feature a Trump-like figure—the Mar-a-Lago resort would absolutely not be out of place in Leonida—and Rockstar is simply holding the reveal back: The new game is still a year away, after all (and doubtlessly longer for those of us on PC). The series hasn't shied away from sensitive subjects in the past, including illegal immigration and private military corporations in GTA 5, and as Grand Theft Auto loremaster Rich Stanton pointed out to me, the series has previous featured a Trump-esque figure: Billionaire developer and cannibalDonald Love, who appeared in Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and Liberty City stories. But there's also a chance that Rockstar will want to stay in its own little walled garden—a world that's very much like ours superficially, but that avoids becoming embroiled in topics that have the potential to be genuinely controversial. The GTA series was arguably more provocative, and intentionally so, back when the mere idea of a videogame that lets you go on senseless crime sprees could shock. At least for now, Rockstar doesn't seem to becourting wrath like it used to, not even indirectly mocking Trump or his followers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For a studio that was once held up as the embodiment of all the ills that plague our society, it's more than a little weird to think of Rockstar as playing it safe with GTA 6. But as Houser said seven years ago, these are strange times indeed. However it ultimately works out, it's not Houser's problem anymore: Heleft Rockstar in 2020and is now heading up a new studio calledAbsurd Ventures.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The newGrand Thefty Auto 6trailer starts with a throwaway line that I didn't think anything of untilRich pointed outthat it's clearly a joke. \"Oh, just fixin' some leaks,\" protagonist Jason says as he climbs down from a roof in the very first scene, and Rockstar is a meticulous sort, so I have to imagine that this is an intentional reference to the many leaks GTA 6 has seen over its long development. The biggest of them came from a 2022 hack, and it's an incredible and unhappy story. In 2022, 90 videos from a GTA 6 development build were posted online. It wasone of the biggest leaks in gaming history, up there with the Half-Life 2 source code theft, and also felt like a sign of the times. The rise of remote working in response to Covid meant that far more information was being transmitted outside of office networks, opening new avenues for hacking and social engineering. The hack wasn't the first time GTA 6 details leaked, and it confirmed previously leaked details, such as the dual protagonist setup and Vice City setting. It wouldn't be the last GTA 6 leak, either: In 2023, the firstGTA 6 trailer hit Xbefore Rockstar officially published it, prompting the developer to put it up early. But the 2022 hack was the most significant incident, and incredibly, it was carried out by a teenager who was out on bail and under police protection over other hacks, including a major Nvidia breach, which he was involved in as part of hacker group Lapsus$. Arion Kurtaj reportedly managed to bypass Rockstar's securityfrom a Travellodge hotelwhere police had placed him for safety after he'd been doxxed by rivals. The conditions of his bail included an internet ban, but he reportedly used an Amazon Fire Stick, smartphone, and a keyboard and a mouse to make his way onto protected Rockstar servers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Kurtaj, who is autistic, was deemed unfit to stand trial but was found responsible for the Rockstar hack and others, and in 2023 was sent to a secure hospital for an undefined duration. Asreported by the BBC, the sentence was motivated by belief from the court that Kurtaj was likely to repeat the offense as he \"continued to express the intent to return to cyber-crime as soon as possible.\" GTA 6: Everything we knowGTA 6 trailer #2: Details and takeawaysGTA 6 characters: Who's whoGTA 6 protagonists: Jason and LuciaGTA 6 cars: The lineup A 17-year-old hacker was also tried and was found guilty, and sentenced to an 18-month Youth Rehabilitation Order, which the BBC reported involved \"intense supervision and a ban on using VPNs online.\" Perhaps it's appropriate that a game series about gleeful criminality would be the target of real crime, but Rockstar seemingly did not find the irony amusing, testifying that it spent $5 million to recover from the hack. The new trailer's opening lines would've been funnier had it also leaked early, and Rockstar might've even anticipated that possibility, but, nope, this GTA video actually dropped when Rockstar intended it to. It wasn't exactly a big surprise, though. We were expecting a new trailer closer to the start of the year, and when that didn't happen, we started to anticipate a delay announcement. We got that the other day, when Take-Two announced thatGTA 6 has been delayedto May 2026. The news didn't help Take-Two's share price, but that's nothing a new trailer to stoke the hype can't solve—shares in the company rose 2.89% today.

    "article_text": "Sounds lovely. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today, Rockstar released the second trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6, providing a fresh look at thesurprisingly effective chemistrybetween its dual protagonists, a glimpse atgorgeous beer graphics, and enoughfodder to fuel redditor speculationfor the next twelve months. The trailer drop came alongside a sizable update to theGTA 6 website, adding details about its character cast and map regions—regions like Mount Kalaga national park. According to the site, Mount Kalaga occupies the \"northern fringes\" of Leonida, GTA 6's parallel universe Florida, where Rockstar says visitors can find \"prime hunting, fishing, and off-road trails.\" Accompanying screenshots show kayakers paddling down riverways, camo-clad hunters beneath pine trees, even a Florida panther (Leonida panther?) stalking unsuspecting deer. It almost looks like Rockstar spliced a little slice of Red Dead Redemption 2 into the GTA 6 map. Given the undying fascination GTA 5 players have with the natural majesty of Mount Chiliad—gamers yearn for uppies—I suspect it'll be a popular destination for anyone looking to venture outside Vice City. I'm surprised by how much wildlife those screenshots show, though. If I fight off a Mount Kalaga panther, can Lucia sell its pelt for cash? Much to think about. The Mount Kalaga region has more to offer than just the wonder of the great outdoors, however. \"In the lush surrounding backwoods,\" Rockstar says, \"hillbilly mystics and paranoid radicals live far from the prying eyes of the government.\" I'm a little conflicted about the description. On one hand, past GTA games give an impression that Rockstar struggles to conceive of a person living outside the city who isn't either fully divorced from reality or wearing a tank top coated with mystery stains, and the \"hillbilly mystic\" characterization doesn't sound like the studio's going to be covering new ground there. On the other, Iamcurious about what it looks like to be subjected to the wizardries of a sorcerous Florida Man. The paranoid radicals, I don't have any hope for.

    "title": "Starfield gets a new beta update on Steam with bug fixes, a 'Very Low' display setting, and no new content",
    "article_text": "Some players are happy the game hasn't been abandoned, but others are wondering why it took six months for this. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Two months after annoying everyone by promising that its development team was still \"hard at work\" on \"exciting things\" forStarfieldthat it refused to talk about, Bethesda rolled out a decidedly unexciting new update in Steam beta that adds a Very Low display setting, makes a few changes to the Creation Kit, and fixes some bugs. There's really not much to say about this one. The new display setting may be a boon for players whose PCs struggle with Starfield, although I can't say that I find the prospect of playing at theworst possiblevisual fidelity all that terribly appealing. The ability to add new icons via the Creation Kit is fine, I suppose, and the increase in allowable upload size presumably opens the door to bigger, more complex Creations in the future. Bundling Creations in the store? I'm sure some mod makers will find that useful. Beyond that, though, today's update is entirely a tune-up, and that's sparked a fresh wave of annoyance among some players, who find it all pretty thin given that it's been six months since the last Starfield update rolled out on Steam. Some are happy to have proof that the game is still being worked on, but there's also an undeniable feeling on theStarfield subredditandSteam forumsthat, well over a year after Starfield's launch and six months since the last update, Bethesda should have come to the table with more than this. Interestingly, while there's no mention of it in today's Steam update, Bethesda did tease some upcoming new content today on its website, although it's being developed by someone else:Watchtoweris a new mod from Kinggath Creations, \"Fallout 4's best modder,\" whose previous work includes bringing Doom weapons and armor to Starfield in At Hell's Gate. Watchtower sounds like a significant piece of work—here's the lowdown: A new faction has emerged from the shadows to protect humanity from potential threats with excessive power – and they’ve identified you as their latest target. Join forces with a fellow adventurer hunted by Watchtower, befriend their contacts and work together to pilfer Watchtower’s technology and turn it against them. And yes, we have a teaser: Watchtower is set to go live on May 20—Kinggath said onXthat it will be a paid mod, but a cost hasn't been announced. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "The details and takeaways you might've missed in the new GTA 6 trailer",
    "article_text": "Cats is the big one! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's true:nobody does it like Rockstar. Last week brought the disappointing news that GTA 6 was delayed until May 2026, but today the pill got some belated sugar coating with afrankly magnificent second traileralongsidemore character details. The game's second trailer focuses largely on Jason and Lucia, and shows sequences from what I'd speculate is the game's opening stretch: Jason living in a shabby beach property doing favours for his shady landlord instead of paying rent, Jason and Lucia reuniting on her release from prison, the couple getting all loved-up and vowing to improve their situation. But alongside that was an absolute treasure-trove of incidental details that showcase just how much of a leap Rockstar is taking with this game's scale and ambition. The first observation is that, when you zoom out a little on everything being shown here, GTA 6's astonishing visual style is coming alongside a way more grounded tone and world than the oft-absurd GTA 5. Obviously GTA 6 is going to deliver some incredible set-pieces and spectacle, and there's a brief glimpse of the protagonists hanging out of an airplane, but for the most part this comes across as a world of low-level criminality, hustles and shakedowns. GTA has at one level always been about engaging in fantasy criminality, whether that's the carjackings of its title or going on murderous rampages and seeing how long you can survive at max Wanted level. I do wonder how those things, which I recall with great fondness from the older entries, are going to translate into this visual style and verisimilitude. The trailer also opens with a gag, Jason shouting down from his roof \"oh, just fixing some leaks.\" GTA 6 was the subject of a 2022 hack that sawlots of footage and detailssplurged onto the internet (the hacker was subsequently convicted in the UK andsentenced to indefinite detention). Rockstar exerts total control over how its games are marketed and released, so all that beta footage must've stung, and this is them taking back control of the narrative, showing the things it wants you to focus on. The trailer shows Jason weightlifting at one point, and if you look closely at the various official screenshots and the different scenes in the trailer, his appearance is subtly different: from tan to the hair cuts. This shot instantly brought to mind San Andreas' weightlifting minigame, which tied into that game's RPG-lite elements around CJ's weight and physique. GTA 6 seems to be revisiting that idea, though perhaps not to the extremes seen in San Andreas. This also ties-in to a brief sighting of a fight club: Lucia delivers a kick within an arena as people watch on from behind wire fencing. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is speculation but it certainly looks like we seePhil Cassidyat one point, the gun store guy, which would make him the second character (after Lazlo) to make the jump from the original GTA 3D Trilogy (Cassidy was in GTA 3 and Vice City, as well as the PSP spinoff games). The first name is confirmed by the gun store's name: Phil's Ammu-Nation. There are reasons to think it's not him, mostly relating to the timeframe and him having both arms, and the character could well be a relative or just a nod, but I think Rockstar's comfortable playing around with its own history like this. This is yet to be confirmed but Brian Hader, Jason's shady landlord-slash-boss, sounds an awful lot like the actor Stephen Root. The setting is up-to-the-minute present day, with yet more glimpses of social media-style footage and modern technology. But the vibes are all 1980s, and among the tracks heard at different points are Wang Chung’s \"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\" and the Pointer Sisters' \"Hot Together\", both major '80s hits. We've now got the full names of both protagonists. Jason gives his full name as Jason Duval when at the prison, and here we also get Lucia's surname: Caminos. Their house also has different stuff in it at different points in the trailer, so presumably you can upgrade your pad as you progress. There's even a PS5-style console and a PS4-style pad at one point. Other things we get a glimpse of include a GTA version of Miami's MetroRail, an elevated train system, and most exciting of all cats! You can see a cat climb out of the bins behind Brian Heder at the start of the trailer, and one on Jason's right as he exits a store carrying a six pack of beer. The latter did make me wonder about getting drunk in-game, which we don't see in the trailer but was a feature in previous games. We see a big cat, too: One of the new screenshots on the website shows a panther hunting deer, suggesting that not only will we find wildlife in GTA 6, but it displays behaviors as complex as stalking and hunting. Oh and on the beer: the characters don't drink Pißwasser, but we do see an advert for it at one point. One other notable animal reference is a character wearing a green football jersey with \"Manatees\" written on it. Manatees are also known as sea cows, so this is the GTA version of the Miami Dolphins. There are hundreds more details to be extrapolated from this trailer, and the more I notice the more excited I am for where Rockstar's going with this. It'll be fascinating to see how the reactiveness of the NPCs holds up when it's dealing with players and their actions, rather than a trailer showcase, and I can't wait to see how environments like bars are handled when it's not a cutscene. You have to hand it to Rockstar: this game may not live up to its promises, but what golden promises they are.

    "article_text": "As Payday 3 continues to struggle, Starbreeze is looking ahead to \"broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Starbreeze Studios has reached a deal to acquire the publishing rights toPayday 3from original publisher Plaion, a move it says will enable it to \"accelerate content development\" for the struggling game. Starbreeze said in today'sannouncementthat, with Payday 3 having launched in September 2023, \"the timing is opportune\" to take over responsibility for publishing the game. At the same time, it said the deal \"also lays the groundwork for a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion on future Payday franchise projects.\" \"This agreement enables Starbreeze to fully acquire the publishing rights to Payday 3 from Plaion, significantly accelerate our content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole,\" Starbreeze board member Thomas Lindgren said. \"We appreciate Plaion's support, which underscores their confidence in Starbreeze’ future and strengthens our strategic alignment with major global industry players.\" It's all very upbeat and forward looking, and more updates at a quicker clip (if that's how it works out) would definitely be welcome. But there's no getting around the fact that after being stuck in the mud for a year and a half, Payday 3 is a game in deep trouble: The launch was acatastropheand efforts to fix it wentbadly sideways; six months later, the CEO of Starbreeze wasout, and six months after that the Payday 3 game directorstepped down. Through it all, player numbers have been decidedly not great: While the 12-year-old Payday 2 remains firmly embedded in the midst of Steam's top 100most-played games, Payday 3 is only occasionally peeking above 1,000 concurrent players. That's a tough one to turn around: There's a little bit of hope here and there on Reddit and the Steam forums that removing the external publisher from the equation will speed up the flow of updates, as Starbreeze said. But there's also plenty of doubt that Plaion was the real problem in the first place. Regardless of whose \"fault\" it is, making Payday 3 into a successful game at this point would be a massive undertaking. Not out of reach necessarily, but Lindgren's comment about pursuing \"broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise\" and future Payday partnerships with Plaion makes me think that Starbreeze may have reached the point where its priority is putting this whole mess behind it and trying again with something new.

    "title": "Bungie announces the next four Destiny 2 expansions, and yes, the second one is literally just Star Wars",
    "article_text": "The Edge of Fate is out July 15, but it's the expansion in December that's bringing a lightsaber to the game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In today's Destiny 2 reveal event, Bungie kicked off the next major 'saga' of the game. It's called the Fate Saga, it'll unfold over multiple years, and it will start on July 15 with the first expansion, The Edge of Fate. But that was just one of four expansions that Bungie announced today, and it's the second one—due out later this year, on December 2—that will raise the most eyebrows. It's called Renegades, and it's… well, it's Star Wars. \"Renegades is going to be a definitively Destiny expansion,\" narrative designer Alison Luhrs says during the reveal. \"This is part of the Fate Saga and it's going to push it forward in important ways and introduce characters that we're going to spend time with for years to come.\" No doubt this disclaimer exists because, well, just look at that teaser trailer. Itlookslike a non-canon Star Wars crossover event. \"To really drive it home here, Renegades is a one-of-a-kind Destiny experience,\" says assistant game director Robbie Stevens. \"Just like we on the Destiny team have taken inspiration from other genres like dark fantasy or cosmic horror, Renegades takes the space western vibe and aesthetic that is Star Wars and puts it through that Destiny lens.\" Which, I dunno. I think you've gone beyond vibe and aesthetic when one of your Ultimate Edition cosmetic bonuses is literally just Darth Vader. A post shared by Destiny 2 (@destinythegame) A photo posted by on Away from the Star Wars of it all, here's what's lined up for the next two years of Destiny 2: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For the first of those, The Edge of Fate, players will be summoned to a new location, Kepler, to get embroiled in some new drama from The Nine. Bungie calls this an attempt to bring mystery back into the Destiny universe, which is why the central antagonists here seem to be The Nine—dark matter beings that represent the celestial bodies of our solar system. This will also kick off a new release cycle for the game. As shown by the timeline, Destiny 2 will be receiving two expansions per year—each said to be around the same size as Destiny 1's Rise of Iron, (ie, smaller than a typical Destiny 2 annual expansion). And between expansion releases will be new \"major updates\" that replace the previous seasonal model. These will be free to all players, and the first, called Ash and Iron, will launch in September and add Destiny 1's Plaguelands location to the sequel. It's going to be a major shakeup for the game, but honestly, after the last year of episodic updates, Destiny 2 desperately needed something different. The Final Shape was an all-timer, but it didn't take long for the regular seasonal fatigue to set in. By the second episode community sentiment was as low as I've seen it in some time, and even though the third episode was much better received, it's abundantly clear that the seasonal rollercoaster had long outstayed its welcome. Will this new model be better? I'm certainly intrigued by what Bungie is doing to streamline the new player experience, and to improve the loot chase through a new tier system. But ultimately it's going to come down to the quality of these new expansions—whether the metroidvania exploration of The Edge of Fate will feel like more than just a gimmick, and whether Bungie can pull off a whole Star Wars expansion and still make it feel like it makes sense in the game. Destiny 2 is a game forever bouncing between \"It's so over\" and \"We're so back\", and I'm struggling to predict where The Edge of Fate will fall.

    "title": "Microsoft unleashes an AI agent on your unsuspecting Windows settings, but initially only if you have a Snapdragon X-powered PC",
    "article_text": "What, no more drilling down into submenus that date from the late 1990s? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Microsoft has been upping Window's AI ante of late. Its latest salvo is a new raft of autonomous features powered by an AI agent,which are due to roll out \"over the next month\"(viaBleeping Computer). Kiss goodbye to those ancient submenus that date back to Windows NT? Maybe, but somehow we suspect not. Up front and center is a new AI agent to help you out with Windows settings. As Microsoft says, \"what if you could simply describe the change you want, in your own words, and get a fix instead?\" Well, now you can, or at least Microsoft claims you'll be able to when the new agent rolls out via the Microsoft Insider program. \"An agent uses on-device AI to understand your intent and with your permission, automate and execute tasks. With this update to Settings, you will be able to simply describe what you need help with like, 'how to control my PC by voice' or 'my mouse pointer is too small' and the agent will recommend the right steps you can take to address the issue. \"With your permission and at your initiation, it can even complete the actions to change your settings on your behalf,\" Microsoft explains. Intriguingly, the update is coming to Snapdragon X-powered PCs first. Microsoft won't say when x86 PCs will get the update, only indicating that it's \"coming soon.\" Without experiencing the new feature, it's hard to say how powerful it is. Does it mean an end to drilling down into ancient submenus with graphical interfaces from the late '90s to access more obscure settings? Possibly. More likely, the agent will cover off more commonly used settings in the main settings menu that's one click away on the desktop. Anywho, along with the settings agent, there's a new \"Click to Do\" feature which offers functionality including, \"copying text from an image, to summarizing text, or even quickly removing objects or the background from an image, Click to Do cuts through context-switching, bringing actions directly into your workflow. More actions are starting to roll out in Click to Do, including the option to create a bulleted list from selected text.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Photos app gets an AI makeover, too, with the \"relight\" feature adding dynamic lighting controls to picture editing. You can position up to three virtual light sources within an image, set their color and move a focus point that all lights automatically follow. For quick edits, there are built-in presets offer ready-made lighting styles that can be applied with a single click. Again, relight will be available first on Snapdragon X-powered PCs with, support for AMD- and Intel-powered devices coming later this year. There's also a new AI-powered cartoon sticker generator and object selection in Paint, plus an AI-enhanced Snipping Tool. The latter supposedly understands your intent when using the tool, meaning you can get precise grabs of on-screen elements without having to crop in accurately by hand. It also nows supports automatic text extraction and the ability to capture color values from anywhere on screen.

    "title": "I'm already totally enamored with Grand Theft Auto 6's Jason and Lucia, and I've had them for less than 5 minutes",
    "article_text": "It took two trailers for me to fall in love with GTA 6's version of Bonnie and Clyde. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rockstarjust dropped its second Grand Theft Auto 6 traileroutta nowhere, and it's managed to do something I wasn't expecting: It made me totally invested in protagonists Jason and Lucia's whole dynamic, despite the fact I've seen less than five minutes of them. Whilethe first trailerwas a broader overview of Lucia and a modern-day Vice City—with Jason only speaking a single word and appearing for less than 10 seconds—the second trailer has honed in a lot more on the Bonnie-and-Clyde-esque relationship between the two. Tender moments are spliced between criminal activity, helicopter fights, and swamp chases, and leaping from motorbikes on highways. We already knew Lucia has spent an undisclosed amount of time in prison, and the latest trailer shows Jason picking her up as she's released. While the reunion doesn't seem to send sparks flying straight off the bat—the initial awkwardness has me theorising she's been in there for at least a couple years—it takes approximately two seconds before we're treated to a scene of the two rolling around on the bed, ankle bracelets and all. There's beer drinking (lots of it), heavy petting (even moreso), and clearly a severe lack of lesson-learning as it doesn't take the two long to ingrain themselves in some classic crime committing. But even among the chaos and the violence—I mean, it's GTA, of course there's an abundance of both those things—the few sentences that the twodoshare are full of care and affection. It's a perfect juxtaposition, one which shows a surprisingly normal and healthy relationship between two delinquents. Maybe it's 12 years of being hit over the head with GTA 5's Michael and Amanda De Santa's toxicity and marital problems, but getting glimpses of the dynamic between Jason and Lucia is incredibly refreshing. It already has me both excited for their story and anxious for their inevitably tragic ending. It's a dynamic which feels like the two actually like each other, which is already a rare win, but also like it's a couple on equal footing with one another. Couples who rob convenience stores together, stay together, or however that saying goes. It also doesn't feel like Lucia only exists to be the nagging woman, or the sassy woman, or any other stereotype that Rockstar has cribbed from in the past. When she comes home from her community service towards the end of the trailer to Jason lazing on the couch with a half-drunk beer, she doesn't deride him. She goes straight in for a lie down and a hug. Hell, there's even a second beer on the table, one which I've already headcanoned Jason had ready for her when she got back. It's one of those incredibly normal moments. They're not caricatures, they're not over-the-top zany criminals. They're just people. A woman tired after a long day of… work? That moment when you get to share an intimate moment with your partner and all the stress melts away. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Though we've still not seen much of them, Jason and Lucia feel like a breath of fresh air after GTA 5. While I love Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, it's nice to see a return to more grounded protagonists. As grounded as you can get for a GTA game, mind. It's made me even more interested in just how these two have fallen into a life of crime, and how they ended up finding each other. Honestly, props to Rockstar for already having me so invested in these two and their story in what amounts to an entire four minutes and 16 seconds of trailer footage between the two teasers—hell, they're not even in it for all of that time, much less together. If I'm already this hooked off such little exposure, I imagine Rockstar's going to be taking me on a hell of a narrative ride whenthe game launches next year. Just for the love of god, don't put me in a situation where I have to kill one of them.

    "title": "The new GTA 6 trailer just dropped and the thing I'm impressed with most are its beer bottles",
    "article_text": "At least I have plenty of time to prepare. In typical Rockstar fashion, it won't likely launch on PC until way after the console release. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's this pretty underground game coming out next year calledGrand Theft Auto 6. Not too sure if you've heard of it. A second trailer has just launched for Rockstar's cosy city life/ murderthon, and the thing I'm most impressed by are its beer bottles. Boring, I know. Just over the two-minute mark into thelatest trailer, Lucia and Jason, two of the game's protagonists, arrive at their riverside property and lie down with a couple of beers. Not only do you see the bubbles and the condensation on those glass bottles, but you also see the reflection of the TV and the light pouring in from the outside. I shouldn't be surprised. Rockstar is known for little details, it is the company that madehorse testicles shrink in the cold, after all. But it does suggest a splash of ray tracing is being used here on at least certain effects. There are bottles, frames, puddles, and even controllers reflecting on glass tables littered throughout the trailer that all scream 'look mythesereflections', and the shadows look pretty impressive too. The water in the latest trailer also looks impeccable, flowing naturally in the warm sun. You might ask, 'How do you know the sun is warm?' and I'd respond, 'I can practically feel it through the screen. Oohing and ahhing at the trailer in the PC Gamer office brought about a conversation about how bottles and the technology around them have always represented a challenge for video game textures. Water is hard to make look real, lighting is hard to make look real—bottles are a combination of the two. Back in 2020, Half Life: Alyx implemented arather wonderful shaderwhich accurately reflects how water moves in a bottle, and that same shader was laterimplemented in Counter-Strike 2. It's a small detail that means a lot in context. This is something both Valve and Rockstar do well. When not admiring bottles and lighting fragments,the rest of the trailer looks great, too. Textures are nearly movie-like, and the sheen that comes off water, or a dull light bulb above our main characters, makes the game feel grounded and real. I'm not one to normally stare, but even the way sweat pours down the chest of Jason in the hot sun feels so needlessly but impressively Rockstar. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Rockstar seems to always be at the front of graphical limitations with the launch of its big games, and early signs suggest GTA 6 will be no different. It's a looker, and the way that trailer 2 leaves shots of glass, guns, and the smoke of the back of a motorbike to just sit shows how confident Rockstar is in its vision. I bought a new PC near the latter half of last year, and myRTX 4070 Superhas been able to handle pretty much everything I've thrown at it. I have no doubt it will be able to run GTA 6, especially when the current generation of Xbox and PlayStation will both be able to play it at its launch. However, I can almost sense the strain thatRed Dead Redemption 2on Ultra settings leaves my rig under. Everything gets quite hot, and I can get above 60 fps on 4K, but not much more. This doesn't seem too bad, but the RTX 4070 Super is a mid-range card that launched five years after Red Redemption 2 did on PC. By the time GTA 6 launches on PC (likely at some point in 2027), we will be either ready for the launch of the RTX 60-series line or already have it in our PCs. You can actually see some stuttering even in the trailer. Trailers are highly edited and likely watched many times before they go live, so the inclusion certainly seems a bit strange. For instance, at1:42into the trailer, there's a scene with a man with a towel over his neck and, as he steps forward, the frame rate slows down. We still have a year until the game launches on console, so that is time for Rockstar to clean up performance, but it's clear it's going to be a mighty game from a technical standpoint. This is all before mentioning that Rockstar is known for having much better console ports than PC ones. GTA 6 will likely be aiming for 30 fps on PS5 with some amount of ray tracing included, but we don't know what kind of PC rig is needed for an equivalent experience.GTA 5had a miserable launch on PC, and even the GTA 5 Enhanced launch in March this year was met by amixed response. Assuming there will be a 12-month+ wait for GTA 6 on PC, one can always hope it will be optimised for that RTX 20-series card you've been rocking, but Rockstar's history suggests it may be a bit of a slog to run on older gear. A worthwhile slog, thanks to excellent visuals and an engaging story, but a slog nonetheless. Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming.

    "article_text": "Test the new update for yourself ahead of launch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. REPOhas been advertising its first content update for a while now, and plenty of Q&A videos have shared what exactly we can expect to see from it. But, one piece of information that hasn't been shared is the release date. Fortunately, the newREPO updateis now available for beta test, and there's no need to register your interest or sign up in order to get access to it. The open beta is available to everyone, but Semiwork has noted in the announcement for the open beta that the update still has some parts missing and potentially some bugs, so be warned. There's currently no date for when the beta test will come to a close either. Here's what you need to do if you want to test the new update for yourself. To access the beta, find REPO in your Steam library and right-click it. Go to \"properties\" and toggle to the \"betas\" menu. In the right-hand corner, you canchange your game version from \"none\" to \"beta - beta branch\", which will change your game to feature everything that will be included in the new update. Changing your version will roll out a quick update for your game before you can jump in and play. But, you'll immediately be able to use features like random matchmaking to play with a group outside of your own pals. An entire new level is also available to explore, alongside some changes to the existing enemies within the game. If you do encounter any bugs, or if you have any feedback, Semiwork is encouraging players to share any comments via the official REPO Discord server. There are several dedicated beta test channels within the server which can help you find a group to play with within the beta test, generally discuss the new additions, or two forums to share bugs and feedback in.

    "title": "GTA 6's preposterously gorgeous second trailer has me thinking 'no-one does it like Rockstar' isn't just a compliment, but an omen",
    "article_text": "A leviathan 1.5 decades in the making. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As you might've noticed by the titanic, earthquake-causing footsteps of an industry giant rolling over in itsyear-long delay slumber, Grand Theft Auto 6 hasdropped a new trailer. And while my rational mind wants to put 'it's a doozy', here, I feel like that's a colossal understatement. Far from just likely melting your computer, GTA 6 looks gorgeous in a way that defies the series' open world scale. The wrinkles on Jason's shirt, the hyper-realism of the evening light playing off the bars on a state prison, the little cracks and imperfections of a 'keep clear' sign that's been artificially made to endure the wear and tear of the dysfunctional society the game's parodying.Even the beer bottles are a new tier of impressive, because why not. I get the same feeling watching this trailer that an Arctic researcher might watching a Lovecraftian horror breach the briny waves. I'm a sailor torn out of the golden age of piracy, staring at a picture of a cruise liner and wondering how it floats. I'm an ant being introduced to the concept of a lawnmower. If I sound like I'm being up this game's fundament, I sort of am—but when some of my colleagues say \"no-one does it like Rockstar\", I can't help but think of that phrase as an omen of some kind, said in the way you might say: \"In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming\". This 13-years-in-development creature just isn't something that exists in the normal constraints of the gaming industry. I mean—despite my uneasy feelings and paranoia, borne out of a job that has me able torecite a dozen crushing layoffs from memory, it's clear that big-budget games aren't dead just yet. Assassin's Creed Shadowsdid quite well for itself, and thebig-names in Japan are doing alright. Well, they would be, iftariffs weren't happening. There are also plenty of heavyweight studios with irons in the fire—the next Witcher from CD Projekt Red'lllikely shake the firmament, and Death Stranding 2 is looking similarlygorgeous and mystifying. But we're also in the twilight years of several industry giants. WhileUbisoftclings onafter an extended slump, Rocksteady wobbles afterSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Bioware is unrecognisable, and probably won't be making a Dragon Age game again with how muchinstitutional knowledge EA just shed. Bethesda kindadoesn't know how to make a Bethesda gameanymore. Every mainline Final Fantasy title Square Enix makes is utterly gorgeous, and unfailingly behavingbelow expectationsanyway. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I don't think doom is coming for Rockstar, not in the slightest—it might not even be coming for big-budget games from traditional publishers. But still, there's something in the air. As far as Take-Two is concerned, GTA Online has a thick enough bankroll for the company to take its sweet time. Similarly, when GTA 6 does hit in 2026 (probably), it'll likely be one of the most successful videogames ever made. There's a reason anyone else making games isscrambling to get out from under its shadow. There's also the darker side of the Rockstar pedigree that allows it to do, well, this—Red Dead Redemption 2 had a similar level of proportionately boggling scope, and that game was built off theback of \"death march\" crunch. Rockstar's promised to be better, and itvery well may have done so. Still, even if things've changed, the path Take-Two took to get here isn't a pleasant one. But I think we can agree it's a unique beast, right? Who else gets to comfortably sit on a pile of money while taking 13 entire years to make their next instalment? And who, gosh darnit,isdoing it like Rockstar? I can name some studios that're getting close, but if this trailer's any indication, they'll be left two steps behind once more. We'll just have to see. I'm not entirely convinced thatblockbusters are on their way out, but if GTA 6 delivers on even two-thirds of the sheer detail and scope it's promising in these trailers, it'll be an architectural marvel, non-Euclidian and impossible to craft for anyone but the big R. And if trends continue, it might be another 14 years before we get anything like it—and who knows where we'll be in 2040.

    "title": "Apple Mac Studio M4 Max review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A professional tool at heart, the Mac Studio with M4 Max offers enough graphics power to make a decent gaming machine too. It does cost an awful lot of money, however, so games will always be a secondary concern to its owners. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The feeling when you take a piece of new hardware out of the box is unsurpassed in the field of human experience. Whether it's a motherboard or a USB SSD or a goddamn printer, unboxing is great fun. People even make videos about it. And however you feel about Apple, you have to admit that the Cupertino phone company does good packaging. The box for the Mac Studio even comes with a carrying handle, and when it opens up the sides fall away to reveal the slab of sharply milled aluminium inside in an act of theatre to rival the moment a magician unveils his lovely assistant from within a wooden box. At the time of writing, new Macs are packing variants of Apple’s M4 CPU, an ARM-based design that’s as far removed from the weak chip that powers your Android phone as a Siberian tiger is from a house cat. The basic M4 in the MacBook Air comes packing 10 cores and easily beats the Intel Core Ultra 7 265V despite being passively cooled, and what we’ve got here is an order of magnitude better. There isn’t just any M4 in the Mac Studio we've got our hands on, this is an M4 Max and, to use a technical term, it’s a bit powerful. The machine tested here is also£3,799/$3,699, around the same price as aRazer Blade 16 with an RTX 5080and an OLED screen, but we’ll gloss over that. CPU:Apple M4 Max (16-core)NPU:16‑core Neural EngineGraphics:Integrated, 40 coresMemory:128 GBStorage:1 TB SSDPorts:4x Thunderbolt 5, 2x USB 3 Type-A (5Gbps), 1x HDMI 2.1, 1x 10 Gbps Ethernet, 3.5 mm headphone jack; 2x USB-C (10Gbps, front), 1x SDXC reader (front)Wireless connectivity:Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3Dimensions:9.5 x 19.7 x 19.7 cmWeight:2.74 kgPrice:$3,699|£3,799 For your money you get a 16‑core CPU, and importantly a 40‑core GPU. The M4 version of Apple’s graphics chip supports ray-tracing, and in synthetic benchmarks it comes out somewhere around the RTX 4070 level, though direct comparisons between the different GPUs are tricky. It certainly beats the AMD Radeon 8050S in theAsus ROG Flow Z13, which is considered one of the better integrated GPU solutions at the moment. Our Studio also has 128 GB of RAM, which is probably overkill for gaming but makes sense when you consider the kind of tasks Mac power-users are likely to set their machines, and it offers a bit of future-proofing too, as the Studio can’t be easily upgraded once you’ve ordered it. It does all this in the kind of SFF case that makes the Fractal Terra look positively ginormous—there are smallermini PCs from the likes of Minisforum, but not many with this kind of power—and it pulls about 100 W all-in. There's a fan in the case, but it’s not required a lot of the time, and you’ll never know it’s there unless you’re making it work exceptionally hard. Also, being a modern desktop Mac, you get loads of Thunderbolt 5, an HDMI 2.1, 10 Gbps Ethernet, some 10 Gbps Type-C ports and 5 Gbps Type-A ports, and even an SDXC reader. It can output to five monitors at once, and is well equipped for life on a desk. Wi-Fi is version 6E, which is surprising as you’d expect Apple to have the latest, but it’s good enough. Mac gaming has come a long way in the past few years, but things aren’t perfect yet. When I installed Steam onto the Studio, I was interested to see how much of the PC Gamer benchmark suite (TM) would be supported, and… it’s not much. While anative version of CyberPunk 2077with ray-tracing should be released later this year, crucially it’s not out just yet, and the benchmarkable games tend to be older ones from the days of Kaby Lake. There are a lot of games with a native Mac version on Steam, and there are versions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Mirage on the Mac App Store, for just two examples. Combined with an M-series Mac’s ability to run iOS apps this means a lot more games are available, though these are often mobile ports meant for the iPad. Still, from Steam alone it’s possible to have a very good time on a Mac. There's Metro Exodus, Frostpunk 2, Civ VII, Stardew Valley, WH40K Rogue Trader, XCOM 2, Alien Isolation, a few COD games and lots more, though it’s still a much slimmer selection than that faced by Windows gamers. What Shadow of the Tomb Raider shows us is that, despite the high performance level of the M4 Max’s GPU, it’s still not quite enough to get to 60fps in 4K/highest. Interestingly, the 4K score is exactly what our reference RTX 3070 hits. The stats the game provides show it GPU-bound 99% of the time in 4K, so we’re really maxing out those graphics cores. It’s definitely playable, though dropping down to 1440p produced something much more palatable to modern high refresh-rate monitors—and it still showed as GPU limited 98% of the time. At 1080p this drops to 53%, suggesting 1440p is very much the sweet spot here. We've also got some comparative numbers for Warhammer III, where the newRTX 5060 Tiis delivering the same sort of 4K frame rates as the M4 Max here. Shadow of Mordor has some weird video options, so I chose something close to 4K and got a playable frame rate in its benchmark tool. The 1440p and kind-of-1080p settings show the kind of frame rate increases you’d expect, with 1440p looking like a great option across all the games we tested, and only Shadow of Mordor showing outrageous dips in frame rate to completely unplayable levels when running in slightly-more-than-4K. ✅You want a device that will help earn you money and lets you game on the side:Use it for your video work, your graphic design, or whatever creative earns you money, with gaming as a happy little secondary activity once the working day is over. It does well at just about anything. ❌You're after a mini PC just for gaming:Literally anything else will do for gaming. Buy a Steam Deck, buy an HP Omen tower, buy a Switch, but this inevitably makes no sense as a primary gaming computer. In the synthetic CPU benchmarks, the M4 Max puts out some excellent scores. For comparison, aRyzen 7 9800X3DI happened to have laying around scored 132 in Cinebench’s single-core test, a 36% win for the Mac, and 1336 in the multi-core test, for a huge 57% increase in the M4 Max’s favour. This is to be expected when you pit a 16-core chip against an eight-core one, even one as beastly as the9800X3D. The 16-coreRyzen 9 9950X3Dand the nominally 24-coreIntel Core Ultra 9 285Kboth post better multithreaded scores, but are still a mile off when it comes to single core performance. You’d never buy a Mac Studio like this as a gaming PC, but if you want to take some time off from visualising a striking new brutalist architecture, torturing LLMs or designing a novel form of minimalist coffee cup, slip off your black-framed glasses and recline in your Herman Miller for a while, then the M4 Max will give you a satisfying experience at 1440p, though I suspect you may have to turn it down to 1080p for more modern games, especially once that ray-traced version of Cyberpunk arrives. A professional tool at heart, the Mac Studio with M4 Max offers enough graphics power to make a decent gaming machine too.

    "article_text": "My Kappa husband is waiting for me. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tales of Seikyu, the fantasy farming simulator set in a world of cheeky yokai, is coming to early access on May 21. In theannouncement post shared to Steam, details were shared on what to expect from the early access version of the game. You'll be able to farm and explore the countryside as you could in the demo, while also mastering three yokai transformations and uncovering a handful of secrets about the playable characters' ancestry. There is a limit to how much you can do though, and you won't be able to progress much further than the first chapter to start. Within this chapter, you'll be able to do all the classic activities of life sims. So, farming, fishing, cooking, and home/character customisations. You'll also have the opportunity to romance six villagers at the start, but according to the Steam announcement the game will be updated regularly with more romance options and heart-event progression. If you played the Steam Next Fest demo, you'll also be able to pick up where you left off without having to start fresh. So if you've made any sort of progress with the yokai inhabitants of Seikyu, you won't have to sacrifice your relationships to keep playing in early access. Arelease date trailerwas also released to coincide with the early access announcement, showing off the world, snippets of farming and decorating, and interactions with several characters. Having played the demo, it doesn't seem like there is a huge difference in the game's visuals, but that doesn't make it any less enchanting. Although I've alreadyexpressed my gripes with how empty the world seemedwithin the demo, there does seem to be a bit more life in its rolling hills in the early access release. The Steam announcement also revealed that the team behind Tales of Seikyu is keen to hear any sort of feedback or suggestions coming off the back of Early Access to help \"shape the future of the game\" and shared a link to the official feedback form, alongside the social media pages for the game should you encounter anything worth sharing during your adventures in Seikyu.

    "article_text": "Jason's a veteran, and everyone is on the make. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Following last week's announcement of a delay to Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar has sugar-coated the pill withthe release of a new trailer. It mostly focuses on Jason and Lucia, who seem to be the dual protagonists of the game and, surprise surprise, get in over their heads when \"an easy score goes wrong.\" Alongside the trailer, Rockstar's official websitewas also updatedwith a ton of new information about the characters and the game. Jason Duval \"grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new [...] Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.\" Lucia Caminos was taught to fight by her father \"as soon as she could walk\" and all that fighting led her to the Leonida Penitentiary. \"Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson—only smart moves from here. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan—no matter what it takes.\" Then we get a rundown of some of the game's supporting cast. Jason's buddy Cal Hampton is an online conspiracy theorist who's \"safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open [...] Cal is at the low tide of America and happy there. Casual paranoia loves company, but his friend Jason has bigger plans.\" Then there's Boobie Ike, one of the few to turn his youthful indiscretions into a \"legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio—Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.\" In the game, his focus is all on Dre'Quan Priest and Only Raw Records: \"now they just need a hit.\" As for Dre'Quan, he \"was always more of a hustler than a gangster\" and breaking the music scene is the goal. Doubtless they'll be crossing over with Real Dimez, two women called Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high-school friends who have \"the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.\" They had an early hit but have gone off the boil, and are now signed to Boobie Ike's Only Raw Records, \"hoping lightning can strike twice.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then there's career criminal Raul Bautista, \"a seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent ready to take the risks that bring the biggest rewards.\" One suspects that Bautista may be the starting point for GTA 6's version of GTA Online: \"Sooner or later, his crew will have to double down or pull their chips from the table.\" Finally we get Brian Heder, who seems to be the kingpin of Vice City's criminal scene. A \"classic drug runner\" from the \"golden age of smuggling in the Keys\", Heder is \"still moving product through his boat yard with his third wife, Lori.\" He's the character we see in the new trailer pulling up to hassle Jason, who's living rent-free in one of his dilapidated properties on the seafront. Heder \"looks like a Leonida beach bum\" but \"moves like a great white shark\", and his apparent benevolence towards Jason extends only insofar as Jason \"helps with local shakedowns, and stops by for Lori’s sangria once in a while.\" GTA 6's second trailerfocuses on Jason and Lucia, but we get a brief glimpse of all of the above characters. As ever, Rockstar's telling a story through an ensemble cast of apparent lowlifes and hustlers with big dreams, and this feels like a setting where absolutely no-one has their shit together. It's also by a distance the most visually stunning game I've ever seen: the delay certainly hurts but, by god, it sure looks like this game is going to be worth it.

    "title": "Deadlock goes full second breakfast by having another, secret playtest tucked inside the first one—with all-new heroes and a redesign of everyone's favourite gargoyle gal",
    "article_text": "Yes, we've had first leaked playtest. But what about second leaked playtest? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you're at all familiar with Deadlock, you might remember some hullabaloo about its 'open secret' status during early testing. Valve's new MOBA/shooter was kept very much under wraps, with the companyplaying coy right up until the finish line. Even now, it's still invite-only. Why? Beats me, since getting a pass to go play isn't really hard. Valve really likes its secret playtest servers, though, as a top Deadlock streamer by the name of Deathy accidentally popped open the wrong client while on Stream. They quickly deleted it, mind, but the internet is forever, and players with a quickdraw print-screensnapped some images(viaEurogamer). What those images reveal is that Deadlock now has a second, more secret playtest tucked inside the first one. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a third, even more occult playtest you had to access by blending and drinking a piece ofGabe Newell's yacht,or something. How far down does this thing go? In terms of revelations, there's a bunch of great-looking heroes to look forward to: The Scholarly-looking \"Bookworm\", a straight-up bellboy \"Doorman\", and the \"Drifter\", who is smiling at me in a way that better not awaken anything in the darker parts of my soul. There's also apparently a second Lash dubbed Skyrunner—likely just placeholder art. In fact, some of the thumbnails for existing heroes are completely different. Abram's grown some stubble, McGinnis has traded her welding mask for a Rosie the Riveter-style bandanna, and Ivy is suddenly, uh, less scrungly. In case you're unfamiliar, Ivy is a gargoyle gal from Deadlock who quickly became a fan favourite and thesubject of much fanart, thanks to her sweet personality and appeal to—let's call them 'monster girl appreciators'. Some of the art is tasteful and impressively-rendered, other pieces are… less tasteful, and still somehow impressively rendered. No judgement here, artists gotta make a living. A constant through-line of this fanart was that Ivy was rendered in a cuter, more cartoon style, while her in-game model's a lot crunchier-looking. Well, this test server sees her undergoing some major stonework surgery, taking a chisel to her fangs, bringing her eyes more central to her face, and giving her big, floppy ears. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Beers and beaches, that's Florida. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Grand Theft Auto 6finally got a second trailer, pretty much out of the blue, and while it may be short, I'll take pretty much anything right about now after the news that itwon't be releasing until 2026. Instead of giving us a wider take on life in Florida, this trailer opts for a more focused view on the two main characters of the upcoming game, Lucia and Jason. It all starts with Jason living out what I can only imagine is an average day in his life, lifting weights, drinking beer, and robbing a liquor store. But then he goes to pick up the Bonnie to his Clyde, Lucia, who's just out of prison. Chances are we're watching what will be essentially the tutorial for GTA 6. You'll start as Jason, run a few errands and pick up Lucia on her prison release, and then the game focuses on the couple getting on the up and up. We get more of an idea of how these two interact with one another and a slight glimpse of what the story could revolve around. I heard the words \"a new life\" uttered a couple of times, which makes me think they're going to start off fresh, probably by robbing more people, but that'll only be a means to an end. But otherwise the whole thing looks really fucking cool. Just when I managed to convince myself that I'm not actually that excited for GTA 6, to try and numb the pain of the delay, Rockstar goes and releases a trailer like this, which manages to make me just as amped for GTA 6 as I was when the first trailerreleased back in 2023. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Intel Arc Celestial discrete GPUs have hit pre-silicon validation and that makes me a little more hopeful for their eventual launch",
    "article_text": "Though validation could take a while. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The discrete version of Intel's upcoming Arc Xe3-based GPU line, Celestial, took a larger step towards full production as pre-silicon validation began. However, so much has changed for Intel as of late that it's not quite a guarantee of the company's commitment to discrete GPUs. This is all according to a reported LinkedIn post spotted by X accountHaze2K1(viaTechPowerUp). In it, the post claims discrete Celestial GPUs have hit pre-silicon validation. This means that, whilst the architecture of the card and the basic hardware have been developed, the silicon chip used in it has not yet been produced. Intel's Tom Petersen claimed on apodcastback in December 2024 that Xe3, the architecture Celestial is based on, is \"pretty much baked\". He said that the software team have a lot to work on in regards to Xe3, but the hardware team has mostly moved on to whatever comes after Xe3. If the pre-silicon phase goes well and testing of the card begins, TechPowerUp suggests this could lead to \"volume production by the end of the year or in early 2026\". However, in response to TechPowerUp's post,Haze2K1clarified their information was \"actually from months ago\". This leaves the further development of discrete Celestial cards up in the air. In January, we had the chance to sit down for a roundtable with Jim Johnson, the SVP of Intel's Client Computing Group. In this, he told us he was \"confident\" about the launch of Celestial, following the recent release of Intel's Battlemage. In this, Jim Johnson said some of the conversation around Celestial internally was about whether it would be discrete or integrated first. Notably, this answer wasn't framed as an either/or, more so a 'which one first'. They cooking Intel Arc Celestial 🧑🏻‍🍳 #IntelArc pic.twitter.com/A7s219tM1uMay 2, 2025 Things have changed quite a bit since we spoke to Jim Johnson, though. Lip-Bu Tan took over as Intel CEO in March, and a well-known leaker suggested that the high-end Battlemage card wascancelled. As well as this, Pat Gelsinger, the previous Intel CEO, said that there's \"less need for discrete graphics\" back inNovember. Though Gelsinger is not with the company any more, this communication has certainly worried those looking for Intel GPUs, especially as some rather liked the budgetIntel Arc B580card. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Discrete Intel Celestial moving into pre-silicon validation is certainly a good sign for the card but, knowing the information is now months old, Intel may have changed its approach since. Thebest graphics cardsare more than just raw hardware. Graphics card manufacturers also have to get their software stack fully formed and ready to go. For Intel, this is slightly helped by the efforts to get the current generation Battlemage cards up-and-running. However, there are a lot of software barriers in the way of catching up with both Team Green and Team Red, and we don't yet know if Team Blue is up for the challenge. Panther Lake, Intel's next lineup of CPUs, is due to launch at the end of the year, and early reports suggest there are gaming performance gains to be had. You'd hope so, after the gaming performance losses of the current generation. The integrated GPU is said to be a Celestial one, so we will see Celestial in some form fairly soon. For the sake of having better competition in the market to take on the current giants, I certainly hope we get further commitments to the discrete market from Intel, but all eyes are likely on its mobile CPU efforts, where it's trying to combat Apple, Arm, and AMD.

    "article_text": "My money's on Man 76. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The latest discourse circulating around the internet has been surprisingly divisive, because no, 100 men couldn't beat a gorilla in a fight, at least not without tools and coordination. But for those who aren't convinced,Overwatch 2has decided to test the query out by pitting 100 Soldier 76s against one Winston—oh, you thought there'd actually be a brawl between a gorilla and 100 men? Don't have the budget for that, but this is the next best thing. \"Join us along with some surprise content creators for an epic showdown,\" Overwatch 2 says onsocial media. The fight will be streamed today at 12pm PT/ 3pm ET/ 8pm BST, but otherwise, there are no other details about who will be involved or what the fight will actually look like. 1 Gorilla, 100 Soldiers: Who Wins? 🦍💯Join us along with some surprise content creators for an epic showdown between 1 Winston vs. 100 Soldier: 76 LIVE May 6 at 12pm PT 🏆 pic.twitter.com/LE45sjLDyEMay 2, 2025 My guess is that it'll just be hosted in a custom game with a giant Winston versus 100 mini Soldier 76s. There needs to be some size discrepancy, because I'm pretty sure a decent Soldier 76 armed with his pulse rifle could take on a bad Winston. So either they give Winston more health or restrict Soldier 76 to just melee damage, you know, for integrity's sake. But how will the current state of the meta impact this historic battle? I hear you. Winston is looking pretty good in the current game. Despite his base armour getting reduced inSeason 16's patch, his health was simultaneously increased. Winston has also just been pretty strong since his shield was buffed, and has quickly become a consistent top pick. Soldier 76, on the other hand, has also topped the roster. His sprint makes him hard to catch, and his pulse rifle and helix rockets are also consistent and easy to use, which I'm sure will come in handy. Because they'll need to be firing through 100 identical Soldier 76s to get at that lone Winston. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Again, no one knows what this fight is going to look like, so all of the bells and whistles to Soldier 76's kit could be useless if he's just running around and meleeing Winston's knees. But as some players have pointed out, the devs need to do something to ensure this fight actually lasts longer than 10 seconds. \"Mildly serious, but the only realistic way I see this going longer than three minutes if they round up every single dev just lined up on one PC like that long line in SpongeBob to 1v1 a Stadium perked-up Winston,\" aplayer says. But regardless of how Overwatch 2 manages to pull it off, it seems like most people are just excited to watch the show. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I never cared about OWL or Contenders or any of their competitive eSports,\" anotherplayer says. \"But for this, I'll be ready and seated.\" I have to say I'm pretty intrigued to see how this plays out, even if it does wrap up quickly. It's probably one of the funniest bits Overwatch 2 has been involved in for a long time and a welcome break from someweird online shenanigans.

    "article_text": "There's not much to go off. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hobbit life simulatorTales of the Shireis setting up for its launch in July, andan Inside Look videohas been uploaded to share an update on development. Spotlighting elements of gameplay like farming, personalities, andhow decorating your home works, there's a lot on display to encourage making the experience your own. The Inside Look also features a spotlight on character customisation, which is one of the elements particularly marketed to help make your experience with Tales of the Shire unique to you. However, as much as the game is presented as your key to Hobbit life, I can't help feeling like the features on display are still incredibly lackluster. When I played the demo of Tales of the Shire in September 2024, I was prettyquick to complain about the lack of unique appearance in each Hobbit. Although you are given the freedom to change your face, ear, and body shape, skin tone, haircut and personality, the sliders still feel limited and only slightly change your appearance. Obviously they aren't shown in detail during the update video, but from what we can see each slider doesn't look much different, despite the UX designer stating \"We want to make sure that you can change everything from your face shape to your foot hair.\" Unfortunately, things just don't look as in-depth as I imagine a lot of players would want the experience of creating their Hobbit-y self to be. The emote library shown off in the same video does seem to bring a bit more life to the character sprites, which is something I look forward to seeing in action throughout the game. Dialogue between characters has been carefully created with gestures to make these interactions worth listening to and more lively, and even though these animations are over-exaggerated and cartoonish it definitely fits the aesthetic Tales of the Shire has built for itself. But even though I'm not feeling particularly enthusiastic about the character customisation, the Inside Look video definitely reassured me that the natural world is still well worth exploring. Between foraging and hunting down various critters across the map like insects and fish, there is something enchanting about its appearance which makes me feel hopeful that, character creator aside, I’ll be able to enjoy the mechanics of Hobbit life regardless of the looks.

    "title": "Nvidia announces RTX 5060 release date of May 19 for both the $299 desktop GPU and $1,099 gaming laptops",
    "article_text": "The budget graphics silicon is hitting just before Computex... where another budget GPU beckons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia has finally announced the RTX 5060 release date, its latest RTXBlackwellgraphics card and the most affordable to date. Theoretically. With a $299 starting price, and no Founders Edition card to help enforce that never-more-ephemeral MSRP, there's precious little to make one confident that will sticker price will be stuck to. Precious little save for the fact that you can still buyRTX 5060 Ti 8 GB cards for only $40 higher than MSRPtoday. So maybe, just maybe there will be a sub-$300 out there for PC gamers on a budget. That said, theRTX 5060 Ti 16 GB version—un-arguably the more desirable of that model of GPU—is either out of stock or far too close to $500 to make it a comfortable purchase. The good news of all this, however, is that down at this level of graphics card pricing is too tight to allow much wiggle room in terms of spiking pricing. The 8 GB RTX 5060 Ti being available for $420 puts an immediate hard ceiling on the sorts of excessive pricing that could be slapped onto the RTX 5060. The market itself might actually keep these cards in check and that should be good news for PC gamers looking for a decent card at a decent price. We still don't have final specs for the RTX 5060 GPU itself, with only the TFLOPs count and memory bandwidth numbers actually given by Nvidia itself for the version of the GB206 it's using inside the new card. But we can kind of extrapolate from what we do know, and from what the consistent rumours have been up to now. Essentially you're getting a ton more memory bandwidth and a theoretical 26% increase in raw GPU performance, if you just take the TFLOPs figure alone. RTX 5060 (*unconfirmed) RTX 5060 Ti GPU GB206 GB206 TFLOPs 19 24 CUDA cores *3840 4608 SMs *30 36 RT cores (4th Gen) *30 36 Tensor cores (5th Gen) *120 144 Memory 8 GB GDDR7 16 GB / 8 GB GDDR7 Memory bus 128-bit 128-bit Memory speed *28 Gbps 28 Gbps Memory bandwidth 448 GB/sec 448 GB/sec Price $299 $429 (16 GB) / $379 (8 GB) Release date May 19 April 16 How that will translate to gaming performance, well Nvidia inevitably wants to quote the Multi Frame Gen figures as it pertains to frame rates. When it comes to Black Myth Wukong and Alan Wake 2 that will net you six times the performance of an RTX 3060, with other games offering 4x MFG frame rates in the order of three to four times that of the old classic GPU. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In real terms, with just plain ol' raster (a dirty phrase in Nvidia HQ) we're probably looking at between 20 and 25% higher performance. That is still not a bad return, and arguably one of the highest potential gen-on-gen uplifts of the RTX 50-series outside of theRTX 5090itself. Launching just the day before Computex—which starts on May 20—is an interesting choice, especially considering we're anticipating theAMD RX 9060 to be announcedat its keynote with Jack Huynh on May 21. There have even been rumours of an Intel B770 making some sort of appearance at the show, too. Interestingly, Nvidia also notes that RTX 5060-based gaming laptops will also finally see the light of day come May 19, with affordable machines starting at $1,099 which is a teeny bit cheaper than the RTX 4060 systems started out life at. These will be super-interesting laptops, and if MFG can deliver decent gaming image quality on an RTX 5060 GPU, they will absolutely be thebest gaming laptopsfor budget gamers.

    "article_text": "Stretchable panels are aimed at cars but what else could they be used for? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bendable, even foldable screens are already very much a thing. But what about stretchable? Yep, that's the next step in malleable OLED panel tech. LG has announceda new stretchable OLED paneldesigned for cars that promises to turn surfaces that used to be pepper with controls into displays. According to LG, the new stretchable OLED panel can extend by up to 50% while maintaining a pixel density of 100 DPI. LG doesn't say what the panel's native pixel density is, but we assume it's higher than 100 DPI and reduces to that figure when stretched. \"A conventional vehicle's center fascia area requires a separate automotive display and physical buttons. With the application of a Stretchable display, however, the screen can freely expand, allowing the display and buttons to merge seamlessly into a single screen,\" LG says. \"When the screen is touched, the previously flat display flexibly expands and protrudes touch buttons, making it easy to operate even while driving.\" Presumably, graphical elements could be rendered to compensate for the \"stretch\". It's an interesting compromise between touchscreens and physical controls. The auto industry is currently in something of a transition phase when it comes to the balance between the two control types. Car models including the entire Tesla range, VW's ID sub brand and Volvo's latest EVs such as the EX30 have come in for criticism for what some see as the excessive use of touchscreens to replace physical controls for features such as climate control and audio functions. The argument is that touchscreens can't be used by feel alone, unlike physical controls, which means drivers have to take their eyes off the road. LG's new stretchable OLED tech could solve that problem by allowing the drive to choose which controls are used most frequently and then mapping those to a virtual button that extends from the display and can be felt without direct viewing. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If that's cars, this new display tech will surely be used in other applications. Bendable OLED displays like the Corsair Xeneon Flex are already a thing for the PC,even if we've yet to be terribly convinced by the idea thus far. At first glance, if seems a bit niche on the context of PC gaming. Maybe you could have a secondary panel with the extendable tech that could be used to mimic the control panel for a vehicle, for instance. Imagine a control panel on a door or, I dunno, a space ship flight deck, in a game scene. Maybe a rendition of that could suddenly appear in some form on the flexible display. No doubt someone will come up with a more compelling application for stretchable screen tech than that, but the possibilities seem pretty open ended. Watch this space, but we suspect stretchable displays with arrive on the PC in some form, eventually.

    "article_text": "With better reasoning ability comes even more of the wrong kind of robot dreams. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remember when we reported a month ago or so that Anthropic had discovered that what's happening inside AI models isvery different from how the models themselves described their \"thought\" processes? Well, to that mystery surrounding the latest large language models (LLMs), along with countless others, you can now add ever worsening hallucination. And that's according to the testing of the leading name in chatbots, OpenAI. TheNew York Times reportsthat an OpenAI's investigation into its latest GPT o3 and GPT o4-mini large LLMs found they are substantially more prone to hallucinating, or making up false information, than the previous GPT o1 model. \"The company found that o3 — its most powerful system — hallucinated 33 percent of the time when running its PersonQA benchmark test, which involves answering questions about public figures. That is more than twice the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s previous reasoning system, called o1. The new o4-mini hallucinated at an even higher rate: 48 percent,\" the Times says. \"When running another test called SimpleQA, which asks more general questions, the hallucination rates for o3 and o4-mini were 51 percent and 79 percent. The previous system, o1, hallucinated 44 percent of the time.\" OpenAI has said that more research is required to understand why the latest models are more prone to hallucination. But so-called \"reasoning\" models are the prime candidate according to some industry observers. \"The newest and most powerful technologies — so-called reasoning systems from companies like OpenAI, Google and the Chinese start-up DeepSeek — are generating more errors, not fewer,\" the Times claims. In simple terms, reasoning models are a type of LLM designed to perform complex tasks. Instead of merely spitting out text based on statistical models of probability, reasoning models break questions or tasks down into individual steps akin to a human thought process. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. OpenAI's first reasoning model, o1, came out last year and was claimed to match the performance of PhD students in physics, chemistry, and biology, and beat them in math and coding thanks to the use of reinforcement learning techniques. What is artificial general intelligence?:We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. \"Similar to how a human may think for a long time before responding to a difficult question, o1 uses a chain of thought when attempting to solve a problem,”OpenAI said when o1 was released. However, OpenAI has pushed back against that narrative that reasoning models suffer from increased rates of hallucination. \"Hallucinations are not inherently more prevalent in reasoning models, though we are actively working to reduce the higher rates of hallucination we saw in o3 and o4-mini,” OpenAI's Gaby Raila told the Times. Whatever the truth, one thing is for sure. AI models need to largely cut out the nonsense and lies if they are to be anywhere near as useful as their proponents currently envisage. As it stands, it's hard to trust the output of any LLM. Pretty much everything has to be carefully double checked. That's fine for some tasks. But where the main benefit is saving time or labour, the need to meticulously proof and fact check AI output does rather defeat the object of using them.

    "title": "Analyst claims Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is selling twice as fast as any other recent JRPG has on Steam—and it's got me wondering what the secret sauce is",
    "article_text": "Looks like PC gamers love Clair Obscur (hi, I'm PC gamers). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 might be a front-runner for my own GOTY personal pick in 2025—its hooks are well and truly in my skin, ticking all the right boxes for my inner RPG and Sekiro freaks. A banger soundtrack, gripping story, and an all-around good first showing from Sandfall Interactive has seen it reachmajor success, despite living in Oblivion Remastered's shadow. In fact, it's apparently outselling Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Persona, and Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth at a whopping 2:1 ratio. That's per analyst Rhys Elliott, who recently spoke toGamesindustry.biz. Here's a handy graph shared by the site to put it in perspective: \"According to Alinea Analytics' data,\" the report reads, \"The game has sold more than 785,000 copies on Steam in its first week—more than twice the sales of any recent comparable games in the Japanese RPG style, including last year's acclaimed Atlus title, Metaphor Re:Fantazio.\" It should be noted that analytics companies like these tend to play the exact methodology behind their numbers somewhat close to the chest—this is all educated guesswork, rather than an official source with a concrete grip on actual sales. Though, given Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 bumped up itsall-time peak to 145,063on SteamDB last weekend, we can at least assume it's donepretty well compared to the competition. The report also keenly points out that, of these competitors, only one of them (Persona 3 Reload) had a simultaneous Game Pass launch on PC—which is even more impressive. You don't have to play full-price for Clair Obscur at the moment, but PC gamers very muchwantto. I'm deeply enthusiastic about the game myself—currently grinding at the 60-hour mark to knock over its final postgame challenge—but I can't help but wonder what the secret sauce is, here. Not because ol' 33 doesn't deserve the praise, but because Metaphor: ReFantazio was also a game that obsessed me for 80+ hours—and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth wasn't any industry slacker, either. Why is Clair Obscur flying while other very good JRPGs waddle on Steam? Here's a few theories I've got kicking around in my skull. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I hope it's not that last one, for the reasons I'm about to get into. The éléphante in the room is that, while Clair Obscur has a ton of JRPG paint in its palette, it has western stylings and trades out the belt buckles for baguettes. There might be a perception that its more anime-inspired contemporaries, such as Metaphor: ReFantazio, are all about cartoon twinks talking about their feelings and killing god—a cliche putdown I'm quoting, but don't put much stock in. Well. I mean—look. Metaphor: ReFantazio does feature acartoon twink or two, and they do talk about their feelings, and they kill something approaching god—but it's also a deeply political fantasy story with stellar character development and some real, actual bite and blood to it. If anyone's steered away from that game because they're afraid of an artstyle, I'll be very sad. As for all the other reasons on that list? I think it's a little from every column, and Clair Obscur deserves its accolades andsanté-s. Especially since there's achance we'll be getting more out of it, and I need more Monoco in my life.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A witty take on sci-fi and co-op that’s teeming with life and begging for you to get creative with its gadgets. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The first thing that hits you is the way your character walks. There you are, excreted out into the furthest reaches of the universe by an uncaring colonisation corporation, made redundant by said corporation immediately upon hitting terra firma and left to scrabble around for scattered survival packages that will allow you to just barely continue existing. And yet you're swaggering around your new home planet like you're the luckiest space pioneer ever to be laid off. What is it?A comedy co-op metroidvania with an impressive ecosystem.Release dateMay 8, 2025Expect to pay$40/£33DeveloperRaccoon Logic StudiosPublisherRaccoon Logic StudiosReviewed oni7 9700K, RTX 2080 TI, 16GB RAMSteam DeckTBALinkOfficial site That bouncy walk cycle is a great marker of Revenge of the Planet's endearingly upbeat take on sci-fi and social commentary, and also a great marker of how well realised that tone is throughout each of the game's component parts. Alex Hutchinson's Racoon Logic studio seems to have diligently branded every wall texture, creature noise and item upgrade with the same unifying irreverence, creating a satisfying whole that feels a bit like, and only very slightly in an unnerving way, stepping inside the writers' minds to enjoy a kind of walk-in closet of a joke. In more material terms, it's also a very well constructed metroidvania of the same calibre as its predecessor, featuring survival elements, a steady upgrade path, and a brilliant ecosystem of flora and fauna whom you can manipulate to get around, harvest resources and now, troll your co-op buddy relentlessly. The second thing that hits you is the goo. Great globules of the stuff, everywhere, colour-coded to indicate its various status effects. Some creatures or planets spew it out passively. Others leave gruesome puddles of it when you kill them. Whatever the origins, there's more gunge laying around on these four planets than a Nickelodeon studio set circa 1996. And naturally, the first thing you'll think when you see it and realise that it makes some areas slippy, or on fire, is:I bet I could lay a trap for my co-op companion with this.Personally, I haven't had this much fun messing about with colour-coded status effects in a co-op game since Divinity: Original Sin, and it's striking that Racoon Logic hasn't just ticked the co-op box, but instead really thought about how to make cooperative play fit within the game's identity as an abdurdist improv comedy sandbox. Yes, it's important that there's local/split-screen co-op now, but it's just as important that I perfected the art of making slippery green goo slopes with lava goo at the bottom, and that my friends repeatedly fell into those traps. Veterans of 2020's Journey to the Savage Planet will recognise plenty about this sequel, despite the perspective shift from first to third-person and a newfound emphasis on platforming. Once again there's the impressive variety of big-eyed, gently cooing creatures who populate the alien landscape, and the ways they can be culled, corralled or fed to giant plants in order to aid your progress. The metroidvania-style backtracking through outlandish landscapes painted in robust colour, and the excitement of figuring out that once you've upgraded your jetpack, or whip, or water cannon, now you can clear that obstacle that was blocking your way three hours ago. That joy of exploration, in a vivid ecosystem that seems to be constantly interacting with itself independently of you, is the beating heart of this game—as it was in the last—but structurally the way that exploration happens is quite different. Before there was just the one titular Savage Planet. As you journeyed through it, one distinct biome gave way to another every few minutes, lending the sense of an epic journey in even a short play session. Then there was the enormous tower at the centre of planet ARY-26, looming large and full of secrets on the horizon at the start of the game. It was an early hook—you absolutely had to know what was at the top of that tower. Where there was once one planet, now there are four of them. It makes a lot of sense on paper—it's a sequel, so let's go bigger—and there is a pleasure to travelling between planets with distinct looks, creature populations and design motifs. But it's a different, lower-key pleasure than the kind that its predecessor served up on that one, densely packed, varied location. This isn't another case of an open-world developer setting you among acres of meaningless empty space, mind you. Each planet retains a hand-crafted feel, built in a patchwork of distinct areas that connect without loading times, and which contain their own hidden secrets, multi-path verticality, and mechanical challenges. Instead, it feels like a developer pushing back the boundaries in order to let you make a bigger mess when you're playing in co-op. And it does that well. Even aside from the knack Savage Planet has for serving up opportunities for two of you to combine your tools to apply a status effect to an enemy and then deal damage, there's also such a variety of objectives that you can divide them up between the two of you and play semi-independently. One heading off to gather silicon while the other hunts for a rare creature to lasso and capture, before you reconvene back at your space trailer and buy a new pinball machine to cheer the place up a bit. Where all that multi-planetary space feels a bittoospacious is during solo play. I know how that sounds. 'Co-op game is shockingly less fun alone'. But given how well its predecessor handled both, it's worth raising. Even when playing alone, though, many qualities come to the fore here that are genuinely rare to find in modern releases. Not only are your tools and weapons intrinsically fun to use, the resource-hunt to upgrade them doesn't feel overly grindy and each new level of the upgrade tree gets you thinking about what you can do in the world now. When you scan objects, plants and creatures, every new description has a turn of phrase that'll make you smirk, and a tidbit that deepens your understanding of the universe you're in. Every new video you unlock from your various corporate bosses feels like a treat. It's a game that's spent all its energy on getting its component parts to function well and serve up opportunities for player expression, instead of incentivising a battle pass purchase. How sorely we need games like this in 2025. It's also a game with a specific vision for the experience it wants you to have with it, and that's carefree fun with a friend, not a hardcore solo grind with a second screen full of crafting recipes and boss fight guides. I'd hesitate to say it's a casual experience, but if you turn up expecting No Man's Sky with fart jokes you won't get the mechanical depth you bargained for. Then again, nobody would look at that walking animation and expect anything other than what Revenge of the Savage Planet delivers. A witty take on sci-fi and co-op that’s teeming with life and begging for you to get creative with its gadgets. Phil 'the face' Iwaniuk used to work in magazines.

    "title": "'He's very good at finding really cool people': Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's director found its composer on Soundcloud and lead writer on Reddit",
    "article_text": "No offers found Soundcloud is pretty goated to be honest. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33completely blew my expectations out of the water. Its story and combat quickly became all-consuming—I sank 13 hours into it over just one weekend. But the best part of this French RPG has to be its soundtrack, which is apparently all thanks to just one composer. Lorien Testard had never worked on a videogame before (viaBBC) and was discovered by Expedition 33's director, Guillaume Broche, onSoundcloud. He then proceeded to make the entire score, comprising 154 songs and clocking in at an impressive, and slightly terrifying, eight hours and nine minutes long. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together But it seems like it was meant to be from the very beginning, as Broche says that they were just on the same wavelength. \"When we discussed the game for the first time, we had exactly the same references,\" Broche says in an interview with the BBC. \"We loved the same thing. We watched the same things. The discussion was so fluid.\" I pretty much have the soundtrack running all day on Spotify, with my favourite song being Monoco's theme, because who doesn't love listening to jazz while fighting bosses? The album has sincepassed 1.5 million track streamsand was the number one selling album on Bandcamp last week. \"I call this the Guillaume effect,\" the lead writer, Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, says. \"He's very good at finding really cool people.\" Somehow it worked, which still makes no sense to me after all these years. Broche also managed to find his lead writer via unconventional means. Svedberg-Yen initially applied for a voice acting role via Reddit. \"I saw a post on Reddit by Guillaume asking for voice actors to record something for free for a demo,\" Svedberg-Yen says. \"I was like: 'I've never done that, it sounds kinda cool', so I sent him an audition.\" The audition obviously went well as Svedberg-Yen was actually cast as a major character in an early version of the game, but after a couple of rewrites and role switches, she then became the lead writer. Broche seems to think the two factors helped massively in his bid to fill roles in the development team: Covid-19 pushing more creatives to display their art online, and a healthy dose of luck. \"It's always the same story,\" Broche says. \"I have a list of 15 people to contact, and I'm like 'Okay, I'm probably going to get maybe no one at all', and every time, the first one is like, 'Yeah, let's do it'.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Finding an outstanding composer via Soundcloud and a clearly very talented lead writer on Reddit isn't just impressive, it's also a great way to cut costs. Expedition 33 has managed to rival games worked on by hundreds or thousands of devs with much more money. \"We have, I think, an amazing team, mostly of junior people, but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented,\" Broche says. \"Somehow it worked, which still makes no sense to me after all these years.\" Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "article_text": "No offers found Get a load of this absolutely cracking event. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Any time there's an opportunity to run a quirky seasonal event,Hello Kitty Island Adventureis happy to oblige. So, it's not surprising that a month-long celebration for all things eggs, the Month of Meh, is the current one underway. The Month of Meh event is here to celebrate Gudetama, one of Hello Kitty's friends known for being lazy. But despite this emphasis on doing very little, there's a lot of tasks you can get on with completing around the island which'll give you access to exclusive rewards. There's plenty of time for you to work towards earning these items too, since the event won't come to a close until May 31. However, getting these gifts isn't as straightforward as it seems. You'll be able to collect Yolks around Friendship Island while the event is on, which serve as your key to unlocking anything event exclusive. To get Yolks, you'll need to take photos with Nisetama, the man dressed as an egg who will randomly appear around the island once a day. Fret not, his location is marked on the map, or you can ask the egg shrine (yep, there's a whole shrine dedicated to it) for a hint if you really can't find him. Or, you might just want to avoid him altogether, since he definitely doesn't fit the normal cutesy vibe of Hello Kitty Island Adventure. One picture with Nisetama will reward you with seven Yolks, which you can offer to the Gudetama egg shrine for some rewards. The challenge of tracking him down is marked in your daily quests too, just in case you forget it's one of the main factors of the event. While you're on the hunt for him, you'll also find Friendship Island covered in giant eggs which you can break. These will give you whole eggs rather than just Yolks, which can be used for multiple things like recipes or trading with Tuxedo Sam and My Melody for more exclusive items. But, if you'd rather just go about your normal island life, then you can completely ignore the Month of Meh event. Apart from the occasional cutscene, the massive golden shrine dedicated to Gudetama at the bottom of the plaza, and the mass of giant eggs to break around the map, it's a pretty easy event to walk past each day.

    "article_text": "No offers found The new Blackwell workstation cards are out in the wild, and are almost affordable if you can get the right grant. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While most of us are desperately hoping for even the chance to buy a flash new consumer grade GPU, others walk a different, higher path. Half the PC gaming community is scrambling to even save the cash it takes to get something like an overpricedRTX 5080, while the rest who have the money can't necessarily find a retailer stocking them. This has led to some people finding their own solutions, like going toJapan to buy cards,or just buying something much, MUCH more powerful. Nvidia's new RTX PRO 6000BlackwellGPUs have finally become available with the first batches already making their way to customers. These pro units aren't in the same tier as our typical gaming cards, instead made for things like intense rendering and the creation of huge models. They're absolute beasts,packing 96GB of VRAM. These are pro cards for actual professionals, not just pro gamer skills. But that doesn't mean it's not a pro gamer move to try and score one. VideoCardzspotted listings for the new Blackwell GPUs at retailers, as well as a Reddit post where one lucky poster got their hands on one such card. The cards are listing at around $9,000 USD with VAT included, which it likely would be given these are a professional tier card. That's a huge price hike over even the inflated costs of very fancy gaming equipment, but it gets a little bit more reasonable when you hear more of this redditor's story. Scrolling throughthe thread, more than a few people were curious as to how Redditor Recurrents came across the card. A bit of digging through the replies reveals they lucked out getting an allocation someone else had wanted from the first batch. This also included a grant from Nvidia providing a $5,000 discount on the card. This means the RTX Pro 6000 likely put Recurrents back by about $3000-$4000 USD. $4,000 is a huge amount of dollerydoos to throw at a GPU, but after some mild rationalisation it doesn't sound too insane.Nvidia's RTX 5090's MSRP is around $2,000 anyway, and with shortages, taxes, and general demand it hasn't been uncommon to see listings charging even more for them. $4,000 on a card about three times as powerful suddenly isn't looking too shabby, assuming your PC could even run it. Unfortunately it looks like that grant is a difficult one to get. If it's the same as what's listed on the Nvidia website you likely need to be a \"full-time faculty member at an accredited academic institution that awards research degrees to PhD students.\" I've reached out to Nvidia to clarify, just incase there's a more accessible option.

    "article_text": "No offers found All these features for under $60 could make this a winning budget friendly option. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to budget-friendly controllers, 8BitDo is a brand that's been known to punch above its weight. Our Jacob was super-impressed with the value in itsUltimate 2C wireless controllerwhich felt like a far more premium device than the price tag suggested. Now 8BitDo is back with the new Ultimate 2 wireless controller, which offers a few upgrades that could be well worth a look for PC controller enthusiasts wanting to spend under $60. The caveat here is theUltimate 2looks like it's kept the 2C's fatal flaw, which for our reviewer was the overall size of the unit. While most controllers mimic Microsoft's Xbox shape and size, the 8BitDo's Ultimate series have been styled more after the Switch. This provides a much slimmer experience, which you'll either love or hate. If you're a big fan of the Switch's Pro offerings then read on, but if a more splayed out controller is for you, the updated features likely won't mean a damn. As always, for your health—both mental and physical—comfort should be king. For those still interested, it looks like the Ultimate 2 is keeping the excellent 2.4G connection that gives under 1 ms of latency that impressed us before. This also boasts no lag within a 10 m connection, which is great news for more competitive PC gamers. I don't think I've ever been 10 m away from my PC while gaming on it, so as long as your loungeroom isn't a literal corridor I'm thinking most should be set with that. For everything else there's also a Bluetooth connection available. The sticks feature tunneling magnetoresistance tech, otherwise known as TMR. This is thought to bea step up from Hall Effectwhich is all the rage at the moment, though we weren't massively impressed with our first controller to use the tech:GameSir's Cyclone 2. Like HE, TMR uses magnetic signals rather than physical ones which tend to be better for the life of the switch. TMR is a bunch more complicated though, and generally thought of as more accurate and precise. It's often found in higher-end devices, so seeing it in this controller is a real win. The sticks are also surrounded by rings of programmable LEDs just to really highlight how futuristic they are. The triggers on the other hand are Hall Effect, but they have a few extra tricks up their sleaves. These can be switched between linear and and tactile modes depending on your preference. Above these are the bumpers which are not only boasting fast action, but are said to be remappable, and this is actually one of the most important features for me, personally. In games like Hades or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, or even Avowed I remap the dash to a bumper as it's easier to quickly tap without having to move off the face buttons. I am also known for destroying the bumpers on controllers because of all the action they get, so I'd be keen to see how these ones the 8BitDo are rocking can hold up to some frequency dash abuse. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The last notable improvement appears to be the D-pad. The Ultimate 2C's was flagged as a con in our review, but hopefully this one is better. 8BitDo is not specific about the improvements, but has listed it as \"a refined D-pad for enhanced control and faster response,\" so I'm hopeful get something much more satisfying on the Ultimate 2. Aside from that you get the usual slew of face buttons and what not, as well as a few programmable back buttons to boot. While on the 2.4G connection you can even use the 6-axis motion control for FPS that support it for that touch of extra accuracy. The controller is available in black, white, or purple and comes with an included matching charging dock for $60 USD, €60, or $90 AUD. That's of course assuming those in the United States can order them with8BitDo no longer shipping from its China warehouse after Trump's Tariffs.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheDestiny 2Edge of Fate livestreamis set to reveal the next year of content for Bungie's looter shooter MMO. Now that Heresy is drawing to a close, concluding the episodic seasonal structure that's run over the last year, we can expect to find out more about what's set to come and what exactly we'll be getting in terms of new stuff. As per usual, the stream is running right before the game's new update, adding theRite of the Nineevent that sees us delving into past dungeons to earn perk-refreshed guns and even adept weapons. It's hard to know what the next year of Destiny 2 will look like, especially now that development is kicking into final gear forMarathon, so here are the details you need to watch the stream. The Destiny 2 Edge of Fate livestream airs onTuesday, May 6, in most places, though the time will of course vary depending on where exactly you're located: You can watch the stream in a few different ways; either through theDestiny 2 YouTubechannel, theBungie Twitchchannel, or, since I've included the stream at the top of this article, you can even watch it right here with us... Typically, these livestreams show off all of the content that's set to arrive in the upcoming year, but there's a lot more riding on this one. With the new episodic structure coming to a close, it's hard to know what to expect from Destiny 2's new seasons, especially now that development on Marathon will likely be a big priority for the company. It's hard to know how much content Destiny 2 players can expect and what the scope of it will be, but we'll find out a lot more in the livestream later today.

    "title": "Cryptocurrency investors are being targeted for ransom, kidnappings, and mutilations across France, with abductors demanding between $6M and $10M in crytpo funds",
    "article_text": "No offers found Crypto's lack of accountability is painting targets on investors backs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Crypto-investors have become the target of a string of kidnappings taking place across France and Western Europe. Police are currently investigating whether or not the cases are linked after freeing the latest victim from a home south of Paris last Saturday. Across the cases kidnappers are demanding ransoms in crypto, likely due to its untraceable and somewhat lawless nature. With demands of around $6 million for the safe return of a loved one, having obvious ties to crypto companies seems to be akin to painting a target on ones back. The most recent case saw a 60-year-old investor abducted by several men in ski masks who forced him into a van in broad daylight. According toThe Guardian, the kidnappers cut off his finger (presumably with a tiny guillotine) to send as ransom to his wealthy son, with whom he co-owns a crypto marketing company. During the ordeal he was held captive for two days while the attackers made their demands. It wasn't until the armed police raid on Saturday when he was freed, and five men in their 20s were arrested. \"The victim appears to be the father of a man who made his fortune incryptocurrencies, with the crime involving a ransom demand,\" said the state prosecutor in a statement. But this case is far from unique. On January 21, David Balland, the co-founder of the crypto firm Ledger, and his partner were abducted from their home in central France. The pair were attacked early in the morning and then separated. Balland was taken to a house where he also had a finger mutilated for ransom demands before being saved by a police raid. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a different location not long after. Not long before that, in late December there was an alleged kidnapping where a Dubai-based French crypto influencer's father was targeted. This took place in eastern France where the father and his wife and daughter were tied up and thrown in a car. The wife and daughter were later released while the father was later found tied up in a car boot. This is on top of other similar reported events in other parts of Europe. At least with the mining of popular cryptocurrencies, such asBitCoin becoming beyond unprofitable, hopefully we'll see less crypto millionaires for these kidnappers to target. Now Police are investigating whether all these crimes are linked to some sort of higher purpose of conspiracy or if they're all just perceived as easy targets. A bit like the$65,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency heiststhat all linked to one guy. Though none of the reported kidnappings seem particularly successful at collecting any ransom, crypto would be a relatively safe way to do it. It's just about finding someone who's got enough of it to make it all worthwhile. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Most of the ransoms demanded were between $6 and $10 million dollars worth of crypto, so these attackers are looking for people guaranteed to have their digital wallets well and truly stuffed. And it makes sense, crypto's lack of accountability does make it a prime target for criminal transactions. While none of the reports here had the ransom paid, if they did the kidnappers could in theory get away scott free with little to no trace. Especially if those receiving the money are several steps separated from the kidnapping portion of the crime. This no doubt makes anyone advertising their crypto holdings a tasty target for these criminals. If you're in Europe and you're rolling in crypto I'd recommend keeping that to yourself for a while. Advertising your holdings seems a bit like the modern day equivalent of wearing fleur-de-lis silk britches in the late 1700's.

    "title": "Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 3D gaming monitor review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 3D visuals plus spatial audio in one monitor? Yup, there's an awful lot to process with the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27. While it's ultimately unsuccessful, it is a tantalising glimpse of a possible future. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. As long as I've been in this technology media game—and the origin story there dates back to the early Mesozoic—some company or other has been trying to flog 3D display technology. So far, none of it has stuck.Even Nvidia's 3D Vision goggles didn't catch on. Could that be about to change with the newAcer Predator SpatialLabs View 27? Put simply, is this the glasses-free 3D tech you've been waiting for? When it comes to gaming, and without wishing to give away too much, too soon, the simple answer is, nope, you probably won't want to buy this monitor for gaming. However, at its best this fascinating 3D display is stunning; an experience you won't quickly forget. Hold that thought and get comfy, there's a lot to get through when it comes to the technology involved here. In simple terms, what you're looking at here is a 27-inch 4K gaming monitor with an IPS-type panel (actually AHVA, but that's splitting hairs) and 160 Hz refresh support. It's pretty well specified with a glossy panel coating and plenty of connectivity, including USB-C. What you don't get is any kind of HDR support, not even basic VESA DisplayHDR400. That's not a disaster given most LCD-based monitors with claimed HDR support deliver little by way of true HDR visuals. But omitting even basic HDR signal decoding is rather stingy, especially considering the painful asking price. Oh yeah, did I mention, this thing costs $1,999 or £2,199. Holy moly. Screen size:27-inchResolution:3,840 x 2,160Brightness:400 nitsResponse time:5 msRefresh rate:160 Hz3D technology:2D/3D Switchable Lenticular LensHDR:NoneFeatures:AHVA panel, Audioscenic spatial audio, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-CPrice:$1,999|£2,199 Of course, this is no ordinary 27-inch 4K panel. You can guess that from the slightly unsightly oversized bezels. These are needed to house tracking cameras, and some odd-looking speakers tacked onto the lower bezel. For starters, the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 offers glasses-free 3D visuals. The glasses-free bit is absolutely critical since the need to wear some kind of goggles or headset has arguably been the chief impediment to widespread adoption of many previous attempts at 3D visuals. With this Acer monitor however, you don't need to wear anything or really evendoanything. The 3D effect just works. How is that possible? The short answer is a combination of eye-tracking camera tech and lenticular lenses. The long answer involves the lenticular lenses sending a slightly different image to each eye, creating the illusion of a fully 3D image. It's fundamentally a complex active technology, which applies both to the eye-tracking camera and the lenticular lenses and that explains why it hasn't been done before. At least not at a vaguely accessible price point. Oh, and one more thing. Not only does this monitor have visual 3D capability. It also has integrated 3D sound courtesy of a spatial audio system from UK outfit Audioscenic. Yeah, it's a lot to take in, whether for your ears or your eyes. So, what's it actually like? The answer is that it depends on what you're doing, watching or playing. By way of example, Acer has included an app for viewing 3D models, individual game figures, vehicles, things like that. You can load up one of the provided models, including an armoured personnel carrier, and then manipulate it, spin it around, zoom in and out, that kind of thing. And you know what? It looks totally incredible. It takes a moment for your eyes to adjust, but once they do the illusion of, well, 3D-ness is remarkable, even tangible. It absolutely looks like the model is sticking about a foot or so right out of the screen. It's very convincing and feels like you could reach out and touch the thing, at which point the illusion inevitably breaks down. Anyway, for engineering, science and medical applications, I'm sure it's fantastic. But what about for gaming? Running an entire game world is a very different discipline and for that task, this 3D technology is far less successful. For starters, the effect is less consistent when multiple objects are being rendered. Whether it's an eye adjustment thing or a limitation of the lenticular tech, you tend to find only the object you're focussing on reliably resolves properly, with other elements in your peripheral vision tending to suffer from a noticeable double-vision effect. It feels like you're looking at a miniature version of a world, not a life-sized universe. That detracts from the overall sense of peering through a window into a fully realised 3D world. You do get that up to a point, but it's not a consistent experience. The other problem is that when it does work, the impression you get isn't of a life-sized 3D vista, but more a scale model. Let me explain. Imagine a 3D object sticking out of the screen, perhaps a tank or a person. Well, that object obviously isn't life sized and that's very much the impression you get—of a scale model rather than the full-sized object viewed at distance. It feels like you're looking at a miniature version of a world, not a life-sized universe. All told, and combined with the double-vision thing, the overall experience is fairly patchy and a bit distracting. Personally, I wouldn't want to game with this technology as it currently is. But apart from the actual visuals, there are other drawbacks from a gaming perspective. It's a little bit of a palaver getting games running. You'll need the Spatial Labs Experience Center app installed, then SpatialLabs TrueGame, which is a gaming platform that's superficially similar to Steam, but just for 3D games. Of course, first you must also install any given game using whatever the normal method is, for instance via Steam. Then you manually point the SpatialLabs TrueGame app at the installed location. Just for the record, specific per-game support is required.You can check out the full list here.In terms of sheer numbers, it looks decent. But on closer inspection you'll find a lot of the titles are older, mediocre affairs, while many, perhaps most, of the latest and most compelling releases simply don't feature. For now, at least. It's also worth noting that image quality takes a hit with the 3D effect enabled. As a consequence of 'projecting' a different image to each eye, the lenticular lenses effectively cut the resolution of the image in half and give the screen a slightly odd, grainy look. It's a little like an old CRT displaying interlaced video. What's more, even when the 3D effect is disabled, the image is slightly impacted if you view the display off-center in the vertical axis. It's subtle and the best equivalent I can think of is the circuitry that can occasionally be just about visible on some touchscreen panels. It's not a major issue, but when you're paying this much for a display, any slight flaw becomes significant. As for the 3D spatial audio setup from Audioscenic, it's a somewhat similar story. To be honest, it's a little overshadowed by the 3D visual tech, which is enough alone to be getting your head and eyes around, let alone having another novel technology to absorb. The spatial audio probably deserves its own, dedicated, debut. Whatever, to cut a long story short it too can work well, but has limitations. Like the 3D visuals, it relies on a camera and head tracking, which is fine. The first problem arrives with the built-in speakers. They're necessary, as opposed to using whatever speakers you already have, because their location needs to be very carefully calibrated. The actual sound quality simply isn't terribly good. In theory, that is possible with the end-user's speakers. In practice, the calibration requirements would be too onerous. Anyway, the speakers look like a fairly ugly afterthought and they are pretty small and offer limited dynamic range. That makes it a little tricky to fully appreciate the clever spatial effect that the Audioscenic system is capable of producing from mere stereo speakers. To an extent, it can fool you into thinking sounds are coming from all around you, which is a nice trick from just two speakers. But the actual sound quality simply isn't terribly good. On a more positive note, the Audioscenic system is compatible with any game with spatial audio, so it's much more widely supported than the SpatialLabs 3D visuals. But, while it does have some advantages over a half-decent set of cans—including the sense of sounds coming from a distance—I'd personally prefer the headphones for the massively richer and more dynamic audio experience. ✅You fancy a novel 3D experience:When the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 works, it's a stunning 3D experience that you won't quickly forget. ❌You want a compromise-free 4K gaming monitor:Even for a 4K gaming panel, this monitor is super expensive and the 3D visuals are dubious for gaming. Oh and one final comment regarding broader usability. To enable all its features, this monitor needs to be connected via both a display input and via a USB-A to USB-C cable. Hardly the end of the world, but that cable clutter slightly adds to a sense of a complicated and slightly unfinished technology. So, what to make of the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 overall? There's some seriously clever technology here. Almost too much to process from a single product. But from a purely gaming perspective, it's clearly suboptimal. If you could have this technology for only a small price premium, it could be interesting as an occasional diversion. Perhaps the 3D effect could be toggled for specific elements of a game where it works really well. But given the huge added cost, there are just too many limitations. As for the spatial sound, in some ways it works better than the 3D display aspect. But it has its own limitations and, again, isn't something we'd want to pay heavily for in this format. All told, then, the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 makes for a fascinating tech demo. But as a product, something you might actually buy? In that context, it's a lot less convincing, especially at its current sky-high pricing. 3D visuals plus spatial audio in one monitor? Yup, there's an awful lot to process with the Acer Predator SpatialLabs View 27. While it's ultimately unsuccessful, it is a tantalising glimpse of a possible future. Jeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography.

Sail straight through to a nice, clean, winning row of green letters with our easily accessed answer to the May 6 (1417)Wordleif you're in the mood for a quick win. And if you're in the mood for a longer session, we can still help. We've got general tips ready to check out, as well as a clue for today's puzzle too. I learned a lot today. I wish what I'd learned hadn't been 'this particular combination of green letters has way more valid possible answers than either I realised or I had rows to poke around with' but here we are. Still, that's all part of the fun, isn't it? To see four green letters and still not be sure what's going to happen next. That's what I'm telling myself, anyway. Connection is key today. A furniture set. A series of interconnected hotel rooms. Several pieces of music designed to be played together. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. A little help. The answer to the May 6 (1417) Wordle isSUITE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "article_text": "No offers found Netflix's most popular show gives us a glimpse of its endgame coming this June. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When we last saw Gi-hun, also known as Player 456, he'd rejoined the gladiatorial Squid Game and sparked a rebellion to shut it down for good. Surprise, surprise: his uprising failed, and in the teaser for Squid Game Season 3 we see Gi-hun respawn in the lobby for one more round. There's not much longer to wait for the endgame: Squid Game Season 3 arrives June 27. Here's the teaser: The teaser doesn't show us a whole lot (it wouldn't be much of a teaser if it did) but there are a few rather alarming, if not completely heartbreaking, details. We get a glimpse of a new game, which begins with players using one of those big capsule vendors (like a big gumball machine that dispenses prizes) to collect a colored ball. This vending machine appears to be used to divide players into teams, blue or red, and horrifyingly, ultra-sweet mom Geum-ja draws a red ball and her doofus son Yong-sik winds up with blue. C'mon. Did you really have to do that to us? We all know Squid Game is gonna end with a horrifying and tragic bloodbatch, but boy, this feels like it's gonna be especially difficult to take. I can't really glean much else from the teaser, but the cop who spent the entire last season fruitlessly searching for Squid Game Island apparently finds it—I assume he's on the correct island this time or he'd have wasted an entire two seasons doing absolutely nothing useful. We also see the return of the wealthy masked viewers from Squid Game Season 1, who somehow bankroll this entire operation but only show up to start watching toward the end. That's rich people for ya. They have luxury box seats for the baseball game and don't even show up until the 7th inning stretch. The teaser ends with the sound of a baby crying, which feels like bad news but maybe isn't? That sound means pregnant contestant Park Mi-yeong finally gives birth, and Squid Game HQ feels like the worst possible place to welcome a new baby. But the teaser has faded to black at that point, so who knows: maybe she escaped alive and gave birth somewhere safely with a huge plastic pig full of money to guarantee her child's future? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I expect Squid Game Season 3 will be big: Squid Game Season 2 was Netflix's second-most watched non-English show of all time, only coming in behind, you guessed it, Squid Game Season 1. This is the final season of the show, but that doesn't mean that's the end of Squid Game: as recently as last year, rumors started floating around about an American adaptation, though nothing official has been announced.

    "title": "You can now edit images in Gemini directly",
    "article_text": "And upload a bunch of photos all at once When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google's Gemini AI is taking out a canvas and palette for your AI-fueled image creation in a couple of major upgrades. Gemini can now edit images directly within its chat interface, and you can send a bunch of images (or other files) for it to examine at the same time. The new editor can work AI magic on any image you upload or that Gemini produces. You simply ask Gemini to make the changes you want. You can change the backdrop of your vacation photo to put your sad Airbnb kitchen on a Santorini cliff, get rid of that mustard stain on your jacket, and even put a funny hat on your dog despite her refusal of all headwear in real life. You can apply multiple edits through your conversation with Gemini, stacking changes as you go. And each modification keeps earlier changes, so you don't have to start from scratch when you decide the last couple of edits made things worse. Under the hood, Gemini’s editor is running a combination of tools that work together so you don't end up with a visual Frankenstein's monster stitching together conflicting textures, lighting, angles, and other aspects of the image. Gemini promises to keep things grounded in reality even when your imagination goes off the rails. Google claims the editor will have many positive uses for a range of professions. Teachers could quickly build illustrated storyboards, designers could make a portfolio of product photos, and architects might visualize tweaks to building designs mid-meeting. The editor pairs nicely with Google's move to blow up the single-file upload limit for Gemini. Now you can upload up to ten images, PDFs, or other files all at once and ask Gemini to make sense of the mess. You may be wondering how Gemini's editor will prevent people from leveraging its abilities to make deepfakes of real people or events for less than benign reasons. Google is keen to show that the company has thought of that. That's why every AI-edited image gets not one but two watermarks. One is visible, and one uses Google’s SynthID, which can only be detected with software. There are also filters powered by human feedback that block ethically dicey requests. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The editor and expanded upload option are not breaking new ground, but they add depth to Gemini. It’s not just about what Gemini can tell you, it’s about what it can help you make. Google is investing a lot of effort in building Gemini into the kind of well-rounded, versatile toolkit that people are comfortable relying on. Instead of thinking of Gemini as a mere digital notetaker or search engine with a sense of humor, Google wants people to view Gemini as a partner in creative and productive tasks. We’re still a ways off from a world where you ask Gemini to “design a birthday card and bake the cake,” but it's closer than you might think. Until then, being able to throw ten files at Gemini and have it respond with something coherent while also placing a hat on your dog is a pretty good start.

To mark its 50th anniversary, Buffalo has introduced a special editionexternal HDDdubbed the Skeleton Hard Disk (HD-SKL). This drive reimagines the company’s 1998 skeleton model and offers a rare peek into a hard drive in action - something even thebest SSDoptions can’t provide. Through its transparent window, users can watch the magnetic head move as it reads and writes data, enhanced by a companion Windows app called \"SeekWizard.\" The software allows the drive to perform demonstration seek patterns - such as sequential and random seeks - transforming the HDD into a visual showcase of mechanical data retrieval. Founded in 1975 by Makoto Maki, Buffalo is celebrating its evolution from an audio-focused firm to a major player in PC peripherals. Its original Skeleton Hard Disk, released in 1998, had a 4.3GB capacity and featured a transparent cover. The 2025 special edition is limited to just 50 units, and while the design nods to nostalgia, the HD-SKL features a high-end aluminum chassis, precisely milled and anodized in matte black, echoing the style of the 3533 yarn drive player Buffalo launched in the late 1970s. Inside, the HD-SKL offers 4TB of storage and connects via USB 3.2 Gen 1, with backward compatibility down to USB 2.0. It also supports the Micro-B port. The drive comes preformatted in exFAT for broadoperating systemsupport, though USB-C users will need to supply their own adapter.

    "article_text": "Three in four tech leaders say they trust robotics for essential functions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. New research from QNX claims over three-quarters (77%) of global tech leaders trust robotics for essential workplace functions, and the future of the workplace could soon be more automated. The report predicts one-fifth of the workforce could be automated via robotics within the next decade, with 71% of organizations already using or planning to adopt robotics soon. As a result, the global robotics market is projected to grow to $163.9 billion by the end of this decade, up from $51 billion in 2024. The report added managers note safety and risk mitigation and reliability and performance as key drivers of trust in robotics, with automation emerging as the most common use case (50%), next to production (46%), support (36%) and high-risk tasks (28%). However, QNX highlighted varying levels of comfort for executives working alongside robots. Assembly (77%), material handling (73%) and logistics/delivery (70%) are areas where managers are happy to introduce automation, however fewer are comfortable with robotics in medical procedures (51%), customer service (55%) and maintenance (63%). Additionally, one in three (32%) say that workplaces are not prepared for robotics, with 29% having already experienced a robotics-related safety incident. Three in five (58%) also expressed security concerns.

    "title": "Jeep signals the end of an era for gas guzzling off-roaders, as all-new compass goes hybrid or electric only",
    "article_text": "One of Jeep’s most popular models gets a stylish makeover… and battery packs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Despite Jeep being about as American as peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, the Stellantis-owned manufacturer is making waves in Europe with its line-up of electrified SUVs. The smaller Avenger model, which is available in fully electric, hybrid and petrol versions, has already proven a success story, blending the brand’s renowned off-road prowess with a compact and practical everyday crossover vehicle. Now the new Compass hopes to build on these successes with all-new looks and a highly electrified selection of powertrains. It will compete in the growing C-SUV segment in Europe, whichAutocarclaims is expected to be 90% electrified by the end of 2026. Turning its back on the gas-guzzling image that chunky models like the Wrangler and Gladiator bring to mind, the new Compass is built on the same Stellantis STLA Medium architecture as Peugeot, Vauxhall and Citroen mid-sized SUVs – many of which sport highly electrified powertrains. The combustion-powered Compass will have the option of \"mild hybrid\" and plug-in variants, which predominantly use the engine to power the car but either increases overall efficiency (mild hybrid) or adds all-electric driving options for a short distance (plug-in). But Jeep says the pure electric version comes with either a 211bhp or 229bhp motor mounted to the front axle, offering 311 miles of range from a smaller 73kWh battery or up to 404 miles from a range-topping 96kWh pack. The most expensive all-electric models, badged 4xe, arrive with an additional motor on the rear axle, delivering Jeep’s famous Selec-Terrain all-wheel-drive and offering up to 370bhp and a staggering 3100Nm available at the rear wheels thanks to a 14:1 rear reducer. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This allows the Compass to climb a 20% slope, Jeep says, even with zero traction on the front wheels, as the sheer grunt from the rear wheels can handle the heavy lifting. Charging rates are up to 160kW, allowing for a 10-to-80% recharge in 30 minutes, and the battery electric range is touted to be in excess of 400 miles. The 4xe model also receives improved ground clearance thanks to a 100mm increase in suspension height and a number of off-road-specific touches, such as knobbly tires and a more aggressive, scuff-resistant body kit. First Edition versions of the Compass, which feature all of the previously mentioned range-topping kit, are available to order now, with first deliveries expected at the end of the year in Europe. Further markets are expected to follow suit thereafter. Most automakers are having a rough time getting onboard with the electric revolution, not only persuading customers that it is a good idea, but also making the entire expensive endeavor profitable. However, there are a number of brands that will naturally find it harder than most, with Jeep mentioned in the same breath as Ferrari, Lamborghini and a handful of performance car-makers struggling to convince customers that electrification is the answer. After all, Jeep has forged a reputation over the past 80 years for producing highly capable, combustion-powered off-roaders that can go anywhere. By its very nature, the electric vehicle can’t exactly “go anywhere”. Well, not until someone invents a Jerry Can-sized portable battery that’s capable of adding at least 300 miles of range and can be topped up in a matter of minutes from any, easily accessible charging station. But Jeep knows that the only way to make money is to chase the most popular sectors, with the Avenger already proving a sales success in the compact SUV sector, shifting more than 2.5 million units worldwide. The company hopes it will achieve similar results with Compass in Europe and further afield. Although reassuring the North American market that battery electric and plug-in hybrid powertrains are a good alternative to the 3.6-liter V6 currently found in Gladiator models will be a much tougher task. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four.

Puget Systems has announced a new5-Node 6U Rackstationbuilt with game developers in mind. The new 5-Node 6U Rackstation reportedly offers an efficient, space-saving solution for studios needing flexible and powerful systems. Each chassis fits five individual workstations in the footprint of a large desktop, with up to 35 systems in a standard 42U rack. What’s interesting is that if you clickhereyou’ll see the Ryzen 5-Node R550-6U entry in the middle of the page. Underneath this, it lists theAMDoptions - Ryzen 9000 and EPYC 4005. Puget notes, “It can also be a great solution for multi-screen installations, saving space compared to five desktop towers or even 2U / 3U size systems.” Designed for tasks like 3D modeling or automated testing, each node supports the latest Ryzen CPUs (more on that in a minute) and top-tier GPUs. Nodes are individually serviceable, allowing for minimal downtime. Puget says artists can access systems remotely through tools like Parsec, while QA teams benefit from a versatile testbed. This setup gives teams more performance per rack without sacrificing flexibility or ease of management.

Modular computing devices are meant to offer flexibility, but the new Kingdel PHX18/K3mini PCseems to prioritize form over function. The device offers respectable performance and some versatility, thanks to its two-piece magnetic design andAMDRyzen processors. The base model includes an AMD Ryzen 5 6600U, a 6-core chip with integrated Radeon graphics. A more powerful configuration features the Ryzen 7 7840U with RDNA3 graphics. It comes with up to 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and storage starts with a 512GB NVMe SSD, expandable via a second M.2 slot in the modular base - up to 8TB in total. The PHX18/K3 separates the main computing unit from its base, allowing users to run the PC standalone via USB-C or attach the lower section for more ports and additional storage. While the modular design is novel, it raises questions. Why separate access to key connectors? Even with the base attached, it doesn’t offer much more than most integrated systems. Since the split doesn’t result in major savings or expanded functionality, the design feels like a solution in search of a problem. Connectivity includes USB4, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, dual 2.5G LAN ports, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2. The system supports8Kvideo output at 60Hz withHDRand can drive up to three displays at once.

I had plenty to say in myEpson QL7000 review, but the highlight was undoubtedly its unmatched brightness. You see, projectors generally provide low brightness compared to thebest TVs, and any ambient room light will lessen the dynamic range of pictures, blunting the impact of highlights and raising black levels so that shadows end up lacking detail. For most owners of thebest projectors, watching a movie, TV news and sports means dimming the lights or darkening the room completely. Home theater enthusiasts go to great lengths to create ‘blackout’ conditions for viewing, painting rooms a dark gray and adding treatments to walls and windows to prevent any stray light from reducing the contrast of the projected image. Pricier examples of thebest 4K projectorssuch as the JVC DLA-NZ800 andSony Bravia Projector 8top out at a relatively modest 2,700 lumens brightness. The Epson QL7000, in contrast, has a specified 10,000 lumens brightness, a level that you typically see in professional projectors used for large entertainment venues. Yes, the QL7000 is the brightest projector I’ve ever tested, and by a significant margin, with its projected image easily viewed in daylight. So surely it's a home run, right? As I noted in my review, “Even when watching in a bright room with light streaming in from windows, the crisp, clear4Kimage beamed by the QL7000 had a true window-on-reality quality.” That’s not something I’ve ever come close to being able to say about any other projector I’ve tested, and the QL7000’s stunning brightness made watching the NBA basketball playoffs on the big screen an incredible treat. Bright as it may be, the Epson QL7000's black levels and shadow detail came up short in my testing. Although the projector’s powerful brightness elevated its contrast ratio to 68,000:1 (with its laser light output set to 30%) – a great result – shadows lacked the inky quality you can get from top home theater projectors, and that ultimately made movie watching less satisfying than sports viewing. I haven’t personally reviewed the JVC DLA-NZ800 projector mentioned above. But I have seen it, plus its even more expensive NZ900 big brother demonstrated at trade shows, and the deep, well-defined shadows both models deliver set a very high home theater projector bar. In TechRadar’sJVC NZ800 review, this section struck me as particularly apt: “Moving on toHDR, the NZ800 proves to be a stellar performer, delivering all the specular highlights of the sun-bleached desert landscapes ofDune Part Two, pulling out every detail in shadows during the nighttime action ofThe Crow, and reproducing the rich and saturated colours ofLa La Land, helping to replicate the Technicolor musicals to which it pays homage.” Of course, if you were to watch those same movies on the NZ800 in a bright room rather than the fully optimized, blacked-out conditions I experienced it in, the picture would quickly lose the powerful contrast that brought out detail in blacks, and madeLa La Land’s colorful costumes pop on the screen. And sports? Forget it. Brightness isn’t everything when it comes to picture quality – contrast and black detail are equally important. The recent DCI (Digital Cinema Initiatives, a motion picture and theater industry trade group) HDR specification calls for theater projection systems to provide a peak brightness of 300 nits. That level is substantially less than what the Epson QL7000 is capable of (I measured 1,005 nits on a 10% white HDR pattern in Natural mode with 100% laser light output setting, and 1,340 nits in Dynamic mode). If a movie theater projection system were to meet the DCI specification (many don’t), it would provide around the same peak brightness as top home theater projectors fromSonyand JVC. So, even with a projector designed for home, you’re getting an equally bright, and in many cases brighter, image than what you get in a movie theater. But brightness isn’t everything when it comes to picture quality – contrast and black detail are equally important. In an optimized home theater setting, fastidiously controlling the environment allows for the light emanating from the projector to be the only source of light hitting the screen, which maximizes black levels and perceived contrast. This gives home projectors another leg up on theater projection systems, where contrast is necessarily limited by the mandatory lighted exit signs located near the front of the room. The Epson QL7000's super-bright picture makes it an impressive projector that's uniquely suited for daytime viewing of sports. However, for movie fans, contrast and shadow detail are arguably of greater value when it comes to getting the best overall picture quality. And, given the right viewing conditions, even a projector with an average brightness level can get you pretty close to perfection.

    "title": "It's Wordle Day, according to its creators, and you can celebrate with a round of Wordle Golf against your friends",
    "article_text": "Shank is a perfect Wordle word When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The only thing missing fromWordle's status as a cultural institution was a day devoted to it, and now we have that, too. Welcome to Wordle Day, or May 6, to be precise. Why today? \"Because Wordle uses five letters with six guesses to find a secret word, we thought May 6 would be the perfect date to celebrate the game that has sparked a joyful daily routine for so many people across the globe,\" said New York Times Wordle Editor Tracy Bennett. Okay, that makes some self-serving sense, and who are we to argue with that logic when most of us are hooked on daily plays of the word game that asks us to figure out a five-letter word in six tries? If you have any questions about Wordle's popularity or why it deserves a day, look at these stats. According to the NYT, there have been, to date, 5.3 billion Wordle game plays. A massive 2.8 million people use the same starter word every day. Wordle' is certainly an institution here, where our dailyWordle today columnprovides some hints then walks you through how we solved it. I hope you don't read those posts before trying to solve the puzzle on your own, but you do you. Wordle is also a competitive sport. In my house, my wife and I end each evening completing several puzzles, including Wordle,Connections,Strands, andQuordle(the only non-NYT game). Wordle is invariably our first stop, and, yes, there is a competition to see who can solve it in the fewest tries. So, it should come as no surprise that to celebrate this totally made-up day, The New York Times introducedWordle Golf. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This is not another word game (thank goodness, I can't take on any more). Instead, it's a reimaginging of the standard Wordle competition into a golf game format. As with golf, there are 18 holes...or, er...puzzles. You can play against seven other players (or more if you, I guess, print out more Wordle Golf sheets). Each game is scored similarly to a golf game, meaning you want the lowest score (more strokes in golf raise your score and are generally considered a bad thing). The scoring system for Wordle Golf breaks down like this: In theory, you can spend most of May playing Wordle Golf, but it does mean that no one should skip a day. It's a silly game, but probably less difficult and frustrating than 18 holes on a real golf course. Who knows, if you're a real Wordle pro, this might be just the kind of challenge you've been waiting for. Let's just hope there's not another \"CORER\".

    "title": "Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer 2 live: analysis of the new GTA 6 trailer and all the latest news",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stop whatever you are doing right now, a new trailer forGrand Theft Auto6has literally just arrived. Developed by Rockstar Games,GTA 6is shaping up to be one of the most anticipated games of all time. The studio confirmed last week that the game will launch on May 26, 2026 - a delay on its previously announced 2025 release window. \"Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on May 26, 2026,\" a statement released by the company read. \"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.\" It also provided a reason for the decision, stating that \"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, andGrand Theft Auto 6is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.\" This latest trailer came out of the blue, and is presumably an attempt to help maintain all that hype now that we know the game is some time away. You can watch it for yourself below, plus follow along for all the latest updates and my own analysis as it comes in. Last week, Rockstar Games confirmed thatGrand Theft Auto 6will release onMay 26, 2026. This latest trailer reaffirms the fact thatGrand Theft Auto 6is coming toPlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Dash is a gaming expert, with years of experience writing about the biggest and best video games for a range of online outlets and national magazines. He has wasted thousands of hours playing games across countless genres, plus spent hundreds inGrand Theft Auto 5andRead Dead Redemption 2. From our first hints at what the story could be about to a cast of officially confirmed characters, the trailer (and corresponding update to the Rockstar website) taught us an awful lot aboutGTA 6. If you're online just tuning in to my coverage and want a concentrated run-down of all the biggest news, my colleague Freelance Writer Demi Williams has put together a list of the five biggest things that we now know. You can read the full list below. Great news everyone! After a shaky start, it looks like the Rockstar website is back online. It's got a wealth of screenshots to browse, so I'd recommend heading over there now. The trailer went live alongside two new pieces of key art for the game. Both show Jason and Lucia together and are follow that iconicGrand Theft Autostylized aesthetic. Of the two, the one with both characters at a dock is definitely my favorite. It's bright, colorful, and really highlights the iconic summery vibe of the Vice City setting. After briefly going back up, it looks like the Rockstar Website has buckled under the strain of eager fans booting it up to browse the latest details. I'm currently seeing the following error message while trying to get it on screen: Hopefully the website will come back online soon! Fans on social media are currently speculating that the trailer might give us our first glimpse at a fan-favorite returning character. Phil Cassidy, a prominent character inGrand Theft Auto: Vice CityandGrand Theft Auto: Liberty City Storiesmight be coming back, as there is undeniably someone that looks an awful lot like him in the trailer. We see a brief ad for a weapon store called Phil's Ammu-Nation, where the character is shown wearing a tank top with the store's logo on it. Now this could, of course, be a completely unrelated Phil, but given how much Rockstar tends to bring back familiar faces in its games it seems safe to assume that it is a modern interpretation of Cassidy. The final character detailed on the website is Brian Heder, a \"classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling\" currently living with his third wife Lori. The site reveals that Brian is letting Jason live rent-free in exchange for helping with his local shakedowns. This explains one of the scenes we see early in the trailer, where Brian arrives at Jason's home to ask him to get him his checks - presumably cash from nearby businesses. The website also introduces us to Raul Bautista. An experienced bank robber, he is searching for new talent for some fresh bank jobs. Raul could very well be part of the \"plan\" mentioned in Lucia's description. Will the story feature the pair robbing banks across Vice City for easy cash? It definitely seems likely, especially given the handful of shots showing what appears to be various robberies in the trailer. And now a little more on Dre'Quan Priest. A drug dealer turns music producer, Dre'Quan is moving up in Vice City. He's just signed the Real Dimez, two young rappers that are massive on social media and could be his ticked to mainstream success. The Real Dimez, Bae-Luxe and Roxy, are two long-time friends on the rise once again five years after their early hit single with a local rapper called DWNPLY. We've also got Boobie Ike (yes that is really his name). He's apparently a prominent figure in Vice City, owning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio. He is working in partnership with a \"young aspiring music mogul\" named Dre'Quan in a ventured called Only Raw Records. The duo are seemingly searching for the next big hit, which might prove an important plot thread in the full game. The official website now also tells us about some of the side characters that we can expect to encounter in the game. First up is Cal Hampton, a conspiracy theorist friend of Jason. From his description, it sounds like his laziness is going to be something of a contrast to Jason's own ambition. One of the things I like most about the trailer is its music, the 1986 song Hot Together from the album of the same name by the Pointer Sisters. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out why this particular song was chosen - with the lyrics \"we could be so hot together\" presumably meant to reflect to the partnership between Jason and Lucia. You don't need to whip out Shazam if you want to hear the full song, as I've found it on YouTube above. This trailer may have been captured on PS5, but that apparently hasn't stopped Rockstar Games from poking some fun at Sony's platform. What appears to be a PS5 parody console is visible in one of the trailer's interior shots. Don't quote me on this, but I do actually quite like the look - maybe a bit more so than the real life PS5 Slim. Here's one little thing you might have missed. The newGTA 6trailer ends with confirmation that it was \"captured on PS5.\" Although the majority of the scenes shown look like in-game cutscenes, it seems safe to assume that they are rendered in engine given the presence of this text. This is great news, as it suggests that the final game will have a similar level of graphical fidelity to this trailer. Given just how incredibly life-like the entire trailer looks, we might soon have one of the best looking games of all time on our hands. As for Lucia, it seems like she's going to be a bit of a loose cannon. \"Lucia's father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk,\" the site reads. She apparently just got out of prison and doesn't seem keen to return. She's dreaming of a good life for her mother who, interestingly, hails from Liberty City - another prominent location in theGrand Theft Autoseries. The website says that she is \"committed to her plan - no matter what it takes.\" What could this plan be? Presumably some kind of criminal enterprise. We'll just have to wait and see... So, on to what we can glean from the Rockstar website. One of the first things on the page is an introduction to our two protagonists - Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Jason is described as an ex army soldier working for a local drug cartel. Meeting Lucia, his lover, \"could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him.\" It seems safe to assume that their relationship is going to be a central part of the game's story. Unsurprisingly, it seems that the Rockstar Games website is experiencing heavy traffic right now. It appears to be down, which is pretty frustrating as it was just updated with lots of juicyGTA 6info. Luckily, we managed to collect most of it before the website crashed - so hang tight for the details! The description of the new trailer provides some interesting insight, namely through a shot plot summary that gives you a rough idea of what to expect from the story this time around. \"Vice City, USA,\" it reads. \"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.\" This, alongside dialogue in the trailer, finally confirms that the name of Lucia's partner is indeed Jason, something that has been rumored for some time. This is not a drill - the latest trailer forGTA 6has arrived. It gives us an extended look at the upcoming open world game with loads of stunning in-engine footage. Join me as I provide you with a steady stream of the latest updates surrounding this trailer drop, plus throw in some of my own analysis to explain some of the most interesting things that it shows.

    "article_text": "Cisco is working with Nvidia to create a Secure AI Factory using its new architecture When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidiais extending its AI ambitions into cybersecurity with the launch of DOCA Argus, a new software framework aimed at protecting AI infrastructure in real time. Part of Nvidia’sDOCA software platform, Argus runs on its BlueField networking hardware to detect and respond to threats as they happen, without relying on traditional host-based security tools. “Cyber defenders need robust tools to effectively protect AI factories, which serve as the foundation for agentic reasoning,” said David Reber, chief security officer at Nvidia. “The DOCA Argus framework delivers real-time security insights to enable autonomous detection and response - equipping defenders with a data advantage through actionable intelligence.” Argus is designed to operate independently of the system it monitors, avoiding integration into the host OS. This makes it invisible to attackers and avoids slowing down the system it protects. It works across containerized and multi-tenant environments, including deployments using Nvidia NIM microservices. Nvidia says Argus uses memory forensics to detect threats up to 1,000 times faster than existing agentless solutions. Because it doesn’t run on the host, it won’t impact performance. The system is built to work with existing enterprise security setups like SIEM, SOAR, and XDR platforms.

Cisco is working with Nvidia to create a Secure AI Factory using this architecture. “Now is the time for enterprises to be driving forward with AI, but the key to unlocking innovative use cases and enabling broad adoption is safety and security,” said Jeetu Patel, executive vice president and chief product officer at Cisco. DOCA Argus is part of Nvidia’s broader cybersecurity AI platform, which includes BlueField hardware and the Morpheus AI framework. The goal is to improve visibility and threat response across AI infrastructure. Argus is trained using Nvidia’s internal security data, with the aim of reducing false alerts and focusing only on real threats.

    "title": "As I predicted, Nvidia's RTX 5060 Ti 8GB will incur a 'motherboard tax' – it suffers a significant performance loss using PCIe 4.0",
    "article_text": "Can't say I didn't warn you... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidia's RTX 5000 series launch isn't complete yet, with the RTX 5060 now set to launch on May 19. However, RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GPU owners may be suffering a significant performance loss without realizing it. According toComputerBase, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GPU suffers a performance loss of up to 10% when using PCIe 4.0 over PCIe 5.0. This was previously rumored before its launch, as one ofMSI's models was leaked, revealing its PCIe x8 specification, which was purported to be a detriment to the 8GB VRAM version. We can now clarify that this is the case, as ComputerBase's tests reveal an average FPS of 44.3 using PCIe 5.0, versus an average FPS of 37.9 using PCIe 5.0 on the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GPU, based on performance across several games. This is an important matter for those using PCIe 4.0 motherboards; the 8GB GPU is already weaker than its 16GB counterpart and the likes of the RTX 5070 Ti, so further performance losses may hit consumers much harder. It points towards 8GB GPUs yet again, and whether they are enough to handle triple-A gaming today – and the evidence shows, they can't. Considering the 8GB VRAM capacity, I had a strong feeling that the rumor regarding the PCIe performance limitations was legitimate, and that appears to be the case. Gamers using more powerful GPUs like the RTX 5070 Ti or RTX 5080 might suffer little-to-no performance loss using PCIe 4 or lower instead of PCIe 5.0; and even if there was a sizable performance loss, it wouldn't be nearly enough to be frustrated over. However, with a much weaker 8GB GPU (and frankly, one that most consumers won't want to pursue), those performance drops will be more important as performance won't be great in GPU-intensive games to begin with. A lot of this can be resolved by lowering graphics settings or gaming at 1080p, but 8GB VRAM capacities can only last so long before it's completely untenable. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. If the message wasn't clear enough already, it's best to choose another card over the RTX 5060 Ti – unless you're okay with 8GB of VRAM and buying a new PCIe 5.0 motherboard...

Darcula, an infamous Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) kit, has helped hundreds of its users steal almost a million credit cards in roughly half a year’s time, cybersecurity researchers have said. Analysts from NRK, Bayerischer Rundfunk, Le Monde, and Norwegian security firm Mnemonic have been drilling deep into Darcula, which in just seven months between 2023 and 2024 served some 600 operators. The hackers were able to generate 13 million clicks on malicious links sent viatext messagesto targets worldwide - and as a result, were able to steal 884,000 credit cards. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Apparently, Darcula is focused on mobile platforms - Android and iOS, and uses 20,000 domains and can easily spoof well-known brands. It stands out from other similar platforms by using RCS and iMessage instead of the usual SMS, making its attacks more effective. To make matters worse, Darcula allows its users to auto-generate phishing kits for almost any conceivable brand, convert credit cards to virtual cards, and with the help of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), they can create phishing messages in almost any language and on almost any topic. Darcula’s operators seem to be Chinese in origin, since most communication is done in closed Telegram groups and in Chinese language. The researchers also observed SIM farms and hardware setups which allow the operators to offer mass text messages and credit card processing through terminals.

A September 2024 report from security researchers Zimperium argued four in five (82%) of all phishing sites today target mobile devices, since they are generally weaker and more often unmanaged compared to desktop and laptop computers. Defending against phishing, however, hasn't changed much. It still revolves around common sense, being skeptical of all incoming messages, especially those with a sense of urgency, or unexpected attachments. Clicking on links in emails and SMS messages, particularly those hidden behind a placeholder or a URL shortener, is also risky.

    "title": "IDF airstrikes ‘fully disabled’ Yemen’s main airport – Israel",
    "article_text": "Israeli airstrikes have“fully disabled”the international airport in Yemen’s Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa and hit other targets, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Tuesday. The IDF has launched a series of strikes on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen following the rebel group’s ballistic missile attack on Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday. ”The fighter jets struck and dismantled Houthi terrorist infrastructure at the main airport in Sanaa, fully disabling the airport,”the IDF said. It added that several power stations and a concrete plant were also targeted. Footage circulating online showed thick black smoke rising over Sanaa. Tuesday’s strikes killed at least three people and wounded more than 30, according to Houthi-run broadcaster Al Masirah. They came less than 24 hours after Israel bombed the port of Hodeidah, killing one person and injuring dozens. The broadcaster warned the latest attacks could worsen Yemen’s humanitarian crisis by disrupting electricity services. 🟥 بالصور | جريمة العدوان الإسرائيلي باستهداف مطار#صنعاءالدولي ..#جرائم_العدوان_الإسرائيليpic.twitter.com/LbG8kmir6b The airstrikes mark a sharp escalation in hostilities between the IDF and the Iran-backed Houthis. On Sunday, a Houthi missile evaded Israel’s air defenses and landed near Ben Gurion Airport, injuring six and briefly disrupting air traffic. It appeared to be the first time a Houthi projectile had reached the area. The attack prompted strong condemnation from Israeli officials. The Houthis claimed responsibility, calling the strike a response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. They warned of“a comprehensive air blockade”and vowed to“repeatedly target airports,”specifically Ben Gurion. The group, which controls much of western Yemen, including Sanaa and Hodeidah, has launched numerous drones and missiles at Israeli territory and Red Sea shipping over the past year. It says the attacks are in support of Palestinians. Following Tuesday’s strikes, the Houthis said Israel’s actions“will not go unanswered.”",

    "title": "China calls out CIA ‘provocation’",
    "article_text": "Beijing has accused the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of committing a“political provocation”by releasing recruitment videos in Chinese targeting officials in the country. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that the US“has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries’ secrets, interfere in their internal affairs and commit subversion.” The diplomat characterized such attempts as being in breach of“international law and basic norms governing international relations.” “The US not only maliciously smears and attacks China, but also blatantly attempts to lure Chinese personnel, even government officials, to be their informants,”Lin said. He further pledged that Beijing would“take all measures necessary to resolutely push back infiltration and sabotage activities from overseas and defend national sovereignty, security and development interest.” The CIA recruitment videos that were published last Thursday solicit covert cooperation from those in China who possess“information about economic, fiscal, or trade policies”or work in the“defense industry… national security, diplomacy, science [or] advanced technology.”The spy agency promised to keep its informants’ identities protected, offering instructions on how to safely make contact. Last month, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) released a similar add, targeting CIA officers, titled ‘Your Option: Together for the Truth’. Evoking the camaraderie shared by the US and the USSR during World War II, the video called on CIA personnel to join in resolving the Ukraine conflict, describing the authorities in Kiev as tainted by neo-Nazi influences and corruption. The video came after the CIA reached out to Russian military engineers through a clip of its own in March. The US spy agency previously produced several other recruitment videos targeting Russia, appealing to various ethnic and social groups.",

    "title": "‘They gave us bread instead of fear’: How Soviet soldiers shaped German childhoods after WWII",
    "article_text": "The fate of Germans in the aftermath of World War II continues to be a subject of reflection and discussion. The memories are as varied as the people who lived them. Sadly, the number of eyewitnesses who can share their firsthand experiences is dwindling with each passing year. That makes it all the more important to give a voice to those who are still with us. RT’s German-language editorial team recently reached out to its readers, inviting them to record and submit their own recollections – or the stories passed down by relatives – about the early postwar years. From East and West, Germany and Austria, readers shared a broad range of experiences: encounters with Russian soldiers, both positive and negative, and personal reflections on the war itself. These deeply personal letters from our German readers have now been translated into English. I met Red Army soldiers for the first time in 1947, when I was just six years old. In September of that year, I started school in the city of Chemnitz. As many know, this Saxon industrial city suffered extensive damage due to air raids carried out by British and American forces between February 6 and April 11, 1945. My route to school took me past the ruins that lined the streets on either side. On one busy street, I often watched a Red Army soldier standing in the middle of an intersection, directing traffic. The soldier stood there regardless of rain and wind, heat and cold. One day, as I walked home from school, I noticed a crowd gathered around a Russian truck. My curiosity piqued, I edged closer to see what was happening. Two soldiers were handing out... bread! It was freshly baked, still warm, and smelled wonderful. One of the soldiers spotted me standing off to the side, feeling utterly lost, close to the adults who reached eagerly for the bread. Suddenly, he pointed at me, waved at me and handed me half a loaf. Overjoyed by this unexpected gift, I ran home and gave the bread to my speechless parents. It was November 1947. Peter M. I was born in June 1945, and thus you could say I celebrated the end of the war while still in my mother’s womb. My mother, born in 1921, had managed to get a job as a clerk at the Aviation Testing Center in Rechlin, located north of Berlin. My father, born in 1919, worked there too as a mechanic, repairing planes for the Eastern Front. He held no allegiance to National Socialism or the war itself. As the Soviet army closed in on Berlin, the testing center was disbanded, and my father, along with other able-bodied men, was ordered to go to Berlin. He didn’t want to support Nazi Germany or be part of the conflict, nor did he wish to throw his life away in the dying throes of a battle already lost. He didn’t want to be forced to shoot others and carry that degrading burden for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, his pregnant wife had to travel alone through perilous roads to get to her in-laws in the relatively safe Sauerland. He wanted to be with her, and dreamed of a new life once the madness of the war was over, hoping to take part in the political revival of his hometown. As a child, he suffered a knee injury that wasn’t too troublesome unless he bumped it hard enough for it to swell significantly. In those moments, he had a desperate idea: to hit his knee with a log to provoke the swelling. When the military doctor examined him, he scribbled a note:“Gefreiter Hesse – to the nearest military hospital.”That played a vital role. He kept his pistol with him, just in case he encountered the“chain dogs”– i.e., the military police. Fortunately, he never crossed paths with them; he rode his bicycle to Schleswig-Holstein, a peaceful region occupied by British troops. There, he changed into civilian clothes and spent a few weeks working on a farm before making his way to the military hospital in Sauerland. He arrived just in time to witness the final days of his wife’s pregnancy and my birth in a hospital that wasn’t destroyed in the war. In the spring of ‘45, the cherry tree in our garden bloomed uncommonly early, gifting my mother with a big plate of cherries. The hospital bill for her two-week stay, the delivery of the baby, and the week-long stay with the baby amounted to 79.92 Reichsmarks. I still have that handwritten note from the doctor along with the bill. Since then, the cherry tree has never bloomed that early again. Reinhard Hesse I’m Austrian, and I’ll turn 80 this November, which means I was born after the war ended. Lower Austria was part of the Russian occupation zone, and we rented a house in the village of Reidling in the Tulln district. The wife of a Russian officer lived in the same house with her young daughter. They occupied just one room, so they were given the best apartment in Sitzenberg-Reidling. This woman saved my life! When I was only a few weeks old, my mother was devastated to learn that I had a severe intestinal infection. The Russian woman heard about my mother’s plight and sent her a full bag of rice and sugar. My mother sorted through the rice and made me porridge. That saved me. I will always be grateful to that kind and compassionate woman! Later, as an adult, I learned Russian at language courses offered by Swiss television. I now live in Vorarlberg, near the Swiss border. I needed Russian for my work as a foreign correspondent. I still work in that capacity, though now not with Russia but with Uzbekistan. But my Russian skills still come in handy. Unfortunately, it’s currently impossible to work with Russia due to anti-Russia sanctions. I’ve only been to Russia once – I visited Saint Petersburg to attend language courses. Saint Petersburg is a dream city! I would love to visit Russia again and see Moscow. I sincerely hope that Western countries will reconsider their absurd Russophobia. Here in Europe, we need to unite with Russia. Bringing together all these diverse and rich cultures, along with their many languages, would be wonderful! Marie-Louise D. By the time the war ended, I was seven years old, and I started school around Easter of 1944. American troops had entered our hometown of Aschersleben. Before we children could even take a good look at them, they were already gone. Soon after, the Russians arrived. I still remember a Nazi poster depicting a bear in a hat with a red star reaching out to grab a woman with children – that’s how they portrayed the Russians back then. Later, the Russian soldiers came in trucks, armored vehicles, on foot, and in other transportation. As they passed by our house, they sang. It was clear that these soldiers had gone through the whole war. I didn’t understand the words, but they sounded beautiful in their own way. Fear lingered in our hearts, however. We were ordered to temporarily host them in our home. My parents cleared out the children’s room, and the three of us moved to our parents’ bedroom. In the children’s room the only furniture that was left was a desk, another table, and a chair. Then they arrived – two men who, as we were told, were“captains.”Both settled in our room, bringing their own beds with them. Soon, one of them spoke to my mother in flawless German. She was so taken aback that she remained speechless, which was rare for her. He introduced himself as a teacher of German from Omsk. He began asking about the“boy” –meaning me. He mentioned that he had a son back home who was my age. He took me to their room, where a large portrait of Stalin now hung over our table. He explained that this was the commander-in-chief. Both men revered him. Igor – the teacher from Omsk – was the first Soviet soldier I got to know. He shared stories about his homeland, read me German poems, and sometimes we sang German songs together. He asked me to correct him if he made any mistakes. Times were tough, and food was scarce. Both officers brought us bread, butter, coal, and potatoes. In winter, my mother heated the room, and my father carried in coal, and sometimes we would eat together. They always asked for hot water for tea. A little over a year later, it was time to say goodbye. They were allowed to return home. Igor gifted me binoculars with an inscription meant to remind me of his friendship. At school, we were taught to love the Soviet Union. It felt natural for us to honor the memory of fallen heroes at the cemetery. May 8th was a holiday for us. I was always impressed by Soviet culture. We watched Soviet films, listened to Russian choirs, and learned about amazing Russian artworks from our art teacher. After finishing school, I acquired a profession and became an active member of the Free German Youth. In 1956, I voluntarily joined the German border police. Occasionally, I encountered Soviet soldiers. The exchange of watches was a significant event for us; every border guard took pride if they owned an“Ural”watch or something similar. We used Soviet weapons that had been used in the war. They were still reliable. Later, I served in Zeithain and Magdeburg, where I became the commander of a SU-76 tank. During that time, we also maintained contact with the Soviet army, particularly concerning technical support. Starting in 1978, I attended the political officer training school for the German border police. Admiration for the Soviet Union felt natural to us. We read and heard a lot of stories about Soviet border guards, the significance of the Brest Fortress during WWII, and aspired to emulate our heroes. Jürgen Scholtyssek, Dresden Seven years after the final shots of WWII faded away, I was born in Brandenburg. While I didn’t directly witness the horrors of war, I belong to a generation that still saw some of its lingering effects. In the streets of Frankfurt an der Oder, it wasn’t uncommon to encounter war veterans with missing limbs. They moved about on crutches or navigated three-wheeled carts operated with two wooden levers. Yet, what struck me as even stranger were the massive, ruined, gloomy buildings that loomed over the city. At six or seven years old, I had no real understanding of what had caused these ruins. In the city center, Soviet soldiers were busy scavenging for building materials. Tracked vehicles used steel cables to pull down the remaining walls of the wreckage. As children, we watched this process with great interest. One day, those soldiers invited us over. The language barrier didn’t matter; they shared bread and soup with us. It was freshly baked, golden-brown whole grain bread, rectangular and warm. When an opportunity arose, one of the soldiers took me up to the roof of a partially destroyed building. The nearly nonexistent staircase in that drafty building didn’t deter us. He firmly grasped my hand and helped me navigate the structure. Up on the roof, where various plants grew in the cracks, I encountered many unfamiliar sights and I remain grateful to him for that experience. These brief encounters deeply influenced how I perceived the“Russians”. I didn’t sense any hostility, arrogance, or rejection from them.“Mama est?”(Do you have a mother?),“Papa est?”(Do you have a father?),“Brat est?”(Do you have a brother?) were the first Russian words I learned. Dr. Wolfgang Biedermann, Berlin I was born in January 1947. My family’s military background profoundly shaped my early years. Like many Russian, French, and Greek families, I lost four uncles – my father’s and mother’s brothers – who died as a result of their involvement with the Wehrmacht on the front lines of the German war machine. I also lost several distant relatives. The pain of losing so many loved ones accompanied me throughout my childhood. My father survived the war with severe injuries. For my grandparents and our extended family, the cause of the war was clear: it was, to quote them, the“unhealthy spirit of Hitler”and there was no doubt that we Germans bore full responsibility for the war and the inhumane suffering inflicted upon Europe. You ask if the end of the war brought liberation and a fresh start for Germans. It certainly felt like a release—primarily from Hitler and the Allied bombers. We were poor; everyone was poor – but that wasn’t terrifying. The important thing was that the war was over. The“unhealthy spirit of Hitler”and its destructive aftermath remained hot topics of discussion in our family for years. Stuttgart, where we lived, was first occupied by the French and later by Americans, and this had a significant impact on me. As a child, I was terrified of soldiers and would hide from every jeep – they seemed to be everywhere. Today, Stuttgart is home to the headquarters of US European Command (EUCOM) and US Africa Command (AFRICOM), so we still have a strong American military presence. For the adults in my large family, the fall of Hitler’s regime brought great relief, but it came with a sense of shame: after all, the Nazi regime collapsed not because of the moral strength of the Germans, but as a result of the country’s (well-deserved) defeat in the war. Losing the war didn’t feel like a disaster, but the catastrophe caused by a world war – with its countless victims, suffering, and destruction – was certainly a disaster. In our family, it was often said that if Germany hadn’t lost, Hitler and his accomplices would still be committing their atrocities today. My father felt strongly that we Germans needed to reconcile with our former“enemies”and seek forgiveness from the victims. He actively participated in this effort. The remilitarization of Germany was firmly rejected, and Adenauer’s policies in regard to the West were met with serious skepticism, even outright opposition. None of those around me wanted to join NATO. As I grew up in the 1960s, I was shocked to see how many Nazis – protected by Adenauer – still held important positions. Many had escaped accountability and taken on new identities; some were shielded by like-minded individuals despite their criminal past. The judicial system was very slow to carry out justice: many cases were ignored, and numerous investigations stalled. Then, Fritz Bauer was killed after the Auschwitz trials. Former Nazis could once again hold positions of Chancellor (Kiesinger) and Prime Minister (Filbinger). It seemed half of the older generation had“skeletons in the closet”. This leads to another answer to your question about“liberation”: there was no genuine“liberation”because the perpetrators remained among us. However, Willy Brandt and Egon Bahr, with their determination and the slogan“We want to dare more democracy”gave us Germans the chance to build a better world. We tried and seized those opportunities, for which I am deeply grateful. Now, however, former militarism, group intolerance, and a fierce thirst for power have resurfaced once again. War and violence are destroying lives in many parts of the world, once again, the Germans are directly involved. And so, my faith is rapidly fading. Rosemarie K.",

    "title": "Zelensky wants Ukraine-friendly government in Budapest – Orban",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky would like to see a pro-Kiev government in Budapest that will approve his country’s accession to the EU, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said. He has vowed to ensure that Hungarians have their say without external pressure. Ukraine formally applied to join the bloc in February 2022, following the escalation of hostilities with Russia. Membership requires the unanimous approval of all current EU member states. In a post on X on Monday, Orban’s spokesperson, Zoltan Kovacs, quoted the Hungarian leader as saying during a parliamentary session that“Zelensky wants a Ukraine-friendly government[installed]in Hungary.”Orban further suggested that the Ukrainian leader had reached an agreement with Brussels on Kiev’s accelerated EU accession, and now expects Hungary to rubber-stamp it. Orban stressed that“there will never be a situation where Kiev or Brussels dictates how Hungarians exercise their rightful sovereignty,”and repeated his arguments that Ukraine’s accession would be ruinous for Hungary’s economy. He urged Hungarians to take part in Voks 2025, which is a consultative vote featuring a single question:“Do you support Ukraine’s European Union membership?” Addressing lawmakers in parliament, Orban also accused the opposition Democratic Coalition, whom he branded the“agents of Brussels,”of seeking to“remove Hungary’s national government, bring Ukraine into the EU, drag Hungary into the war[and]unleash migrants on us.” Last Friday, the Hungarian prime minister lambasted Brussels’ plans to admit Ukraine into the bloc by 2030 – a target recently referenced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Zelensky responded by citing domestic polling in Hungary and claiming that“70% support Ukraine joining the EU. That means people in Hungary are with us.” However, the poll conducted by the opposition Tisza Party to which Zelensky referred actually indicated only 58% support, while an earlier survey produced a figure even lower, at 47%. In a post on X, Orban emphasized that“there is no Ukrainian EU accession without Hungary,”promising that“every Hungarian will have their say on this. Whether you like it or not.” The Hungarian government has long criticized the EU’s policies on the Ukraine conflict, including weapons deliveries to Kiev and sanctions against Moscow.",

    "title": "Canadian province could hold secession referendum – premier",
    "article_text": "Alberta could hold a public referendum on breaking away from Canada next year if a citizen-led petition gets the required number of signatures, the province’s premiere, Danielle Smith, said on Monday. The western province has long clashed with the federal government over legislation limiting fossil fuel development and promoting clean energy, which Alberta officials say unfairly targets their economy. Smith’s announcement comes days after the Liberal Party secured a fourth consecutive term in the federal election, deepening political divides between Ottawa and oil-rich Alberta. Following the election, the Alberta Prosperity Project launched a petition calling for a referendum on the province’s independence. The petition garnered more than 80,000 signatures within 36 hours of its May 2 launch and remains open for public support. “Should Ottawa, for whatever reason, continue to attack our province as they have done over the last decade? Ultimately that will be for Albertans to decide,”Smith said. She added that although she does not personally support the idea of separation, she would respect the will of voters.“I will accept their judgement,”the premiere said. Recently, Smith’s government also introduced legislation to lower the threshold for referendums initiated by citizen petition. The bill reduces the number of signatures needed from 20% to 10% of eligible voters from the last provincial election and extends the collection period from 90 to 120 days. In order to pass the threshold, a petition would need about 177,000 signatures. Smith noted that Alberta doesn’t want“special treatment or handouts;”it just wants to be free to develop its“incredible wealth of resources”and choose how to provide healthcare and education. She expressed hope that secession would not be necessary and that her government would be able to reach an agreement with Prime Minister Mark Carney and Canada’s new government. Last week, Carney’s Liberal Party retained power after a campaign that focused heavily on what he called the existential threat posed by US President Donald Trump, who has floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state and imposed extensive tariffs on most of its neighbor’s goods. The outcome of the election has added to long-running tensions in conservative regions. In Alberta, where the Conservatives won 34 out of 37 seats, many residents have expressed frustration with their federal leadership. Similar dissatisfaction has been reported in neighboring Saskatchewan, and to a lesser extent in British Columbia.",

    "title": "Yemen’s Houthis have ‘capitulated’ – Trump",
    "article_text": "Washington will immediately halt airstrikes on Yemen, US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday. He made the announcement while speaking at the White House alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The order comes after weeks of US-led attacks on Yemen targeting the Houthi militant group, which has“capitulated”and pledged to stop attacks on commercial maritime traffic in the region. The US president said the Houthi group has told Washington it does not“want to fight anymore.” “We will honor that and we will stop the bombings. They have capitulated,”Trump stated. The main goal of the bombing campaign against the Houthis, in which the US and UK took part, was to stop the group from“blowing up ships,”according to Trump. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio added,“This was always a freedom of navigation issue. These guys are a band of individuals with advanced weaponry that were threatening global shipping, and the job was to get that to stop.” Shortly after the announcement, senior Houthi figure Mohammad Ali Al-Houthi said the movement will continue its support for Gaza, and urged Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to resign over his“crimes”and“failed terrorism.” “The Yemeni people will not be intimidated by American and Israeli terrorism, and the crimes they have committed in Yemen are the same genocidal crimes they commit in Gaza,”Al-Houthi stated, without addressing Trump’s remarks directly. The Houthi militia’s attacks on maritime traffic it claimed was associated with Israel, as well as long-range missile and drone strikes on the Jewish state itself, have been the key elements of a campaign to support Palestinians amid the ongoing Gaza war. Later in the day, Oman’s Foreign Ministry revealed that the country had mediated a“ceasefire agreement”between the Houthis and the US. “In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping,”the ministry said in a statement. Trump’s announcement came in the aftermath of an Israeli air raid on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen, including the international airport in the capital, Sana’a, which left one dead and 35 injured, according to Yemeni Houthi-affiliated media. The attack, which forced the airport to close, came in response to a ballistic missile strike on Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. The projectile landed outside the airport, injuring six people, briefly disrupting air traffic.",

    "title": "Trump ends virus research funding",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order restricting federal funding for“gain-of-function”research into viruses and other biological agents in the US and abroad, including China. ”Gain-of-function”or“dual use”studies have been gaining controversy after the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has suggested that a lab leak in Wuhan, China, where US-funded research was based, was the source of the outbreak that brought the world to a standstill. Beijing has denied the claims and accused Washington of trying to smear China. Unrestricted gain-of-function research could“significantly endanger the lives of American citizens,”among other things, Trump’s order alleges, and lead to“widespread mortality, an impaired public health system, disrupted American livelihoods, and diminished economic and national security.” Trump ordered an end to federal funding for“dangerous gain-of-function research”in“countries of concern,”such as China and Iran, citing“biological threats”. He argued that US taxpayer-funded research should help Americans, without threatening national security. Similar US-based programs will be suspended for at least 120 days during which existing policies on dual-use research will be revised or replaced, according to the document. The document also blamed the administration of Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden for allowing“dangerous”research into viruses in the US and“actively”approving funding for similar projects abroad, where Washington’s oversight is limited. Moscow has repeatedly alleged that US-backed biological research laboratories in Ukraine and other countries near Russian borders are involved in bioweapons research. Washington has acknowledged providing support to laboratories in Ukraine but insisted that they were owned by Kiev and focused solely on preventing the outbreaks of infectious diseases and developing vaccines. The Defense Ministry in Moscow has claimed that the US has transferred unfinished Ukrainian projects to post-Soviet states and Southeast Asia, while also singling out Africa as a focal point of Washington’s interests.",

    "title": "400,000 signatures gathered in EU nation to have Russia sanctions lifted (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "Activists in Slovakia have gathered nearly 400,000 signatures demanding the lifting of EU sanctions against Russia. The country’s president, Peter Pellegrini, will now have to respond to the petition and consider holding a referendum within a month. Members of the Slovak Revival Movement (SHO) and the national party DOMOV, who are behind the petition, have submitted the signatures to the office of the president. They want the government to pose the following question to its citizens:“Do you agree that... sanctions against the Russian Federation harm Slovak citizens, tradesmen and entrepreneurs?” Commenting on the initiative that was launched late last year and has surpassed the 350,000 threshold for consideration, Pellegrini’s office promised to“handle petition sheets strictly in accordance with the law.” SHO leader Robert Svec said he expects the president not to ignore the petition and to call for a referendum, citing Pellegrini’s own presumed skepticism regarding anti-Russian sanctions. In late March, the activists held a conference called ‘For Slovakia Without Sanctions,’ that was attended by a number of politicians and economists. Speaking at the time, DOMOV leader Pavol Slota claimed that Slovakia’s future depends on whether the sanctions against Moscow will be lifted or not. “It is about our whole nation, all Slovak citizens,”he stated. Economist Peter Stanek, in turn, said that“there are dozens of studies that clearly show that sanctions have never worked,”affecting instead“those who imposed them.” Slovakia implemented the sweeping EU sanctions imposed on Russia following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Robert Fico, who became prime minister in 2023, has maintained that the punitive measures“are not working,”and doing more harm to member states than Moscow.",

    "article_text": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday ordered the active-duty military to reduce its number of four-star generals and flag officers by 20% in order to improve efficiency. In a memo, Hegseth announced that the measure would be followed by a second round of reductions of 10% among top officers across all branches of the armed forces, including the National Guard. The reductions come in addition to the dismissal of more than half a dozen top generals since January, as the administration of US President Donald Trump is trimming excess spending from the federal budget through its newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Announcing the cuts, Hegseth said they would eliminate“redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership”and were intended to free the military from“unnecessary bureaucratic layers.” “More generals and admirals do not lead to more success,”Hegseth said in a video posted on X. “This is not a slash and burn exercise meant to punish high ranking officers; nothing could be further from the truth,”he added. Secretary of Defense Hegseth has promoted efforts to eliminate programs and leadership that were put in place to“support diversity in the ranks.”He has sought to remove transgender service members, and has launched broad changes to enforce a single fitness standard for all combat roles. The policy is part of Trump’s broader White House effort to eliminate several of the Biden administration’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government and the military. Earlier this year, Trump fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Brown, the second African-American commander ever to occupy the post. Brown publicly supported the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement back in 2020. As of May 2025, the US military has about 653 active-duty generals and flag officers across all branches, including all ranks, according to data from Southwest Journal. Of those, 44 are four-star generals and flag officers, according to Hegseth. The US Army has the highest number of generals, with 231, including 11 four-star generals. Despite the ongoing campaign to cut federal spending, the White House has approved a record defense budget of around $1 trillion, up from the current $894 billion. China, the world’s second biggest defense spender, has allocated $256 billion for defense in 2025, while the third largest, Russia, has budgeted $157 billion.",

    "title": "The death of Old Europe: The living corpses in Brussels have forgotten how to fight for their world",
    "article_text": "The European Union, that grand and failing dream of technocrats, is dying. Its decline is not sudden or dramatic but a slow unraveling, a bureaucratic collapse in which every policy designed to sustain it only hastens its demise. It starves itself on the thin gruel of ideology – open borders dissolving nations into contested spaces, green mandates suffocating industry under the weight of unattainable standards, and a moralizing anti-Russian fervor that has left it isolated and energy-dependent. Once, Europe was the center of empires, the birthplace of civilizations that shaped the world. Now, it is a patient refusing medicine, convinced that its sickness is a form of enlightenment, that its weakness is a new kind of strength. The architects of this experiment still speak in the language of unity, but the cracks in the foundation are too deep to ignore. Immigration was the first act of self-destruction, the point at which Western Europe’s ruling class severed itself from the people it claimed to govern. The elites, intoxicated by the rhetoric of multicultural utopia, flung open the gates without consideration for cohesion, for identity, for the simple reality that societies require more than abstract ideals to function. Cities have fractured into enclaves where parallel societies thrive, where police hesitate to patrol, where the native-born learn to navigate their own streets with caution. The promise was harmony, a blending of cultures into something vibrant and new. The reality is a quiet disintegration, a thousand unspoken tensions simmering beneath the surface. Politicians continue to preach the virtues of“diversity,”but the people – those who remember what it was like to have a shared history, a common language – are beginning to revolt. The backlash is no longer confined to the fringe. It is entering the mainstream, and the establishment trembles at what it has unleashed. Then came the green delirium, the second pillar of Western Europe’s self-annihilation. Factories shutter under the weight of environmental regulations, farmers take to the streets in protest, and the middle class is squeezed between rising energy costs and stagnant wages. The climate must be saved, the leaders insist, even if the cost is economic ruin. Germany, once the industrial powerhouse of the continent, dismantles its nuclear infrastructure in favor of unreliable wind and solar power, only to return to coal when the weather turns unfavorable. There is a madness in this, a kind of collective hysteria where dogma overrides pragmatism, where the pursuit of moral purity blinds the ruling class to the suffering of ordinary citizens. The rest of the world watches, perplexed, as the EU willingly cripples itself for a cause that demands global cooperation – cooperation that is nowhere to be found. China builds coal plants, America drills for oil, India prioritizes growth over emissions, and the EU alone marches towards austerity, convinced that its sacrifice will inspire others. It will not. And Russia – the great miscalculation, the strategic blunder that may yet prove fatal. Europe had a choice: to engage with Moscow as a partner, to integrate it into a stable continental order, or to treat it as an eternal adversary. It chose the latter, aligning itself fully with Washington’s confrontational stance, severing ties that had once provided cheap energy and economic stability. The pipelines are silent now, the ruble flows eastward, and Western Europe buys its gas at inflated prices from distant suppliers, enriching middlemen while its own industries struggle. Russia, spurned and sanctioned, turns to China, to India, to those willing to treat it as something other than a pariah. The Eurasian landmass is reconfiguring itself, and Europe is not at the center. The EU is on the outside, looking in, a spectator to its own irrelevance. The Atlanticists in Brussels believed they could serve two masters: their own people and Washington’s geopolitical whims. They were wrong. In this unfolding drama, America and Russia emerge as twin pillars of Western civilization – different in temperament but united in their commitment to preserving sovereign nations against globalist dissolution. America, the last defender of the West’s entrepreneurial spirit and individual liberty, stands firm against the forces that would destroy borders and identities. Russia, keeper of traditional values and Christian heritage, guards against the cultural nihilism consuming Europe. Both understand that civilizations must defend themselves or perish; neither suffers the death wish that afflicts the Western European elites. And of Western Europe? It is a ghost at the feast, clutching its empty wineglass, muttering about“norms”and“values”as the world moves on without it. The European elites still cling to their illusions, still believe in the power of rhetoric over reality. They speak of“strategic autonomy”while marching in lockstep with Washington’s wars, of“diversity”while their own cities become battlegrounds of competing identities, of“democracy”while silencing dissent with bureaucratic machinery and media censorship. The voters sense the decay. They rebel – in France, where Marine Le Pen’s supporters grow by the day; in Italy, where Giorgia Meloni’s government rejects the EU’s dictates on immigration; in Hungary, where Viktor Orbán openly defies the liberal orthodoxy. Yet the machine grinds on, dismissing every protest as populism, every objection as fascism. The disconnect between rulers and ruled has never been wider. The elites, ensconced in their Brussels bubble, continue to govern as if the people are an inconvenience, as if democracy means compliance rather than choice. The social contract is broken, and the backlash will only intensify. There is a cancer in Europe, and it is not the right or the left. It is the very idea that a civilization can exist without roots, that a people can be stripped of its history and still remain coherent. The EU was built on the assumption that identity was an accident, that men were interchangeable economic units, that borders were relics of a barbaric past. Now the experiment is failing. The young flee – to America, to Asia, anywhere with opportunity and dynamism. The old huddle in their apartments, watching as their neighborhoods change beyond recognition. The politicians, insulated by privilege, continue to lecture about“tolerance”and“progress,”oblivious to the rage building beneath them. The great realignment is already underway. The Atlantic widens; the Eurasian landmass stirs. America and Russia, for all their rivalry, understand power in a way Western Europe has forgotten. They build, they fight, they act decisively. The EU deconstructs, hesitates, agonizes over moral dilemmas while others seize the future. The 21st century will belong to those who can face it without illusions, who can say“we”and mean something concrete, who can defend their interests without apology. Western Europe, as it exists today, is incapable of this. Perhaps the EU will linger for years yet, a hollowed-out institution shuffling through summits and issuing directives that fewer and fewer obey. But the spirit is gone. The people feel it. The world sees it. Historians will look back on this era as the funeral of liberalism – a slow, self-inflicted demise by a thousand well-intentioned cuts. The creators of this collapse will not be remembered as visionaries but as fools, as men and women who prized ideology over survival. And when the last bureaucrat turns out the lights in Brussels, who will mourn? Not the workers whose livelihoods vanished for the sake of carbon targets. Not the parents afraid to let their children play in streets that no longer feel like home. Not the nations that surrendered their sovereignty to a project that demanded their deconstruction. Only the living corpses of the elites will remain, muttering to each other in the ruins, still convinced of their own righteousness. But righteousness is not enough. The world has always belonged to those who are willing to fight for it – and Old Europe has forgotten how to fight.",

    "title": "Merz elected German chancellor at second attempt",
    "article_text": "Friedrich Merz has been elected as German chancellor following a second Bundestag vote on Tuesday. The leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) had initially fallen six votes short of the required 316-vote threshold earlier in the day, but hours later rallied conservatives and allies in the country’s parliament to win 325 votes. The situation is unprecedented in Germany’s post-war history, as no prospective chancellor had previously failed to be voted through by the Bundestag at the first try after securing a coalition agreement. Merz faced opposition from 289 MPs, many of them from the Left and Green parties, who voted against the 69-year-old. The second vote took place after four factions agreed to alter parliamentary procedures to avoid delays. According to Politico, urgent closed-door meetings were held in between the votes. Addressing lawmakers before the second round of voting, CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader Jens Spahn told them that“all of Europe, perhaps even the entire world, is watching this second round of voting.” “I appeal to everyone to be aware of this special responsibility,”he said, as quoted by broadcaster ARD. Commenting on Merz’s initial failure, one of the leaders of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party faction in the Bundestag, Bernd Baumann, said:“Mr. Merz, you have failed. This is a historic defeat, the likes of which have never been seen in this Bundestag before.” Green Party politician Renate Kuenast spoke of a“massive loss of authority”for the incoming chancellor, as quoted by broadcaster ZDF. Left Party parliamentary leader Christian Goerke characterized the situation as a“crushing defeat”for Merz, attributing it to a“truly poor coalition agreement[between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats]that fails to address the major problems facing this country.” Germany’s previous three-way ruling coalition led by the SPD fell apart last November amid internal disputes on spending. The new CDU-SPD coalition has pledged to continue key elements of former Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s agenda, including support for Ukraine and unlocking a constitutional debt brake to further boost the military budget.",

    "title": "White House halts new grants for Harvard",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump has blocked new federal research grants to Harvard University, saying the school must meet a list of White House demands first. The decision marks the latest escalation in a broader clash between the administration and top US universities over their response to pro-Palestinian protests. Since taking office, Trump has ramped up pressure on campuses to tackle alleged anti-Semitism and roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. In a letter posted on Tuesday on X, Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of“serious failures”in anti-Semitism, racial discrimination, academic rigor, and viewpoint diversity. “Harvard University has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,”McMahon wrote, adding that it“should no longer seek”federal funding“since none will be provided.” The letter said Harvard would need to enter talks with the government and show it had complied with the administration’s demands to regain eligibility for new grants. Harvard responded on Tuesday, saying it“will continue to defend against illegal government overreach.” Dear@Harvard:pic.twitter.com/XmMimXfkX0 Trump has targeted Harvard over claims of anti-Semitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests, which erupted after Israel’s offensive in Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attack. More than 50,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the local health ministry. The protests intensified as Washington continued supplying weapons to Israel. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has launched a review of nearly $9 billion in federal funds for Harvard and demanded the university ban DEI programs, restrict pro-Palestinian groups, and prohibit masks at protests. Harvard rejected the demands, accusing the White House of trying to“control”its campus. It sued the administration over the suspension of around $2.3 billion in funding and pledged to combat discrimination internally. In its lawsuit, the university warned the cuts could have“real-life consequences”for students and researchers and could jeopardize medical and scientific work. Harvard has a $53 billion endowment – America’s largest – but much of it is restricted for specific purposes such as financial aid and scholarships. The Trump administration has also suspended federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern.",

    "title": "Russia must crush resurgent Nazism in West – security chief",
    "article_text": "Moscow must crush Nazism, which has resurfaced in the West in recent years, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu has said. On Tuesday, ahead of the 80th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War – Russia’s term for the 1941-1945 Soviet war against Nazi Germany – Shoigu emphasized the“enormous price”paid by the USSR in defeating Nazi Germany. “The multinational people of Russia have learned well the lessons of the Great Patriotic War against fascism,”Shoigu wrote in Rossiyskaya Gazeta. The secretary served as defense minister from 2012 to 2024. He mentioned nearly 27 million combat deaths and 6.5 million additional deaths from starvation and disease during the war against the Nazis. “Today we are obliged to do everything to defeat the resurrected Nazism,”Shoigu stressed. This imperative has“determined one of the main goals”of Moscow’s Ukraine campaign. “The European elites, who are being incited and patronized by London and Paris, continue to make loud statements about inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia... NATO and the EU have launched programs aimed at preparing the collective West for a direct military conflict with Russia,”he said. Those“aggressive steps”by the West“are being justified by Russophobic fabrications – in the best traditions of Goebbels’ propaganda,”the security chief stressed, referring to Joseph Goebbels, who was Nazi Germany’s propaganda minister from 1933 to 1945. “In order to avoid a repetition of the horrors of the war years, there is an urgent necessity to protect the country from a variety of external and internal threats”by further boosting the military, developing the economy and investing in science and education, he said. In late April, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the Security Council, also insisted that“a real de-Nazification is required. Nazism needs to be rooted out not only in Ukraine, but in all of Europe.”",

    "title": "Brazil and Russia could play soccer friendly – media",
    "article_text": "Brazil has agreed in principle to play a soccer friendly against Russia this autumn, local media reported Monday. Russia is currently barred from official FIFA and UEFA tournaments due to the Ukraine conflict. Journalist Galvao Bueno of the Band.com.br news outlet revealed a letter from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) dated August 2024, confirming that it had accepted an invitation from the Russian Football Union (RFU) to play a match in Moscow in 2025. The confederation has reportedly informed Russian officials that the Brazilian national team would be available during the FIFA international match windows from October 6 to 14 and November 10 to 18. “We believe that collaboration between the Brazilian Football Confederation and the Russian Football Union will be fundamental to strengthening ties and further enhancing the global football ecosystem,”the CBF reportedly wrote. “The national team board will be mobilized to work towards holding the aforementioned game,”it added. The correspondence signals Brazil’s willingness to schedule the match, although no official agreement has been reached. Details including dates, venues, and logistical arrangements reportedly remain under discussion. Both federations are expected to continue negotiations in the coming months. If confirmed, the match would mark a rare meeting between the two national teams outside of official tournaments. The last time the two teams played each other was in March 2018 ahead of the World Cup in Russia, when Brazil recorded a 3-0 win at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. CNN Brazil later reported that it had contacted an unnamed representative of the CBF who denied the organization having any plans to hold a match against Russia in football or any other sport. The Russian national football team has maintained an unbeaten record since its suspension from international competitions in February 2022. In the past three years, Russia has played a series of friendly matches, securing victories against countries such as Cuba (8–0), Serbia (4–0), Belarus (4–0), Vietnam (3–0), Brunei (11–0), Syria (4–0), Grenada (5–0), and Zambia (5–0). Despite Russia’s ban from official competitions, FIFA has continued to award ranking points for the friendly matches, contributing to Russia’s climb to 34th in the world rankings.",

    "title": "Trump proposes national holidays for WWI and WWII victories",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has announced plans to designate days commemorating America’s victory in the First World War and Second World War as national holidays. The proposal, first floated last week, is part of Trump’s call to“start celebrating our victories again,”although Russia dismissed his claim that the US won WWII as“nonsense.” In a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump claimed that America“won two World Wars, but we never took credit for it,”unlike other Allied nations around the world, which are celebrating“the Victory we had in World War II.” He went on to reiterate that“the Victory was only accomplished because of us,”adding that“without the United States, the War would have been won by other Countries, and what a different World it would be.” Trump stated that he would establish a national holiday“in celebration of the victories of World War I, marked by the Armistice on November 11, 1918, and World War II, with Victory Day on May 8, 1945.” Last week Trump asserted that the US“did more than any other country, by far”to win World War II, claiming“nobody was close to us in strength, bravery, or military brilliance”in either war. Trump’s claims that America played the leading role in defeating Nazi Germany sparked controversy. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of his country’s Security Council, dismissed the remarks as“pretentious nonsense,”emphasizing the Soviet Union’s sacrifice of 27 million lives in the war. General Lord Dannatt, former chief of the UK General Staff, called Trump’s remarks“extraordinary”and accused him of“rewriting history.” Nazi Germany officially surrendered to the Allies on May 8, 1945, after Soviet forces captured Berlin. The surrender took effect after midnight Moscow time. While the US observes May 8 as Victory in Europe Day, Russia commemorates the occasion on May 9. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged Russia’s gratitude for US support during World War II but maintained that the Soviet Union would have defeated Nazi Germany without it. He noted that the Lend-Lease program provided valuable aid, such as vehicles, aircraft, ammunition, and tanks, which helped make a difficult task more manageable. The Lend-Lease program was a US initiative that supplied Allied nations with military equipment, food, and raw materials. According to Peskov, the Soviet Union received aid valued at around $200 billion in today’s terms. However, the support wasn’t free. Russia, as the USSR’s successor, only completed repayment in 2006.",

    "title": "Seven sentenced for harassing LGBTQ Olympic organizer",
    "article_text": "Seven people have been sentenced in France for the cyberbullying of Thomas Jolly – the artistic director of the LGBTQ-themed opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics. Last year’s games opened with a controversial spectacle that included what was perceived as a recreation of Leonardo DaVinci’s ‘Last Supper’ featuring drag queens, homosexuals, transsexuals and a pro-obesity activist in the role of Christ. The show was condemned by Christians across the world, as well as Muslims, many of whom expressed their frustration on social media. Several days after the event, the production company behind the ceremony, Paname 2024, complained that its employees were getting harassed online and had received death threats. Jolly, who has insisted that the scene was not inspired by the ‘Last Supper’, also filed a complaint claiming was the target of“homophobic and anti-semitic threats and insults.” In October, French authorities arrested seven people, including one woman, who were accused of writing hateful messages targeting Jolly that included posts like“degenerate Jew,”“slut,”“God will not forget you”and“you will pay for having disrespected our Lord Jesus Christ.” On Monday, the Paris Criminal Court found the seven individuals guilty of“repeated death threats, cyberbullying and aggravated insults based on sexual orientation or real or supposed religious affiliation”against Jolly. The court imposed suspended fines of €2,000 to €3,000 ($2,260-$3,395) and suspended prison sentences of two to four months and ordered the defendants to pay one euro in damages to the artistic director. The seven defendants, aged between 22 and 79, will also have to complete a five-day citizenship course, the court ruled. The X accounts of two of the accused individuals will also be suspended for six months. Their posts came amid a wave of backlash to the Olympic opening ceremony from the Christian world, with the Bishops’ Conference of France claiming that it“mocked and ridiculed”the faith. The Vatican also said it was“saddened”by the ceremony and that it offended many Christians and believers of other religions. The Russian Orthodox Church stated at the time that the performance represented a“counterculture of godlessness”that has emerged in the center of Europe. The head of the church, Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, also said it was evidence of the“de-cultivation”of moral values and the“downward trajectory of the spiritual-cultural component of Western civilization.” The outcry over the event ultimately forced the International Olympic Committee to apologize and delete the video of the opening ceremony from online streaming platforms.",

    "article_text": "A proposed coalition of Germany’s liberal and conservative parties has failed to elect a chancellor in a German parliament first round vote. Frederich Merz, the Christian Democratic candidate who was also backed by the liberal SPD, garnered 310 votes on Tuesday, falling six short of the 316 needed for an absolute majority. The session was adjourned for consultations among political groups regarding their next steps. According to German media, the vote failure marks the first time in Germany’s post-war history that a chancellor candidate has been thwarted in such a manner. Merz’s proposed coalition, comprising his CSU/CDU bloc and the German Social Democrats (SPD), holds 328 seats in the Bundestag. Should Merz – or potentially another candidate – fall short in a second round held within two weeks, the procedure would go to a simple majority vote, after which the German president must appoint the winner as chancellor or dissolve the legislature. Germany’s previous three-way ruling coalition led by the SPD collapsed last November due to disagreements over spending. The new proposed coalition has pledged to continue key elements of former Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s agenda, including support for Ukraine and unlocking a constitutional debt brake in militarization. Last week, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, designated the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as“extremist.”The right-wing, anti-migrant movement is currently polling on par with the Christian Democrats for voter preference in a potential federal election. The AfD’s leaders have claimed that the“extremist”designation was politically motivated and aims to undermine the party’s rising popularity.",

    "title": "‘A lot of people know’ who blew up Nord Stream – Trump",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has dismissed claims that Russia was behind the 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and suggested that the true culprit is widely known – without naming names. Speaking at a White House press event, Trump said there was no need for a formal investigation to uncover who carried out the attack, which crippled a key energy route between Russia and Western Europe. Three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, built to deliver Russian gas to Germany and the rest of Western Europe, were damaged by blasts at the bottom of the Baltic Sea in September 2022. On Tuesday, a correspondent for libertarian financial blog ZeroHedge, which has been admitted to White House press events under the new administration, noted that Trump had previously rejected the Western narrative that Russia blew up its own pipelines, and asked the president if he was planning to initiate a probe to find out who was actually behind the attack. “If you can believe it, they said Russia blew it up,”Trump responded.“Well, probably if I asked certain people, they would be able to tell you without having to waste a lot of money on an investigation. But I think a lot of people know who blew it up,”he added, without elaborating. ZeroHedge suggested that Trump’s comment meant that“based on classified intelligence he knows exactly who was behind”the destruction of Nord Stream. It also“should put the ‘Russia destroyed its own vital and economically lucrative pipeline’ storyline to rest,”the outlet insisted. In early February 2023, veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report claiming that then US President Joe Biden had given the order to destroy Nord Stream. According to an informed source who talked to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, the explosives that were detonated on September 26, 2022 had been planted at the pipelines by US Navy divers a few months earlier under the cover of a NATO exercise called ‘Baltops 22’. The White House denied the report, calling it“utterly false and complete fiction.” Senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have previously pointed the finger at the US as the possible culprit behind the Nord Stream explosions. They have argued that Washington had the technical means to carry out the operation and stood to gain the most, considering that the attack disrupted Russian energy supplies to the EU and forced a shift to more expensive US-supplied liquefied natural gas.",

    "article_text": "Israel has launched a series of airstrikes on Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen in retaliation for the rebel group’s ballistic missile strike on Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)saidthat around 20 fighter jets participated in Monday’s operation, dropping at least 50 munitions on“dozens of targets,”including the Hodeidah port complex and a concrete factory in Bajil. The IDF described the targets as critical to the Houthis’ military logistics, alleging that they served as conduits for Iranian arms shipments. According to Yemeni sources, the strikes resulted in at least one death and 35 injuries. Rescue operations were still ongoing as of Tuesday morning, with authorities searching for possible victims trapped under the rubble. The air raid came one day after a Houthi missile struck near Ben Gurion Airport, injuring six people and temporarily disrupting air traffic.

The group says its actions are in support of Palestinians and in protest of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. The Houthis have also warned of a“comprehensive aerial blockade”on Israel if it proceeds with a renewed offensive in Gaza. Despite the warning, Israel reportedly approved a plan on Monday for the full military occupation of Gaza and the forced relocation of its Palestinian population to the territory’s southern areas, according to multiple media outlets. Since returning to office, US President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to escalate strikes against the Houthis, warning that the group would be“completely annihilated”unless it ceases its attacks. Washington and Israel have both accused Iran of arming and directing the Houthis, though Tehran has denied the allegations. The United States did not directly participate in the latest Israeli airstrikes, but coordinated closely with Israel, a senior US official told Axios journalist Barak Ravid. Another official cited by Al Jazeera did not rule out the possibility that non-lethal support was provided. Separately, US forces conducted their own airstrikes on Monday, reportedly targeting Houthi positions near Sanaa, an unnamed US official told the Associated Press.",

President Donald Trump emphasized the benefits of the program, stating that some participants might be eligible to return legally in the future.“We’re going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little work, they can come back in – if they’re good people, if they’re the kind of people that we want in our country, industrious people that love our country,”he said during a White House event on Monday. “And if they’re not, they won’t… If they miss that limit, they’re going to be taken out of our country, and they will never get a path to come back in. And it’ll be a much tougher process,”Trump warned. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem described the initiative as the“best, safest, and most cost-effective way”for undocumented immigrants to avoid arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), urging them to“download the CBP Home App TODAY and self-deport.” DHS estimates that traditional deportation procedures cost taxpayers an average of $17,121 per individual. In contrast, the self-deportation program is projected to reduce costs by approximately 70%, lowering the average expense to about $4,500 per person – even after accounting for the stipend and travel assistance. During his re-election campaign last year, Trump repeatedly promised to“stop the invasion of illegals”and begin the“largest deportation operation”in US history. In the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, ICE arrested more than 150,000 illegal immigrants and deported over 139,000 of them, according to afact sheetpublished by the White House last month. The administration aims to reach one million deportations within its first year. Trump has also increased border enforcement hiring and has denied federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions, though some of his deportation measures continue to face legal challenges. He has declared a national emergency, authorizing the deployment of armed forces to help secure the border.",

    "title": "Go Inside the Making of Usher’s Fabulous, Feather-Capped Met Gala 2025 Performance Fit",
    "article_text": "It’s 9 in the morning on a foggyMet Gala Monday, andUsheris trying out different canes. As part of his perfectly on-theme, dandified outfit, the music and style icon needs some props. There’s about eight to choose from, but the right one needs to have the correct weight, feel, and ornamental details. (Sadly, the cane topped with a golden jungle cat didn’t make the cut.) Usher, after all, is one of the most legendary performers of his generation, and performing at theMet Galacalled for the fit of a lifetime. “It feels like a national event,” Usher says from his pregame suite at theMark Hotel. Now 46 years old, he’s lost count of how manyMet Gala red carpetshe’s walked, but that doesn’t dull any of the sparkle. “Every other industry has their grand moment—the Grammys for music, the Oscars for film, and the Tonys [for theater]. The Met is that moment for fashion, to bring our A-game, be our best, and offer our best in this moment.” For someone like Usher, whose name has been synonymous with suave, sexy sophistication for decades now, the task of dressing him for themenswear Super Bowlrequired a veritable army. The international hitmaker—who flew straight from Berlin to New York for his fitting, jet lag be damned—is holed up with a fashion team. Racks of clothing line the perimeter of the room, luxuriant jewelry covers every available surface, and pairs upon pairs of tasteful shoes are carefully situated all over the floor. (In addition to his fashion braintrust, Usher’s also got a documentary crew packed in there with him.) Over the course of his fitting, Usher is in constant communication with the Harlem-based designer Brandon Murphy and his stylist Yashua Simmons. A healthy amount of nervous energy hangs in the air. “There are nerves, but,” Murphy begins, before being cut off by Usher. Brandon Murphy “Lying!” the singer interjects. “You’re lying, dog. Talk your shit. Pressure makes diamonds!” Nine hours fromthe big event, there are a bevy of questions that still need answering.Do we go with the white, faux fur jacket on top, or the more traditionally dandy boucle with the sequins? Which of the opulent watches works best with these colors? Are these buttons 14- or 24-karat gold?Usher asks if the diamonds adorning him are lab-grown (they are), and chuckles as he mimes conducting an orchestra before learning the official term “baton.” The rest of the getup includes a custom Stetson bowler on his head and Manolo Blahnik shoes on his feet, the latter of which were decided on via an on-the-fly poll of the room. Usher also went back and forth on whether to spice things up by sticking a massive feather in the hat, ultimately deciding to go full Yankee Doodle Dandy. But the bones of the ensemble were never in doubt: a made-to-measure white suit by Brandon Murphy, which both men agree was designed to “reach beyond the limits of what it is to be sophisticated.” “I’m a storyteller,” Usher declares. “As an artist, but I’m also a storyteller as the star of the show. For amusical, creative, and theatrical storyteller, this is the recipe for a beautiful historical moment.” With this year’s theme—“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—celebrating Black dandyism, Usher wanted his tailoring choices to reflect that. It wasn’t just tapping Murphy and Simmons (both Black) to get him suited and booted. He name-checksBlack dandies of yesteryearlike Sidney Poitier, Miles Davis, and Ben Vereen as some of his inspirations, and at one point rhetorically asks out loud, “Do I want to be Duke Ellington?” “This is such an effort on everybody's part, I want to make sure that everybody is seen and everybody that's a part of this team, Black or brown, is represented,” Usher says. “There were a lot of ideas. There were tons of sketches that were sent and tons of ideas and even tons of pushback. Everybody that is in this room has given their all.” When curating a Met Gala uniform for someone like Usher—a mononymous celebrity, whose nine Billboard No. 1 hits make him one of a handful of men to ever accomplish that—Murphy knew he’d have to combine sartorial excellence with reverence for the global superstar. “At the beginning of this design process, I thought about how Usher has impacted fashion throughout the decades with his style,” the designer says. “I wanted to bring elements of who he is naturally withhis elegance and his talent. ​​So, there's a bit of history in this look, while also tapping into the modern techniques and ideas that I love to do.” In Usher’s case, hisMet Gala apparelhad to mix function with fashion, too. Looking good was only one part of the equation; Murphy also had to make sure the clothing could accommodate mic packs, elaborate dance moves, and the raw energy of an Usher performance. “Yashua, he and I worked on my last tour together, so [he has] an understanding of how the clothing has to move,” Usher explains. “He assisted Brandon in understanding what fabrics he should select, and also the fact that things had to be movable and fabulous at the same time.” When morning turned to night and the world’s eyes turned to the Met, Usher did what he’s been doing for over a quarter century: he freaked it. The confident, kinetic, rendition of “OMG”, came complete with a hat toss and pristine choreography, as movable and fabulous as he promised. “Dandyism is a posture. It is a choice, and your choice basically dictates your expression. Dandyism is something that I actually lean into,” Usher tells me, listing a staple of hisrecent tour wardrobeas an example. “I don't know that many people walking around with fur coats on with no shirt. I've been doing that shit since I was 14. You know what I mean? This moment gave me an opportunity to really stand in who I am.”",

    "title": "13 Best Athletic Fit Jeans 2025, According to GQ Denimheads",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Hunting for the perfect pair of jeans is torturous. That’s doubly true for our jacked brethren searching for the bestathleticfit jeans—a whole other kind of hell. And with fitness on the rise, lines at thesquat rackshave never been longer, and thighs have never been meatier. Combine that with the surge of dudes who’ve also taken an interest in fashion and you’ve got leagues of swole sartorialists in desperate search of jeans that fit well. Thejeans journeyis rocky enough for the average-bodied, so our hearts go out to the gym rats who’ve discovered the double-edged sword that is thunder thighs. But thoughts and prayers aren’t where we leave you. See, chatted it up with the most stylish and swole individuals we know and tapped them for their tips on finding a properly-fitting pair of jeans. What we walked away with is an incomparable list of the best athletic fit jeans for men, in every budget and every silhouette. Levi's Amazon Materials:99% cotton, 1% elastane |Sizes:29x29-44x36, big & tall |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Leg Opening:15.75\" The Levi's 501 may reign supreme for most of the world. Even then, it's not for everyone. The legendary denim brand's range of iconic fits, however,doesinclude a pair of jeans made specifically for the thunder thigh'd homies among us. The Levi's 541 cut is the brand's athletic cut and features a classic medium rise with a roomy thigh and an ever-so-slight, perfectly-balanced taper. These jeans won't give you an extreme thigh-to-hem differential that other jeans fall prey to. Instead, these aim to give you that classic silhouette while keeping in mind your well-endowed thigh meat. What makes the 541 especially great is the sheer range in terms of styles and size offerings. You can find the 541 in an endless amount of washes from light wash to dark wash and all the freaky options in-between. Plus, they're the only brand on this list that offers big and tall versions, which is a major plus. Carhartt Amazon Materials:100% cotton |Fabric Weight:15 ounces |Sizes:28x28-54x32 |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Leg Opening:15 1/4\" Levi's may be the reigning jean in this category (well, most categories), but Carhartt's hard-wearing denim and tough-as-nails construction make its jeans a better value. The denim is truly beefy, tipping the scales at 15 ounces, and the all-cotton material means you don't have to worry about stretchy elastane giving out on you after a few months. They have a versatile mid-rise that can be worn at the waist or slung a little low near the hips and the generous seat and thighs mean your tree trunks will have space to breathe while the tapered leg streamlines the silhouette—sounds a lot like these jeans are cut more like jeans from a high-fashion brand...and yet they're just $40. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Materials:99% cotton, 1% elastane |Fabric Weight:14 ounces |Sizes:28x28-40x34 |Fly:Zip |Colors:Varies |Thigh:27\" |Leg Opening:16\" If your athletic build means that so-called relaxed-fit jeans fit more like straight-fit jeans which fit more like skinny jeans, then you're probably automatically factoring that in when you're shopping. But if you want a pair of relaxed fit jeans that takes into account your muscular legs and actually look, well,relaxed, then Abercrombie's got yourbacklegs. A&F's Athletic Loose jean is cut with a properly generous seat and thighs while maintaining a roomy yet tastefully tapered cut to the hem. As for the washes, you can expect the usual light washes, mid washes, and dark washes, but we love that Abercrombie's expanded color palette includes denim in black, brown, and gray, along with one badass camo pattern. Wrangler Amazon Materials:100% cotton |Fabric Weight:12-15.25 ounces |Fly:Zip |Sizes:27x30-54x40 |Colors:Varies |Leg Opening:16.75\" Okay, so we did say that fit is relative. Different people can make a straight cut jean look like a skinny jean and vice versa. The bootcut silhouette can't really be finagled. Slinky, sleazy dressing and cowboy aesthetics are extremely on-trend (a resurrecting and reinventing of Y2K fashion), so if you're gearing up to look your grooviest or rarin' to get your rootin-est, Wrangler's Cowboy cut jeans are the pair to step your fancy boots into. But as tempting as it may be, don't opt for the Wrangler's slim fit version of the Cowboy cut—the original is better suited for your build. Our Legacy SSENSE Mr Porter Materials:100% cotton |Fabric Weight:12-15.25 ounces |Fly:Zip |Sizes:28x32-36x32 |Colors:Varies |Thigh:28” |Leg Opening:20\" If you’re after a pair of designer jeans that can accommodate your thunderous thighs, Our Legacy’s Third Cut is the charm. They’ve got a mid-high rise, relaxed seat and thighs and a straight leg for a silhouette that’s sits smack dab in the goldilocks zone between relaxed and wide leg. And if you’re skeptical that a fancy schmacy pair of designer denim could even do such a thing for you and your meaty gams, just take a look at GQ cover star and entertainer of the year, Dwayne Johnson who wore them for ourcover shoot. Our Legacy produces its Third Cut jeans every season in new fabrics and washes, but this trompe l’oeil jeans are a cult favorite amongst fashion heads, athletic or not. 3sixteen Huckberry Materials:100% cotton |Fabric Weight:14.5 ounces |Sizes:28-42 (long inseam) |Fly:ButtonColors:Raw indigo |Thigh:22” |Leg Opening:14.5\" Denimheads have thick thighs, too. There's no shortage of vintage-y, mid-century reproduction jeans to satisfy the uber-picky denim lover out there. In fact, fancy repro jeans are a great place to look for high-end denim if you're bottom heavy since jeans of the era were often very wide. But if you're looking for something a bit more tailored with the pedigree to back up your blue jeans bona fides, 3sixteen's CT-100x jeans are the pair to slide your legs into. They’re made of a high-quality Japanese selvedge denim and are cut with a classy tapered fit right here in the USA. The best part? They’ll mold to your body and fade like a dream. Dickies Amazon Waiting in the shadows of its more popular 874 work pants, Dickies' no-frills jeans share a lot in common with its sibling. Namely, a hardy fabric, a surprisingly elegant silhouette, and tough construction. Oh, and they're just thirty bucks. Gap Gap A throwback pair of dungarees with a full fit through the hips and thighs and a ruler-straight leg. Add to that a hardy 13-ounce all-cotton denim and a delightful medium wash and you've got a pair of jeans that vintage lovers could only dream of finding. Noah Noah Pleats on jeans are the kind of odd detail that Noah loves to toss in. But there's a real method to the quirkiness. Those dadly pleats have a functional role and add some room to the top block of the jeans—the perfect device for fitting athletic legs. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Maybe you're into nice denim but don't want to subject yourself to fashion masochism by going through the whole cardboard raw denim thing. Todd Snyder's relaxed fit jeans are made from premium selvedge denim and are sewn right here in the States. But they come washed to hell, like a beautiful worn-in pair of vintage jeans. Madewell Madewell The '90s were a great time for denim and beyond the plaid-draped, grunge-rocking aura these jeans evoke, the relaxed, yet still classic-fitting jeans are prime pants for the athletically-legged. Consider them an alternative option to the Levi's 505, but with just a smidge of stretch. Orslow Blue In Green OrSlow has been a menwear darling for the selvedge-loving crowd for years and the Japanese label's latest fit is also its roomiest. Taking inspiration from so-called dad jeans and vintage details from the 1960s, these grail-level dungarees are one to add to your collection, especially for those of us with double-wide thighs. Freewheelers Son of a Slag If 3sixteen's jeans weren't repro enough for you, Freewheeler's hyper-accurate 1940s-inspired jeans will tick all your overly-specific boxes. They're a go-to for Muzquiz and any discerning denimhead who needs pants big enough for two tree trunks. Livid Jeans Livid Stockholm-based brand Livid has been lauded for its transparent production and high-quality, Scandi-cool designs. Its recently released Beth jeans feature a roomy top block, thighs, and wide hem, all coupled with a lower rise for a bit of Y2k flavor. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. Even withthe skinny jeans era thankfully behind us, it can be difficult for bigger fellas to find denim that fits flatteringly and comfortably. Or it was, anyway, before a handful of denim brands started tailoring their dungarees specifically to the needs of swoler physiques. Enter theathletic fit, a roomier and more forgiving silhouette that accentuates your legs rather than hiding them under a baggy, JNCO-esque curtain of fabric. If you’re a committed leg day practitioner or just the proud owner of a dad bod, these are the best athletic fit jeans for every budget that’ll look and feel incredible straight off the rack. Given that expert wisdom, the most important factor for a good pair of men's athletic fit jeans has to do with the top block of the jeans—the thighs and the seat. The top block should have extra room all-around to accommodate larger frames. And while not totally necessary, it helps if they've got a medium rise or a high rise that actually tapers closer to the body so you don't have that dreaded crack-baring waist gap. That said, athletic cuts with lower rises can work too if you're after that kind of Y2K-reminiscent style. We consider ourselves pretty big denimheads, but big thigh'd guys, we are not. So we tapped some real heads with real big thighs for tips on how to find the perfect pair of jeans. “There are so many different bodies and all of them can achieve similar looks,” saysAlbert Muzquiz, a fashion influencer, actor, and denim expert whose resume includes stints at Self Edge and Heddels. \"But they have to look at different cuts that have different names.\" There's endless talk about the Levi's 501 as the ultimate jean. Aside from literally birthing a new type of garment, the 501's iconic fit is basically a yard stick for every other straight-leg silhouette out there. But it ain't gonna fit the same way for a rail-thin body as it will for someone with thunder thighs. You might be after a straight-leg fit, but you'll probably have to do some transposing to figure out which models actually offer your personal perfect fit. What's marketed as a slim jean only fits comfortably on a handful of frames. For people who have bigger legs, they can achieve a slimmer, tailored look, but they have to look at different models. “I look for a high rise,\" Musquiz says. \"I tend to find that any jean that's cut with a high rise almost always has a more accommodating thigh.” Muzquiz also notes that folks who work out a lot tend to have a smaller waist relative to their frame. Because of that, higher rise jeans tend to accommodate that differential better. Higher rise jeans sit higher up on the body (duh) which naturally gives you more room in the top block. Not only does it give the wearer more room, it also gives them the option to wear the jeans higher or lower, depending on their preference. The perfect pair of jeans is like Atlantis—it probably doesn't exist. Or at least, for most people, it doesn't exist straight off the rack. That's why both Muzquiz and Brandon Mahler, a visuals manager in New York, advocate for taking your jeans to the tailor. The jeans journey is enough of a hassle, so why in Ralph Lauren's name would you want to add another step to it? Well, you might actually wastemoretime searching for those Atlantis jeans. Instead, what you want to do is get a pair of jeans that fits close enough and take them to the tailor. It's important to make sure they fit well in the top block—that is, the area around the hips, seat, and crotch—since that area won't stretch very much and it's harder for a tailor to adjust. “I tend to size up in a lot of jeans in general,” Mahler points out. “I usually want the leg opening to be a little wider. I would size up and then I would take them toSelf Edgeand be like ‘Yo, take the waist in an inch and a half.' You can always start bigger and make it smaller.” The waist, the thighs, the legs, and the inseam can all be tailored. (Hopefully, you won't need to have every one of those areas adjusted.) Also keep in mind that denim changes over time. With wearing and laundering, the fit will shrink and expand. So once you land the right pair of jeans in a close-enough size, wait until you give it a wear and a wash before you take it to the tailor. And a final plea that could help the denim afflicted: “If you can part with this tiny leg opening,” Muzquiz says, “if you can accept the straight leg jean or even a wide leg jean into your life, then you're gonna have way fewer problems finding a good fit.”",

    "title": "The 12 Best-Dressed Men at the Met Gala 2025, Ranked",
    "article_text": "Another first Monday in May, another round of fashion’s biggest night in the books. This time around, the2025 Met Galawas a particularly big deal aroundGQHQ, given that the theme of this year’s Costume Institute exhibition,“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”promised the most menswear-centric Met (at leastsince 2003, which riffed on the historical constraints of male fashion with the aptly titled theme of “Men in Skirts”). But on Monday night, many of the well-dressed famous fellas across the industries of music, sports, art, and entertainment attended the so-called “Men’s Gala” with a bright, dandyish sense of sartorial freedom, paying homage to the history of identity-affirming Black fashion and tailoring traditions. From pattern-happy bespoke creations to moody tonal masterpieces, here are a dozen of the finest looks to grace the 2025 Met Gala red carpet. For much of the 2010s, Public School’s Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne ranked amongthecoolest young designers in New York—racking upprestigious fashion awards, droppingred-hot Jordan collabs, and generally becoming scene-leading men about town. But by the early 2020s, the brand had all but faded from view, with its founders engaged in solo projects and corporate gigs. Which is what made it all the more heartwarming to see the duo reunited on the Met Gala steps last night, reviving Public School to dress Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson in a flouncy, pleated, Prince-of-Wales-check zoot suit. Following their surprise appearance, the label’s Instagram account appears to be teasing…something—and if Jefferson’s stellar look is any indication, it’s worth getting excited about. Suit by Public School. Few menswear designers better embody contemporary Black dandyism than Ozwald Boateng, the British-Ghanaian tailor who has reinvigorated Savile Row with his penchant for brash tones, exuberant prints, and strong lines. And few stars are better equipped to wear Boateng’s creations thanBurna Boy, the irrepressible Afrobeat megastar. At the Met Gala, the Nigerian musician arrived decked out in a searing crimson tux offset by a shimmering leather cape and a clashing canary silk shirt. It’s a look that demanded attention in the best way possible. Tuxedo by Ozwald Boateng. At last year’s Met Gala, Tom Ford did something out of the ordinary:He didn’t wear Tom Ford. (Instead, he donned a fantastic burgundy dinner jacket from Anthony Vaccarello’s Saint Laurent.) But this year, the legendary designer returned to form and wore a perfect black tuxedo by—who else?—Tom Ford. Which is, frankly, a very dandyish move. Tuxedo by Tom Ford. Few people were as booked and busy during this year’s Met Gala season as the celebrity super-stylist Law Roach, who, in addition to styling seven celebs at Burberry’s table, also managed to outfit himself in a great velvet-jacquard tuxedo with a slinky, extra-wide cummerbund and a playfully frilly silk shirt. Per a brand press release, Roach’s ensemble “is a celebration of traditional tailoring, inspired by the essence of dandyism. A style revolution steeped in pride, resistance and sartorial refinement, the self-expression of dandies has long provided a subtle form of rebellion against societal norms.” Plus, his perfectly coiffed swoop of blond hair was perhaps the best accessory of the night. Tuxedo by Burberry. It’s poetic, really, just how well Tyson Beckford—themale supermodel of the ’90s, whose wave-making 1994 Polo Sport campaign still feels like a fixture on every cool brand’s marketing moodboard—can pull off a classic Ralph Lauren dinner jacket. Like popcorn at the movies or rain in the spring, some things just make sense. Tuxedo by Ralph Lauren Purple Label. On a Met Gala carpet that felt severely lacking in vibrant hues,Willy Chavarria’s pale pink Pachuco-inspired suit felt as refreshing as a scoop of strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day. “The Pachuco is the quintessential dandy from the ’30s and ’40s, representing Latinos and Blacks who dressed as a form of resistance through beauty,” the CFDA winnertoldWWD. The turquoise tie, custom Jacques Marie Mage aviators, and fistful of red roses were the proverbial sprinkles on top. Suit by Willy Chavarria. For as much as dandyism is about perfect tailoring, it is also about dressing exuberantly, which is something that Andrew Scott nailed with this colorful Giuliva Heritage suit. The near-clashing tones, the rakishly loosened tie, and the wickedly pointy shoes brought some much needed flair last night. “I love, love, love playing with colors,” the Irish actortold BritishGQof the look. “It just feels really fun.” And lest we forget, fun is part of this, too! Suit by Giuliva Heritage. Fear of God boastedarguably the coolest table at the gala, withJerry Lorenzorecruiting the powerhouse likes ofSinnersdirector Ryan Coogler, NFL superstarDeAndre Hopkins, and gamechanging artists Amy Sherald and Arthur Jafa. It was one of Lorenzo’s fashion forebears, however, who looked most righteous modeling the label’s roomy, dramatic wares:Andre Walker, the trailblazing New York designer whom André Leon Talley once called “unsung genius.” Walker cut an especially rakish figure in his drapey black overcoat, pooling black trousers, leather driving gloves, and knit skullcap. Suit by Fear of God. WhilePharrell’s pearl-encrusted Louis Vuitton dinner jacketwas certainly striking, it was slightly outshined in the mollusk department by Questlove’s elegant Gabriela Hearst rig. By deploying its more than 30,000 freshwater pearls as pinstripes, Hearst gave the ensemble the dandyish glitz necessary to meet the evening’s dress code while simultaneously elongating and enhancing its graceful silhouette. Suit by Gabriela Hearst. Colman Domingo will go down in Met Gala history as one of the event’s most devoted co-hosts ever, and the honor of strutting with abandon was not one the Oscar-nominated actor took lightly. “I’m emotional thinking about it right now because I feel like, where I come from, this is beyond anyone’s dreams,”the actor toldGQduring the fitting for histwoValentino looks, which included a resplendent blue cape as well as this technically perfect homage to the checkered wool zoot suit. The suit worked particularly well because it felt historical while also looking completely contemporary. Suit by Valentino. During his celebrated tenure at Gucci, Valentino creative director Alessandro Michele engineered some of the most diabolical Met Gala stunts in recent memory: there was the timeJared Leto carried his own head up the steps in 2019; three years later, in 2022, Michele and Letodressed as slightly unnerving twins. For Justice Smith’s look this year, however, Michele eschewed any over-the-top tricks in favor of tasteful flair. Half of theI Saw the TV Glowstar’s sharply tailored cream jacket is shrouded in a neatly knotted polka-dot scarf, with a demure lace turtleneck peeking out along the edges. Natty, inspired, and not too much. Suit by Valentino. There was a disproportionate number of all-white suits on the carpet last night—Zendaya, Tyler Mitchell, Mary J. Blige, Anna Sawai, and, uh,this dudeall sported spotless alabaster, among several others—but none of them could quite catch F1 GOAT and Met Gala co-chairLewis Hamiltonin pole position. “From the moment I heard the theme,” Hamiltonwrote on Instagram,“I knew I wanted to work withGrace Wales Bonner.” It’s easy to see why: In collaboration with Hamilton’s stylist Eric McNeal, the British designer crafted a sublime ivory tuxedo—topped off with a matching beret from the London milliner Stephen Jones—riddled with thoughtful references. The sash around his waist was embellished with cowrie shells, believed to ward off evil spirits in many African cultures, while his cropped jacket was a nod to the legendary jazz singer Cab Calloway. “This is more than a suit,” Hamilton said. “This is ancestral history.” Tuxedo by Wales Bonner.",

    "title": "15 Best Wedding Suits for Men in 2025: Go Further Than the Function",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Invited to a wedding that expressly bills itself as anti-black tie? The best wedding suits for men are a failsafetuxedoalternative. Not only will they carry you through “I do,” into dinner and across to the other side of the open bar, they’ll also come home with you in one piece, ready for yournextwedding (or date, or reunion, or workday.) Still, when the dress code calls for anything other thanclassic black tie, figuring out what's considered appropriate wedding attire can be a headache. Our advice there? Stick with the trusty two-piece suit. Faced with the frightening prospect of an especially confounding wedding invitation, a traditional suit—in navy blue, say, or charcoal gray—will always be a safe bet. Pair it with acrisp dress shirt, asolid-colored tie, darkdress shoes, andvoila: your gam-gam will be introducing you as her dapper grandson in no time. The point: The suits below will help you fix up and look sharp on the big day, whether it's your own, you’re a groomsman, or you’ve been asked to give a speech in front of 300 people. To help you traverse the nuptial circuit in style, we tracked down the best of the bunch available today, whether your budget is under $500 or over $1,000. The single greatest thing about suits under $500? You can still look sharp without stressing about spills on the dancefloor or treating it too preciously. (In some ways, this is how you’re meant to wear a suit, so if you fear you’d be overly delicate with an investment suit, welcome to your section.) The trade-off? You’ll miss out on some of the finer details—like horn buttons, proper canvassing and finer fabric composition. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew The Ludlow suit helped define the slim-fit era of the 2010s and gave J.Crew a major menswear moment. But the brand has made sure to stay current, expanding its tailoring lineup in recent years with a range of fits—including the Crosby, a more classic, traditional cut that feels just right for now. This version comes in a breezy, garment-dyed cotton-linen blend that’ll keep you cool in the heat but can still handle a light spring drizzle. You’ll kill it in anOxford shirtandloafers, but it will look just as sharp when worn separately. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo If you’re after something truly inexpensive but still put-together,this Uniqlo suitbrings together everything the brand does well. It's highly functional (quick-drying and machine washable), sharp-looking (breathable but structured fabric), and wildly affordable. Sure, this won’t fly at the most formal of affairs, but at this price, you’ll find more than a few places to make it work, from casual weddings to rooftop drinks to a presentation at the office. It’s something you can just throw on and not overthink. Hell, maybe you should grab two. Madewell Madewell Madewell Madewell Sometimes you want your suit not to blend in, but to make a statement—at weddings, rooftop drinks, or just while pretending you’re on the Amalfi Coast (hell, maybe you’re lucky enough to have that on your summer itinerary). This cotton-linen number from Madewell fits the bill perfectly. The fabric is light but structured, with just enough texture to keep things interesting. The double-breasted cut brings a touch of swagger, as does the relaxed silhouette. It’s a bit of a statement, but at under $300 you can afford to throw caution to the wind. Spier and Mackay Spier and Mackay If you haven’t heard of Spier & Mackay, the online-only Canadian brand is basically a cheat code for menswear guys on a budget. They work with legit fabric mills like E. Thomas and Abraham Moon, and offer updated, well-cut tailoring with all the right details: soft Italian shoulders, 3-roll-2 closures, hand-sewn Milanese lapel buttonholes, genuine horn buttons, and a curved barchetta chest pocket. All the hallmarks of fine tailoring—without the eye-watering price tag. Yes, the suits are made in China, but the fabrics and finish still make them an unbeatable value. This cotton-linen suit, for instance, could have you posted up at Pitti one day and hitting a wedding the next. Mr. P Mr. Porter Mr. P Mr. Porter If the big day involves watching loved ones say “I do” at City Hall and grabbing cocktails after, this worn-in cotton twill suit hits the exact right note. Unstructured, unfussy, and versatile enough to wear with a proper shirt and tie or dress down with a slouchy knit polo or tee, it's the kind of suit that doesn’t screamwedding, but still looks totally intentional. And its casual nature means that when the day’s done, you’ll soon find reason to wear it again. At this price point, you’re getting much better fabrics—softer to the touch, more breathable—and most of the sharp details that make a suit feel elevated. It’s a smart investment if you’ve got more weddings on the horizon or need something versatile enough for work and other more formal occasions. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason As werecently pointed out, Buck Mason has quietly become a go-to for regular dudes who want to look great. This suit is a prime example. It’s deceptively simple but has just the right details to get a guy excited. The 3-roll-2 closure is inspired by Ivy looks of yore and the fresco English wool is made, impressively, with full-canvas construction and a natural shoulder. The pack breast and front pockets add to the throwback American look—so much that Buck Mason has aptly named itThe Graduate,as if the Dustin Hoffman classic were set in 2025. You can almost hear someone whispering, “A.I., Benjamin. Just one word: A.I.” J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew The Kenmare cut is J.Crew’s even more relaxed option, after the Crosby above, and two steps from the slim Ludlow suit that made the brand a household name. This version is done up in an airy fresco wool from a legendary English mill—high-twist yarn, open weave, the whole breathable, wrinkle-resistant package. In other words: it keeps you cool, even when the dance floor heats up. Natalino Natalino Natalino Natalino A relatively new tailoring upstart with a shop tucked just off London’s Oxford Street (and a great online store), Natalino is turning out some of the sharpest menswear around, at prices that won’t make your eyes water. Usually, when you pay less for tailoring, you sacrifice a lot of the finer details. But in this case, its half-canvas suit is cut in a soft Neapolitan style with features you’d typically pay a premium for: wider lapels,spalla camiciashoulders, and the like. The trousers lean slim, but there’s enough fabric in the seams to let them out if you’re after a wider leg. And the two-ply high-twist wool is woven in England—light, breathable, and crease-resistant—then crafted in Naples. English refinement meets Italian craftsmanship. Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Banana Republic Originally built for globe-trotters and safari types, Banana Republic has roots in travel and adventure—and their summer wool suit taps into that spirit. Made from Ventile wool by one of Italy’s top mills, it’s got a vintage edge, plus all the modern perks the brand typically infuses: breathable, wrinkle-resistant, and finished with a soft Italian shoulder. A no-brainer for summer weddings. Sid Mashburn Sid Mashburn Sid Mashburn has been perfecting suiting for years from his Atlanta HQ, and the Kincaid is his signature. The brand bills it as the ideal starter suit: charcoal grey, natural shoulder, two buttons, fully canvassed, and paired with classic plain-front trousers. It’ll take you from weddings to work without missing a beat. Dress it up with a crisp shirt and knit tie, or keep it breezy with a camp-collar shirt and fisherman sandals for an outdoor affair. If you’re open to dropping over a grand on a suit—Congratulations, sir—you likely know your way around a lapel. Maybe you wear suits often. Maybe you’re just a tailoring nerd. Either way, you want all the desired details and only the most exquisite of drapes. Here are a few worth the splurge. Drake's SSENSE Drake's SSENSE Drake’s may be best known for its offbeat British prep approach—think slouchy suits, colourful ties, and rakish scarves—but don’t let the fun fool you. The brand still knows how to turn out a properly sober English suit: beautifully draped, impeccably tailored, and loaded with all the right details. Sure, the price tag isn’t as playful as their neckwear, but you’re getting a suit built to last (and to quietly flex in) for years to come. J. Mueser Mr. Porter J. Mueser Mr. Porter For the past few years, J. Mueser has been quietly crafting bespoke and made-to-measure suits for New York’sin-the-know menswear crowdout of its West Village shop. Now, the brand’s signature style is available on Mr. Porter. This ‘Waverly’ double-breasted suit comes in black linen—arguably one of the coolest moves a guy can make. Sure, black’s often reserved for somber occasions, but in soft, breezy linen? It’s effortlessly sharp and very much of the moment. Stòffa Mr. Porter Stòffa Mr. Porter Founded by two former Isaia employees, Stòffa has carved out a cult following for its clean take on Italian elegance. The brand built its name on impeccably made-to-measure pieces, but its ready-to-wear collection delivers the same elegant lines and thoughtful design. This suit, cut from a washed slub linen, is a perfect example—light, breathable, and refined. Yes, linen wrinkles—but when it’s this good, it’s more of a stylish rumple than a mess. Embrace it, and you won’t look out of place at a Tuscan vineyard wedding or just sipping a spritz somewhere your phone doesn’t get service. The Armoury by Ring Jacket The Armoury Hong Kong-founded, New York-located tailor The Armoury is a go-to for suit nerds. While you’ll find the expected Neapolitan-style soft-shouldered tailoring, I'm especially into their Model A12 suit—a slightly more casual option inspired by 1930s workwear. Designed in collaboration with Japan’s Ring Jacket, it features patch pockets, a ventless back, and easy-wearing charm. The real star, though, is the olive cotton from Italian mill Solbiati. It’s a warm-weather MVP you can break up and wear in a dozen different ways, making it a seriously smart investment. Berg & Berg Berg & Berg Scandinavian tailoring ishaving a moment, and Berg & Berg is proof that the Nordics know their way around a silhouette. The Don suit is full of quiet swagger: broad lapels, a nipped waist, a slightly longer jacket with a low button stance that gives you legs for days, and wide-leg trousers that drape just right over your shoes. It’s cut from the holy trinity of fabric blends: wool-silk-linen, all sourced from Italy. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest dress shoes, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories: quality, fit, and price. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "article_text": "Each year on the first Monday in May,hotel suitesacross Manhattan turn into bustling Met Gala workshops—part atelier, part salon, part war room—as celebrities, fashion brands, and their respective teams go into overdrive assemblingthe intricate ensembles that will grace the Met stepsat the Costume Institute’s annual soiree. Then, at last, it’s time for the postgame: After the main event, but before retreating home to de-glam for the evening, the celebs hit the glitzy party circuit. Last night, the best-dressed VIPs changed into their afters finest and headed toThe GQ Partyat The Twenty Two, the Manhattan outpost of the posh London hotel-slash-members’-club. Tucked in an intimate corner of the hotel’s Café Zaffri was our very own photo studio, where photographer Tyrell Hampton shot playful portraits of the night’s biggest stars as they goofed around on a real-deal king-size bed.

    "title": "Ryan Coogler, DeAndre Hopkins, and Arthur Jafa Linked Up with Fear of God Before the Met Gala",
    "article_text": "Last night’sMet Gala was an exhilarating celebration of Black excellence—and nowhere was that energy more prevalent than on the 12th floor of the luxurious Aman hotel in midtown, where Fear of God maestro Jerry Lorenzo assembled an Avengers-level group of Black talent to get dressed in his threads for the historic night. Sleekly dressed assistants, photographers, and handlers hurried back and forth across a suite strewn with clothes, but the vibes remained overwhelmingly positive, upbeat, and supportive. In between photos, the veteran artist Arthur Jafa dapped NFL wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, who recently joined Jafa’s beloved Baltimore Ravens. “You guys gonna get one this year?” Jafa asked with a laugh. “This is what I love doing man, coming out and supporting my friends,” Hopkins told me. “I’ve always been a big fan of Jerry even before we met, what he's done for the culture, for young guys like myself, who are motivated by people of color who break through it and do things that not a lot of people have done before. And if you know a little bit about Jerry, man, his background, where he comes from, everything about him is legit and it’s hard not to get behind somebody like that.” Ryan Coogler The evening represented a rare opportunity for Hopkins to let loose a little before locking back in for offseason training. “I’m looking forward to starting training with my QB, Lamar Jackson,” he said. “I understand where I am, I understand my age and all that, but I still feel like I got a lot of ball left. So I’m excited to go out and show the world.” This being Hopkins’ first go-round at the Met, he said he was most intrigued to finally see what actually goes on inside the event once the carpet is wrapped. “I know a couple people who went, [but] they didn't give any details. It was a secret, like you had to be there to know, so I guess I'll keep that secret when somebody asks me what happened inside.” Jafa admitted he wasn’t too pressed to attend his first Met Gala, but nevertheless couldn’t say no to a call from his longtime friend and supporter Lorenzo to be a part of this moment. “I'm really interested in fashion and aesthetics,” Jafa said, as he received a few last-minute fit touch-ups. “And I’m also very interested in the artists who are trying to tap into—I guess you could call it vernacular aesthetics, people might say ‘ghetto,’ they might say ‘street.’ You can say a lot of things, but I'm very interested in the transposition of those aesthetic values into what you would consider mainstream contexts.” Jafa pinpointed this year’s theme as one signifier of a larger cultural wave that’s happening in fashion and entertainment right now. “I think there's a unique desire [right now] to see what I would describe as Black Expressivity, sort of unconstrained and unmediated in a sense,” he said. “And I think this is because we really strike a chord with people.” Jafa cited the phenomenon ofSinnersas one such example—just as Ryan Coogler and his wife Zinzi trailed into the room behind him, dressed to the nines. The filmmaker and producer behind the biggest movie in the world right now graciously accepted all of the praise, but Coogler admitted they were just “happy to be at something that ain't about us,” he said with a laugh. “Happy to be here in service of Jerry.” Coogler and Lorenzo go back, sharing California roots—Coogler hails from the Bay, while Lorenzo is from Sacramento—and formally connecting around the time Coogler released 2015’sCreed. “The day we met, me and Zinzi were at ComplexCon,” Coogler recalled. “Something got messed up with our ride, so we ended up trying to do our own thing. And I had one of [Jerry’s] denim jackets on, and I saw him recognize me. He was like, ‘Hey, man, nice jacket.’ We exchanged info on the spot and he's just been real supportive since then, man. Every time we release a project, he'll find a way to support it. If he can design something, he will.” DeAndre Hopkins Jerry’s maintained that support withSinners, designing exclusive merch for Coogler and Zinzi’s first original blockbuster. Coogler shared that when they screened the film for Lorenzo a while back, he “related to it on a level that I didn’t expect, because he has a history as a promoter.” The SmokeStack twins’ zeal to get their juke joint poppin’ unexpectedly struck a reflective chord with Lorenzo, reminding him of the historic run of JL Nights parties that he organized before becoming one of contemporary fashion’s preeminent designers. Now, here he was dressing the film’s creators for a Met Gala where Smoke and Stack’s 1930s-era fits would’ve looked right on theme. The irony wasn’t lost on Coogler, who agreed it felt like some sort of divine alignment. “I don't believe in coincidences,” Coogler said. “It's just exciting, man, that this would be the theme when we got this movie coming out. Our people been here for so long, bro—it's like, any type of art form or aspect of the culture, we got a part in its direction.” Still, Coogler and Zinzi were far from victory lap mode, admitting that there was still “much to do” in support of the movie as it continues a superlative theatrical run. “We’ll take a nap and get back to it…though eventually,” he said, tapping Zinzi’s pregnant belly affectionately. “We’ll have to sit down soon.” Jerry Lorenzo “The theatrical experience is everything to us,” Zinzi said. “It's where our company name is rooted: Proximity Media. We started out wanting to tell stories exclusively for the theatrical experience. And Ryan came up with our name because thematically, the stories we try to tell are about people and communities [that are] often overlooked. [We wanted to] bring audiences in closer proximity to those stories—and bring audiences in closer proximity to each other.” Coogler asked me what my go-to theater was growing up—the one guaranteed to have the strongest cultural representation in the audience, no matter the movie. (Regal Court Street in Brooklyn, by a mile.) “So where we're from, bro, especially if it's a horror movie—you can't even hear the dialogue, people are talking so much. But that experience, it elevates it so much. It's so much fun. That was how I fell in love with movies, bruh, before I knew I was going to grow up and make them. I thought I was going to be like DeAndre, playing football and shit, bro.” Arthur Jafa “And you did,” Hopkins chimed in supportively, referencing Coogler’s time at Saint Mary’s and Sacramento State. His voice emerged disembodied from behind racks of clothes, where he was taking a quick power nap to rally for the night ahead. “Deandre, are you in there, bro? You okay?” Coogler called out with a laugh. “I’m good now, I got my cappuccino,” Hopkins replied groggily. “There's no film fans like football players, bro,” Coogler told me. “We would bring movies in the night before a game and it'd be hella interactive.” Coogler and Zinzi’s infectious love for the theatrical experience is part ofSinners’ success—as evidenced by the charming video they made breaking down the different film formats it would be available in. Coogler admitted he was nervous while recording it, and “didn't think people would care. But for me, I just wanted folks to know what was available to them and that we were thinking about it. Because that matters. Like, if I come in here on a fashion tip and Jerry start talking to me about a lapel, now I care about the lapel because he cares about it. You know what I'm saying?” (Coogler also noted that the immaculate handwriting on the whiteboards is Zinzi’s, because his is “atrocious.”) “I was just trying to get the word out,” he said. “But to see people take to it was real heartwarming.” “None of this is guaranteed, bro,” Coogler said of the film’s success. “And there was a lot on the line with it for us, and also culturally, the conversation about the habit of moviegoing and [whether] it’s a thing of the past. So it was exciting to see people come out again and talk about it and be inspired by it. We really enjoy that, because that was us. We used to go to the movies on dates and come out inspired.” As for their date night at the Met Gala, Coogler and Zinzi laughed at the idea of it being a long one. “We're old parents right now,” Coogler said, beaming. “So after the show, we might retire, bruh.”",

    "title": "16 Best Wrinkle Creams 2025 for Smoother, Clearer Skin",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Every line on your face tells a story, but if you'd rather leave some of those stories untold, then the best wrinkle creams might help smoothen things out. We're not saying these recommendations will leave youcompletelywrinkle-free, but these are some of the best options for slowing down the signs of aging on the skin. When it comes toanti-agingskin care products—or anyskin carein general—active ingredients are key. “I kind of like to break it down with anti-aging ingredients: What happens with age that these ingredients can prevent?\" Dr. Muneeb Shah, also known as the “DermDoctor,” a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the new skincare brandRemedy, says. “So, loss of collagen and elastin, thinning of the epidermis, slowing down of skin cell turnover…anything that's going to support collagen and elastin is going to be beneficial with aging.” After months of testing anti-aging products (and some overall guidance from the good doctor), we narrowed down our medicine cabinet to the top 12 best wrinkle creams for nearly every skin type and issue. Jaxon Lane Amazon Price Per Ounce: $17.73Key Ingredients: Gotu kola, squalane, ceramides, hyaluronic acid It's amazing how many research-backed anti-aging ingredients are contained in this $36 face moisturizer for men. It's proof that you don't have to spend $100 to start your own anti-aging skin care routine (there's a reason it won aGQGrooming Award). The ingredients include niacinamide, ceramides, hyaluronic acid, squalane, and botanical extracts from ginseng and Indian pennywort. Guys, especially those with sensitive skin types, will appreciate the lightweight formula, which is also fragrance-free. Cardon Amazon Price Per Ounce: $20.59Key Ingredients: Cactus extract, rosehip oil, niacinamide Cardon is a Korean skincare brand that's a favorite of ours here atGQRecommends. The brand won back-to-backGQGrooming Awards in 2022and2023. We previously named this one of thebest moisturizers for oily skin, but anyone can benefit from its potent formulation of niacinamide and botanicals. Apply this anti-aging moisturizer at night to the entire face and neck. For guys in their 20s and 30s who aren't quite ready for a retinol, make this your new everyday moisturizer. Beau Domaine Beau Domaine Amazon Price Per Ounce:Key Ingredients: GSM10, ProGR3, grape water, olive oil, shea butter Speaking of $200 luxury French skincare products, Beau Domaine is the result of a partnership between Brad Pitt and famed French winemaker Marc Perrin. Along with the brand's face serum and cleanser, this moisturizer gave my skin an undeniable glow-up in just four weeks. It contains patented antioxidants derived from grapes and other natural hydrating agents. It's a luxe unisex moisturizer and wrinkle cream, and one of the best I've ever reviewed. If you really love skincare and want rapid wrinkle repair with natural ingredients, then this cream is worth the splurge. Dr. Loretta Dermstore Price Per Ounce: $41.42Key Ingredients:Antioxidant Lipochroman, peptides, Chromabright This dermatologist-founded brand makes some of my favorite anti-aging products. I recommend this wrinkle cream for anyone dealing with more than just fine lines—although it helps with those, too. It contains retinoid derived from vitamin A to fight wrinkles, improve overall skin brightening, and smooth out skin, while antioxidants such asCoQ10support your body's natural collagen. The formula isn't oily at all, and I found it absorbed quickly into the skin. Just a couple small drops was enough to keep dryness at bay for my entire face. Geologie Geologie Amazon Price Per Ounce: $34.91Key Ingredients: Retinol, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid If you prefer to apply skincare products at night, then go with Geologie's Night Cream. I love this product because it's available with three concentrations of retinol—0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%. You can start with the lower concentration in your 30s, and as your body gets used to the formula, you can increase the concentration for improved results. In addition to retinol, this moisturizer also contains niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. Grown Alchemist Amazon Grown Alchemist Price Per Ounce: $22.65Key Ingredients: Reishi extract, moringa peptides, antioxidants Are you a morning person that likes to apply skincare products in the a.m., fresh out of a shower? Then opt for this Grown Alchemist day cream. The formula contains niacinamide (vitamin B3), glycerin, peptides and botanical extracts from reishi mushrooms and echinacea. In our review, we found it to be a luxurious cream that absorbed quickly. It even contains green tea to help fight blemishes, making it a smart face moisturizer for acne-prone skin types. Skinceuticals Skinceuticals Dermstore Price Per Ounce: $114.19Key Ingredients: Proxylane, flavonoids, glycyrrhetinic acid One of the newest products in this guide, this award-winning Skinceuticals anti-wrinkle cream does more than moisturize. It supports your body's elastin and collagen production, which means it can fight wrinkles at the source. It also contains more proven anti-aging ingredients such as niacinamide and licorice extract. While it's a pricey balm, it's worth it if you're fighting deep wrinkles. This is a good option if you don't tolerate retinol, although it would be a good complement to a retinol moisturizer, too. Prose Prose Price Per Ounce: $30.59Key Ingredients: Depends on the formula Prose takes customization seriously. For instance, the brand might add extra UV protection to your products based on your sensitivity, location, and the season. I recently tested the brand'snew custom skincare regimen, and I actually liked it more than the famous Prose hair products. The vegan formula I received contains moisturizers such as glycerin and squalene, as well as anti-aging ingredients such as red algae, amino acids, and niacinamide. I normally prefer fragrance-free products, but I love the scent of this gel-like moisturizer, which is non oily. Like all of the best anti-aging moisturizers, it’s also cruelty-, phthalate-, and paraben-free. Kiehl's Amazon Kiehl's Price Per Ounce: $29.40Key Ingredients: Adenosine, proxylane Wrinkles and fine lines aren't the only signs of aging you need to worry about. Kiehl's multi-purpose anti-aging moisturizer was formulated with vitamin A, chaga mushroom extract, and hyaluronic acid to even skin tone and improve elasticity on the face and neck. Apply it every day to the face and neck and you should see a plumping and smoothing effect in four to six weeks. CeraVe Amazon Price Per Ounce: $13.57Key Ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid, ceramides Tired of the sight of fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots? You don't need to pay $200 for a luxe French face moisturizer (though we can recommend a few). This affordabledrugstore brandface moisturizer is one of the few that combines broad spectrum SPF 30, for daily sun exposure, with retinol to protect and repair the skin. This day cream also uses hyaluronic acid to as the moisturizing agent, and it's suitable for all skin types. For a $28 product on Amazon, it's punching way above its weight class. RoC Amazon Price Per Ounce:Key Ingredients: Need a concentrated dose of anti-aging ingredients in an affordable package? Not only does this wrinkle night cream contain retinol to fight wrinkles, but it also contains exfoliating glycolic acid to help with dark spots and other signs of aging. Additional moisture comes from squalane and shea butter. Suitable for men and women, we recommend saving this product for deep wrinkles. Kiehl's Kiehl's Amazon Price Per Ounce:Key Ingredients: Kiehl's anti-aging moisturizer for men contains two potent ingredients: salicylic acid and caffeine. The former is a powerful exfoliating agent, useful for more than just acne, and the latter helps to energize the sensitive skin under the eyes, just like your favorite eye cream. It also has additional botanicals and moisturizers and a subtle, masculine fragrance. The whipped-cream like texture is soft to the touch and absorbs quickly. SK-II Amazon SK-II is a GOATed brand when it comes to skin care, and its Skinpower moisturizer might be one of its most popular products. Why? Just ask the millions of people who use it and have noticed the diminished appearance of fine lines or those who have yet to see any little wrinkles start to crop up. Noble Panacea Dermstore Are we recommending a single-use product? We sure are. These sleep masks from Noble Panacea contain a hearty recipe for keeping your visage youthful, featuring the gentle exfoliator polyhydroxy acid, the collagen booster retinol, and barrier-repairing ceramides to name a few of the ingredient bonafides. Above all else, your smooth-as-butter face will be the only selling point you need. Ilia Ilia Ilia's Barrier Cream looks towards oatmeal to help repair the layer of skin that's most likely to be damaged by environmental factors. Its calming and protecting formula work exceptionally well in the cold weather, but manages to stay light enough to work year round. Estée Lauder Nordstrom Set aside the fact that this cream contains black diamond truffle extract (a.k.a. four words that are guaranteed to inflate the price of this product by 200%), but know that years of innovation have led to a skin care product that's simply a Fountain of Youth in a glass jar. Skin not only looks smoother and wrinkle-free, but hydrated and healthy no matter your age. If you’re fighting wrinkles, it’s all about retinol, retinol, retinol. But what other ingredients will help give your skin a glow-up? “Retinol is probably the most studied ingredient over time for all the signs of aging,” Dr. Shah says. \"Niacinamide is a great ingredient for this…Exfoliating acids like glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, salicylic acid, can all be beneficial.” With anti-aging products, you also need to manage expectations and practice patience. While some of the best wrinkle creams can provide near-instant plumping and firming effects, long-term results take time. That’s because the skin cells in your face take months to fully turn over. “So when you see a product that says, like, results in 24 hours, that's generally just due to the moisturizing effect. It's not really a long-term effect on your collagen or elastin,” Dr. Shah says. “With texture, you should see an improvement in texture in like, two weeks. If you're talking about dark spots, discoloration, uneven skin tone that you see with aging skin, give it a month, six weeks. Anything like fine lines, wrinkles, you gotta give it at least three months, and probably a lot of times six months, to see results, quite honestly. And, if you think about it, how long did it take you to form wrinkles? A decade for you to develop wrinkles? And so it does take time, just like exercising, to kind of reverse those things.” Lastly, there are limits to what you can achieve with over-the-counter products. Dr. Shah says that proactively seeking out professional treatments, rather than waiting for wrinkles to form and skin to sag, can also pay dividends. Prevention will always be easier than treatment. “And then I wouldn't discount having a routine to get procedures done,” Dr. Shah says. “A lot of people get procedures done, almost reactionary, to an issue, right? Like, they develop a wrinkle, or they develop a dark spot, and they go in. But there is something to be said about getting regular [procedures]. Not to the point where it's taking over your life, but going to a dermatologist and getting a laser treatment once a year, which really can make a big difference to your skin health, or doing micro-needling, you know, every six months, or picking something and just having some routine.” We chose these face creams and anti-aging moisturizers based on a combination of hands-on testing and expert input. While Shah didn’t recommend specific products, we looked for the ingredients he said would make the biggest impact on the signs of aging—wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots, uneven skin tone, and sagging skin texture. What are the best anti wrinkle creams? We think the items listed above are the best wrinkle creams out there right now. Our favorite is theJaxon Lane Relax and Repair. What are the best wrinkle cream ingredients? Things like retinol, niacinamide, glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, and salicylic acid, are all ingredients to keep an eye out for.

    "title": "Inside Last Night's GQ Party Hosted by André 3000 With Grace Wales Bonner, Law Roach, and Anok Yai",
    "article_text": "Fashion’s biggest night was just getting started at around 1:30 a.m. when Colman Domingo strutted into The GQ Party with a gaggle of gussied-up artists and starlets tumbling through the doors of The Twenty Two in his wake. The actor’s silky baritone was shot, to say nothing of his legs, following a busy day co-chairing the2025 Met Gala, which culminated in a couple hours of greeting guests at the top of the fashion world’s most famous red carpet. Luckily for him,GQhad its own party and host committee of sorts, topped by GQ global editorial director Will Welch and André 3000, along with Grace Wales Bonner, Law Roach, and Anok Yai. I caught up with Domingo as he beelined for the dance floor. The Met Gala, which this year celebrated the legacy of the Black dandy in menswear, “felt like a quiet act of loving revolution,” Domingo told me. Call that a success. By early Tuesday morning, it was time to celebrate. With DJ Rich Medina setting the rhythm, Domingo, who had swappedhis Valentino capefor a leather Balmain coat, wiggled his hips as Sprinter vans continued to disgorge A-listers out front. It would take more than a persistent drizzle to dampen the post-Met Gala party circuit, a genuinely singular moment in NYC nightlife where hundreds of celebrities wearing the highest of high fashion are unleashed upon a dozen-some parties dotting Manhattan, from august Upper East Side hotels to grungy Lower East Side clubs. Things start late for a Monday (or any day of the week), and go even later. It’s like an entire fashion week’s worth of bashes packed into one highly energetic evening. By the time Domingo arrived, it felt like the best dressed were at The GQ Party, which was presented by Lexus, Capital One’s Velocity Black, 1800 Tequila, and Aramis. In one corner, André 3000, having ditchedhis grand piano, was locked in conversation withLewis Hamilton, who then got waylaid by a big hug from Blackpink’s Rosé. “It’s so good to see you!” she squealed. The Formula 1 legend circled back to make sure he and 3 Stacks got a photo together—one GOAT with another. “This party is where you really get to let your hair down,” declaredLaw Roach, whose own bleached hair remained perfectly coiffed. “And look, people are jumping around, screaming, taking pictures.” All night, you could feel the sky-high levels of enthusiasm around this year’sBlack dandy-themedMet Gala and Costume Institute exhibition. But Roach, coming off what he called “such a special night,” was also reflecting on the rare opportunity to get a room like this together. “It’s about fellowship. Here, you can hang out witheveryone.” And what a room it was. In the warm light of Twenty Two restaurant Zafri’s, Sabrina Carpenter popped into a photo booth with Jenna Ortega, while a Thom Browne-clad Walton Goggins got comfortable in a plush hotel bed—not to order room service but to pose in the GQ portrait studio manned by Tyrell Hampton. The real supermodels—namely Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner, who commandeered a couple of banquettes for their comrade Anok—patiently waited their turn. Near the late-night buffet by chefs Charlie Mitchell and Camari Mick, global celebrity made easy company with creative genius, with Rosé and Jennie whispering amongst themselves right next to generational artists Amy Sherald and Arthur Jafa—both wearing tonal Fear of God cashmere suits—who sipped champagne with rising star Chase Hall. For a moment, Janelle Monae and Al Sharpton had the biggest top hats in the room—until Jeremy Pope waltzed in with a Lincoln-esque stovepipe cocked on his dome. All of which is just a reminder that the afterparties are every bit as much about dressing up—or as Domingo termed it in a speech at the Met that morning, “putting that shit on”—as the main event itself. Nearly every Met-goer changes outfits before hitting the town, and themenswear focusof this year’s Met encouraged plenty of louche tailoring, as well as some moments of late-night poignance. The vintage bicycle hat that Domingo paired with his leather Balmain was a nod to the personal style of pioneering Black designer Patrick Kelly. “Everything I’ve worn this week has been a reference to our culture in some way,” he said. And if you’re wondering what was in the black trash bag André 3000 carried on the red carpet, it was his party look—a pillowy midnight-blue Burberry suithe designedwith Daniel Lee to resemble a “velvet suit of armor.” With red carpet photos flooding Instagram as the evening stretched on, designers took the opportunity to confab with their night’s muses.Grace Wales Bonner, who dressed no fewer than eight people for the Met, let a load off as she grabbed a drink and debriefed with three of them: Hamilton, Tyler Mitchell, and Antwaun Sargent. The Wales Bonner crew agreed they looked incredibly fly, a word that was used purposefully and frequently all evening. By the bar, Zac Posen smiled proudly as he took photos of his Met date Laura Harrier. Leon Bridges, who wore a velvet tuxedo by Nicholas Daley, dapped Daley up and told everyone in earshot about his obsession with the designer’s work. With Domingo still cutting a rug, now joined by Omar Apollo and Andre Walker, last call got pushed back once, then a second time. “I mean, everyone’s here!” saidHenry Golding, sitting on the edge of a booth, the exact spot where at around 2:45 a.m. Zendaya would drape herself next to Hunter Schafer. Golding spotted a friend and leapt up. “You finally made it!” shouted Regé-Jean Page. “No, you finally made it!” Golding replied.

    "title": "Lululemon Yoga Mat Review 2025: Worth the Splurge?",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Before I tried the Lululemon yoga mat, I always thought yoga mats were a little likemattresses—you don’t really know what you’re missing until you use a good one. For years, I cycled through cheap mats that bunched, slid, or turned into peeling messes after a few months of hot yoga. I didn’t expectLululemon’s The Matto be wildly different—at this point, the market is full of “premium” options that rarely live up to the hype. But I’ve seen this mat rolled out time and again at press workouts, group classes, and hot yoga studios, making it a go-to for top instructors and longtime practitioners alike. And while I wouldn’t say it’s perfect (no mat is), I get why it’s built a loyal following. It’s grippy in a way that actually changes how you move, especially in sweaty conditions, and the cushioning strikes a rare balance: soft enough for joints but firm enough for stability. If you practice regularly and want a mat that doesn’t fight you halfway through class, this one’s worth a look. Lululemon Lululemon Specs The version I have at home is a deep, wine-colored swirl—just bold enough to stand out without clashing with the rest of my space. Lululemon rotates its colorways seasonally, but most of them lean muted and modern, which fits the brand’s aesthetic. There’s no big logo or busy pattern, and honestly, I prefer it that way. But design aside, it’s the construction that justifies the price tag. The top layer has a smooth, almost tacky texture—grippy right out of the box, even when things get sweaty. According to Lululemon, it’s built to absorb moisture to help you stay grounded in high-sweat practices, and in my experience, that holds up. I’ve used it in heated classes without needing atowel, which says a lot. The mat is reversible, but I almost always stick with the grippy side facing up. The base is made from FSC-certified natural rubber, which adds both cushioning and a bit of texture if you flip it over. Either way, the mat stays flat and planted—no slipping, no corners peeling up mid-flow. At five millimeters thick, it’s just the right amount of padding for me: comfortable on my knees but not so plush that I lose my balance during standing postures. It is heavier than most mats I’ve used, which may be a consideration if you’re hauling it around frequently. But if you primarily practice at home or don’t mind the weight in exchange for performance, it’s a solid tradeoff. The first thing I noticed during practice was the grip. A lot ofyoga matsclaim to be “non-slip,” but this one actually is—especially when things heat up. I’ve gone through entire sweaty classes without sliding out in down dog or having to readjust my stance in warrior poses constantly. That top layer almost seems to get grippier the more moisture it absorbs, which is rare. It’s not sticky in a way that interrupts transitions either—it just holds you in place when you need it to. The cushioning also strikes a really nice balance. I’ve used mats that were either too hard on my knees or too plush, making them feel unstable while standing on them. This one feels supportive without making me feel disconnected from the floor. I can hold a lowlungeor plank without any sharp pressure on my joints, and still feel grounded in balances like half moon. It also performs well across different surfaces. I’ve used it on hardwood, tile, andcarpet, and it stays anchored with no shifting or bunching. That consistency makes a difference when you want to drop into flow without thinking about what’s underneath you. One of the trade-offs with a mat like this—grippy, absorbent, and built for sweat—is that it requires a little more maintenance than your average PVC roll-up. I try to wipe mine down after each use with a damp cloth—sometimes I’ll use a mild natural soap or a yoga mat spray, especially after a heated class. If I skip that step, I do notice a faint smell lingering (not offensive, just…earthy), which is probably the natural rubber doing its thing. Lululemon says the mat has an antimicrobial additive to help prevent mold and mildew, which is reassuring. But even so, I wouldn’t leave it rolled up wet in a car or gym bag. I usually hang it over a door or railing to air out completely before putting it away, and so far, it’s held up really well—no peeling, cracking, or weird texture changes. One heads-up: Because the Lululemon yoga mat is designed to absorb moisture, you’ll see marks from feet, hands, or water after a session. They usually fade as it dries, but if you’re someone who wants your mat to look pristine all the time, it’s something to be aware of. Personally, I kind of like the visible wear—it makes it feel lived-in, like a pair ofgood sneakers. If you practice yoga regularly—especially styles that get sweaty—Lululemon’s The Mat 5mm is absolutely worth considering. It’s not the cheapest option out there, and it’s not the lightest, either. But the grip, support, and overall consistency it offers make it feel like a tool, not just an accessory. I’ve used enough mats that needed constant adjusting or wore out too fast to know how rare that is. It’s not a perfect fit for everyone. If you’re brand new to yoga or mostly practice at home once in a while, you might not need something this performance-focused. But if you’re showing up on the mat several times a week and want something that can keep up—without distracting you from your actual practice—this one earns its spot.

    "title": "11 Best Nose Hair Trimmers Our Editors Have Tested in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Perhaps it never occurred to you that you might need a list of the best nose hair trimmers until this very moment. Fear not—reasonably priced, speedily shipped (thanks, Amazon), simple-to-use options populate this list of best nose hair trimmers. Meaning—whenever you have a general facial hair emergency that calls for rogue hair removal, you need not add an ear hair trimmer or brow trimmer to your cart. You need only think back to this moment and thank your lucky stars for choosing a gadget to cut hair—wherever it may appear. Similar to other battery-operatedbeard trimmers,back shavers,razors,hair clippers, orbody hair trimmers, nose hair trimmers are ergonomic and designed with durability in mind. You can use many of them on wet or dry hair to trim nose hair, and like otherelectric razorsyou may be familiar with, most nose hair trimmers can actually be used for nose & ears (and also as eyebrow trimmers). To help you keep those unruly nose hairs in check, we’re here with our top recommendations for the best nose hair trimmers—many of which we’ve tested for years to help form our opinions. Keep scrolling for our top picks. Philips Norelco Amazon Best Buy Battery:1 AA battery (included) |Attachments:Linear head, rotary head, detail trimmer, eyebrow trimming guards |Cleaning:Waterproof and fully washable |Warranty:3 years If you’re looking for a quick, pain-free way to get rid of unwanted nose whiskers, Philips Norelco’s Nose Trimmer Series 5000 can absolutely handle that. But this versatile grooming device also covers most hair-detailing needs with precision and gusto. Add in the affordable price, and that’s why it stands as our pick for the best nose hair trimmer, bar none. The 5000 Series includes three types of trimmers: a linear-style trimmer, plus the rotary and detail attachments. Depending on your preference, you can use either the linear or rotary trimmer for both nose and ear hairs as well as working as an eyebrow trimmer. Personally, I appreciate the size of the cylinder on the rotary trimmer, which is wider than most and is able to capture overgrown hairs better than any other trimmer I tested. The linear trimmer works great at managing eyebrows (thanks to two different guard lengths) and tending to fuzzy ear canals. Perhaps the unsung hero of the kit is the straight-edge detail trimmer, which is more than capable of daily touch-ups. Think sideburns, mustaches, or even edging beards in a pinch. The 5000 Series is battery-powered, cordless, easy to wash with a rinse in the bathroom sink, and you already know that anything made from Philips Norelco has longevity. If what you’re after is a no-frills device to manage most facial hair needs, consider this trimmer twenty bucks well spent. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:\"Awesome price. Dependable brand. It's power and speed for trimming is superb. So many attachments for different trimming needs…It's performance is excellent.\" Wahl Amazon Target Reviewed by Adam Hurly, Video by Adam Hurly Battery:1 AAA battery (not included) |Attachments:Rotary and detail heads, eyebrow guide comb |Cleaning:Washable heads only |Warranty: 3years True to its name, Wahl’s Micro Groomsman is easily the smallest nose hair trimmer we recommend — but don’t let its diminutive size fool you. This is a perfectly pared-down trimmer that’s great for home use, and even better for travel. Heck, it’s so small you might forget you stashed it in your dopp kit. The Micro Groomsman offers two interchangeable heads, including a rotary trimmer for nose and ears, and a linear trimmer for detailed work. You can also attach an eyebrow guard to manage any overgrown caterpillars up top. The compact design feels great in the hand, and the stainless steel blades are cinch to clean. Even if you have a primary grooming device you love, we readily recommend the Wahl Micro Groomsman as a go-to backup option or a permanent accessory in your travel kit. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:\"Very easy to operate, works fine on eyebrows, nose, and inner and outer ear hair. Even works with an attachment from a previous trimmer.\" Panasonic Amazon Best Buy Reviewed by Adam Hurly, Video by Adam Hurly Battery:2 AAA batteries (not included) |Attachments: Rotary head |Cleaning:Waterproof and fully washable, easy flush vortex cleaning system |Warranty:2 years Got a partner who absolutely hates when you leave trimmed hair in the sink? This one’s for you. An upgrade from the standard Panasonic ER-GN30 (shown in the video), this trimmer offers everything you’d want from a dedicated nose hair trimmer, but what sets it apart is a vacuum system that sucks up clippings in an instant. Easy clean-up, yes, but the vacuum system also helps prevent bacteria build-up. We call that a win-win. Otherwise, this tool is fairly minimal with no fancy attachments. You get a rotary trimmer, and that’s all. Granted, it’s a powerful one that’s able to mow down the coarsest strands. All told, the GN70-K is best for the person who just needs a dependable nose and ear trimmer that will save them from the mess. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:“This nose hair trimmer spins at least twice as fast as the model it replaced. I think that helps it cut without tugging. I have some ‘thick’ nose hairs that it flies right through. Very impressed.\" Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Battery:Lithium ion rechargeable battery |Attachments:21 in total, including rotary head and detail trimmer |Cleaning:Waterproof and fully washable |Warranty:8 years Nose hair trimmers can be admittedly limited in terms of function. If you’re on the hunt for a device that can handleallyour hirsute needs, errant nose hairs included, we'd be remiss not to mention going the route of the multigroomer. And for that, you want Philips Norelco’s 9000 Multigroom 9000 Series. GQ’s pick for thebest beard trimmer, the Multigroom 9000 Series is my all-time favorite grooming device. Why? Largely because of all the hair customization it offers users across from head to toe. The MG9510 is an all-purpose groomer that features 21 tools and accessories in total, including a rotary head trimmer and precision detail trimmer — two heads that come with most nose hair trimmers. Whether beard, body, or nose hair, the Multigroom 9000 Series is a brilliant investment. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:\"Very good product. Works very well, easy to use, very effective. Has plenty of accessories for all grooming needs. Battery life is good and easy to charge. Comes in convenient and sturdy case, very convenient for travel.\" MANSCAPED Amazon Target Battery:AAA battery (rechargeable battery included), USB-C |Attachments:Rotary head |Cleaning:Waterproof and fully washable |Warranty:3 months Manscaped’s rotary nose hair trimmer is straightforward, but it’s worth noting that it much muscle as most beard trimmers. During our testing, the Weed Whacker cut nose hairs with ease. The tool will be a godsend for guys who canals sprout thick bushels of hair. But what sets this nose hair trimmer a part is the fact it comes with a rechargeable AAA NiMH battery, which will give you a run time of 45 minutes. When you need to top up, all you need to do is plug in the included USB-C charging cable. If your nose hairs call for a dedicated nose hair trimmer with an impressive run time, stick with Manscaped. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:\"Great results. Don’t have sticker shock, you get what you pay for and this thing does all it claims to do.\" ConairMan Amazon Ulta Battery:AA battery (not included) |Key features:Rotary head, dual detail trimmer and shaver head |Cleaning:Washable heads only |Warranty:2 years If you have a beard and your grooming routine requires a more exacting tool, ConairMan’s Nose and Ear Trimmer kit will serve you well. I think of this more as a mustache and beard-line tidier-upper, as opposed to a nose hair trimmer. The tool has a rotary blade that makes quick work of nostril hairs. But its two-faced trimming and shaving head is its best calling card — you get a straight-edge detailer on one side, and a shaver on the other. If you’re looking for a tool that can truly tend to the lower half of your face, ConairMan offers an excellent package that’ll get the job done. What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying:“Trims close, never bites, quick to use, and long battery life. Best I've ever used.” Amazon This ultra-affordable nose hair trimmer has a nearly five-star average from a whopping 77,000 ratings on Amazon—and a sterling endorsement from Ian Burke, one ofGQ's senior commerce editors. “My girlfriend got me this as a sort of gag gift last Christmas,” he says. “I guess she got sick of watching me rip them out one by one on the couch. It honestly turned out to be one of my favorite gifts, and over a year later, this thing still works great—and I haven't had to change the battery a single time.” Royal Amazon Remington Amazon Wahl Amazon While many nose hair trimmers tout motors with serious RPMs and boast about their long battery life, the truth is, you won’t be using it much—maybe once every couple weeks for a mere 5 or 10 seconds. But that’s no excuse to skimp on them, either. Here are a few things to consider: We’ve tested over 25 nose hair trimmers for this guide, using them on our noses, ears, and faces. The devices run the gamut of price and type, from electric trimmers and multigroom beard trimmers, to manual nose hair trimmers. For every nose hair trimmer, we take note of general performance, versatility of trimming heads, battery life, washability, and ease of use. With more than a decade of experience testing products and writing about the grooming industry, I’m usually one of the first to receive new devices as they become available. So, I’m always considering which tools deserve accolades—similarly, which ones are worth your money. What is the best nose hair trimmer? The best men’s nose hair trimmer isPhilips Norelco’s Nose Trimmer 5000 Series, according toGQ. The powerful device offers dual trimming options (for internal and peripheral nostril hairs) and also functions as a facial hair, eyebrow, and ear hair trimmer. Can a nose hair trimmer cut you? Whether you are using a rotary head or a linear head, nose hair trimmers are built with a protective guard, which ensures the blade doesn’t come in direct contact with the skin. The protective guard also helps you get a clean cut so the device doesn’t pull or pluck at your nose hairs. Generally speaking, nose hair trimmers do not hurt. Can you wash nose trimmers? Not only can nose hair trimmers be washed, but it is important to disinfect them between use, first by flushing out stray hair clippings. Let them dry before storing, too, to avoid rust and bacterial proliferation between each use. It’s a good idea to clean the device again before using it, since itisgoing into your nose, after all. Do you need a nose hair trimmer? Nose hairs are a natural part of the human body and they actually serve as a defense system. Celebrity groomerSimone, whose clients include Mahershala Ali, Ramy Youssef, and Jason Schwartzman, explains that nose hairs “act as filters and prevent toxins, dust, and other allergens from getting in your body,” adding that just “the way hair on our bodies act as a barrier and protect us from environmental damage, same goes for nose hairs.” How do you use a nose hair trimmer? To trim your nose hair, simply stick the trimming tip of the device in your nostril and apply a gentle circular motion. Here are a few more tips to keep in mind, according to Simone: How do I clean my nose hair trimmer? “Some nose hair trimmers are waterproof, so it’s easy to just rinse under water, if you are the sole user, and just let it air dry,” says Simone. If you share the device with somebody else, then it’s going to be all the more important that you disinfect between uses (ideally beforeandafter each trim). “Make sure you have tapped out the hair trapped inside to avoid clogging,” adds Simone. “For a disinfectant, I would use a sterilizing alcohol pad or barber’s disinfectant, and just wipe the tool gently dry.” Simone(who is professionally mononymous) is a celebrity men’s groomer. Her A-List clients include Mahershala Ali, Ramy Youssef, Jason Schwartzman, John Magaro, and Brandon Perea. Adam Hurly has been covering men's grooming forGQsince 2016. He also writes about travel.

We would have been in on any project from John Reardon, who spent years working directly at Patek Philippe and Christie’s auction house before founding his siteCollectability, dedicated to all things revolving around the beloved Swiss watchmaker. But his new collaboration with Dennison is even more exciting than we could have imagined. Not only is there a pair of very pretty new watches, but they also arrive at a very tempting sub-$1,000 price point. Reardon, who knows his way around the most high-end, elegant watches, applied all his expertise for a pair of watches with Dennison that cost just $690 each. Reardonis a man of exquisite taste. He’s forgotten more things about Patek Philippe than I could ever hope to know. And Dennison, which was founded in America in 1874, hit it out of the park in late 2024 with the ALD, its new collection oftonneau-shaped dress watches with sunray or genuine stone dials. In fact, it was these watches that caught Reardon’s eye (which is accustomed to poring over details from six-figure 1463 chronographs andseven-figure 1518 perpetual calendar chronographs). Reardon only met Dennison’s current stewards because he thought they were wearing vintage Pateks at last fall’s Geneva auctions. “I noticed there was a father and son in the front row wearing what I thought were Ellipse or Golden Circle Patek Philippe watches,” Reardon told me. \"So I went up after the auction, introduced myself, and it turned out to be Stéphane Cheikh, the director of Dennison, and his son, both wearing Dennison ALD watches. I was like, ‘I would wear that and my kids would wear it and my wife would wear that,’ and I assumed it'd be a few thousand dollars.” When Reardon found out it wasn’t even a single thousand, he was determined to work together on a project. Now, that project is available for pre-order in either gold or stainless steelon Dennison’s website. The watch sports a gorgeous bi-color sunray design that’s split into an outer graphite-blue area and an inner dark blue area. Reardon’s objective was to make the watch as pared-down as possible—there’s not even a logo on the dial. “This is something that I felt very strongly about: I wanted the design to speak on its own without a Denison logo or a Collectibility logo,” he said. “When I pitched that idea to the team, everyone questioned it. They were like, ‘I don't understand—it should have some sort of branding on the dial, especially for a collaboration.’ But for me, this is a design-driven project. It's a design from Emmanuel [Gueit, the man behind Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak Offshore (among many other models)], and by having the extra element of the two-tone dial, it doesn't need to have a signature on the dial. The watch itself is the signature.” Meanwhile, the two-tone dial is inspired by the relatively rarePatek Philippe Golden Ellipse ref. 3862with a similar aesthetic. “It's an homage to something that I can't even source for my own clients or for my own personal collection,” Reardon said. “So I don't feel like we're really taking anything from the world of Patek Philippe, and Emmanuel's design is so different and actually I prefer it. It's a little more elongated. The size and shape are much different than the original Patek Philippe. But the two-tone dial is inspired by it.” The rest of the details are equally well thought out. The spade handset, either steel or gold-tone, has no seconds hand in the manner of classicdress watches, and is powered by a simple Swiss-made quartz Ronda 1062 movement. Paired to a 20mm bespoke leather strap with a 16-mm pin buckle matching the case architecture, it’s a thoughtful design that offers enormous bang for your $690 bucks. In addition to Reardon's expertise, the design comes from another design luminary in the watch world. To have someone like Gueit behind a watch at such an affordable price point is rare. “The more I learned about Dennison and how Emmanuel Gueit designed this watch, the more I fell in love with what they're doing,” Reardon said. “The size of the watch, the thinness of the case and the proportions very much speak to the ‘70s and ‘80s aesthetic that I love. Of course, Patek Philippe did similar pieces which are near and dear to my heart, but they’re also at a very different price point with many more zeros. This [price point] is not what I do on a daily basis—I'm used to paying this kind of money for a buckle or a strap, and here you can get a watch, which I think has a really persuasive story, in that same price range.” The easy-on-the-eyes price tag is thanks to the movement powering the watch. “I'm not afraid ofquartzwatches. I celebrate quartz technology,” Reardon says. All the better, as it allows Dennison to offer the watch at microbrand-like prices, making it accessible to a wider number of people, even hardcore collectors who might, like Reardon, not want to wear their actual, very precious, Ellipse on the street. Considering the men behind the design, the price tag, and the undeniably great-looking watch, there should be no shortage of people interested in the Dennison + Collectability Sunray Dial. Midcentury Patek fans will be well served by its referential proportions, while those searching for a handsome, affordable dress watch will no doubt scramble to preorder one. Production is limited, and Reardon expects to sell out during the five-day order window that ends May 11th. “We never imagined we would even consider such a project,” Reardon said. “I know from my collectors, many of them have 50 or over 100 Patek watches, and this is going to be something that's a slight nod to the past and something that's fun to wear.” Even more exciting is imagining the folks who aspire to but don’t have a single Patek watch. Now, for less than $700, they can own something that gives them that feeling.",

    "title": "Justin Bieber and Timothée Chalamet Skipped the Met Gala for the Same Reason",
    "article_text": "As far as party invitations go, theMet Gala—the glitziest, glamorous-iest, highest-wattage bash of them all—ranks among the most impossible to turn down. Unless, of course, you happen to be Justin Bieber or Timothée Chalamet and your respective favorite teams are both kicking off their second-round playoff series on the first Monday in May. That’s right, bothTimmyand theBiebs—two of the most bewitching and anomalous dressers of our time—failed to grace the fabled Met steps with their presence last night. (Both men last attended in 2021:Chalamet in a pairofHaider Ackermann-designedsweatpants; Bieber in aroomy suit from Maison Drew, an offshoot of hisnow-disavowedfashion label Drew House.) While some folks online were initially disappointed, neither star left their fans wondering where they were for long, thanks to a pair of near-identical Instagram posts that got to the bottom of the mystery: They were watching sports. Bieber was focused on his beloved Toronto Maple Leafs battling the defending NHL champions, the Florida Panthers. Chalamet spent the night rooting for his hometown New York Knicks against the defending NBA champions, the Boston Celtics. Plush couches and fuzzy slippers were even involved in both mise-en-scènes. “Shitting myself this game is insane,” Chalamet eloquently explained inone IG story. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. “Dudes rock,” one of my colleagues remarked upon seeing both posts. “That really is so Boy of them,” another chimed in. But frankly?I get it. Chalamet, despite recentrelationship-based challenges to the contrary, is an established and dedicated Knicks fan, going as far as to travel to Detroit with Ben Stiller for Game 3 of New York’s first-round matchup withthe Pistons. Bieber isthepreeminent celebrity Leafs fan, often palling around with Toronto captainAuston Matthewsand once literally pausing in the middle of filmingaGQvideoto catch a few precious moments of a random regular season game. Ofcoursethese guys skipped the Met Gala to stay home and watch sports! (Chalamet’s girlfriend, Kylie Jenner, and Bieber’s wife,Hailey, however, still attended the event on their own.) For all the anxiety and panic theMet red carpetoften instills in its celebrity attendees, that pales in comparison to the abject horror of your team being in a critical postseason game and not being able to follow along. (I should know: asGQ’s resident Leafs obsessive, I was stuck frantically refreshing the box score last night while also desperately racing to push out our Met coverage. Justin, let’s link for Game 2.) Thankfully for both Chalamet and Bieber, the games played out almost as similarly as their IG posts. The Leafs overcame losing their starting goalie midgame and a late push by the Panthers to seal a 5-4 victory, while the Knicks rallied from 20 points down to eke out a 108-105 W in overtime. They were the kind of games, frankly, that any fan in their right mind would feel foolish to have missed—no matterwhatelse might be happening that evening.",

    "title": "What Is Black Dandyism?: A Look Back Through the GQ Archives",
    "article_text": "In September 1967,Sammy Davis Jr. became the first Black man to appear on the cover ofGQ,in a photograph that looks just as ineffably cool now as it did then. Leaning up against a blond-wood fence, the legendary Harlem-born entertainer draped the jacket of his three-piece double-breasted plaid suit over his shoulders, his right arm loosely hugged around his torso, showcasing his wide gold pinky ring. The swoopy, hand-drawn cover line proclaimed Davis as “something else!” Something else, indeed—in more ways than our predecessors ever could have known six decades ago. Next week, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute will present its spring exhibitionSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style, which will parse a history of Black fashion and expression through the exuberant suiting and formalwear ofdandyism. The so-calledMen’s Galafelt like an opportune moment to look back on how Black creativity and style has manifested inGQ’s history—in front of and behind the camera; through words, clothes, and other wisdom. From Davis onward, we combed through the magazine’s back catalogs and found a lineage of new and familiar faces in various states of elegance and theatricality: Miles Davis at his grooviest; a fresh-faced Magic Johnson in pleated khakis; a vaudevillian portrait of Bernie Mac; Tyler, the Creator in a corduroy tux. We spoke toGQpioneers like Jim Moore and Mobolaji Dawodu, as well as trailblazing cover models Urs Althaus and Rashid Silvera, about how these images came to life. As more Black creatives joined the publication behind the scenes in the late 2010s, representations of dandyism in the magazine have continued to evolve. The thing about images, though, is that there is always more life going on beyond the frame. Early on, the magazine’s vision was anchored in a Eurocentric ideal of decorum, but over the decades its definition of style and sophistication evolved to include people of color, queer people, women, and those who reside at the intersection of those identities. Central to this expansion is the influence of transatlantic Black dandyism. In her 2009 bookSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, Monica L. Miller explores how this sartorial tradition became a way for Black people to challenge dogmas of who gets to be seen as refined and respectable. That history and Miller’s research are at the heart of this year’s Met exhibition. When Sammy Davis Jr. graced the magazine’s September 1967 cover, he didn’t just model clothing; he broke barriers as the first person of colorto frontGQ.In a year fraught with violent manifestations of racial tension, it wasn’t easy to be a Black person on the cover of a historically white national magazine. The United States had just legally desegregated with the passage of the Civil Rights Act three years earlier, Malcolm X was assassinated two years prior, the carnage in the Vietnam War was escalating, and nearly every week a riot broke out across the nation in protest of police brutality and racial inequality. Still, Davis embodied the epitome of elegance, decked out in a Sy Devore three-piece, hair perfectly coiffed, and flashing a megawatt smile. Two years before hisGQcover, the American entertainer published his autobiographyYes I Can,where he recounted his family band’s reputation as the best-dressed group around: “Even if each of the trio owned only one suit and one pair of shoes, the suit was pressed, the shoes shined,” theGQprofiler notes in the text accompanying the 1967 shoot; later, when Davis hit the big time, he treated himself to Carnaby Street shopping sprees. “I have a feel for clothes. I think things out—there must be a reason for everything,” Davis said. No matter the circumstances, impeccable self-presentation was a constant. That’s the essence of the Black dandy—smiling and “stylin’” through it all, as Miller puts it. GQturned its gaze toward Africa in the February and April 1968 issues. The former featured a dashiki on the cover, while the latter centered on a journey to Kenya. In the accompanying April spread, a striking portrait of a rural Maasai family by Horn/Griner shows a man standing in a “French-cuffed dinner shirt of silvery blue rayon, nylon, and…metallic threads” paired with a dinner jacket from After Six. He’s dressed for a formal evening at home. On his feet are sandals worn in from a long day of walking. Although his attire is of Western origin, he still maintains his tribal identity through his ornate earrings and the staff in his hand. Black models begangracing the coverofGQin 1973, when Pat Cleveland became the standout star of the December “Elegance Again” issue. In the accompanying editorial, she radiates opulence, draped in everything from a mink-lined black cashmere coat to a sequin-striped John Anthony suit adorned with a dramatic lavallière collar. Though several men appear throughout the spread, Cleveland remains the centerpiece, effortlessly lounging and strutting aboard the SSMichelangelo. Urs Althaus, a Nigerian-Swiss model, was just 22 years old when he becameGQ’s first Black male model cover star on the November 1977 issue. According to Althaus, he didn’t quite grasp the gravity of that distinction untilGQart director Harry Coulianos greeted him at the New York shoot with a glass of champagne. They toasted and celebrated this landmark moment—though Coulianos did express his anxiety over the decision. “We were looking at the picture selections,” Althaus recalls, “and [Coulianos] went over to me and said, ‘I might be fired. It’s the first time we are coming out with a Black man in a [full] spread.’” The cover, however, was a success—and opened up opportunities for Althaus to model for Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino, Calvin Klein, and Armani. Two years later, in the November 1979 issue, Renauld White became the first African American male model to graceGQ’s cover. (According to Althaus, White actually shot hisGQcover prior to Althaus’s shoot in 1977, but it was left unpublished for several years.) The cover actually marked White’s third appearance inGQthat year—he starred in spreads in both the February and September issues as well. The February feature was particularly notable: Titled “For Black Men Only: A Complete Guide to Skin and Hair Care,” White not only modeled but also received a coordinator credit alongside skin care specialist Gordon Lee, who operated a Black treatment salon in New York; the piece served as a launching pad for a recurring column about grooming, health, and fitness called “Distinctively Black,” which was written by Lee and others, and ran throughout the 1980s. This lifestyle column—alongside a notable rise in advertisements featuring Black models and products tailored specifically for Black hair and skin—marked a pivotal shift: BlackGQreaders were finally beginning to see themselves reflected in the pages of the iconic American men’s magazine. Inside issues from the ’70s, Black designers, musicians, and athletes were spotlighted as vanguards of menswear. Eugene Reimen and Bert Middleton earned spots in the American Discovery designers’ roundup in 1971 for their innovative work—Middleton’s lavish furs and Reimen’s vivid color patchwork. Walt Frazier, the legendary New York Knicks point guard, took up a full page in his pinstriped suit for the February 1970 issue featuring up-and-coming athletes as part of a spread titled “Tomorrow People Today.” And at the intersection of music and dandyism, both Miles Davis and Isaac Hayes discussed their eclectic careers and equally eclectic wardrobes. “Nearly as celebrated as Miles Davis’s trumpet playing is his long-standing eye for fashion,” read a caption in a feature about the jazz legend from the winter 1970 issue, putting a spotlight on his “strikingly contemporary” preference for “unorthodox hides” and “casual vest-type tops” in the midst of one of his groovier phases. In October 1980, the year he would first star asStar Wars’s suave con man Lando Calrissian inThe Empire Strikes Back,Billy Dee Williams smoldered on the magazine’s cover in a stylish sport coat and skinny tie. The inside spread was full Hollywood movieland glamour, and Williams looked handsome as ever: posted up in a charcoal double-breasted suit on a plush poolside chaise the hue of a lemon rind; grinning widely in a sharp suit and dark aviator shades while leaned against his own Mercedes parked outside the storied LA celebrity hotspot Ma Maison, the birthplace of California cuisine on Melrose Avenue, where Wolfgang Puck cut his teeth. “When I’m not acting or painting, clothes serve a form of creative expression,” Williams said then. “Classic dressing is much easier to deal with since trends keep coming and going. These looks never change.” Williams’s starry appearance would mark the magazine’s transition from mostly featuring models on its covers to entertainers and celebrities, but not before Rashid Dilworth Silvera—a “Jamaican-made,” Boston-born educato with a post teaching literary philosophy at Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York, where he would go on to teach for 36 years—would have his model-making turn on the April 1983 cover. Despite Silvera’s preternatural fashion sense passed down to him, he says, from the maternal grandparents who raised him, he had never had any intentions of modeling. But one summer, while Silvera was frolicking with his then-girlfriend outside his friend’s beach house on Fire Island, he was spotted by a nearby neighbor, the designer Perry Ellis, who flagged him down to aGQproducer. But it wasn’t until receiving a phone call to confirm the spelling of his name (long after he shot a number of suit-centric editorials with renowned fashion photographer Rico Puhlmann) that Silvera, then 35, learned that the magazine had selected a solo shot of him—a closeup in a chunky yellow knit sweater that showcased his sparkling eyes and glossy beard—as the cover. He was dumbfounded. “When they called me to ask me the correct spelling of my name, I’m thinking,This is someone messing with me. There’s a joke,” Silvera recalls now. “I mean,GQwas like a type of bible for me. And I’m the cover?” The cover, he says, was a green light to a whole new universe. He went on to become the first Black man to model in advertisements for Ralph Lauren, as well as one of the American menswear icon’slongtime muses. (“You’re going to be my Cary Grant,” Silvera recalls Lauren telling him when they first met.) Dandyism “embodies something that’s more than formal. It’s playful,” says Silvera. “I used to be a football player. I was an athlete. But my uniform was impeccable, do you get me? I mean, one of the reasons I ran so fast and I got to be sort of a famous athlete is because I didn’t want people to tackle me. I didn’t want to mess up my outfit.” To him, the fashion inGQwas always “about comfort. You know, it would be comfortable in your skin. If your skin is going to be your clothing, well then be as comfortable in that clothing as you would be in your own skin.” Fast forwardthrough the yuppie era to March 1987, when Magic Johnson was well on his way to cementing his place as one of the greatest offensive players the NBA has ever seen. He grinned in a navy sport coat, pleated khakis, and a polka-dotted yellow tie. Two years later, Michael Jordan—also sporting a dotted tie and a pearly grin—madehisGQcover debutwith a shoot by the legendary Richard Avedon; even then, just half a decade into his professional career, the cover line declared MJ as “the best there ever was.” The NBA was entering its superstar era, which would carry over intothe 1990swith its rising stars taking suits to new heights—literally, figuratively, spiritually, all of the above. In November ’93, the seven-foot-one Shaquille O’Neal graced the cover in a peaked-lapel suit whose jacket fell to his mid-thigh, paving the way for the fever-dream draft suits of the Anthonys and the Stoudemires to come. In the ’90s, from professional basketball to magazine-making, everything was going Hollywood. Denzel Washington, photographed in a monochromatic navy kit onthe January ’94 cover, was leading a new generation of Black movie stars. Halfway through the decade, the suits gotsleek,and so, too, were the models: Who else but the first Black male supermodel, Tyson Beckford, in a glen-plaid, peak-lapeled, single-breasted Valentino Couture kit and sporty wraparound shades, could usher in 1995 as “the Year of the Suit”? While the standardGQlook ofthis era—think clean, gray, boxy Armani suits—resulted in plenty of iconic images, it didn’t leave much room for the spirited wiles of dandyism. Those flourishes, however, would soon return in force. Inthe 2000s, hip-hop continued its ascent as a mainstream phenomenon—andGQwholeheartedly embraced the genre’s growing influence on music, fashion, and culture. Jay-Z and Kanye West fronted the Men of the Year issues in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both donning impeccably tailored suits that nodded to their rise as industry moguls. Elsewhere in the magazine’s pages, stars likePharrell WilliamsandAndré 3000reflected hip-hop’s colorful embrace of the preppy aesthetic. In the February 2009 issue, the latter’s fashion label, Benjamin Bixby, earned a coveted spot inGQ’s annual Best New Menswear Designers in America package. For Jim Moore,GQ’s creative director at large, it was a no-brainer to include the Outkast rapper’s designs in the roundup. “It was a mix of his love of Tommy [Hilfiger] from the early ’90s to his color sense and his history,” he explains. “It was everything from formal wear to fluorescent polo shirts. It had a lot of chutzpah and a lot of style, a lot of grit, a lot of his personality.” The decade, of course, also gave America its first Black president. For Barack Obama’s secondGQcover, in December 2008 (his first arrived during his campaign in September 2007), Moore wasn’t allowed to dress the president-elect due to a Secret Service rule prohibiting any incoming or sitting presidents from wearing any clothes other than their own. The suit that Obama pulled from his own closet for the shoot, Moore says, “was definitely a size too big.” With only a 15-minute window to get the shoot done, Moore went to extreme lengths to ensure a proper fit: “As I was talking to him,” he recalls, “I had the tailor go behind him and start pinning the back of it.” Some of the era’s most iconic covers also carry an air of mischief and satire. Take comedian Bernie Mac’s April 2003 cover, for example. Echoing the subversive spirit of 18th-century Pinksters celebrations or 19th-century cakewalks—where Black people parodied European dances and outfits—Mac appears in a tailcoat, top hat, tap shoes, and a hooked cane. In doing so, he not only satirizes traditional symbols of white American entertainment but also asserts his place within its legacy. In the 2010s,GQ’s purview of dandyism expanded. Janelle Monáe, for one, became a recurring figure in the magazine’s pages, thanks in part to the slim tuxedos she had made a vital part of her onstage uniform. “I want to redefine what it means to be young, black, wild, and free in America,”she toldGQ’s Mark Anthony Green in 2017. Meanwhile,Colin Kaepernick’s Men of the Year coverthat year opened doors for more Black creatives to work withGQbehind the scenes. In the lead-up to the shoot, Kaepernick requested to wear only designers of color for the cover and inside spread. “At the time, I felt ashamed that I hadn’t thought of the idea,” explains Moore,GQ’s creative director at large, “but as soon as he said it, I was like, ‘That’s the most brilliant idea.’” Kaepernick and his stylist Rachel Johnson providedGQwith a long list of Black designers, includingJerry Lorenzo of Fear of Godand Davidson Petit-Frère. Miles Pope,GQ’s current global fashion director, was an assistant on the shoot and recalls getting introduced to the bespoke boutique Harlem Haberdashery in the process. The brand continues to collaborate withGQto this day. In 2018, the legendary Harlem tailor and prototypical Black dandy Dapper Dan appeared ina glossy portfoliodedicated to modern dandies. “All the important people that I saw growing up, they had suits,” he toldGQat the time. “A suit was a sign of achievement, power.” When Nigerian-born stylist Mobolaji Dawodu—who would go on to become the magazine’s first Black fashion director—first joined the GQ team in 2016, he saw an opportunity to dress the magazine’s subjects in new ways. “In my brain,GQrepresented men in suits. That was my interpretation of it,” he says. “It represented men in suits, and the idea of tailoring,” says Dawodu, who cites Miles Davis, Fela Kuti, and James Bond as his perennial style icons. “It was exciting for me to bring in the full color. And as a Black male, it was exciting to bring familiarity and a perspective for Black subjects. I just wanted them to be fly, and for the clothes that fit well, it’s actually very simple…. It’s about feeling it. It’s an aura of taste. And it’s more than clothes. We’re talking about clothes, but it’s more than clothes.” Dawodu, who frequently incorporates tailoring traditions from Africa and Asia into his work, explains that his role as a stylist is more or less to help channel a subject’s inner flyness. Dawodu would go on to style street-cast shoots inDakar,Marrakech, andAtlanta. He dressedWill Smithin an embroidered Indian-made suit. He put the lateNipsey Hussle and his partner, Lauren London, in matching ethereal white ensembles, which they modeled alongside a gleaming white horse on a palm-tree-lined street in their hometown of Los Angeles. And he styled Tyler, the Creator—once rap’s enfant terrible—in a tan corduroy tuxedo forhis 2019 Men of the Year cover. “I’d never seen [Tyler] in a tux,” Dawodu recalls, “and I thought it would be a bold statement. It was just really about pushing an artist who’s already dynamic [even further].” GQentered a new era at the turn of the decade, which kicked off in earnest withNovember 2019’s “New Masculinity” issue, featuring a striking image of Pharrell in a voluminous down-quilted gown on the cover. The goal,GQglobal editorial director Will Welch wrote in his editor’s letter, was to explore “the ways that traditional notions of masculinity are being challenged, shifted, and overturned.” “One thing that any dandy has an abundance of is just a love for taking risks and not giving a shit what anybody else says, right? A performative willingness to be overdressed and get noticed, when I think the majority of men would prefer to just be conformist,” Welch says now. “When you talk about dandyism, there is that root in tailoring, there’s that preppiness. New Masculinity was about a different shift, but they’re deeply correlated. You never could have had gender fluidity and the new-masculinity moment without dandyism first.” One of the sharpest expressions of that mission arrived just over two years later, withLil Nas X on the coverof the 2021 Men of the Year issue. The accompanying shoot’s Kennedy-inspired portraits, lensed by Pari Dukovic, finds the pop star playing the roles of both husband and wife in crisp tuxedos and regal gowns, a nod to the oft-overlooked queer lineage of Black dandyism. “It was really about making him feel comfortable, and showing different sides of himself,” says Dawodu, who styled the Lil Nas X shoot. “Being fluid in the sense of wearing exactly what you want to wear, and not conforming to any specific idea of what the style is.” As Miller writes inSlaves to Fashion, “When tuxedoed…class, gender, and perceived racial hierarchies can be disguised, confused, unintentionally or deliberately transgressed.” She traces this subversive history back to Isaac Julien’s dreamlike 1989 filmLooking for Langston,which explores the lives of gay Black men during the Harlem Renaissance. The film’s subjects wear tuxedos both to conform to and to subtly undermine mainstream masculine ideals. Thus, the tuxedo became a symbol of “the queer artistic underground,” according to Miller. Zoë Kravitz also embodied this dualityon her MOTY coverthe next year. Moving forward, Pope,GQ’s global fashion director, says he hopes to see more Black talent in positions of power throughout the fashion industry. “I see a lot of brands and a lot of people pull inspiration from the Black experience and true Black icons and iconography, but then there’s no one in the room who matches that,” Pope explains. “Sometimes, you’ll see an inspiration board and you’re like, ‘Wow, I can point out where all these images are from, because they were part of the history that my parents and my grandparents [taught me about].’” For his part, Pope intends to use the magazine’s platform to help shape the next generation of Black dandyism. “I’m excited for that journey,” he says. “I’m buckled in. I’m ready for it.”",

    "title": "Met Gala 2025 Watches: Exclusive Wrist Shots from Walton Goggins, Usher, and More",
    "article_text": "TheMet Gala red carpethas always been the best place in the world for gawking at incredible fashion, but in recent years, it's also become a great place to spot incredible timepieces. Attendees determined to look their best know they can no longer ignore their wrists. That seems especially true at theMet Gala 2025. The gala's theme is inspired by “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”the Met Costume Institute’s new exhibition exploring the history of Black dandyism. The official dress code is “Tailored for You.” The timepieces worn by the event’s A-list guests this year are especially killer. However, close-ups are hard to come by, and more often than not we're thwarted by those pesky suit sleeves that leave only a fraction of a watch showing or none of it at all. Thankfully,we've found a workaround for the third Met Gala in a row. Tonight, the best-dressed attendees have been sending their wrist shots exclusively to GQ. See the full selection below and check outthe full gallery of watches here. Bellamy Brewster Usher owns the Met Gala red carpet, especially when it comes to watches. His$5 million Jacob & Co. covered in rubies stole the show last year.This year, he went with JLC's famous Reverso. He's removed several zeroes from the price tag, dropping from $5 million to just under $50,000, but the watch doesn't give up that much in its wow factor. This watch is is no slouch in the diamond category. The Reverso is set with over 300 stones. Dayne Malan / Nine Two Six Williams smartly keeps rocking the new-ish mini Royal Oaks. These trendy, snackable, stackable little timepieces are perfect accessories. Anthony Tudisco Last September,before we ever knew the famed artist KAWS (aka Brian Donnelly) was working on a collaboration with Audemars Piguet, he was spotted in a mysterious timepiece. The watch was certainly the brand's flagship Royal Oak, but with a design that wasn't anywhere in its catalog. The piece resulting from that partnership featured one of KAWS's Companions with its hands pressed up against the crystal of the watch, much different from the simple gold Royal Oak with two Xs on the dial Donnelly was wearing earlier in the fall. That timepiece, or an identical one, just popped up tonight at the Met. J Balvin paired his custom Marc Jacobs suit with the watch, which I'm told is a one-of-one that the musician received from KAWS himself. Could this be the very watch that the artist was wearing last year? Whether it's Donnelly's old watch or a special one whipped up just for Balvin, it's a perfect high-level flex for the glitziest red carpet of the year. Stylist: Chloe Hartstein Rock wore this dainty Fred Leighton broach with a tiny clock at the end as a tie on Monday night. That's just clever styling. Why banish a timepiece to the depths of your suit sleeves when it can be front and center around your neck? PHRAA Maluma took Jacob & Co.'s already outrageous Billionaire watch and found a way to level it up several tiers. This is a completely unique piece made to match with Maluma's outfit with emeralds sourced from the musician's native Colombia. The matching emerald jewelry is from SILEO. Jared Cotter Shaboozeyis wearing a killer ref. 15550BA.OO.1356BA Audemars Piguet with a natural turqoise stone dial. A flamboyantly colorful watch for a night meant to celebrate dandyism. When in doubt, reach your hand into Heuer’s deep bag of excellent archives and pull out a grail. Clearly it’s working for Page, who found one of the few watches on the planet as handsome as he is. Goggins is on a tour de force over the past 12 months with starring roles inFalloutandThe White Lotus.Now he's at the Met Gala wearing a powerhouse watch to match. This Vacheron gives you all the functionality of a complete calendar with a super-cool translucent dial. Josh Osuna Keoghan is an Omega superfan turned ambassador. Even before the contract rolled in, he took advantageof the brand’s full catalog. Now a full year in, he’s leaning into the classics,like this “Moonshine” gold Speedmaster. Did you know that James Corden secretly has this killer vintage Patek in his arsenal? I was delighted to find out. This piece dates all the way back to 1953 and represents the slightly cheeky side of Patek. In this era of the manufacturer, it let its hair down and experimented with fun designs and shaped cases. This very square 2514 with what are known as “cow horn” lugs is a real gem. Brandon Todd of the New York Liberty Sorry, the title above is an error. It should sayWNBA CHAMPIONJonquel Jones. She wore a watch worthy of that distinction: a slimmed-down 38-mm of Hublot's famous Big Bang with a bezel set with plenty of diamonds. Somewhere Ellie the Elephant is doing a happy dance. Jeff Goldbum’s deliciously gaudy Jacob & Co. is an homage to what André Leon Talleydescribedas his “version of a tennis watch.” This baby has almost 64 carats of diamonds! Sharif Fennell Jr. It’s always exciting to see H. Moser on the red carpet! This watch uses vantablack, the “world's darkest material” and then threw a tourbillon on top. Straight from the GOAT’s mouth: “I love the story behind it about H. Moser working with Vantablack material and that NASA used it first for space exploration,” Barkley told GQ. “The tourbillon is also fire. It’s clean but also a bit flashy and how it all comes together with the leather strap. I love it; it’s that simple.” Eric Lagg Every part of this sentence gets better than the last: Leon Bridges wearing a piece from beloved watchmaker Urban Jürgensen! With a tourbillon! And it's a pocket watch! “I chose the Urban Jürgensen for its timeless craftsmanship—rooted in history, refined in every detail,” Bridges said over email. “It felt right to wear something with that kind of legacy to the Met.” Hailey Bieber is turning into a watch maniac before our eyes. She seems especially in love with Audemars Piguet, whose Royal Oak she pairedwith Marine Serre's dress made out of upcycled watch band. The dress doesn't lean as horological at the Met Gala tonight, but the watch is her best yet. This vintage AP comes with a diamond-set bezel, white-gold bracelet, and dial made out of shimmering opal. LOTS of diamonds on the Met Gala timepieces tonight and right near the top of the leaderboard is Tookes. Her Carrera comes loaded with over 700 diamonds and—why not?—a mother-of-pearl dials. Our very own Will Welch, GQ's global editorial director, showing some love for the blistering independent scene. Journe represents the apex of watchmaking and this pared-down Chronomètre Bleu with its ridiculously pretty blue dial is a perfect showcase for the brand's skill. Apollo went with a blindingly blinged-out Chopard. While we tend to spread the gospel of their still-somehow-insanely underrated watches around these parts, i’'s always good for the brand to remind people it is an excellent jeweler as well. Apollo’s piece leans into both of those strengths. Smith paired lace with a dainty vintage Omega on a beautifully textured band.",

    "title": "Central Cee Broke His Own Style Promise at the Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "Back in 2023, on his Dave linkup “Our 25th Birthday,”Central Ceedropped the line: “I ain't puttin’ no suit and tie on, I turned down the Met Gala.” Fast forward to 2025, and there he was atthe Met Gala, wearing a suit and tie. That’s because fashion’s annual big one and fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute follows a clearly laid out theme each year. The exhibition's theme is“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”with the dandy at the core. Basically, you need to suit up—and you need to show up. Cench got the memo. Up top, he wore a black custom double-breasted jacket which cropped above the waist. Down south, the rapper rocked straight-fitting pleated trousers and polished leather lace-ups. But to really tap into the dandy thing, you need to give your suit some lift. This means accessories which came in the form of aRichard MilleRM 30-01 Declutchable Rotor White Ceramic watch on a camo strap, iced-out rings, and a Guyana flag brooch as a nod to his dad’s heritage. Sure, Cench’s look isn’t the most out there, but it’s true to theme. This is a guy who famously doesn’t do tailoring, but he broke his own rule to sport a structured double-breasted suit, the kind worn by dandies likeSammy-Davis Jr.in the 1960s. But with a shortened jacket, things instantly look more casual, and way more in Central Cee’s ballpark. To make things even sicker, this custom look is designed byJacquemus, a guy that's known for chopping up the classics and bringing a Euro sense of humor from the south of France. One of his most recent campaigns had a model ironing on a paddle board in the Mediterranean. Enough said. Now, he’s even got Cench, a full-throated suit detractor, wearing that very thing. And you know what? Central Cee, it suits ya! This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Could Trump’s Movie Tariff Be Traced to an Old Grudge Against ‘Parasite?’",
    "article_text": "WhenDonald TrumpnamedJon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone as his “special ambassadors to Hollywood” back in January, no one was quite sure what to make of it. But if we've learned anything from what's happened since Trump let Elon Musk fire up the chainsaw as head of an initiative named after a Shiba Inu meme, it's that these things are never just fodder for easy jokes. Voight and his managerreportedlymet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend to discuss what Deadline termed “a plan to save Hollywood.” And on Sunday night, Trump announced, via his Truth Social account, that he was ordering the Department of Commerce to place a “100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.” [sic] “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump wrote. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnickresponded“We’re on it,” to Trump’s post on Twitter, feeding the sense that something might actually come of this besides talk. Trump’s concern about so-called “runaway production” wasn’t pulled entirely out of thin air. The issue of productions moving out of Los Angeles—and often abroad—in search of more favorable tax incentives has been a hot topic in the entertainment industry for at least a decade, and the situation has only intensified in recent years. The Vice President of IATSE (the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 168,000 crew and craftspeople)told the New York Times last monththat California had lost 18,000 production jobs in the last three years alone. “We are allowing California to become to the entertainment industry what Detroit has become to the auto industry,” IATSE’s Michael F. Miller Jr. said then. California governor Gavin Newsom hadproposed doublingCalifornia’s tax incentive program back in October. Other California lawmakers have put forth even more generous bills. Trump himself referenced the kinds of incentives drawing productions abroad in his own post, and trying to lure productions back to the US with incentives of our own seemed like the logical reaction. Indeed, an incentive program was largely what Voight had been expected to broach with Trump. Instead, Trump announced his plan for “a 100% tariff,” with scant details on what that would actually apply to or mean. It’s not as container ships are arriving at our docks packed with film reels. All of which raises the obvious question: why did Trump respond to the groundswell of support for production tax credits by announcing a tariff? To some extent, the obvious answer is probably the correct one: Trump has become obsessed with tariffs as his economic cure-all in his second term, an infatuation possibly even stronger than the one he had with building a wall in the lead up to his first. It’s like he has one giant button on his desk, and whenever a problem arises, he tries pressing it again. Other countries, like migrants before them, simply aren’t paying their fair share, in his mind. Certainly that’s mostly the explanation, but couldn’t there be something else? One of those half-forgotten grievances that lodges itself in the recesses of Trump’s brain and eventually becomes a worldview? Why might the man, seemingly against the advice of all counsel, prefer a policy that punishes foreign productions rather than one that boosts domestic ones? In retrospect, perhaps a seminal event in the annals of Trumpology was Korean director Bong Joon-Ho’sParasitewinning the 2020 Academy Award for Best Picture. “How bad were the Academy Awards this year, did you see? ‘And the winner is … a movie from South Korea,’ ” Trump said at a February 2020 rally in Colorado. AlthoughParasiteis by Trumpian standards an unconscionably woke film about income inequality and violent class vengeance,  his objection seemed to be less about the content of the movie itself—which it's hard to imagine Trump has actually seen—and more about Bong Joon-Ho's decision to film it in Korean rather than English (its subtitles being perhaps an additional hurdle to a presidentmany have intimatedmay be dyslexic). “What the hell was that all about? We’ve got enough problems with South Korea with trade, on top of it they give them the best movie of the year?” Trump continued. True, “we’ve got enough problems with South Korea on trade” does point to this being part of Trump's longstanding obsession with trade deficits—but that’s not reason enough to discountParasiteas an inciting factor. “I’m looking for like, let’s getGone with the Wind—can we get likeGone with the Windback, please?Sunset Boulevard, so many great movies,” Trump riffed, citing two films that were not eligible for the Oscar in 2020 by virtue of being, respectively, a Best Picture winner from 1939 and a 1951 nominee that lost toAll About Eve. If the reference toGone With the Wind,a movie that venerates the Old South and perpetuates the Lost Cause mythos, can be understood as a red-meat pick for the base,Sunset Boulevardseems the more telling choice. Gloria Swanson’s performance as Norma Desmond, the glamorous, imperious, deluded fading star of the silent film era, living inside a museum to her own greatness is both much more true to Trump’s personal tastes, and the better fodder for a Freudian close read. Is there any famous film character more likely to have a solid gold toilet? It’s hard to imagine that the struggles of below-the-line union members in the greater LA area are any closer to Trump’s heart than the pain caused by the high price of groceries (“It’s such an old-fashioned term but a beautiful term: ‘groceries,’\" Trumpmused last month. \"It sort of says ‘a bag with different things in it.’\") Sunset Boulevard—this is the kind of movie Trump imagines is Oscar-worthy. Not some goofy South Korean class parable with subtitles. Better tax incentives wouldn’t keep movies like that from winning Best Picture. But tariffs that kept Academy members from seeing it might.",

    "title": "‘The Righteous Gemstones’ Is Going Straight to TV-Comedy Heaven",
    "article_text": "InThe Righteous Gemstones’pilot episode, gazing out over his wife Aimee-Leigh’s memorial pool, a distraught Eli Gemstone tells his children: “She was the magic, and now she’s gone, and the magic is gone too.” The three Gemstone children (and Big Daddy too) enjoy the trappings of their ultra-#blessed lifestyle, but the reason for the season, the fount of all that holy abundance—their mother, the center of the ministry and the family—has left them for good, and they’re all aimless and stranded. Now,at the end of their journey, the luckiest wayward spawn of Strip Mall Jesus can now (kinda!) stand on their own. Each of the Gemstones, over four seasons of lurid storytelling, has crept at least a few inches closer to salvation. They’ve drawn their flock closer in, and expanded it outwards. They’ve sinned, been forgiven, and learned to forgive others for their trespasses. They have, against their own unflagging bad instincts and judgment, grown (again, kinda). In constructing our finalRighteous Gemstonesdraft board, we must consider where each character began, and the distance they’ve traveled to get here. More may yet be saved, yes. But only some clearly finish the series on an upward trajectory towards that big custom treehouse in the sky. AIMEE-LEIGH GEMSTONE (Jennifer Nettles).In the beginning: Not present, but felt everywhere, to the detriment of everyone in her family. In the end: MAYBE ACTUALLY PRESENT?? If the Gemstones’ matriarch has been a restless spirit this whole time, it’s certainly understandable. And if anything can finally bring her peace, the sight of her idiot children joining hands to pray over the son of her best friend might just do the trick. KELVIN GEMSTONE (Adam Devine). Previously, in 2019: With the highest hair, the youngest Gemstone child was mathematically the closest to God on the outside, lonely and closeted on the inside. In 2025, he’s finally made an honest man of Keefe, and got offthefit of the episode at his wedding (no mean feat in this family). He also got himself shot, after executing the most harebrained sneak attack strategy ever seen in a show with many, many harebrained sneak attack schemes to choose from. Delivered the most moving passage of the whole episode, because as hinted in the previous two weeks, the baby of the family has turned out to be the only one who can flat-out preach. A true heir to Eli at last—at least behind the pulpit. JUDY GEMSTONE (Edi Patterson).Heart has grown at least one (1) size via putting BJ’s needs ahead of hers in retrieving the exiled Doctor Watson. (Repossessed a service animal from a disabled veteran in doing so, so it’s not all Grape Job stickers this week, okay?) Displayed improved communication skills in lecturing a capuchin monkey about the futility of holding a grudge against someone you love. In a shocking upset, has somehow gone nearly four seasonswithoutgetting shot, despite multiple instances of public menace, embezzling from the family business, and engaging in extramarital near-affairs with unstable men. The spiritual inheritor of her father’s true gangster nature, Judy springboards from forsaking vengeance against her enemy (who is, again, a small monkey) to saving her own life and both her brothers when she’s able to call on that enemy for help. She even sorta comes to terms with her own pain, first in cajoling Dr. Watson and again mid-prayer for Corey, so. Closer to God we all go, right? SUCK IT FUCK IT MUNCH IT OR PUNCH IT won’t easily fit on an airbrushed front license plate, but it’s tattooed on our hearts forever. DR. ELI GEMSTONE (John Goodman).Nicole Cliffe coined the term “beloved shithead children of God” long before audiences met the Gemstones for the first time, but it’s safe to say nobody on earth has had more practice at loving such shitheads than Eli. Has put up with a heroic amount of talk from his children about his dick over the years, and gets another whopping dose in the finale, but still seconds Jesse in his duel (this while successfully talking him out of dueling at all). Does not wind up being the one to deliver the big sermon in the end, and doesn’t have to, a huge W for both him and the future of the church. In the series premiere, Eli’s introductory video in the Salvation Center lobby proclaimed that he’d “built a Christian empire,” and like all emperors, he’s been shown to be one acquisitive motherfucker. He’s also a profoundly lonely man, a loop that finally closes four seasons later with him breezing out of slip 69 in Tommy Bahama finery, a good woman by his side and the first genuine smile on his face we’ve seen all year. Somewhere in Florida, indeed. JESSE GEMSTONE (Danny McBride).A lot going on here for the self-vaunted scion who hasn’t shown himself to be truly adept at anything but dressing this entire time. In this episode alone: Renounced external validation by leaving the Cape & Pistol Society, showed his foe Vance Simpkins mercy, and also accidentally shot someone in the leg. (That’s a full but not atypicalweekend in South Carolina, if we’re being honest.) Got shot for the second time in the series. (Note: Both times by people who know Jesse very well!) Clarified, for the benefit of a monkey, what was and wasn’t a men’s daily carryall, then immediately retrieved what appeared to be an ivory white lady’s derringer from said sling bag. Mirrored the Gemstone family’s ministerial origin story by killing a man, sure, but also by helping a dying soul transition into the next world with comfort. Some might say it’s a little bit Catholic of him, claiming that actions are what makes an impressive man. But as he concludes his journey with us he’s functioning primarily as a power behind the scenes, and seems as fine with it as he’s capable of being. Jesse’s never been the greatest at praying. But he makes visible, effortful progress here, and that’s the whole point. His last intercessions over Corey make the dicks of meaning touch, if you will, and complete the loop on the Gemstones’ turbulent cycle of sinning, prayer, and redemption. AMBER GEMSTONE (Cassidy Freeman).Low work rate this episode, but quietly ensured the earthly salvation of her husband and both his siblings by engineering the return of Doctor Watson. If we have one complaint about this show it’s that Amber didn’t get more of an arc, but truthfully, her character needed one the least. Started on top and stayed there, purposefully mentoring her dipshit husband and accidentally mothering his dipshit sister along the way, to the benefit of all involved. And with the utmost respect: Gets her girls further out and with more daring and better framing than any church wife on record. RESPECTFULLY. KEEFE (Tony Cavalero).Hard to overstate Keefe’s come-up from floating in a tank of Satanic mystery goo in a gimp suit to blushing goth bride and newly-minted member of the family. Our sweet bat boy has weathered the hot piss of the devil and come out sweaty but sanctified. A down-for-his-man legend; a ride or die; a stalwart. All thisandhe somehow got more ripped with each passing season? Dare we say it: A gem. BJ BARNES (Tim Baltz).Emerges from the hardest physical lessons (either God or gravity definitely seems to have strong opinions about that nose job, Beej!) to finish as another solid gold riser. Devastates in his 47th insane fit of the seasonandreunites with his prize monkey/consigliere. GIDEON GEMSTONE (Skyler Gisondo).Apart from being the only person to clock Corey’s gunshots from the boat, is really just here this week to get his story buttoned up. As cozy landings go, however, the launch of his own sick skateboard ministry is a spectacular one. Let’s hear it for the prodigal grandson, dropping in for Jesus. BABY BILLY FREEMAN (Walton Goggins).Gets his arc wrapped up fairly quickly, but Baby Billy’s been a workhorse back all season and this is the fourth quarter. Let the man drink his Gatorade on the bench. He’s earned it. Besides, there’s something faintly poetical aboutTeenjusgetting cut down in its exorbitant prime. And who are we, at the end of this dusty trail, to scoff at what’s clearly a revelation? (For the record: If we were scoringTeenjusthe show as a character, this is about where it’d land. On one hand, it has already cost the family millions and may not ever see any return on account of Billy pulling the plug. On the other: The show’s crew is setting up to crucify Teenjus the person as a teen when Billy calls it quits, a plot point which would have required aseriesof explanations.) LORI MILSAP (Megan Mullally).Points in her favor: Said what she felt when she felt it, frankly and from the heart, and in doing so did eventually get to sail off with Eli. (Calling Lori and Eli as intracoastal sailors here, by the way. They’re gonna hit Amelia Island and maybe get as far down as the Keys, but big open water ain’t them.) Is presumably free of her financial troubles for good. Supportive of her daughter-in-law in the face of deranged behavior on the part of her only son. Points against: Loses that son to the twin demons of generational trauma and brainworms inherited from his daddy. Is presumably going to be a Gemstone herself before too long, a development which will visibly accelerate what until now has been a graceful aging process. JANA MILSAP (Arden Myrin).Spray tan game remains FIRM in trying times. May that virtual carapace of synthetic melanin shield you from a hard world, baby girl. Loses her husband, but didn’t divorce him in time to lose out on the accompanying property inheritance. Life’s rough. Take your wins where you can, and see if you can’t sell the park to the Gemstones after all. MARTIN IMARI (GregAlan Williams).Has quietly been holding his own in the fashion department for four seasons, always serene in an array of crisp damasks and brocades with never a wrinkle in sight despite the coastal Carolina swelter. Showed all the way back in the pilot episode that he’s smart enough not to loan Jesse money, a scene which planted a hope we still cling to today: That offscreen he’s been quietly skimming millions from the Gemstones all along. PONTIUS GEMSTONE (Kelton DuMont).First introduced to the world hurling homophobic slurs at his father; now glimpsed briefly vibing at the lake house and making himself at home in his brother’s pastoral skate park. Once again making maximal shreddage from his minimal screen time. Outlook promising. DR. WATSON (A Capuchin Monkey).At series’ close, has neither murdered nor been murdered by Judy Gemstone. Rejoins the family and will likely end up running the whole church. TIFFANY FREEMAN (Valyn Hall)Her upsides are obvious: Thriving under the continued care and custody of a German giantess; got her husband back from a death spiral of substance abuse and workaholic narcissism. The downside: Got her husband back from a death spiral of substance abuse and workaholic narcissism? SOLA (Kerstin Schulze).Did y’all see the way she lit up when it came time to hit the dance floor to a vintage bleep-bloopy dance beat? That’s real-deal authentic Teutonic boppery there. We didn’t get to see her karate chop a coked-up Baby Billy into an open pit mine. But in the Gemstones universe that continues beyond our sight and understanding, the possibility remains. BIG GUS (An Alligator).As Camus says, one must imagine Sisyphus happy, and so must we assume Gus found purpose and fulfillment in digesting Cobb Milsap along with Corey’s bespoke Rambo knife. No alligators are visible in this episode, but here we find ourselves imagining them happy in the literal sense, as the future stars of what cannot possibly be South Carolina’sfirstChristian gator park and serpentarium, but will certainly be the most expensive. COREY MILSAP (Seann William Scott).Is dead, which won’t leave him on the redeemable side of any earthly ledger, but an accounting must be made. Let’s go to the tape: COBB MILSAP (Michael Rooker).Somehow came off even crazier in a flashback a whole entire episode after he died! Did try to make his son a part of his life and his hobbies? We’re reaching here. BIG DICK MITCH (Regan Burns).Returns in non-miraculous fashion via the aforementioned and deeply undignified flashback scene for the sole purpose of showing off just how easy he was to kidnap. His ultimate fate remains unknown, but if he did survive his nude exit from the gator park, he can take some comfort in being safe from further Milsap molestations. VANCE SIMKINS (Stephen Dorff).Despite his own best efforts and the peer pressure of his Cape & Pistol compatriots, did not get shot this episode, which is more than any of the Gemstone siblings can say. Does not appear to know when he’s beaten, a quality which probably served him well in missionary work, but here seems like a perilous path to pursue any further. Limited ability to serpentine in the face of antique gunfire. Stay down, man!",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. It’s not reinventing the wheel to pull up to theMet Galain sneakers. On this year’sred carpet, we saw plenty of dudes opt out of traditional dress shoes in favor of kicks.Joe Burrowpaired a blue Gucci suit with blue Gucci trainers to match, whileSpike Leestuck to his red carpet tradition of pairing black-tie attire withAir Jordan 3s. The gala is typically ablack-tie affair, but rules—especially in fashion—are meant to be broken. However, there’s showing up in sneakers and showing up in a budgetrunning shoethatNikedropped back in 2019. To get away with wearing it to the red carpet, you’d have to be one of the most significant creative figures of the last century with a billion-dollar bank account to match. Luckily for George Lucas, he can lay claim to both. TheStar Warscreator andTHX 1138director (put some respect on it) pulled up to the gala with his wife Mellody Hobson, who leaned into the theme significantly more than her husband. Hobson Lucas showed out in a subtly bejeweled tweed suit adorned withbroochesand chains, very much in keeping with theSuperfinetheme of the night. George took a far more restrained route, opting for a simple three-button navy suit (with all three buttons fastened). It’s fairly indicative of their dynamic: Lucas has become one of the preeminent wife guys of his era, rarely seen out in public without Hobson and often in mall food courts, waiting patiently for his wife as she shops. He has never seemed like a guy who appreciates the spotlight, so it tracks that he’d keep it simple on a red carpet as major as the Met Gala and let Hobson take the spotlight. Still, he couldn’t help but turn heads with his footwear choice. He walked the red carpet in a pair of all-blackNike Flex Experience RN 7s, a restrained runner that’s a part of a long-tenured budget-friendly running line for the Swoosh. Currently onits 12th incarnation, the RN 7 hasn’t been available in years, which means Lucas likely pulled the peak dad move of liking the shoe so much five years ago that he bought multiple pairs so he’d never run out. Tough to say for sure if he had the Met Gala in mind when he made that call but we’re inclined to say probably not. Most of the time, when a Met Gala attendee laces up a pair of sneakers on the red carpet, it’s with the intention of making a statement, intentionally leaning into the contrast of something ostensibly so low amidst so much high. Lucas’s footwear choice instead feels more like an extension of his character—this is an artist who spent much of his career striving for the autonomy to do things his way with little to no outside interference. It’s why he self-financed theprequel trilogyand turned it into one of the most divisive but artistically singular cinematic accomplishments of the century. He wants to do things his way or not at all—hence finally sellingStar Warsto Disney back in 2012 for an amount of money that ensures nobody can tell him what to do, or which sneakers to wear, for the rest of his life. It makes all the sense in the world—nay, the galaxy—that someone that strong-willed and stubborn couldn’t have his arm twisted into wearing dress shoes to a work event. What are they gonna do, not let in the guy who created Luke Skywalker?",

    "title": "How Henry Golding Found His ‘Holy Grail’ Cartier for Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "Just a few days before he’ll walk theMet Gala red carpetfor the third time, Henry Golding faces a problem. He simply has too many great watches to choose between. Okay, maybe there aren’t lives on the line, but there’s still urgency. Golding describes the Met Gala as the most high-wire of red carpets. “It's one of the more nerve-wracking events,” he tells me. Rather than merely making an appearance to promote a new project—as one might on a talk show or at a premiere—those invited to the Met Gala climb the famed steps with a single divine purpose: looking peerlessly stylish while nailingthe annual theme. And for an ever-growing number of the gala’s A-list attendees, Golding very much included, a watch is a critical piece of the puzzle. Golding’s watch choice feels particularly difficult because he isn’t simply a mannequin happy to wear whatever a brand or stylist urges him to have on his wrist.The actor is a longtime watch collector who once blew an entire season’s paycheck from a travel show he hosted on a Cartier Pasha. He still cherishes the Tank he acquired for theCrazy Rich Asianspremiere. His watch collection is impeccable—and Monday night's challenge was to keep it that way. During our interview on Thursday afternoon, Golding admits he still gets the Met Gala butterflies. He remembershis first time at the event in 2019. “The first one, oh my god,” he says. “I felt like such a plum, just wandering around aimlessly.” Luckily, there is plenty of good art inside the Met to pretend to be interested in. Sure to quiet those anxieties is the companion on his wrist this year. Golding is attending the event with Cartier, which specializes in bulletproof red-carpet timepieces. The brand’s catalog walks an impossible tightrope, combining idiosyncratic stunners with classic, time-tested designs. (The Tank is over 100 years old, after all.) And Golding’s experience offers fascinating insight into how Met Gala guests piece together their most important outfits of the year. Golding is being dressed by the Savile Row tailor Ozwald Boateng, known for breathing modernity and color into traditional tailoring. “Black dandyism is what he's been fighting for his entire life,” Golding says of Boateng. “He’s put this representation in all of his tailoring, so I just left it to him.” Selecting the Cartier accessories that will augment Boateng’s work, however, is entirely up to Golding. There are pins, bracelets, necklaces, and brooches to choose from before he even begins to ponder the all-important timepiece. Over Zoom, Golding shows me just a single page of a PDF provided by Cartier with over a dozen watch options on it. There are several factors to consider. The first is what goes best with his Boateng look. This will remain a mystery until close to gametime. Golding will get into his suit on Monday night and start trying on different pieces from Cartier’s spread. The second factor is his own taste: “I'm traditionally more of a slimmer watch and a smaller bezel kind of guy,” he explained. “I think they look better with suits.” With all those factors in mind, Golding has whittled his choices down to just two possibilities. The first is a yellow-gold Santos. “It's a beautiful classic watch,” Golding says, adding that he believes it looks particularly good with a suit. But the second model is one the actor describes as his “last holy grail in watches.” Early last month, at Watches and Wonders, Cartier announced the revival of one of its most distinctive archival designs.The new Tank à Guichet, which the jeweler originally released in 1928, hardly resembles your typical timepiece. Instead, the watch looks like a Hershey’s chocolate square of precious metal (the trio of new Guichets come in gold, rose gold, and platinum) with just two tiny apertures that indicate the time. The Guichet was on Golding’s radar long before he ever considered what he might wear to the Met. Even during our interview, he speaks gingerly and carefully about the watch, as if he’s afraid to scare it away. “There's, like, one Cartier watch that I'm…like, I need. And it's very rare that I find a [watch] that I'm, like, no matter what, I need to get hold of that.” In Golding’s view, there are two main types of watches. “There are the expensive watches, and then there are the collector's watches,” he says, sounding like he’d fit right in at a geeky watch meetup. The former, he explains, comprise the sparkly, bedazzled pieces meant to appeal to folks with unlimited money: “You've just spent out your butthole for a crazy timepiece,” Golding says, “which is amazing, sure. But [does it have a] history? [Does it show] your knowledge of what horology is all about?” True collector’s watches, by contrast, “don't have to be the most expensive, but they are hard to get, hard to track, hard to find,andhave more of a story than just, ‘I got this looking shiny watch.’” Golding points to Tyler, the Creator as someone whose collection epitomizes this latter philosophy. And while the Guichet boasts a $47,700 price tag that makes Golding hold his head in anguish when I relay it, the model is undoubtedly a “collector’s watch.” It’s no surprise, then, that it’s a watch he’d like to have more than a single date with. “It’s pretty crazy that I’m going with Cartier because I was like, ‘Oh my god. This is my chance [to put my name at the top of the list for this watch].” On Monday night, with the watch finally on wrist, Golding doesn’t appear anxious at all. With his sweep of hair, natural good looks, which practically destined him for movie stardom, and a voice that could help a pack of hyenas meditate, it’s hard to believe even the Met could be stressful for Golding. During our interview, he tells me that even his red-carpet watch pose—a move that can turn even the most seasoned actor into a painfully awkward mannequin—is just the natural way he stands. On the carpet, Golding puts his hand gently in front of his stomach, and there it is: his holy-grail yellow-gold Cartier Tank à Guichet.",

    "title": "André 3000 Is Making Clothes Again",
    "article_text": "It’s been a whilesinceAndré 3000played the role of tailor as the proprietor of aughts menswear label Benjamin Bixby, which crossed the OutKast MC’s obsession with Ralph Lauren andThe Official Preppy Handbookwith his own righteously funky sensibility. This past Friday, it appeared he hadn’t lost a step. In a New York fitting studio, André was pinching centimeters of fabric here and there on the back of a customer’s tuxedo jacket. When he stepped back to appraise his work, it was with a precise and focused gaze, his hands clasped and his lips pursed, like if Reynolds Woodcock hailed from Stankonia. “Man, the shoulders look awesome,” André said. GQ global editorial director Will Welch at the 2025 Met Gala wearing Benji Bixby Yes: André 3000 is back in the atelier, in a sense, of his trailblazing, long-dormant menswear brand. This time around, it’s called Benji Bixby. And the soft launch is taking place at the2025 Met Gala, where André is dressing none other than GQ global editorial director Will Welch in a custom Benji Bixby hickory stripe denim tuxedo. On Friday, Welch and 3 Stacks met at theGQoffices for the final fitting before the big night. “How’s itfeel?” André asked as Welch emerged from the dressing room. “Incredible,” Welch confirmed. André 3000 adjusting Will Welch's bowtie moments before heading to the Met Gala Law Roach and Welch; the back of his tuxedo jacket is embroidered with the logo of André 3000's workwear label “From Now On, They Will Have No Choice But To Call Us Ants” “Obviously the Met Gala this year is a celebration ofBlack dandyism, and luckily I happen to know probably the flyest dandy of the last three decades,” said Welch. “André is a personal hero of mine, and also happens to be a talented fashion designer, even though I thought he’d set all that aside. So anyway I just called him and asked him if he would revive Bixby for one night only and dress me for the gala. At the time, I had no idea that he was already in the process of making clothes again.” Welch also wore Chrome Hearts jewelry… …as well as an FP Journe Chronometre Bleu watch and Welch’s own bespoke Charvet tux shirt André designed the cummerbund to resemble a formal Indian sash (“I had just bought some vintage madras Bixby shorts on eBay a couple months ago,” Welch added.) The final fitting in New York three days before the Met Gala With pagoda-like shoulders, intricately patterned pleated trousers, and a sturdy Japanese workwear fabric, this first look hints at the different direction André might take Bixby this time around. “I call ’em devil shoulders,” he said of the exaggerated silhouette, which like all of his designs began sketched by hand. Like any good tuxedo, this one comes with a cummerbund, which André designed to look more like a formal Indian sash than an English pleated design. André 3000 and Will Welch at an initial fitting (using temporary fabrics) in Amsterdam “With the relaunch of Bixby, I wanted to try out more ideas,” André explained on a phone call earlier in the week, his drawl as smooth as when the world met him and Big Boi onSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik. “I've been drawing and painting since I was a kid, so I draw out ideas all the time. And to be able to actually make them and to share them and see people wearing them, that's the joy in it. That's it. And so that's why I'm back at it again, you know. I have new things to say.” André's designs start in his sketchbook One of those new things is a workwear component to Benji Bixby, a sub-brand of sorts that André dubbed “From Now On, They Will Have No Choice But To Call Us Ants.” Technically speaking, André explained, Welch’s tuxedo hails from Ants by Benji Bixby, and the back is embroidered with the label’s rune-like logo. As for the name? “I spend all day watching YouTubes of ants working,” André said. “And who are better workers than ants? And so that's the workwear initiative, honoring ants and thinking about how humans can learn a lot from ants. They've been a big inspiration for me.” André 3000’spost-OutKast creative journeyhas yielded many moments of unexpected brilliance. His workwear impresario era is in step with his recent exploration of the heady world of woodwind instruments, which culminated in the 2023 release of Grammy-nominated New Age flute albumNew Blue Sun. During that project, he took to auniformof understated overalls, which he’s now tinkering with under the Ants label. “There's still people like myself that stretch out on the floor and are doing drawings, and they need clothes,” he said, adding that his mood board is covered in images of midcentury abstract expressionist painter Helen Frankenthather sitting on the ground in her studio. (Another only-by-André surprise? Thepiano EP he dropped out of the blueon his way to the red carpet Monday night.) André last wore a bowtie in 2011, but at the fitting he appeared to be reacquainting himself with his sartorial roots, having shed the overalls for his own Ants by Benji Bixby suit, which fit impeccably over his vintage football jersey, the cropped trousers skimming the tops of his Nike Air Trainer 1s. Like the tuxedo, André’s crisp navy jacket had gussets on the back, a detail borrowed from hunting jackets. “It’s almost like when you’re making music, you’re in a certain zone or a certain vibe, and you kind of follow that vibe,” he said. Looking at André’s ensemble, I was reminded of OG Benjamin Bixby, but with age his bawdy, clubby menswear vision has taken on a new worldliness—deepened by travel, a recommitment to art and painting, and the wisdom of having been here before, back when it was near scandalous for a rapper to declare themselves a fashion designer. When I complimented him on his suit, he smiled. “Kap kun kap,” he replied. André articulating his idea for the final tux’s “devil’s shoulders The original idea for Welch’s tuxedo was for André to refurbish a madras dinner jacket he made when the brand debuted in 2008. He fished a few of them out of storage boxes in his basement in Atlanta, but, alas, they had been down there too long. “They smelled like mildew,” André rued. “Once we decided André was going to make a look from scratch, I just said I want to wear your vision—whatever it is,” Welch said. “I was like, I’m happy to give my opinion if you ask for it, but at the end of the day, I’ll do whatever you want.” Back in those early days, André was already as prominent amodern dandyas there was, “known for his leadership of the African American Gentleman’s Movement,” according to Barnard professor Monica L. Miller, whose scholarship guided this year’s Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Instituteexhibition“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” At a time when Americana was associated with WASPy lawyers and hipsters, the OutKast superstar freaked the preppy canon, performing in varsity sweaters and ’80s aerobic instructor-hairdos, and mixing boater hats and striped rugby shirts with bug-eye sunglasses. Benjamin Bixby brought André’s rule-breaking style to Barneys. With OutKast on the backburner, André poured himself into the brand, channeling 1930s Ivy League uniforms and his own upbringing as a Polo-obsessed Atlanta schoolboy into colorful cricket sweaters, wide raw denim, and bold madras shirting. To this day, André recalls those days as “some of the best times of my life.” At the final fitting, the tuxedo is nearly done André was on the vanguard of famous rappers diving head-first into fashion, and there was little precedent for the level of creative expertise he craved. So he figured out how to do it himself. “I totally knew nothing about the fashion business,” he said. “Especially from my side of the world as far as entertainers and music, we were all new to it.” Once in the late 2000s, Pharrell and Kanye were touring in Hong Kong when André happened to be in town visiting knitwear factories. “I went to the concert to go meet 'em backstage,” he recalls. “They were like,Dude, what are you doing out here in Hong Kong?I'm like,Man, I'm out here trying to make clothes. I'm out here trying to make things work.” Instead of going to Paris Fashion Week, he was dropping in on the city’s fabric trade shows. He particularly loved making suits, recalling fondly his experiences flying to Italy to meet with the old-world tailoring ateliers that made Bixby’s blazers. “I’m getting in the car and driving an hour and a half outside of Florence, and going to these little artisan shops run by families that have been doing it for generations!” he recalled. I look at the left and I'm seeing Tom Ford jackets, and I look to the right and I'm seeing Ralph Lauren jackets. I'm like,Oh, so this is where it really goes down.” André and Welch consulted on every detail, down to the Chrome Hearts wallet chain Despite critical acclaim (in 2009,GQnamed André a “best new menswear designer in America”) the first iteration of Bixby was self-funded, ahead of its time, and ultimately short lived. The world wasn’t ready for a preppy revolution during a global financial meltdown, even one led by everyone’s favorite rapper. “And now we have the worst time in history to launch anythingagain!” André said with a chuckle. I asked him what lesson he learned from the first go-round. “Focus,” he replied. “This time it’ll be way more focused, more streamlined.” Though there’s no timeline for the official launch, André is once again putting in the miles to make it work, traveling frequently to Amsterdam, where he’s building the line with a couple former G-Star designers. “I like spending a lot of time there, because something about being away from home or being in a distant place, your brain is freer for some reason,” he said. André will be attending the Met Gala for the first time since 2008, when he wore a white dinner jacket, black trousers, and a boater hat propped casually on his head. That wasall Bixby, too. Given that dressing Welch this year represents a major full-circle moment, no detail at the fitting escaped his eye. “I'm thinking something flashy, like a burnt orange, or the red?” he mused in front of a buffet of formal socks. As he directed a tailor through a few more minute fiddles, the look came together: sleek John Lobb loafers, round Moscot frames, an FP Journe Chronometre Bleu watch—plus Welch’s own bespoke Charvet tux shirt and Chrome Hearts wallet chain. Finally, after a brief confab about haircuts, Welch stood in front of the mirror so the designer could give the next chapter of Benji Bixby a once-over. “Ain't going to even lie, man,” André said. “It looks great.”",

    "title": "Exclusive: André 3000 Wore a Grand Piano to the Met Gala—and Dropped a Surprise EP",
    "article_text": "The last timeAndré 3000attended the Met Gala, he entered through the kitchen. “I rarely do red carpets,” said André, recalling how he skirted the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s famous Fifth Avenue steps in 2008. “And so we devised a plan for me to go through the bottom of the building. And so I'm going through the kitchen, I'm hollering at cooks, we’re chopping it up. I was so happy to be walking through this dirty kitchen with my tuxedo on. It was kind of like a spy stealth mission to actually get to the Met.” This year, 3 Stacks went the opposite of incognito. André 3000 wearing the piano(!) at the Met Gala In a2025 Met Galamoment that could only be orchestrated by the OutKast alum, woodwind master, fashion impresario, andATLien himself, André pulled up to the carpet with an enormous grand piano strapped to his back. And in an even more unexpected flourish, while he was on his way to the museum, he dropped a surprise new EP. The record,7 piano sketches, is the first new André 3000 project sinceNew Blue Sun, the vibey flute-based New Age album that arrived out of left field in 2023 following a period of experimentation with woodwind instruments. LikeNew Blue Sun,7 piano sketchesdoesn’t include any rapping. As the title suggests, it consists of seven raw, improvisational solo-piano pieces, plus oddball voice-note introductions at the top of each number by André, a studio engineer, and the choreographer Fatima Robinson. (The press release announcing the EP came with a “warning: no bars.”) André 3000, image architect Law Roach, and Burberry chief creative officer Daniel Lee at André's final fitting Though this release is as unexpected asNew Blue Sun, the sketches have actually been on André’s hard drive for a long time. As André told me in a recent interview, he recorded most of the tracks on his iPhone between 12 and 15 years ago. Two of the songs—the doleful \"blueberry mansions,” and “i spend all day waiting for the night,” the only track on the album with a backing beat—were first written in 2000 and recorded years later, sonic artifacts from when he and Big Boi were at the height of their powers and preparing to releaseStankonia. The piano arrived in a piano-sized box “I had a piano in my house, and sometimes I would record ideas, or record myself improvising and making up stuff from scratch,” he said. “A lot of these little moments or songs, they were just fun pieces that I would email to my son, or I would email them to Erykah [Badu], or to my stepdad or other musicians like Q-Tip or Tyler the Creator. If they look in the history of their phones, they’ll find some of these pieces.” André recently did just that, rediscovering his own archive of piano compositions. At a time when he’s alsodusting off his long-dormant menswear brand Benji Bixby, he’s evidently looking at a lot of his past work in a new light. “When I listened back to 'em, I was like, this is pretty interesting. So I wanted to make a collective out of them. I think it’s a cool piece of music that people might want to have in their arsenal.” André added that he’s planning to release7 piano sketcheson vinyl as well. “A lot of times I try to think outside of myself. Like, if I was someone else, would I want to buy this and put it in my record collection? And I totally would!” André inspects the grand piano, which was fabricated to be light enough to wear The rather, ahem, grand Met Gala stunt came together in collaboration withLaw Roachand Burberry chief creative officerDaniel Lee, who dressed André for his return to fashion’s biggest night on the occasion of the Costume Instituteexhibition“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style”—a formidable responsibility, seeing as André 3000 is responsible for two of thegreatest and dandy-estMet Gala looks of all time. “When Burberry asked me to collaborate with them on the Met and help curate the table, the first person I thought about was André,” said Roach. “And they kind of went crazy, because Daniel is a huge fan.” “André is someone whose music I grew up with, and whose style has always been super inspirational,” Lee confirmed at André’s final fitting on Saturday evening. So Roach introduced the Atlanta MC to the fashion designer from Yorkshire, which led to an initial meeting in Paris. As an icebreaker, André—who has been sketching new Benji Bixby designs lately, includingGQglobal editorial director Will Welch’s Met tuxedo—presented sketches for his own look. Said Roach: “Everybody wanted it to be a true collaboration between the Bs: Burberry and Benji Bixby.” The final options André's sketch of the embroidery on his Burberry jumpsuit Eventually, the two designers landed on a Burberry x Benji Bixby jumpsuit made of a formal midnight navy cotton gabardine. It’s a true collaboration: the silhouette calls back to the rapper’s radical style legacy, namely theiconic graphic jumpsuitshe wore on OutKast’s 2014 reunion tour, while the fabric and embroidered umbrellas—also from André’s sketches—reference Burberry’s lengthy heritage. “Where I connect with Burberry is the trench coat,” André said. “And even further back—making clothes for explorers. That's what's really inspiring to me about the Burberry story.” According to Lee, André’s extensive design experience was apparent. “I don't think I've ever worked with anyone who paid so much attention to the details and had thought things through so thoroughly,” Lee said. “André arrived with these incredible iPad drawings that were super inspiring. He knows and talks about clothes in such a technical and expert way that I've never experienced from another musician before.” (“I think everyone's jealous we’re the ones dressing André for the Met,” Lee added. “That's certainly what I've been hearing since I arrived in town.” “Really?” André replied. “I hadn't heard that!”) It might not surprise you that the piano prop was André 3000’s idea. “When I heard about the piano, I was like,Only him. He's the only one,” said Roach. André first had the idea of wearing a large piano on his back when he was laying down his piano tracks over a decade ago. He thought it might make a good music video at some point: André 3000 walking around the streets of New York, piano in tow. For his first Met Gala in 17 years, and with the piano project on the horizon, he figured, why not wear it to the Met instead? “It's saying a lot for this little bitty piano album, which is kind of hilarious to me,” André said. Ironically, when the rapper stealthed his way through the kitchen back in 2008, he wore a white Bixby dinner jacket, black trousers, and jaunty boater hat—every bit the Black dandy that the 2025 Met Gala celebrates. Jumpsuits, on the other hand, might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking ofthis year’s theme. When asked at the Saturday fitting about how dandyism influenced his and Lee’s creative dialogue, André replied, “It wasn’t like we said, Okay, we got to check these boxes to find this dandy thing to do. My understanding of dandyism is your own personal outburst in fashion, or your own exclamation point on fashion. You don’t really have to try for it if it’s something that you are doing.” With a piano, and a surprise piano EP, André 3000 certainly put his exclamation point on this year’s Met Gala red carpet.",

    "title": "Yup, Myha’la Just Wore Thigh-High Timberlands on the Met Gala 2025 Red Carpet",
    "article_text": "While he’s often skeptical of the intense, ephemeral gratification of social media, Raul Lopez has an innate sense of how to make his followers lose their minds. In 2017, theLuardesigner posted a picture of himself wearing a pretty standard bodega fit—sweatsuit,puffer coat,Yankee fitted, sling bag,sunglasses—withone eye-raising swerve: a pair of brown lace-front boots that extended well above his knees. The frankly medieval footwear, plus the undeniable aura on display, made the post go viral. One particularly memorable reply deemed Lopez “the final boss” of NY. The boots in that photo were notTimberlands, but rather a runway sample that never made it to market from Hood by Air, the now-defunct cult label that Lopez co-founded with Shayne Oliver in 2006. And yet, a clear reason the outfit works is because they look a bit like the classic Timberland boots rendered through a funhouse mirror. Lopez was lovingly riffing on the New York archetype he identifies as the “sweatsuit dandy.” The kind of guy who takes painstaking effort to make sure he doesn’t scuff his boots, even though they were designed to be used on a chaotic job site. “It’s the equivalent of someone wearing a Saville Row suit with a Church's shoe,” he said. “It’s kind of a flex to have a fresh pair of wheat nubuck Timbs,” he said. Myha'la and Raul Lopez Unsurprisingly, then, when Lopez got the opportunity to work with Timberland to produce a boot forIndustrystar Myha’la to wear atthis year’s Met Gala, themed around the concept ofthe Black dandy, there was little question he would leap at the chance. “I was so geeked,” he said, excited for the challenge to bring the iconic street boot tofashion’s biggest red carpet event. Lopez’s sketch for his own Met Gala look. The design process began in the Timberland archives in Stratham, New Hampshire. “We went up there and looked at all the shoe lasts and shoes they’ve produced before in wheat colors.” Lopez also took inspiration from stories about and paintings of the free Black residents of Tudor England. “I feel like they haven’t really ever gotten their flowers,” he said. Tired: referencing the 1960s. Wired: referencing the1560s. The final boots, which Myha’la and Lopez just debuted at the Met Gala tonight, are a stunning thigh-high iteration of the Timb, made by hand in Italy from wheat and chocolate moiré (a trippily patterned silk). Paired with a mini dress on Myha’la and a long-line suit from Lopez, the boots complete looks that offer an updated take on both that classic Black sweatsuit dandy, but also the stylish women that Lopez grew up around in Williamsburg who would wear their Timbs to the club with short, sexy dresses. These two outfits, Lopez explained, were his attempt to pay his respects to the legacy and history of the shoe. “It’s a construction shoe that was taken by hip-hop culture and converted into a staple for us to feel fad and look good,” he said. The new thigh-high boots, he hopes, will offer an elevated look that people might someday adopt as icons in their own right. In the meantime, they’re sure to generateplentyof attention on social media once more.",

    "title": "Hanging With Future, Jeremy Allen White, and More in Louis Vuitton’s Met Gala 2025 Suite",
    "article_text": "A few hours before theMet Gala 2025, Louis Vuitton’s suite atthe Mark Hotelis in a state that can only be described as highly controlled chaos.Pharrell Williams, the house’s men’s creative director since 2023, is co-chairing this year’s event, celebrating the Met Costume Institute’s Spring 2025 exhibition, entitled“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.”It’s the first Gala centering Black style and designers, and the first in 20 years that’s focused on menswear, making Williams—whose contributions across music, fashion, and popular culture span over three decades—the ideal man for the job. The designs of his Louis Vuitton predecessor,Virgil Abloh, play a large part in the museum showcase, celebrating his profound cultural influence and his work as the first Black American to helm a French luxury house. Pharrell dressed over a dozen people for tonight’sMet Gala red carpet, many of whom passed through the suite—decked out with trunks, books, artwork, collectibles, and ephemera covered in the signature LV monogram—to get their photos taken in a fully functional content studio built out for the evening. To a soundtrack of Skepta, Jay-Z, Amy Winehouse, and Lauryn Hill, a mix of his longtime friends and collaborators (Pusha T,Future,Henry Taylor) and icons of the new generation (Sabrina Carpenter, Lisa, Doechii) filed in and out ahead of their red carpet departures. In one sweet moment—especially to me, a Virginia Beach native—Pharrell came to check out Pusha’s full ‘fit and give him a round of applause, before getting out of his jeans and pink polo to put on his own look, comprised of a cropped jacket hand-crafted entirely from white pearls. Lisa and Future Malcolm Washington,a Met newbie, was honored to wear a classic Pharrell Williams silhouette for his first time: a double-breasted smoking jacket and flared trousers. “This is such a cool Met to come to, the reason we’re here is so exciting and it’s been personal in my life in a way, so it’s cool to come celebrate Black dandyism.” The director is a longtime fan of fashion, and loves self-expression through all artistic practices. (Washington comes from an art-forward family: His dad, of course, is Denzel.) “My grandfather was the principal of a Black high school. When schools were integrated in the ’60s, he lost his position, but still within it he found so much dignity in how he dressed,” he says. “I always thought that was such a beautiful way to express [that] in how you carry yourself, and to now be here, and get to wear a classic tuxedo by a Black man at an event such as this celebrating that, felt like a wonderful full-circle moment.” Malcolm Washington Malcolm Washington Jeremy Allen White’s another of the LV crew’s Met rookies. “I feel nervous, excited, but good. I feel like I look nice,” he says with a smile. As for his ensemble? “For a couple of months we’ve been piecing it together,” he says, looking over at his stylist Jamie Mizrahi. “We had a lot of reference photos, the pinstripes were something that we found pretty early on in the fabrics, and the suit just got snugger and snugger and sharper and sharper as we went. We wanted to do something kind of period, but also timeless, and just make sure that the tailoring itself was very elegant and angular.” Despite having many friends who have attended the Met, White’s going in cold. “I don’t know what happens in that room, nobody does, I guess, if you haven’t been before, but I am excited to see,” he says. He’s heard about the famous smoking section, where all of the fun allegedly happens. “Well, that’s where I’ll be most of the night,” he deadpans. “I think I might be there the whole time, just kinda hiding.” Jeremy Allen White “I’m really excited, it sounds like it’s going to be beautiful carnage,” saysCallum Turner, who’s also a Met first-timer. He’s heard the rumor about the smoking section, too. “Zoe Kravitz told me yesterday that you’re not allowed to smoke in the bathroom anymore,” he says. He is dressed in a cropped double-breasted blazer that he and Pharrell worked on for a few weeks; when the two crossed paths in the suite, they chatted about a last-minute change that went into Turner’s suit, and both appeared to be pleased with the final result. He’s also wearing a crystal, hand-embroidered tie in the pattern of the Louis Vuitton Damier checks; sparkles are admittedly outside of his comfort zone, but he’s pulling them off. Callum Turner and Pharrell Callum Turner By 5:20 p.m., most of the Louis Vuitton crew was on their way to the carpet, and for the first time, there’s some breathing room to be found at the Mark. There were a few stragglers: Blackpink’s Lisa, a LV brand ambassador, came in after the rush to get her photos taken. Doechii, perhaps the event’s most highly anticipated rookie, was dressed in a tailcoat and waistcoat featuring pearl-encrusted buttons inspired by the wardrobe of the Afro-Caribbean fencing master Julius Soubise, and left the hotel in a box that the Louis Vuitton team had custom made to preserve the surprise. Jeremy Allen White snuck in one last smoke on the auxiliary suite’s balcony in the rain before departing the Mark, taking special care to not mess up his hair. On the way out the door, he double checked (and confirmed to the team) that he had all he needed for the night ahead: phone, cigarettes, lighter.",

    "article_text": "The Met Gala is thebiggest and best-dressed red carpet of the entire year. And among the flawlessly tailored looks from designers like Ozwald Boateng, Fear of God, and Louis Vuitton are the essential accessories: the watches. The timepieces have been just as impressive as the looks.

    "title": "“There’s a Lot of Tension”: Democrats Are Locked In a Generational Fight",
    "article_text": "The impending Democratic opening at the top of the House Oversight Committee has reopened rifts between the party establishment and its younger insurgent wing. Back in December, then 74-year-oldGerry Connolly—who was being treated for esophageal cancer—was elected ranking member of the powerful watchdog panel overAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez,the 35-year-old progressive who has emerged as one of the party’s most dynamic stars. The snub seemed, at the time, a reflection of adeeper issuefor Democrats: that the party’s aging old guard was too reluctant to abandon its power, and valued seniority and longevity over the kind of change that Democrats’ 2024 losses seemed to call for. Five months later, withDonald Trumprunning roughshod over democracy, Connollywill be stepping down from his leadership roledue to a reemergence of his cancer. But AOC, who had been said to be considering another run for the Oversight post, ultimately decided against throwing her hat into the ring: “It’s actually clear to me,” shetold reportersMonday, “that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary.” Ocasio-Cortez’s decision leaves an open lane for other younger Democrats to make a run at the position, includingJasmine Crockett,Maxwell Frost,andRobert Garcia.But it could also make the path for 70-year-old Massachusetts representativeStephen Lynch—who has been endorsed by Connolly and some other more establishment figures—all the clearer. To be sure, the divide isn’t just about age, as Pennsylvania progressiveSummer Lee—one of the younger members of the Oversight Committee—told me. “I know some old folks who got fire still, and maybe are more ideologically connected to me,” the 37-year-old said. But, Lee suggested, some of the younger Democrats are better able to rise up to these “unprecedented times” because they are able to see them more clearly, without the fog of nostalgia. “There are, quite frankly, people who were here at a time when bipartisanship existed. I’ve never seen it. There are people who were here before the Tea Party and before Trump as a politician existed, and they have a nostalgia for the institution as it existed then,” Lee said. But “we are in times that take different tactics.” The fight over Oversight is, of course, a proxy fight for a bigger battle among Democrats. Many of its leaders have faced criticism—within the conference and among the base—for taking a perhapstoo careful,sometimes anemic,occasionally helplessapproach to Trump’s all-out assault on America’s democratic system. Some have downplayed interparty divides: RepresentativeWesley Bell,a 50-year-old Oversight member, told me that any differences among Democrats are “boutique” issues compared with the unified front they are presenting against the Trump administration. “I think there’s a great dynamic of young people with energy and bringing a different perspective, but then also folks who are veterans, who have the experience and wisdom,” Bell said. “I think Democrats are doing everything that we possibly can to push back.” But the base—already frustrated with a party that, in sticking with a senescentJoe Bidenlast year until it was too late, has lost two out of the last three elections to Trump—has shown an appetite for a more aggressive approach to fighting the current administration: “We don’t need [an Oversight leader]…who’s going to be sending, like, strongly worded letters,” saidSantiago Mayer,founder of Voters of Tomorrow, the Democratic-aligned Gen Z political group. “I think we’re now in a moment where we need that energy and we need that fight.” There have been some signs of a changing of the Democratic guard; just in the past two weeks, two prominent lawmakers—SenatorDick Durbin, the minority whip, and fellow IllinoisanJan Schakowsky,who has served in the House since 1999—announced that they would not seek reelection, with both 80-year-olds citing a desire to pass the torch. Meanwhile, a growing number of long-serving members are expected toface primary fightsfrom younger challengers—a movement that has the backing ofDavid Hogg,a 25-year-old vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. (Hogg’s active support of primary challenges to incumbent Democrats has been controversial, drawing a rebuke from DNC ChairKen Martin:“No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,” hesaidlast month.) At the very least, Lee suggested to me, there is a “more robust conversation” underway about the party’s leadership and approach. The question is what that conversation will mean for Oversight, where the next leader will be tasked with bringing together what Lee called a “constellation” of stars working to provide some check on Trump: “There’s a lot of tension between what direction we’re going in” as a party, Lee told me. “The Oversight Committee obviously epitomizes that.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Emma Chamberlain Wore Two Courrèges Looks for One Very Long Day at the Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "Emma Chamberlainis certainly no stranger to theMet Gala: When she hit theMet Gala red carpeton Monday, it was her fifth consecutive year both attending and acting as a host forVogue’s livestream. It means she knows the ins and outs of fashion’s biggest night, and talks to pretty much every A-lister who makes the event’s ultra-exclusive invite list. Met Monday begins at 6:30 a.m. and ends well past midnight for Chamberlain, and that’s after weeks of beauty prep and two days of intensive final interview research once the official guest list is shared with her. Chamberlain’s Met Gala 2025 look needed to both fit the high-fashion billandbe practical enough to work in. “It’s definitely my longest day of the whole year, that’s for sure,” she toldVanity Fairfrom her hotel room ahead of her whirlwind Met Gala. This year, she reached for two bespoke ensembles by French brand Courrèges, the house’s first time dressing a Met attendee under artistic directorNicolas Di Felice.The looks are related, and both referenced the night’s Tailored for You dress code celebrating the exhibit “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” For her red-carpet moment early in the night, Chamberlain opted for a hand-embroidered navy pinstripe crepe dress, with a suiting-inspired deconstructed silhouette, open back, and matching tulle tights and gloves, with hand-stitched pinstripe detailing. Then, working with stylistJared Ellnerand Courrèges, she changed into a look that was designed to appear as if she could have been wearing it under her longer red-carpet look, a navy crepe miniskirt, also hand-embroidered, and an asymmetrical white cady shirt, paired with low heels, a must for the long hours Chamberlain spends standing through the night. Chamberlain explained that what started as a “why choose” moment a few years ago—she had the choice of the same Miu Miu look in blue and black and decided to wear both—has since turned into a (very practical) tradition that she cherishes. “There’s no risk of fashion disaster, like a boob coming out or something,” she said of her second look. “Whereas, on the carpet, there is usually a risk of that. These looks are so finicky, so the carpet look is definitely not something I could wear all night. There’s a long train, there’s this and there’s that. Changing into another look has ended up being really special, so that, you know, Jared and I, and whoever we’re working with, can actually have a full moment on the carpet and not cut it short because I’m going and doing the interviews. This is, like, our sport, you know? Like, we love this shit, right? We want to do it to the fullest.” Translating the carpet look to the interview ’fit is, she said, “mainly just about [finding] something that I can move in that’s reminiscent of the carpet look, worn with some sort of comfortable shoe.” Collaborating with Courrèges, she said, was a dream come true after she and Ellner attended the brand’s show for the first time in Paris last year. She called it “our absolute favorite of the season, the one that we were just raving about for, like, weeks and weeks after.” Di Felice, in an email, mirrored the sentiment. “For our very first appearance at the Met Gala, I really enjoyed collaborating with Emma on these looks,” he said. “We have a lot of common values: She is forward-thinking, free-spirited, with a strong fashion sense.” “We were floored, like, it wassomy style on a personal level,” Chamberlain continued. “A lot of times, we go to shows and it might not necessarily be our personal style, but we’re watching art happen, that sort of thing. But this was, like, so me.” Vintage jewelry, watches, and eyeglasses sourced from eBay completed the suite of looks, which she said “could not be more tailored for me.” As a bonus, those vintage bits and bobs are hers now. “The fact that I get to keep it, like, that’s never happened. I’m always giving everything back, which is like, fine, but it’s, like, a million-dollar necklace? That’s not mine. I’m giving that back.” Returning borrowed jewels, she said, is “such a relief. I get so stressed out. There’s security, it’s a crazy thing. So this is a chill year with accessories in a way that’s very fun.” Asked if she has a sartorial security blanket for red carpets, like a certain lipstick, or a color she finds herself gravitating to over and over, Chamberlain paused for a moment to think. “I have no security blankets when it comes to fashion,” she answered. “To be honest, I think my security blanket is my brain, it’s who I am. It’s my soul and my spirit that’s always with me, and my taste and my fashion philosophies, thoughts that are constantly changing.” She said that she tries not to go obsessively deep into the people she’ll be interviewing, because she wants to maintain a level of curiosity that keeps things fresh and exciting for the viewers. Fashion-wise, “Clothes in general are a security blanket for me, and the choices that I make specifically for that event are, you know, what sort of makes me feel safe and like me?” Another Met Gala essential: “My boring-ass cream Stanley cup.” (Chamberlain admits she is aggressively anti-rhinestone and won’t zhuzh her water bottle.) “I’m usually so dehydrated during the Met, because I don’t drink water when I travel,” she explained. “But this year, no excuses. I got the Stanley cup.” She called her Met Gala experiences “chaotic,” this year’s beginning a few weeks ago with a facial that “popped all my zits” after an unexpected breakout, and in more recent days fresh color and a trim for her platinum pixie cut, a self-administered gel manicure (“They’re actually in really good shape, and they match the outfit. And I’m wearing gloves. So I was like, ‘perfect,’” she said), more facials, and a day-of lymphatic massage. This, amidst the flash cards and research, Chamberlain at the center of a swirl of people. “It’s amazing how many people are involved in this process,” she said. “It’s always very humbling for me, it’s a bit challenging for me at times, because I feel almost a level of guilt—there are so many people who are putting so much love and time and effort into this look. I’m a canvas for so many different people. It’s not just about me.” “It’s, like, insane. There’s so many people loving on me, and every year, it feels like my birthday. It feels more like my birthday than my birthday does.” Of course, due to her red-carpet duties, Chamberlain has a different experience of the evening than all the other attendees who also get the glam treatment, though “it’s all I’ve ever known this event to be.” “I actually can’t even imagine what it’d be like to go to The Met and not get yanked back and change, and to have it be this sort of hectic thing. And to be honest, I bet that would be delightful,” she said, laughing. “Usually I get in so late and I’m exhausted by that point and hungry. So I’m like, This is awesome! But I’m also eating. Everyone’s dancing, and I’m eating because I literally just had the longest day.” “My experience is very different than everyone else’s, yeah, but I also think that my experience is so rich,” she said. “It’s very hectic, it’s very chaotic, but also, that’s what I love about it. And it’s all I know.” Accessories: Vintage sourced from eBayLymphatic: Josie RushingBeauty Sandwich: Ivan PolHair: Sami KnightMakeup: Lilly KeysStylist: Jared EllnerFacialist: Shani DardenHaircut:FrankColor: Anthony Vincent For more from the Met Gala 2025, revisitVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblogfor the evening’s highlights includingevery look, thebest-dressed of the night, our experts’ picks for whobest embodied the theme, avideo replay of the red carpet, and more.

    "title": "Shaboozey Dares Anyone to Outdo His Custom Turquoise Grill at the Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "If the last year has been crazy forShaboozey,the Virginia singer known for his hip-hop-inflected country music, who shot to fame in 2024 with his indelible single “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” the last few months have been a whirlwind. In the run-up tothe Met Gala 2025, the artist, born Collins Obinna Chibueze, has been serving up maximalist spins on Westernwear at events including two weekends at Coachella, music festivals and awards shows, and a day at the Kentucky Derby. How can you top all of that for fashion’s biggest night? Two words: turquoise grill. Vanity Faircaught up with the singer as he prepped forthe Met Galawith his stylist,Anastasia Walker.“Me and my team did a great job of just finding something that was bold and daring, but still kind of really just played up to all my features,” he said of the look. “It still has a bit of the stuff that I love and I put into my everyday personal style—and a lot of turquoise.” On Monday night, Shaboozey’s unique mouthpiece was just the cherry on top. He walked the carpet in a customRobert Wunblack moiré suit, which featured chains with 3,100 turquoise beads and 2,900 Swarovski crystal beads in jet black. He topped it off with a few spectacular pieces from David Yurman, including a yellow gold Albion ring with turquoise and diamonds, a gold and diamond signet ring, and silver huggie hoop earrings in pavé diamond. “I just love how it all works together. When I saw the sketches I was like, ‘Man, I haven’t done anything like this before.’ But it came together,” he said of the suit, which blends cowboy touches with a dandy-inspired form. “It’s really quality. It doesn’t feel like it’s just something that’s meant to be worn tonight—it’s got durability. You can tell that a lot of craftsmanship went into making the piece.” Shaboozey has long hada strong sense of his personal styleand a love for vintage, but he said his collaboration with Walker has helped him up the ante now that he’s performing on some of the world’s biggest stages. “We always land on something that’s really just always elevating it. Every look is always just an elevation of the previous thing,” he said. “I was always a vintage guy, and it’s been cool to just be able to put some of my favorite brands into that—just mixing it all together. To create something that I feel like is exactly where I want to be.” As for the stress of making his Met Gala debut, Shaboozey said he would be keeping an eye out for the fellow guests he already considers friends and relying on the systems that have helped him manage a year packed with new experiences. “I think I have a very calm demeanor through it all,” he said. “Never really let anything get to be too much. Just don’t let things get too high, don’t let them get too low. There’s always a next day coming.” As for his fellow guests, he was looking forward to seeing whatColman Domingowas planning to wear and was hoping his look would be just as memorable. “Fashion is definitely a form of art. I’m just really excited to see how people react to what we’re wearing,” he said. “Honestly, I’m really confident in our look. I want to see if anyone out there can outdo it.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Ayo Edebiri, Aimee Lou Wood, Dapper Dan, and More Prep for Fashion’s Biggest Night at Cartier’s Annual Met Gala Pre-Party",
    "article_text": "At Cartier’s intimate but glittering—with star power and fine jewelry—annualMet Galapre-party on Monday, everyone had a riveting story to tell. The mood in Bemelmans Bar felt especially energized and festive, as A-list guests readied to celebrate theCostume Institute’s exhibit“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” while weaving their own narratives of history, family, and personal style through theTailored for You dress code. Ayo Edebiriconsidered the history of dandyism and what it meant to her. “There were just so many different ins: I’m half Nigerian, I grew up in the church, I’m a Black person. I was thinking about [how] the women’s and queer [experience] blends in,” the Met Gala host committee member toldVanity Fair.“So it was all kind of swirling around.” Edebiri’s black leather trench with ribbons flowing down from the pointed cuffs, and white gown with majestically draped coral embellishments by Ferragamo creative directorMaximilian Davisalso paid homage to her Nigerian father’s Edo and Yoruba roots. Edebiri worked with her stylist,Danielle Goldberg,to accessorize with meaningful jewels, like a Clash de Cartier 18k rose gold ring with a cluster of apple green chrysoprase, and an adorable 1966 Cartier Collection yellow gold doggy brooch adorned with rubies. “I love this little dog brooch, partially because I’m missing my dog because he’s back home,” said Edebiri, lifting a sheer-gloved hand to playfully move the head back and forth. “It’s like the cutest thing ever.” The Emmy winner wasn’t the only one whose luxury jewelry choice reminded her of home.Miley Cyrusadorned a custom cropped, croc-embossed leather top and ball gown skirt by Alaïa byPieter Mulierwith a triple-layer, yellow and white gold Cartier Collection necklace from 1988. Miley Cyrus “It’s from the 1980s, so it reminds me a lot of my mom,” said Cyrus of her mother,Tish.“That was her prime, and she will tell you she hasn’t come out of the ’80s yet. I don’t have the heart to tell her that it’s 2025.” TheSomething Beautifulsingeralso considers the Alaïa team to be “like family,” and the fashion house holds sentimental meaning not just for designer Azzedine Alaïa’s collaborations with legend Tina Turner, but for Cyrus herself. “I remember my first big purchase was a perforated Alaïa belt,” said Cyrus. “So now to be able to represent them at The Met, it just feels like it’s a very full circle.” Kelvin Harrison Jr.,who played B.B. King inElvisand the titular 18th-century trailblazing composer and violinist inChevalier,also looked to musical greats to express Black dandyism through his Prada double-breasted suit. “I always wanted to be like a Quincy Jones meets Nat King Cole and that timeless kind of sassy, flamboyant masculinity,” said Harrison, who was styled byMichael Fisher,also pointing toward his tulip-print shirt, which threaded back to his attendance at the 2022 Met Gala with directorBaz Luhrmannand theElviscast. “Austin Butlerhad a really pretty little scarf,” said Harrison of Butler's 2022 look. He similarly undid his shirt’s necktie to showcase four gleaming necklaces, with a 1984 Cartier Collection yellow gold, sapphire, and diamond chain pendant as the centerpiece. “[The necklace] has a little bit of sex appeal to it, but at the same time, there’s something very androgynous about the diamonds and the jewels.” Jon Batiste Upon first spotting Harrison at the bash, Oscar- and Grammy-winning musician extraordinaireJon Batisteyelped in delight. Fun fact: For Batiste’s custom Dunhill tux last year, he took inspiration from Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint Georges, formerly embodied on film by Harrison. “One of my favorite things about the Met Gala is this ability for us to all align on the theme and come together and celebrate something that brought us to this moment,” said Batiste, who was styled byLaw Roach.“Now we’re here together, celebrating the dandyism of our ancestors.” With his custom Tom Ford suit this year, Batiste recognized a Hall of Fame of Black American musicians, including Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Allen Toussaint, Fats Domino, and Harold Battiste. The delicate white polka dots on Batiste’s double-breasted suit jacket lauded “all of the great conductors,” like band leader Fletcher Henderson, while the billowing material and cut of his trousers saluted the maestros of the ’40s. “It allows you to dance,” said Batiste. “If you can imagine seeing the Mills Brothers, Cab Calloway, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard onstage, and the motion, I wanted that silhouette.” Batiste also paid tribute to before-her-time jazz great Billie Holiday with a white gardenia pinned to his lapel by a 1968 Cartier Collection brooch featuring a ruby-eyed, yellow gold rabbit in a top hat. “It’s an Easter egg,” he said. But his saxophone proved his most important accessory, as Batiste proceeded to turn the Met Gala red carpet into an impromptu, headline-makingconcert. “To really pay homage properly, [a performance] needed to happen,” he said. Andra Day Batiste also greetedAndra Daywith zeal, as the star ofThe United States vs. Billie Holidayexcitedly told him she had brought visionary fashion futurist, designer, and consultantJérôme LaMaar“out of retirement” for her hot pink tuxedo. “[LaMaar] was the epitome of Black dandyism, Afrocentrism and Afro-futurism,” said Day. “I have been trying to get him to work with me for over 10 years.” The interview paused for a moment as Day’s stylist,Wouri Vice,and staffers buzzed around her, attempting to bustle the jacket’s long, bead-embellished train in preparation for the rainy commute to The Met. “The train pays homage to the dandy-ette,” said Day, explaining that it flowed out into three tobacco-leaf shapes. “Because we wanted to talk about the history—how we got to dandyism and what we had to break through to get there—and just remember how hard-fought and well-earned it was.” A self-professed admirer of the Cartier Panthère collections, Day proudly showed off jewelry conveying the spirit of Afro-futurism: an 18k white gold, diamond, emerald, and onyx bracelet; and two glittering rings, a geometric one and another of embracing felines. She also carried a Cartier leather clutch, encrusted with amethysts, hessonite garnets, and green onyx cabochons. “No one’s ever seen this before,” said Day, as a staffer brought over her phone—which was too big for the case. “It’s the first time it’s been debuted.” Another Simple Favoractor and haute horlogerie aficionadoHenry Goldingalso happily took a rare Cartier piece out for a test-spin. “I actually requested this watch. I’m a huge fan,” he said, showing the gleaming 18k yellow gold and black leather Cartier Tank à Guichets on his wrist. “It’s a dream watch.” Henry Golding For his third Met Gala, Golding earnestly dressed on theme in a custom gold three-piece suit, with Adinkra symbols signaling knowledge, by British Ghanaian Savile Row designerOzwald Boateng. “[Boateng] says that I wear and carry wisdom very well, so he designed the gold and the emblems,” said Golding, also emphasizing the connection to the zoot suit, a representation of pride and identity with roots in the Harlem Renaissance of the ’20s and ’30s. “It’s an honor to be able to represent someone like Oswald and be one of his muses for the evening.” Fellow Brit andWhite LotusbreakoutAimee Lou Woodwas one of the later arrivals to the pre-party—readying for her first Met Gala experience. Also in a version of black suiting, she quickly fell into animated conversation with Edebiri, as Bemelmans Bar longtime pianistEarl Roseplayed upbeat tunes as their backing track. “I’ve felt like for years I was always putting really girly clothes [on], and it’s not very me,” said Wood. “When [I found out the theme was] tailoring, I was like, ‘This is just the perfect moment right now.’” She happily found an exuberant custom Ahluwalia take on a tuxedo: a cropped jacket, shirt, and tie layered over a draped asymmetrical dress. After meeting designerPriya Ahluwaliaat a party, Wood knew the British Indian Nigerian designer would be her number one ask for her Met Gala debut. In collaboration with Wood’s stylist,Felicity Kay,Ahluwalia designed the tuxedo, inspired by the self-expressive, sharply outfitted, and resistance-fightingCongolese Sapeurs. The handmade flower appliqués on Wood’s ankle socks showcased Ahluwalia’s Nigerian and Indian roots. “It was just the perfect alignment,” said Wood, who adorned the jacket with an elegant Cartier Collection white gold and diamond brooch, circa 1939 Paris. Wood, feeling somewhat jittery about walking the red carpet, found relief in knowing herSex EducationcostarNcuti Gatwawas on the guest list. “He’s gonna be here, which is the best. It’s also the perfect theme for him, like he’s such a dandy,” said Wood. “And thenPatrick[Schwarzenegger], who’s inThe White Lotuswith me. So I’ve got two great [friends] and thenWalton[Gogginsis] here as well, somewhere.” Schwarzenegger—in pinstripe Balmain—considerately dropped into Bemelmans to hang with Wood, and chatted with Edebiri by the bar. Then the two costars left to share a ride to The Met, with Schwarzenegger presumably giving Wood pointers from the two previous times he attended (in2019with modelTaylor Hill,and in2022holding a red straw hat). Joe Burrow Wood wasn’t the only newbie at the Cartier pre-party. Cincinnati Bengals quarterbackJoe Burrowwas also getting in the zone, per se, at Bemelmans. “I’m a little out of my element, but I’m excited to experience something new, for sure,” said the athlete, also known asJoe Brrdue to his affinity for opulent jewelry (i.e., “ice”). “I just think the more that I can diversify that part of my life, the more well-rounded I’m gonna be.” Burrow also ventured into new territory with an Art Deco–style Cartier High Jewelry platinum pin with sizable pink and blue sapphires surrounded by diamonds. “I’ve never worn a brooch before, but this one just caught my eye with the colors and the shapes,” he said, also highlighting a relatively understated Les Berlingots de Cartier 18k yellow gold and snakewood necklace, a notable 18k yellow gold Cartier Santos-Dumont watch, and blue Panthère de Cartier sunglasses tucked into the pants pocket of his Gucci suit. “It’s all just about individual expression, and I like colors, I like blue, I like classy, and this fit exemplifies that,” said Burrow, also focusing on the most significant part of the evening. “Just celebrating African American history and culture is important to everybody in this country.” Appropriately,Dapper Dan,groundbreaking Harlem fashion designer and godfather of hip-hop fashion, was the last to appear, and quickly jetted off to The Met. He made his much-anticipated grand entrance in his own design, of course: a black-and-white, zoot-suit-inspired tuxedo with lace, honoring the Harlem Renaissance of the ’20s. “I tried to have my outfit embody the whole history,” said the Met Gala host committee member. “[The Harlem Renaissance] is the most important period to me—the true, liberating period of dandyism, because that’s when the grassroots people dressed themselves.” Dapper Dan The Harlem-based designer broke ground in fashion and culture by combining Western European luxury logos with bold streetwear—only to first be appropriated by those very fashion houses, and then to ultimately partner with Gucci and then creative directorAlessandro Michelein 2017. “I am regarded as the father of logo mania, and I wanted to tie in the history of Africa and history of the world to that in the diaspora,” he continued, referring to the Ghanaian Sankofa symbols, meaning “retrieve,” emblazoning his jacket and hat. Dapper Dan’s 18k yellow gold, peridot, and onyx Panthère de Cartier ring spoke to Cuba’s storied Leopard Society, and the pyramid-shaped yellow gold and diamond Cartier Collection ring, dating to 1932 New York, evoked Southern Gothic author Flannery O’Connor’s short story collectionEverything That Rises Must Converge. “Everything that rises must converge, and so I see myself coming together in Africa, here, the diaspora, everywhere,” said Dapper Dan, whose mink-collar, Louis Vuitton–logo, leather jacket “knock-up”—made for Run-DMC’s Jam Master Jay—is on exhibit at the Costume Institute. But the rose-shaped, 1936 New York–originated Cartier Collection brooch, sparkling with platinum, diamonds, and sapphires, sent the most celebrated message of the evening. “I suggested this here because of the flower,” said Dapper Dan. “Everybody’s happy that I’m finally getting my flowers.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "How Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens Turned the Met Gala 2025 Into the Best—and Best-Tailored—Date Night of All Time",
    "article_text": "On Tuesday, gymnastSimone Bilesand Chicago Bears safetyJonathan Owensare celebrating their second wedding anniversary, which made Monday’sMet Gala 2025the perfect site for an unforgettable date night. Biles, the most decorated US Olympic gymnast in history, has walked the carpet in the past, but 2025 marked Owens’s debut. To celebrate, the couple wore downright regal custom outfits, hers from Harbison Studio and his from Nigerian brand Deji & Kola, which they paired with complementary watches from Audemars Piguet. “The first year [of marriage], we were actually long-distance. The second year, being together for the most part has been really special because we didn’t get that first year together,” Biles toldVanity Fairas the couple prepared for the big night. “It’s just being in each other’s presence one day at a time, and just enjoying and embracing the moments that we do have together, because we are so busy and our schedules never really come together to do events like this. So we’ve been super lucky this week to do the Kentucky Derby and now the Met Gala together.” Owens and Biles were both excited aboutthe theme of this spring’s Costume Institute exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” andthe night’s dress code, Tailored for You. “It’s so cool to be able to have the opportunity to attend this one,” Biles said. “As soon as the theme came out, I said, ‘I wanna go to that one so bad!’” Owens said his white suit was inspired by the Black history on display in the show. “I’m just putting the emphasis on fine tailoring and Black excellence,” Owens said of his look. “It’s a bit of a modern take on the Harlem Renaissance. I have fringe on the end of my hands and on my feet, so it just gives a very royal look.” He said he was also looking forward to seeing how others would interpret the theme. “I’m excited to seeColman Domingotonight. He truly embodies dandyism year-round, and I’m looking forward to seeing what he wears on fashion’s biggest night.” Before hitting the carpet, Biles said she was most excited by the color of her taffeta minidress with a cathedral-length train, which featured intricate metallic floral embroidery and 3D appliqué, as well as a pearl-colored satin collar. Harbison Studio, a brand founded by designerCharles Harbisonin 2013, described the color as capri blue, and Biles noted its similarity toone recent viral object. “My color is very vibrant. It’s just a very bright blue,” she said. “It’s like the Saratoga water bottle!” Biles accessorized with a matching pair of Aquazzura platforms and an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Mini featuring a frosted gold case and bracelet. “Mine is obviously petite, packed with a punch, and I feel like that’s a great representation of myself and my personality,” Biles said of the timepiece. “So that’s why I love it.” Owens complemented his wife’s look with a couple blue accessories of his own, including a Margot McKinney Atlantic pendant, which featured a pearl drop and a 119-carat aquamarine surrounded by diamonds. His Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar was stainless steel with tone-on-tone blue dials. Biles said she was eagerly anticipating catching up with friends and fellow OlympiansSerena WilliamsandMiles Chamley-Watson.“I’m always excited to see Serena, just because I love her and we are always having good chitchat,” she said. “As well as Miles. We’re pretty good friends.” (Naturally, all three of them, plus Owens, werephotographed together inside the event, with Biles and Williams appearing deep in conversation.) Even though it was going to be Owens’s first time at the Met Gala, he said he was feeling calm, while Biles said she was panicked. “I just get so anxious about getting there,” she said. “I think it’s the same in gym. Like, I don’t panic that much, but I just get super nervous. But then, as soon as I raise my hand to salute and step onto the floor, or get out of the car and step onto the red carpet, I’m calm and everything is seamless.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "title": "Behind the Scenes of Instagram’s Met Gala 2025 Class Photo With Nicki Minaj, Charli XCX, Shaboozey, Rosé, and More",
    "article_text": "Before taking to the iconic steps leading up to the Metropolitan Museum of Art Monday night for the2025 Met Gala, nine VIPs made their way through the dimly lit halls of the Mark Hotel to check off one last crucial bit of preparation: Posing for Instagram’s annual class photo. The portrait commemorates the celebrity guests invited to sit at Instagram’s table at the fête, and necessitates transforming one of the Mark’s luxe suites into an elaborate set tucked away behind stage curtains. This year’s celebrity guests posed for photographerQuil Lemonsindividually, then flagged their favorite shots, which were then edited together for a group photo nobody would dream of untagging. Head of InstagramAdam Mosseriwas first on set for the evening’s shoot, where he posed with his wife,Monica,and reflected on the platform’s nine-year partnership with the Met Gala. “We’re a place for creatives to express themselves and tell their stories, and fashion is one of the most important verticals for us. And so we’re excited to support the night, be part of it, but also just seeing what everybody brings,” he toldVanity Fair. As for who Mosseri was most looking forward to seeing on the Met Gala red carpet? Co-chairLewis Hamilton.“I’ve seen him rock some pretty amazing tuxes and a skirt in previous years. So my guess is he’s going to bring it,” he said. Eva Chen,VP of Fashion Partnerships at Meta, made a grand entrance into the suite, sparkling in a pale pink custom Wiederhoeft gown made of 370,000 glistening glass beads from Mumbai, which also featured matching beaded opera gloves with custom touch-screen fingertips. Having been “dazzled” by designerJackson Wiederhoeft’s talent, Chen turned to the popular bridal designer to make her custom corset creation. “When thinking about the theme of the Met Gala and your particular dandism, I thought no one would be able to channel that more than Jackson and their flair for corsets. It’s my first time wearing a corset,” she admitted. “My goal is to not faint, but I feel extremely comfortable, actually. We’re going to sit.” As Chen exited the set, she ran intoJeff Goldblumand his wife,Emilie,as they entered the room. “Now that’s what I call a train,” theWickedstar said of Chen’s billowing silk train. The actor easily exuded the Met Gala 2025 theme, Tailored for You, in his midnight blue Wales Bonner suit that he paired with a blue suede loafer version of Carrie Bradshaw’s favorite Hangisi crystal–embellished Manolo Blahniks, and a Mongolian cashmere coat with a cream shearling collar. But, of course, the Wizard of Oz had one more thing up his sleeve—a blinged-out Jacob & Co. diamond watch. “Feast your eyes upon that,” he said, noting that the glittering accessory was an ode to the late André Leon Talley, who wore a similar Jacob design. When asked who theJurassic Parkactor was excited to see this year, he recalled the 2024 Met Gala with hisWickedcostarsCynthia ErivoandAriana Grande.“I was here last year for the first time, and they were here. We had a moment of connection, and then they performed…I was crying big tears. You know, just ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’—but they did a great thing—both of them.” And while many stars celebrated their return to the Met steps,Shaboozeywas excited to make his Met Gala debut. “I’m so ready to get to the carpet,” the Grammy-nominated singer said in between shoots, while showing off his custom Robert Wun look. The black, wood-grain patterned suit was adorned with nearly 3,000 Swarovski turquoise beads, making for a bold pop of color. The county star went on to explain that he was inspired by the history of West Africa and his home state of Virginia for the unique design, which he topped off with a saucer-style hat and matching turquoise grill. “I’m a huge fan of turquoise, which is very Southwestern, you know. So we just tried to include as much turquoise as we could, keep certain things natural,” said theCowboy Cartercollaborator. “It really feels like West African as well, which I think there’s like a little bit of correlation that just shows like the history of West Africa and coming to America; it’s all embedded in all of these different cultures.” In honor of this year’s Met theme,Taraji P. Hensonchanneled her “divine dandy” with a bespoke collaboration fromMONSEandPost-Imperial, founded by Nigerian designerNiyi Okuboyejo.A few days before the gala, Henson celebrated her Met collaboration with cocktails at Monse’s Lower East Side store, where she joked that, though she hadn’t seen the creation, she wasn’t at all worried about her custom look. While standing in the bespoke outfit at the Mark on Monday, the sentiment remained. “I’m very happy with how it turned out,” she said of the all-white design, which featured a collared, corseted shirt dress with a tails-style jacket and no pants. “I was like, ‘leave the pants to the fellas.’ I want to be a toss-up of masculinity and femininity. I love it,” she said about her ensemble, which she accessorized with a white, pearl-handle cane and a matching bowler hat that she clarified was “just a prop.” Meanwhile, on the other side of the suite,Jenna Ortega’s shoot was underway as she posed in a striking Balmain gown made of metal rulers and tape stitched together, mimicking shimmering metallic chain mail. The young star, who swapped out herWednesdaypersona for old Hollywood glam, jingled as she moved through the set—her excitement matched by the echoing sound as she clapped and cheered when her session wrapped. While exiting the Instagram suite, Ortega greeted superstar singerRoséas she made her way inside. “I’m such a big fan,” Rosé said to theBeetlejuice Beetlejuiceactor, who smiled and returned the compliment before the singer headed onto the set. Charli XCXandNicki Minajrounded out the evening, arriving in the photo studio around 7 p.m. Despite coming off a four-day takeover of Brooklyn’s Barclays Center for the close of her US Brat Tour, the “365” singer appeared fresh and ready to go as she entered the Instagram suite, cheerfully greeting everyone. But leave it to Minaj to turn the last shoot of the night into a grand finale with a showstopping Thom Browne gown. Though it was hard for the singer to walk in the ultra-fitted, pinstripe suit dress, it only took a second for the photographer to exclaim, “We got the shot!” after Minaj immediately nailed her pose in true superstar fashion.

    "title": "Damson Idris on What It Took to Pull Off the Met Gala 2025’s Biggest Red-Carpet Reveal",
    "article_text": "“It makes me feel like I’m walking with the DNA of my forefathers,” actorDamson IdristellsVanity Fairof this year’sMet Gala theme.“When you see a dandy, you see history, but at the same time, you see innovation. You see confidence, but at the same you see vulnerability. And you see everything that that person and the culture has been through. It was the suits that my mother put me in for my birthday, or seeing Sidney Poitier inGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner—and then dandyism. All of that linked together is what makes me the man I am today,” he says, “and the taste I have when it comes to putting on a tailored suit.” Idris, who stars in the upcomingsummer blockbusterF1alongsideBrad Pitt,Kerry Condon, andJavier Bardem, describes working on the movie as the “most fun he’s ever had.” And art imitated life last night, as Idris arrived via anAPXGP carfrom the film, wearing a white racing suit and racing helmet covered in Swarovski crystals.On the carpet,Idrisunveiled the outfitunderneath the suit: a supremely tailored rouge tuxedo, with a contemporary nod toTommy Tartan. Both the racing suit and the tuxedo were designed by American iconTommy Hilfiger. The joint forces of Idris and Hilfiger were a match made in tailoring (and race car) heaven. The relationship between the actor and the designer began almost three years ago, when they met in Miami at an F1 event hosted by Hilfiger, who is also the official fashion sponsor of the upcoming film. For Idris, wearing the brand to the Met Gala was even more personal. He remembers Tommy Hilfiger being one of the first brands he bought when he was “making a little bit of money.” Understanding the assignment for this evening, designer Hilfiger began working on this year’s look the moment the theme was announced. “We wanted to reach back into the Tommy Hilfiger DNA,” Hilfiger says. “There’s a satin lapel that brought classic elegance to it. And the inner lining is the Ithaca stripe. The look was completed with tailored tuxedo pants featuring a side satin stripe and a flare at the knee to sort of give a nod to modern dandyism.” On the tartan side, 80 hours-worth of gold beading contrast against the special print (on the official Scottish Register of Tartans,) along with custom buttons that allowed for the actor to accomplish the theme with grace, style, and a twist on classic American tailoring. But Idris didn’t stop there. He also chose pieces from his newly launched jewelry brand, DIDRIS. The inspiration behind building the brand, he says, started roughly two years ago, during the Hollywood strikes; citing his mom’s love of jewelry as inspiration, he says he wanted to build a legacy that she could be proud of. “This space of fine jewelry is one that people like us don’t usually exist in,” he says, “so there was that challenge too. Me and my team created this custom brooch, which has green tourmaline, tsavorite, and an 11-carat emerald.” Green, he says, is “my favorite color on jewelry.” Besides the gems and the fine stitching, Idris’s essentials for pulling off his look are sleep and starting the day off with a long shower while Fela Kuti’sBeasts of No Nationis playing. “Between the release of this new picture that I’m in and just the [Met Gala] theme, I really wanna take it in, be present, and be focused,” he says. “I’m just excited [to see] everyone who’s smiling. We’ve been through a lot as a culture.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Dapper Dan On the Symbolism Behind His Met Gala 2025 Look",
    "article_text": "Even at 80,Dapper Danremains a lifelong student. “All through the night, I watched documentaries on things that I want to talk about while I’m on the red carpet,” he toldVanity Fairshortly before attendingthe Met Gala 2025to celebrate the opening of the Costume Institute’s new exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” This included a documentary on the groundbreaking Black actress Dorothy Dandridge, and footage of her performing the song “Zoot Suit” alongside Paul White in 1942. Dapper Dan at The 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York. For the exhibition’s theme, focused on the history and transforming contexts of Black dandyism, the designer, whose own work appears in the show, explained how he wanted his look to reference the zoot suits of the Harlem Renaissance. “The zoot suit symbolizes the freedom that we have associated with the dandy,” he said. Representing Harlem, where he’s lived formost of his life,was an especially personal directive too. In 1982, he opened his haberdashery shop Dapper Dan’s Boutique on 125th Street, where his signature“knock-ups”(one-of-a-kind garments featuring remixed luxury logos like Louis Vuitton and Gucci) became iconic pieces of their own.LL Cool J, Bobby Brown, Mike Tyson,and members of Run DMC were among his clientele. A trademark infringement lawsuit forced him to shutter the business in 1992, but in 2017, a surprising turn of events—Gucci acknowledged being influenced by one of Dapper Dan’s own designs—led to a collaboration and thereopening of his atelierin 2018. That year also marked Dapper Dan’s first Met Gala appearance and his shift from fashion outsider to a widely recognized cultural figure. Dapper Dan at The 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York. For this year’s Met Gala, Dapper Dan used an actualzoot suitfrom the Harlem Renaissance era as a model to fashion his own entirely sequin-covered version, featuring both aSankofa symbolin tiny print and a large Sankofa emblem of a bird with its head turned backward adorning the back of his jacket. “The symbol means ‘Go back to get.’ Go back and get so we can go forward. If we all go back first, we can come together,” he said. As though the all-sequined ensemble didn’t require enough heavy lifting up the Met’s red-carpeted steps (“Itisheavy,” he acknowledged), there was also a suite of Cartier jewelry to layer on, starting with a pyramid-cut diamond pinky ring that reminded the designer of his neighborhood’s early Italian presence. “During the Harlem Renaissance period, one of the biggest influences that a lot of people don’t realize were the Italians in Harlem,” he said. “We had the San Gennaro festival.” Dapper Dan's jewelry details There was also a multi-strand gold chain necklace—a nod to the Latinos and West Indians in the neighborhood—a bejeweled flower brooch, a gold pocket watch, and a signature Cartier panther ring that was an especially noteworthy addition to the ensemble’s various cultural references: “The panther is symbolic to the music that came out of the Congo, that went through Cuba, that was responsible for Afro-Cuban jazz.” While Dapper Danhad outfittedother celebrities for the Met Gala on past occasions, he was his sole client this year, instead opting to preserve his creative stamina. “I don’t want to leak out any energy. It takes something out of me, and it takes something out of the people who I dress,” he said. But that only makes him more excited to see who shows up and turns out for the major occasion, especially with the show’s theme in mind. “It’s so important to people of color…. This one shouldn’t be just about being elegantly dressed or very superfly,” he said. As a member of the gala’s host committee this year, he said he plans to hold guests accountable too. “This is a Cinderella event…. So, I mean, put your glass slippers on, and let’s get busy.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "title": "Pamela Anderson on Being “Brave” at the Met Gala 2025, Debuting a Rebellious New Haircut on the Red Carpet, and Who Sat at Her “Power Table”",
    "article_text": "“For me, I could have jumped out of the shower and put the dress on and went to The Met,”Pamela Anderson,who attendedthe Met Gala 2025withTory Burch,said with a chuckle over the phone the morning afterfashion’s biggest night out. “The few people that came by my room said, ‘This doesn't feel likea Met [Gala]day. This is the quietest, most peaceful place,’” she toldVF.“I just keep it simple.” Over the last few years, the 57-year-old actor has made it her signature to do more with less on the red carpet, trading her iconic blond bombshell persona for a more minimal, stripped-back version of herself. And Monday night, her second-ever Met Gala, was no exception. Anderson glowed with minimal glam, allowing her custom, sculptural, icy blue Tory Burch gown to do all the talking as she appeared to float up the steps of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. “I feel like this is one of the great things about being my age and where I’m at in my life is that I’m not craving that attention. I’m not craving that scene. I’ve done it and I’ve done it with really wild, wonderful artists and people. I’ve had an interesting, messy life,” she said. “I’ve learned that I’m okay just the way I am and I’ll present myself the way I want to, not under any pressure, and I don’t worry if everybody’s going to like it.” It’s a confidence and freedombefitting of the Met Gala’s dress code, Tailored for You,in support ofthe Costume Institute’s spring exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”and an aura Burch brought to life in Anderson’s simple yet strong silhouette that resembled a suit of armor. “I just loved the theme so much because I felt like it was like you need to be courageous and brave and precise in how you present yourself to the world and in how you find joy in fashion and confidence,” she said. Though Anderson has adopted a more relaxed approach to these larger-than-life events, months of preparation and craftsmanship went into making her gown. Burch first sent Anderson a sketch while she was filmingKornél Mundruczó’s upcoming film,Place to Be,in Australia, followed by multiple fittings to get the tailoring just right. Sparing no detail, the silk mesh gown was custom-made for Anderson from the inside out using traditional menswear techniques, with hand-sculpted boning, an exaggerated hip, and a molded floating neckline. To give it that effervescent sparkling effect, the gown was then embroidered with twisted silver sequins and crystals in Italy and finally constructed at Burch’s atelier in New York. “It’s actually sitting next to me on the couch right now and it pretty much looks the same off me as it does on me,” she remarked. “It looks like there’s a person in it without a head. It’s really very structured. It’s a sculpture.” Because of the higher floating neckline, Anderson immediately knew that the dress called for a haircut. A self-proclaimed rebel who has embraced this new season of life and period of self-discovery, Anderson didn’t hesitate to make the chop, debuting a whimsical bob with fringe on the carpet. “I am just being a brave little girl. Like the haircut—I had this haircut at five years old. When I did it, I was like, Oh my gosh, this looks like my kindergarten picture,” she said with a laugh. Reinventing herself—while shattering people’s expectations—whether that be on the red carpet or in new and exciting roles, such as last year’sThe Last Showgirland in her upcoming slate of projects, has become Anderson’s new superpower. “I’m not married to any style, and I think that this part of my life is all about freedom and making the choices I want to make. I don’t have a jury around me to tell me what to do, what to look like, how to dress and how to wear my hair,” she said. “So it’s always a collaboration, but I like that I can do whatever I feel. I don’t need to have my long hair. I don’t need to hide behind my hair or feed into a caricature, even though this kind of became a character. I just always do that. I just kind of go from character to character, which is, in a way, just trying to find yourself.” Ever evolving but always grounded by her roots, Anderson’s jewelry for the evening, a sparkling and sprawling ear cuff from Pandora, for which she is an ambassador, was actually a callback to her Met Gala debut last year. “What’s really wonderful about Pandora is that they love to repurpose, recycle, and they put a lot of thought into sustainability,” she said. “I was able to use my first Met necklace and make it into this ear cuff, and also give [her son]Brandon [Lee]a brooch. We used the same diamonds, and it’s just really kind of a clever way to keep using what you have.” Though Anderson admits that attending the Met Gala for the second year in a row doesn’t make it any less intimidating, she did feel more relaxed this time around. Having thrived through awards season, where she received a Screen Actors Guild and Golden Globe nomination for her performance inThe Last Showgirl,she felt more familiar with the landscape. “This time I was with Brandon, which always makes me feel more comfortable,” she said. “It was kind of a nice Mother's Day experience with Tory and I having our sons there.” She also credits the ease of the evening to her tablemates, likeJeremy O. Harris,Rashid Johnson,andJanicza Bravo,whom Burch also hosted. “We had such a fun power table, and everybody was so inspiring. It felt like a magical night. It really felt very relaxed and very fun and also very peaceful,” she said. “I can’t compare it to anything. There were a lot of synchronicities kind of going on. It really was beautiful. I think that everybody was in the same headspace. It just felt very, very collaborative and a lot of camaraderie.” She admits that after her son dropped her off at the hotel, she was in bed by 11 p.m., though she was still suffering from jet lag after traveling to New York from Australia. On Tuesday morning, she was awake at 5 a.m. and took a walk in Central Park to visit a tree that she adopted back in 2022. “It’s very grounding,” she said. It’s a quiet moment that will become increasingly rare for Anderson in the year ahead as she juggles several projects. Having just wrappedPlace to Bein Australia, she will spend the summer returning to the stage in a Williamstown Theatre Festival Production ofCamino Realby Tennessee Williams, promoting another upcoming film,Naked Gun,between shows, and then heading off to take on the lead role inSally Potter’sAlma. “Sally Potter is every actor’s dream. She is an incredible actor’s director, and I can’t wait to collaborate with her, especially right after coming off of Tennessee Williams’s play. I feel like I’m just learning. I’m soaking everything in a sponge and just really working hard, and it’s really fun,” said Anderson. “You never know how long this will last, so I’m just going to keep on working as hard as I can. This has all been a very mysterious and happy surprise that I didn’t expect at this time in my life. Not too many people get second chances like this, so I’m not taking it for granted.” After her big night out in the city and before her career kicks back into high gear, Anderson is eager to return to her happy place, her property on Vancouver Island in rural Canada, and get her hands dirty. “I have to finish planting my garden,” she said excitedly. “This is the most beautiful time of year. All the dogwoods are blooming, my tulips, the daffodils, my peonies. I just can’t wait to get into my garden, and I also have to finish planting my vegetables.

And then I go off into the world.” “You really have to have someplace as your sanctuary to feel grounded. And then you go off into these film projects and theater, and this is a really incredible time,” she said. “My kids are grown. I have no other distractions in my life personally. My relationship is to my work, and I’m enjoying it, and I’m really getting to know myself in the process, which is: I always knew that I could do more, that I was capable of more, and I still don't know what I made of.

    "title": "Taraji P. Henson Didn't See Her Look Until the Day Before the Met Gala 2025—and Made One Big, Perfect Change",
    "article_text": "ForTaraji P. Henson,going to theMet Galareally is about what happens inside. “I am a nerd and I love art,” theactortoldVanity Fairbefore she hit the red carpet. “Every time I go to The Met, I’m always blown away by the art pieces that they pick to exhibit, so I can’t wait to go to see the exhibit. That’s my favorite part of the night.” Henson’s look forthe Met Gala 2025was created by Monse in collaboration with Post-Imperial, a brand founded by their former employee,Niyi Okuboyejo.To design her look for the night, a white suit jacket and bodysuit combo, they drew from a specific historical reference,a 1974 painting by Black painter Barkley Hendricks calledWhat’s Going On,which shows a variety of figures in white suits. Harding, who died in 2017, was known for portraiture that played with formal composition and put special attention on Black figures and self-presentation. In a statement, Monse explained that the look, which Henson paired with copper-colored pumps from Aquazzura, was intended to express a combination of masculinity and femininity. “It intertwines the craftsmanship of menswear with the daring spirit of Josephine Baker—a Divine Dandy embracing her Divine Femininity,” it read. “Each fabric weaves a narrative: The raw edges of the crisp cotton sateen and pique shirt float above a short pique corset dress, sculpting her silhouette, while an opulent wool silk coat envelops her in elegance, complemented by ethereal silk faille shawl lapels.” Henson has been working withstylist duoWayman+Micahfor years, and she said that they normally try to keep the look they’ve planned for the Met Gala a surprise until the final fitting. She loved the suit when she finally saw it, but in an interview conducted before Monday night's Met Gala, she explained how one final decision brought it to perfection. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Vanity Fair:How did the look come together? Taraji P. Henson:I didn’t see the look until yesterday at my fitting because Micah and Wayman, my stylists, wanted to keep it as a big surprise. I trust them, you know? They know me, they know my style, so we’ve been steadily telling a story in my fashion. And I love Monse. But when I saw it, I was just floored. Then I was, like, “I think the pants should go.” I wanted it to be a great cross between feminine and masculine, and I didn’t wanna cover all of my femininity up, so my suggestion was to lose the pants. When we took the pants off, everybody was, like, “This is the look.” I knew it was going to be guys doing the whole suit thing, so I just wanted to toss it up a bit. Besides, I worked really hard in the gym. We can’t cover up all my hard work. Is there anybody whose style you admire who you’re looking forward to seeing tonight? I cannot wait to seeRihanna!I can’t wait to see her andZendaya. I can’t wait to see the top ones, the ones that always shut down the carpet. I hope I’m one of them! Do you have any rituals before you go on a red carpet? I get lots of rest and drink lots of water. I do my meditation and prayer to keep me calm, and that’s about it. I’ll make sure I’m not eating things that are gonna bloat me—I haven’t had carbs in several days. I can’t wait to have a slice of pizza after the Met. I’m gonna have my driver take me straight to a pizza shop! I just want people to know that I am in a very peaceful place, where I have poured so much into myself. That’s why I’m glowing. Because I’m at peace. I love myself. I think I’m taking care of myself in a way that I never have in my life. I’m staying away from negative energy. Loving from afar, but protecting my peace at all cost. That’s what you’ll see on the carpet, a representation of my peace and joy that I found. This weekend, you were announcing a new mental health program in Prince George’s County, Maryland. What can you tell me about it? We are losing kids, and that’s what bothers me. Not too long ago, Prince George’s County lost an 11-year-old to suicide, and that really breaks my heart. As a mother, I can’t stand by idly and just do nothing. We are boots on the ground trying to get to these kids and meet them where they are. You know, you can’t say to a child you gotta get some therapy—they don't understand what that is. So we’re trying to implement fun activities for them, where they can decompress, then slip in therapy in there while they’re doing arts. We’re trying to implement our arts program and a facility where middle school students have somewhere to go after school. We need to pay attention to the middle schoolers. They have hormones kicking in and they’re trying to figure out who they are. They need a safe place to go after school where they can decompress and do some fun activities, like yoga, hip-hop therapy, arts and crafts, to activate their creative side. I think we can help and change those numbers. It’s all about meeting them where they are, and not talking past them or above them. Getting right to their level.

    "title": "Walton Goggins Felt “Like the Commander of the Death Star” Before Twirling Through His Met Gala 2025 Debut",
    "article_text": "A person never knows what version ofWalton Gogginsis going to walk into a room. The actor disappears into his roles so completely—donning tattered clothes and a decaying face asThe Ghoul inFallout,wrinkled Hawaiian shirts and melancholic vindictiveness asRick inThe White Lotus,and the big-haired, tile-toothed razzle-dazzle of theindelible Uncle Baby BillyinThe Righteous Gemstones,to name just three very recent examples—that it’s hard to put a finger on the guy underneath it all, let alone predict what he’d wear for hisMet Gala debut. Days prior, Goggins evenappeared on the cover ofCultured, knees spread, louche, wearing little more than an unbuttoned mustard shirt, a banana yellow Speedo, and a smirk. Speaking toVanity Fairfrom his hotel room Monday amid hisMet Gala 2025prep, he allowed that his customThom Brownelook—an ensemble worthy ofour best-dressed list—was “a little less revealing” than his cover wardrobe. “Slightly.” But not to worry: “I have yellow underwear, the yellow Speedo’s on underneath this.” “This,” it should be explained, was a bespoke suit made up of a sport coat, classic oxford shirt and tie, and ankle-length pleated skirt. This isn’t just a well-fitted suit: The whole look was made “inside out,” with visible tailoring hand stitches, exposed shoulder pads, and style lines standing out in bright contrast with the dark pin-striped wool suiting, double duchess silk, silk faille, and three-ply wool mohair of the ensemble, highlighting the immense effort and multitude of details that go into creating a perfectly tailored suit—tiny, hyper-personal intricacies that, deployed correctly, disappear behind the seams and become more than the sum of their parts. Needless to say, Goggins’s look, accessorized with David Yurman jewelry, rose to the challenge of the night’s dress code, Tailored for You, in celebration of the Costume Institute’s exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” “Deconstructing a suit and then rebuilding it from the inside out is tantamount to really showing everything that is under your skin, how the body works,” Goggins said. “And this is like how the mind works in tailoring. So you’re just showing everybody how much work goes into this seamless presentation of the outer layer of this garment. I was just kind of blown away by that concept and here we are.” As a Thom Browne superfan, Goggins was ready to let the designer do pretty much whatever he wanted. He recounted his stylist,Erica Cloud,calling him a few weeks ago and asking him if he’d be willing to shift a scheduled trip to London to attend the Met Gala. “I thought, Oh, yeah, yeah. Who is it for? And then she said, ‘Are you ready for this?’ And I said, ‘Sure, I think I’m ready.’ She said, ‘Thom Browne.’ I said, ‘I’ve already changed my flight. I’ve canceled my flight.I have no flight.’ My relationship with Thom Browne goes back a very long way.” He traced the roots of his love affair with Browne’s work all the way back to being a broke actor wandering the aisles of Wilshire Boulevard department stores, touching fabric and trying on clothes that he couldn’t really afford. One day, he discovered something that helped him unlock his personal style philosophy, aiming for a look he describes as “devastatingly understated,” and “wearing everything with reverence, but as if you slept in it.” “I came across this one particular shirt that I tried on and it fit me as if I’d been wearing it my whole life, and it was one of the first shirts that I put on where I felt like, This is a true expression of who I am as a person.Thisis how I would dress. Who makes this? I looked at the label, and it was Thom Browne.” He saved up and bought one of those shirts, first in white, “because I could wear it anywhere, and then a blue one, because I could wear it anywhere, and then a light gray one, because I could wear it anywhere.” “That was almost 20 years ago, and I still have those shirts,” he said. The invisible thread connecting Goggins to the brand surfaced again at a photo shoot in Malibu a few years later: “I tried this jacket on, and it felt like it was mine, like, This is mine. Who makes this?” Again, “It was Thom Browne.” He begged the stylist on the shoot to let him take the jacket home with him, but was denied, as it was one-of-a-kind. Instead, he wrote Browne a letter saying how much he admired the jacket and loved his work. “A week later, I get a package in the mail with that jacket in it, and a note from Thom Browne saying, ‘Hope you enjoy it...’ His dot, dot, dot. And I put that note on my corkboard 18 years ago, and it’s still there,” he said. “What a wonderful human being to have done that so long ago.” He still has not only the note, but the jacket, and those first three shirts he scrimped and saved for. On Monday, giddy and running on a self-proclaimed four hours of sleep before the Met Gala, Goggins allowed himself to be talked into trying out an exuberant twirl that he would later display on the steps of The Met, warning, “We might need more room,” before handing his phone over to a friend and allowing the skirt to swirl around him. “How do I feel?” he mulled. “I feel like the commander of the Death Star. I feel like a dandy. I feel like a peacock. It makes me feel on the outside how I wake up every day feeling on the inside. Yeah, I feel special. But I’ve always felt that special wearing Thom Browne.” When he first tried on the look, he said, “I just kind of came alive. And [my stylist] Erica was watching on Zoom, and she said, ‘Oh, there it is. Okay, that’s it. That’s exactly how you wear it. That’s exactly how you’re supposed to feel.’” Goggins finds joy in experiences as varied as the roles he portrays in his projects, and the Met Gala is just one more first for him. “For me, this isn’t about ego,” he said. “For me, this isn’t about being invited to the club or being included at the dinner table. To me, this is an experience, and I live my life for an experience, and like with everything that has happened in my life—it’s like before working with [Quentin]Tarantino,after working with Tarantino, before going to India, and after going to India, before going to the Met Gala, and after going to the Met Gala. It’s an honor to be included, but moreover, it is an experience that I don’t imagine anyone that ever attends this event will ever forget.” “Here we go,” he said, drawing in a breath and grinning hugely again. “We’ll see what life is like on the other side of it.” For more from the Met Gala 2025, revisitVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblogfor the evening’s highlights includingevery look, thebest-dressed of the night, our experts’ picks for whobest embodied the theme, avideo replay of the red carpet, and more.

    "title": "How RFK Jr. Is Already Undermining Vaccines Under Trump",
    "article_text": "During his confirmation hearing to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.tried to distance himself from his notorious reputation as the country’s most infamous anti-vaxxer. He said he supported the measles vaccine,despite writingin a 2021 book that Americans had been “misled” into “believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective.” He promised to support the childhood vaccine schedule, despite casting doubt on the long-term safety of that schedulein his 2023 book. “I believe that vaccines play a critical role in healthcare,” Kennedy said. “All of my kids are vaccinated.” Kennedy’s doublespeak was at least enough to land him the job. Now that he’s in it, though, Kennedy has continued apace with his just-asking-questions approach to undermining vaccination in America. Kennedy’s attacks on vaccines were apparently so swift and so disruptive that in late March, the Food and Drug Administration’s top vaccine official quit the agency ina fiery resignation letter. “This man doesn’t care about the truth. He cares about what is making him followers,” Dr.Peter Markswrote to the FDA’s acting commissioner. Here’s a look at just some of the ways Kennedy is eroding vaccine trust from inside the government. Reviewing the childhood vaccine schedule Less than a week after his confirmation hearing, Kennedy delivered a speech to HHS staff in which he announced his department would investigate childhood vaccinations as part of a newly formed commission that President Trump created through an executive order. That commission,Kennedy said, would look into issues that “were formerly taboo or insufficiently scrutinized,” according toThe New York Times. “Nothing is going to be off limits,” Kennedy reportedly said. Kennedy is also reportedly consideringremoving the CDC’s COVID-19 recommendation for children, though an HHS spokesperson told Politico last month that “no final decision has been made.” Appointing an anti-vaxxer to lead a study on autism As HHS secretary,Kennedy has sought to discreditresearch from the Centers for Disease Control, which found that increases in autism diagnoses are largely due to broader screening and identification of people in “previously underidentified groups.” Instead, Kennedy claimed that “environmental” factors were to blame for this “epidemic” and commissioned a study to determine those supposed root causes. The tell is inwho he tapped to lead the study: anti-vaxx researcherDavid Geier.Geier, who was oncecharged with operating without a medical license, has written extensively about the supposed link between vaccines and autism,which has been repeatedly debunked. Kennedy, who isreportedly planninga national registry of autistic people as part of this research, has said he plans to have the initial results of the study by September. Cutting resources for vaccination In late March, theCDC withdrew$11.4 billion in funds for state and community health programs. That included roughly $2 billion in grants for “Immunization and Vaccines for Children,”according to NBC News. Staffing cuts across HHS, meanwhile, havehit vaccination programs hard, including in Texas, which has been at the center of the measles outbreak. On the other end of the spectrum, Kennedy has thwarted efforts to limit vaccine hesitancy. TheNational Institutes of Health has terminateddozens of research grants focused on vaccine hesitancy, according toScience. A letter sent to grant awardees reportedly stated, “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focus on gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.” Mixed messaging on measles vaccination As the measles crisis in Texas grew,Kennedy acknowledgedon social media that “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” But that was only afterhe confused the messagein a Fox News interview, saying that it was difficult for measles to kill healthy people and suggested thatpoor nutrition and exercisecontributed to the outbreak in Texas. He also claimed—against evidence—that “natural immunity” to measles may be more beneficial than vaccination and thatcod liver oilwas among the natural treatments delivering “very, very good results.” Pushing changes to vaccine testing Just last week, HHS announced that all new vaccines would need to undergo placebo testing, which aspokesperson for the department toldThe Washington Postwas \"a radical departure from past practices.” Which is true—but with good reason. Vaccines that have been around for a while—including COVID-19 boosters—are often not tested against placebos, in part because that would require depriving a subset of trial patients of a vaccine that's known to treat a deadly disease. Now, public health experts worry that Kennedy's new mandate, the details of which are still hazy, could stand in the way of the release of Covid boosters in the fall. “You are watching the gradual dissolution of the vaccine infrastructure in this country,” Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, toldThe Post. “The goal is to make vaccines less available and less affordable.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "Ike Barinholtz Gets By With a Little Help From His Friends",
    "article_text": "InAlways Great, Awards Insider speaks with Hollywood’s greatest undersung actors in career-spanning conversations. In this installment,Ike Barinholtzreflects on his journey on TV and film, leading to his two big comedy hits currently on TV. WhenIke Barinholtzshows up, you remember him—even if he’s not playing the lead character. He’s the tracksuit-wearing nurse Morgan Tookers onThe Mindy Project,the Russian baseball player Ivan Dochenko inEastbound & Down,and, most recently, the boisterous movie studio executive Sal Saperstein inSeth Rogen’s new Apple TV+ series,The Studio.“I do have a tendency to play characters that are kind of, I don’t know, stupid or haughty or impulsive,” he tellsVanity Fair.“It does feel like a lot of times that is in my wheelhouse.” Now he’s involved with two of the funniest new shows on TV—even if you don’t see him onscreen in both. Along with starring inThe Studio,Barinholtz cocreated the Netflix sports comedyRunning PointwithMindy KalingandDavid Stassen,his longtime collaborator. He’s a writer and executive producer on the charming series, which follows Isla Gordon (Kate Hudson) after she’s put in charge of her wealthy family’s professional basketball team. It’s a fruitful time for Barinholtz, made even better by the fact that he’s been working with longtime friends on both projects. He’s known Stassen since they met at a Chicago summer camp in the late 1980s, and they’ve been co-collaborators for much of their adult lives. He and Rogen first worked together onEastbound & Downin 2012, later reuniting in the 2014 movieNeighborsand its 2016 sequel,Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.Barinholtz not only starred with Kaling onThe Mindy Project,but also directed and wrote on the sitcom from 2012 to 2017. “At the end of the day,” he says, “if you can find collaborators who you could spend all day in the writers room or on set with, laughing, getting the work done, making it good—and then still want to go to dinner and grab a drink? That is the best.” Barinholtz, with Mindy Kaling, Kate Hudson and David Stassen at theRunning Pointpremiere in Los Angeles. Born and raised in Chicago, Barinholtz earned his comedy stripes in the city’s sketch and improv scene. He got involved after dropping out of Boston University and catching a show at the ImprovOlympic theater, now known as iO. “Everyone was funny, butTim Meadows,specifically, was so funny to me. He said something that made me laugh so hard,” Barinholtz says. “It just clicked, and I signed up.” In the ’90s, he took classes at iO and Second City, and was often one of the youngest students there. He wasn’t just learning how to act, but also how to improvise a story, which would help him as a writer in the years to come. “Even if it’s a stupid improv scene about the president and the first lady, you’re not just improvising funny things that your character might say,” he explains. “You’re improvising lines to advance the story going forward.” In some ways, Barinholtz had a slow start. He invited his parents and his friends—including Stassen, who was attending Northwestern at the time—to a show that turned out to be a disaster: “I was bad in it. It was very dirty,” Barinholtz says. “I dropped out of college to do this, and my parents come and just see me swearing onstage and not being funny.” But he kept going. Barinholtz got his first big break when he joined the cast ofMadTVin 2002, when he was 25. There he learned about not only comedy and character, but also navigating writers rooms and dealing with notes and producers. “It was very fun, especially the first few years,” he says. While he got noticed for his impressions, which ranged fromArnold SchwarzeneggertoAshton Kutcherto Alex Trebek, it was his original characters that felt fresh and memorable. But his contract wasn’t renewed in 2007—which was fine with Barinholtz. “I was young and just—I don’t want to say bratty, but I would want to try to do other stuff. And I felt like sometimes stuff that I wanted to do wasn’t getting on.” Barinholtz assumed he would be able to book a new role on a TV show with the heat he’d built up fromMadTV,but that didn’t happen. He auditioned for multiple pilots, but his acting career stalled. Instead, he teamed up with Stassen to focus on writing. Eventually, Universal bought a script they wrote that would become the 2016 comedyCentral Intelligence,starringKevin HartandDwayne Johnson.He and Stassen soon found a steady stream of writing and rewriting gigs. “It was just like, Okay, I’m a writer now,” he says. “And I was really grateful that I had the partner that I shared a sensibility with, and this was going to be my life.” Then Barinholtz was cast in the third season ofEastbound & Down,playing a confident baseball player, Ivan Dochenko, who often found himself at loggerheads withDanny McBride’s Kenny Powers. Though Barinholtz only appeared in six episodes, the HBO comedy showcased his improv agility on a much larger platform. “I’m always so grateful to Danny McBride for casting me on that show, which also was the first time I ever worked on something, or got hired to be on something, that I loved,” says Barinholtz. He’d fallen in love with McBride’s comedic abilities years earlier, after seeing him in 2008’sThe Foot Fist Way.“I was like, This is my muse—I’m in love,” he says, adding that he and Stassen had even written roles in their scripts with McBride in mind. Kaling, in turn, was struck by the character of Ivan. When she was hiring the writing team for her own show, she met with Barinholtz and Stassen. “We saw her pilot, loved it, just loved her voice,” Barinholtz says. “I think she’s one of the funniest people in the world.” They joinedThe Mindy Project’s writing staff, and then Kaling came to him about playing a role onscreen as well. It was a dream setup for Barinholtz, who got to both write and create another zany but lovable character. Morgan Tookers remains his favorite part to date. “He’s so loyal, almost to a fault. There’s just something very funny about a man who is very desperate but still relatively upbeat,” he says. “I broke the most doing Morgan.” For a few years, Barinholtz worked onThe Mindy Projectfrom August to April, then used his off time to star in movies such asNeighbors,its sequel, andSisters,acting alongsideTina FeyandAmy Poehlerin the latter. AfterMindyended, he kept busy in both film and TV, having his directorial debut with the 2018 black comedyThe Oath;making the sketch-comedy limited seriesHistory of the World, Part II;and starring in the hit 2018 comedyBlockers. Then cameThe Studio.Rogen wrote the role of Sal with Barinholtz in mind. Barinholtz is “truly one of the quickest thinkers, one of the most convincing improvisers I’ve ever worked with,” Rogen said on hisStorytimepodcast in 2021. “His ability to create a new reality on the spot—something with a fully fleshed out character, something with a storyline and a narrative to it out of seemingly nowhere—was truly amazing to me.\" Barinholtz used these skills to make Sal Saperstein into a much more interesting character, especially after he loses the studio chief job to his friend Matt (played by Rogen). “There’s a version of the show where when Sal doesn’t get the job, he tries to usurp Matt and compete,” he says. “But at least for this first season, I thought the way that he right away accepts it and is like, ‘What do you need, boss?’—he’s a real survivor, and there is a desperation there too. So that character is incredibly fun to play.” It also helps that he and Rogen go way back. “I think when you have a history with someone,” he says, “the laughs are just deeper and richer.” Just as he was in theMindyyears, Barinholtz is juggling writing and acting—and this time, it’s withtwomajor hit TV series. It’s the culmination of decades of hard work, raw talent, and, of course, a little help from his friends. Barinholtz with Rogen and Martin Scorsese inThe Studio. “It is nice sometimes to have someone that you have a history with and you don't have to like talk to them,” says Barinholtz. “Seth and I have done a lot together, and there's times when we'll just both sit there and look at our phones.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

Former Vice PresidentKamala Harrismade an appearance in a black and white Off-White gown.Rihanna, a fashionably late arrival, revealed that she's expecting her third child with her partner, A$AP Rocky, in a Marc Jacobs look.

And to be honest, I bet that would be delightful,” she toldVanity Fairahead of the event, laughing. “Usually I get in so late and I'm exhausted by that point and hungry. So I'm like, someone's performing, and I'm like, eating. I'm like, ‘this is awesome!’ but I'm also eating, and everyone's dancing, and I'm eating because I literally just had the longest day.” This year, she opted for two looks by French brand Courrèges after being “floored” by their show in Paris last year.

We finished it with a custom Jennifer Behr headpiece and Cartier’s Tsagaan set, a striking nod to the Mongolian snow leopard.

The finishing touch was a turquoise grill, which brought a Western edge and hip-hop spirit to the high-fashion look. The secret to his success? A laid-back approach and a bit of confidence. “I’m just really excited to see how people react to what we’re wearing,” he toldVanity Fairbefore hitting the carpet. “Honestly, I’m really confident in our look. I want to see if anyone out there can outdo it.” Erin Vanderhoof 8 hours ago When Harbison Studio was creating a taffeta confection forSimone Bilesto wear on the red carpet, the color they chose was “capri blue.” But when Biles saw the gown—complete with a cathedral-length cape fit for a GOAT—her mind went to TikTok first. “It’s like the Saratoga water bottle!” the Olympian toldVanity Fair.“My color is very vibrant. It’s just a very bright blue.” Jonathan Owens,Chicago Bears safety and her husband of two years, wore a white custom suit by Deji & Kola, complete with a regal stole.

But, as the actor toldVanity Fair, it didn’t come together completely until she suggested one change to show off her recent fitness gains. “I was, like, ‘I think the pants should go,’” Henson said. “When we took the pants off, everybody was, like, ‘This is the look.’ I knew it was going to be guys doing the whole suit thing, so I just wanted to toss it up a bit.

I’m not craving that scene. I’ve done it and I’ve done it with really wild, wonderful artists and people. I’ve had an interesting, messy life,” Anderson toldVanity Fair'sDaniela Tijerinathis morning. “I’ve learned that I’m okay just the way I am and I’ll present myself the way I want to, not under any pressure, and I don’t worry if everybody’s going to like it.” Read more here: Kase Wickman 10 hours ago Walton Gogginswasn't misbehavin' at the Met Gala Monday night, his first time attending the legendary event, but he was ready to have the best time of anyone there. “No one's having more fun than I am,” he toldVanity Fairfrom his hotel room while preparing to walk the red carpet in a bespoke Thom Browne look, a deconstructed suit presented inside-out to show off the intricacies of the tailoring.

    "title": "First Look at Stephen King’s ‘The Long Walk’: The Dystopian Coming-of-Age Story He Considered Too “Merciless” to Film",
    "article_text": "The Long Walkhas survived against the odds. It still resonates decades after the violent conflict that inspired it, and has now finally overcome the many failed efforts to adapt its bleak narrative for the screen. The story, about a group of young men in a dystopian future who embark on a life-or-death marathon with no set finish line, was the first novelStephen Kingever wrote. He was only 19 at the time, finishing it as a student at the University of Maine in 1967. King started the novel when he was in high school and the body count of young American men killed in the Vietnam War was rapidly rising. In 1964,according to government archives, 216 American servicemembers were killed there, but by 1965, when his senior year started, that tally had skyrocketed to 1,928. King started college in 1966, when the number of troops killed more than tripled to 6,350. It doubled once more over to 11,363 the next year when he finished writing the book, with no end to the real-life bloodshed in sight. Looking back, King says he didn’t intend to write a political allegory, but his futuristic fantasy about a military leader known only as The Major who sends a veritable platoon of healthy young men to their deaths for sport had an obvious true-life parallel. “You write from your times, so certainly, that was in my mind. But I never thought about it consciously,” King, now 77, tellsVanity Fair.“I was writing a kind of a brutal thing. It was hopeless, and just what you write when you’re 19 years old, man. You’re full of beans and you’re full of cynicism, and that’s the way it was.” Almost 60 years later, the story is finally making its way to theaters on September 12—directed byFrancis Lawrence, who has helmed all of theHunger Gamessequels and prequels. There are obvious similarities betweenThe Long Walkand those films, based onSuzanne Collins’sYA kill-or-be-killed series. But Lawrence was drawn in by the prospect of telling an even more intense and harrowing story. “​​Anything that has a contest with death as the stakes and some sort of big prize if you win can be connected in some way,” Lawrence says. “But inThe Hunger Games, everybody’s competing in a very different kind of way. There are alliances and you are trying to kill one another. Here, you’renotactually trying to kill one another. It’s a very different dynamic, in terms of relationships.” The boys onThe Long Walkare desperate to survive, but sometimes they help their fellow walkers. Each boy gets up to three warnings if they slow down or stop. The fourth warning is a bullet to the head. The Thinning Ranks: (L-R) Charlie Plummer as Gary Barkovitch(#5), Garrett Wareing as Stebbins (#38), Cooper Hoffman’s Raymond Garraty (#47), David Jonsson as Peter McVries (#23), Ben Wang as Hank Olson (#46), Tut Nyuot’s Arthur Baker (#6), and Joshua Odjick as Collie Parker (#48.) The walk has no destination. It goes for hundreds of miles with no rest for any reason—and ends when only one participant is left standing. “You know that, slowly, these kids are going to be picked away one by one by one, which is not unlike pretty much any horror movie that you see,” Lawrence says. The Long Walkis more a tragedy than a horror tale; the jump scares are punctuated by bursts of heartbreak. The young men’s decency emerges as they realize that stopping to help someone now may mean them reaching out a hand when they fall in turn. But the ugliness of some comes out too, as various characters taunt or torment each other—especially as they all near their breaking points. The Long Walkhas a large ensemble cast that’s steadily whittled down, but the action centers primarily on two guys: Ray Garraty (played byLicorice Pizza’sCooper Hoffman), who may not be the more formidable of the walkers but is certainly the most big-hearted; and Peter McVries (Alien: Romulus’sDavid Jonsson), a fit, handsome, and charismatic front-runner with a philosophical side. While perpetually on the move, they develop the kind of foxhole friendships that often occur between two soldiers in war. “To me, that’s what the whole thing is about. The whole thing is about the two of them bonding, and kind of falling in love in a weird way,” Lawrence says. “The conflict of what they’re there for and what they’ve been through in the past only brings them closer together. The sacrifices they make for one another, to me, is the whole movie.” The Long Walkbegins with Hoffman’s Garraty being dropped off at the starting line by his fretful mother (played byJudy Greer). She’s beside herself, but he’s resolved:They need this.The high-minded explanation for the walk is that it’s intended to inspire a wounded nation with its depiction of fearlessness and strength. It’s also meant to satisfy an angry population’s unabashed bloodlust, the same way gladiator combat did for ancient civilizations. Judy Greer as Mrs. Garraty, watching the morbid procession that includes her son. “You just look at her and you like her,” director Francis Lawrence says. “There’s a warmth and and endearing quality before she says a word. I think she makes it more emotional.” Twenty-two-year-old Hoffman couldn’t connect withThe Long Walkas a representation of soldiers being pointlessly slaughtered for no good reason. But he found another way to relate to the story: resilience. “The Long Walkis a metaphor for life, in my eyes,” he says. “It’s a metaphor for any sort of hard thing you’re going through, whether it’s depression or anxiety or heartbreak or whatever. Sometimes in life, you want to stop walking, and that’s a really dark thought. But the second you acknowledge that and come to terms with it—andthenkeep going—that’s a really beautiful thing.” It’s an inspiring idea wrapped in a grim tale. The winner of the walk gets untold riches and the fulfillment of a single wish—anything they want. Those two prizes serve as a north star for the walkers as they head out on a country road, keeping a steady pace of three miles per hour until no one else is left. TV cameras attached to Army jeeps follow their every step. The march is led by The Major (Mark Hamillin dark-side mode), who repeatedly lauds the nobility of the boys even as he oversees their gruesome executions. It’s ironic casting. In another age, when the book was first published, Hamill might have played any number of the young participants inThe Long Walk. He stood as the epitome of the young hero’s journey inStar Wars, but it was his later work inRian Johnson’sThe Last Jedithat made Lawrence think of him as The Major. ”His Luke Skywalker at that point had weariness. There was an authenticity to it that was grizzled and wary and real,” Lawrence says. “I asked for a meeting, and he and I had a Zoom, and I discovered that he had grown up traveling around in a military family. He was, like, ‘I know this guy.’” Each young man inThe Long Walkhas his own personal reasons for participating in the deadly, endless journey, and the actors did too. Hoffman’s Garraty is grieving his lost father; he enters the race to get vengeance on leaders he despises, pursuing the wishes of his resistance-minded dad. The actor— son of the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman—says he could relate. “The way I always had to think about it was, like, my relationship to my father or my relationship to my parents in general,” Hoffman says. “You kind of believe everything they tell you, and you kind of want to do what they want to. You want to be them, even if you don’t want to be them. Growing up, you start to realize that what they are is notyou. To try to live your life for someone else, especially for someone else who isn’t there… There’s a nice scene in the movie where [McVries] is saying, ‘Anger only gets you so far.’ And it is true, because anger is a feeling based on grief.” TheLong Walknovel is often an entry point for young King fans because it’s a coming-of-age story. They may not be marched off to war, but they are following the orders and expectations of the adults in their lives. “Garraty believed wholeheartedly that his father was fighting for the exact right thing, and his father could do no wrong. And then, at one point, it switches,” Hoffman says. The character starts to think: “Okay, who am I in this? Even if I started out on this journey doing it for someone else, how am I going to finish it, doing it for me?” Mark Hamill as The Major: “Even though he’s got those mirrored sunglasses on and there’s something faceless about him as an antagonist in this, he brings complexity and and even some vulnerability,” Francis Lawrence says. Jonsson, who’s 31, brings a more hardened and mature presence to McVries. His experience sends him to a different epiphany than Garraty’s, even as they become as close as brothers.The walk makes McVries realize that it’s not enough to stand only for yourself. “It’s about acts of kindness and how they affect you,” Jonsson says. “You get that beautiful act of surrender, of putting you before me. That’s part of McVries’s journey with Garrity. How do you pass on the kindness that was given to you? Especially since McVries had a very hard life up until that point, which made him a bit tough.” McVries has a lean physique, ripped arms, and an indefatigable presence, but the actor’s preparation for the role went beyond making sure he didn’t skip leg day. “Francis told me to read some William Blake,Songs of Innocence and Experience,” Jonsson says. “That really reminded me of their relationship, this kind of yin and yang of who we are to be human. What McVries lacks, Garrity has. What Garrity has, McVries lacks.” Together, they might be unstoppable. But only one can win. The film poster with the “legendary” tag mirrors the cover design for the original book. “‘Legendary,’ when it’s connected to a person, basically means old,'” King says. The Long Walkitself was all too often halted in its tracks over the years, both as a book and as an attempted movie. It was the first of five finished novels to be stashed in King’s desk, unwanted and largely unread, until he finally hit the jackpot with his first published book,Carrie,in 1974. “I was trying to impress a girl that I met, and I gave it to her chapter by chapter,” King says ofThe Long Walk. “She liked it, and that was cool.” But she didn’t fall for the book hard enough to swoon for him too. “I don’t think that I ever managed to get lucky, but I certainly tried,” he says. He then submitted the book to a Random House contest for aspiring first-time novelists, hosted annually by the legendary editorBennett Cerf—known for shepherding the works of William Faulkner, Eudora Welty, andDr. Seuss,among many others. “Wow, that takes me back,” King says. “But I was depressed to get a form letter back, and I just never sent it anywhere else. Just put it in a drawer.” Several years after followingCarriewith bestsellers like’Salem’s Lot,The Shining,andThe Stand, King considered resurrecting some of his better unpublished books. But his editors in those days worried that King was already too prolific. “Nobody wanted to publish too many books [by one author] at one time because they felt that it would be a drag on the market and people would be overwhelmed,” he says. Mark Hamill and Francis Lawrence beside a field of wildflowers, behind the scenes during the making ofThe Long Walk. SoThe Long Walkfinally hit bookstores in 1979. But it was published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman, which King would use for five books. He planned to releaseMiseryas a sixth under the fake name when the ruse was uncovered by abookstore clerkin 1985. The King revelation turned each of the Bachman books into bestsellers, andThe Running ManandThinnerwere later adapted into movies. The Long Walkwas repeatedly considered for the big screen, but each attempt fell apart.Night of the Living Dead’sGeorge Romero gave it a try in the late ’80s;Frank Darabont, no stranger to King with his adaptations ofThe Shawshank RedemptionandThe Mist, began developing a version inthe late 2000s.More recently in 2019,Scary Stories to Tell in the DarkfilmmakerAndré Øvredal wasattached to direct.But each time,The Long Walkstumbled in the development process. “I think maybe what held it back in those other adaptations is that merciless quality,” King says. “Somebody putting down the money for it must’ve been, like, ‘I don’t know…this is hard. This is a painful one.’” What changed? He isn’t sure. But King is certainly on a hot streak these days. In a few weeks, he’ll publishNever Flinch, the latest installment in his Holly Gibney series of detective thrillers; he’s also finishing thethirdTalismanbook now.Oz Perkinsjust scored a hit withThe Monkey, based on King’s short story about a cursed toy; directorMike Flanagan(currently working on a new TV series based onCarrie) releases his take on King’s upbeat apocalypse taleThe Life of Chuckon June 6, after winning the audience prize at the Toronto International Film Festival last year;Edgar WrightdirectsGlen Powellin a new version ofThe Running Manlater this year; and MGM+ is putting the finishing touches on a TV series based on King’s 2019 novelThe Institute,about a secret government facility to study children with otherworldly powers, withBenjamin Cavellwriting and directorJack BenderofLostfame overseeing. “What’s weird is that I’ve almost become a franchise, like Marvel or something,” King says. “I saw a poster the other day forThe Long Walk:‘based on the legendary Stephen King story’ or something like that. ‘Legendary,’ when it’s connected to a person, basically means old.” Cooper Hoffman’s Garraty and David Jonsson’s McVries bond during a late night portion of the endless walk. It was never announced publicly, but Lawrence counts himself among the filmmakers who previously tried and failed to makeThe Long Walk. “It crossed my desk in 2006, around the time I was makingI Am Legend. The guy who wroteI Am Legendwas one of the producers—Akiva Goldsman,who’s now a friend of mine. He gave me a copy. We were trying to find something to do together, and I totally fell in love with it. We went to get the rights, and I think it might have been Frank Darabont who had nabbed them right before we could. I fell in love with it, but we couldn’t do it.” Instead, Lawrence signed on to make all four follow-ups toThe Hunger Games. When the rights became available again in recent years,Strange DarlingscreenwriterJ.T. Mollnerpenned the adaptation, and Lawrence signed on to produce in partnership withThe Ring’sRoy Lee,whose previous King credits include therecentItmoviesand last year’s remake of’Salem’s Lot.(King also joined as an executive producer.) Lawrence is currently prepping anotherHunger Gamesprequel,Sunrise on the Reaping.The Long Walkis considered the forefather of those stories, and the progenitor of everything from South Korea’sSquid Gameand Japan’s 2000 kid-on-kid kill festBattle Royale—as well asMr. Beast’sAmazon series,Beast Games,in which contestants are rewarded for eliminating rivals, sometimes bysymbolically murdering them. King doesn’t feel he owns the notion of survival of the fittest, and speaks highly ofThe Hunger Gamesin particular. “I'd been influenced by1984andLord of the Fliesand a lot of novels,\" he says. \"I always thought that Suzanne Collins just had that idea and ran with it. As somebody who has worked in the horror and suspense genre, everything is related to everything else. It’s not like theft. It’s more like homage.” The book set the pace at 4 mph, but the movie lowers it to a slower and steadier 3 mph. “They changed it at my advice,” King says, “because four miles an hour was just too fucking fast.” Still, it was important for Lawrence not to approachThe Long Walklike he’d been down this road before (so to speak.) “I thought the opposite. I’m, like, ‘I don’t want this to feel likeThe Hunger Games,” he says. This film has a scrappier, grittier feel. It seldom leaves the blacktop where the young men are walking. The audience sees only the passing countryside and gawking townsfolk that the contestants see. And the violence is much more explicit. “I’m really only interested in the emotional value of it. You want that impact,” Lawrence says—especially with the very first death, which we won’t spoil here. “He doesn’t seem like he’s going to be the first one to go,” the director teases. Most movies are shot by jumping around through the script, butThe Long Walkwas shot in sequence from beginning to end. The worn-out quality you see in the actors was real, even though they got to stop and sleep each night before returning to the road. “My walk changed. My feet were hurting, my legs hurt. It had to look uncomfortable,” Hoffman says. The cast also found themselves bonding just as the characters did. “It happened so naturally,” Jonsson says, recalling his first scenes with Hoffman when the pair meet as strangers before the walk. “It was like the first day at school.” But the chronological shooting schedule was also bittersweet. “Once they die, you lose them,” Hoffman says. “I got pretty close with some of those boys, and I felt pretty sad when they left.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?

    "title": "On the Eve of the Conclave, a Peek Inside the Pope’s Last Grand Gathering",
    "article_text": "At a sidewalk café and wine bar on Via dei Penitenzieri near St. Peter’s Square last month—the day before the funeral for Pope Francis drew a quarter of a million people to the square—a friend handed me his phone and said, “Look at this. It’s like a Renaissance tableau.” I looked and said, “It is!” The friend wasJames Martin:Jesuit priest, best-selling author, and adviser to the Vatican’s Dicastery for Communication. He was also a delegate to the late pope’s Synod on Synodality, the oddly named gathering in Rome over two Octobers, in 2023 and 2024. The synod, an exercise in collective listening, centered on monthlong meetings of several hundred attendees, was one of Francis’s main efforts to carry out his vision for the Roman Catholic Church. The cell phone photograph was one Martin had snapped “on the fly” on the final day of the synod in the Paul VI Audience Hall, a venue a short distance from the café where we were sitting. It’s an image that at once captures the extraordinary openness of Pope Francis’s pontificate and points to the challenge facing this week’s conclave—and the next pope. The photo showsPope Francisseated among delegates, who cluster around him: scarlet-capped cardinals, violet-capped bishops, women religious (nuns), and lay people in garments of many colors. Everybody is in high spirits, strikingly at ease with the pope. Some are wearing big crucifixes, others lanyards with credentials. Several are taking pictures: In the foreground, a delegate thrusts their phone out to capture the moment; at the upper edge, a nun in a full-on white habit and wimple snaps a picture of the bishop at her side. Close to Francis are two priests, and also two women: one, dressed in white, is kneeling, while the other leans in, clad in a print dress and a headscarf. These four figures are akin to the magi in a nativity scene, people animated with piety and curiosity. As for the pope: Francis, more robust-looking that day than he would be after acute respiratory failure in March, is looking at the pair before him with the attentiveness, even intimacy, that led me, in a 2015Vanity Fairprofile, to call him the pope who looks “the whole world in the eye.” The sheer vivacity of the scene calls to mind Renaissance works likeThe School of Athens,Raphael’s great fresco (1509-1511), now in the Vatican Museums, which depicts a gathering of classical philosophers and learned figures—each at once vividly personal and yet allegorically representative. And as Martin and I considered the photograph further over coffee and orange juice amid the bustle of the café—a go-to spot for Vatican officials and journalists—we agreed that it conjured a painting we’d seen, independently, in the remarkable show of earlyRenaissance art from Sienaat New York City’s Metropolitan Museum last fall. This is Duccio’sThe Raising of Lazarus,from 1310-11, where the cheek-by-jowl closeness of the figures suggests the tight-knit character of the community Jesus gathered around him, and of 14th-century Siena too. So a tableau it is. And yet this is a photograph that belongs very definitely to the Catholic era characterized by Pope Francis’s leadership. For it’s an image of the pope and the faithful in a relationship that scarcely existed before Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was elected pope in 2013. The Church “needs nearness, proximity,” Francistold an interviewerin August of that year, and the synod was one way he sought to make that figure of speech real. The women here are pioneers: Prior to Francis, few women enjoyed proximity to the pope or were asked to take roles in the Vatican power structure. The same is true of the delegates from Asia and Africa: their presence at the pope’s elbow was at once a structural breakthrough and the expression of a demographic change, whereby Catholicism is thinning out in Europe and North America but growing in the Global South. Which means that this cell phone tableau is an image of the future—of a global community of believers that Francis brought near. A few days later I asked Martin to tell me more about the photo and recall the mood when he took it. “Well, who is in there? Crouching down on the pope’s right, at the pope’s right hand, sort of looking excitedly into his face, isPhilippe Bordeyne,a Jesuit theologian, who looks just delighted to be so close to the pope. Above him, beaming down, is CardinalMario Grech,an archbishop from Malta, who really was running the synod. Toward the right side with the grey beard isGiacomo Costa,an Italian Jesuit also instrumental” in coordinating the meetings. “The woman in the green or aqua-colored sweater, also smiling at the pope, isMaría Luisa Berzosa”—a Spanish nun of the Daughters of Jesus, and a consultor to the Synod of Bishops—one of the most powerful women in Catholic history, and a woman who wassaid to have had the pope’s ear. “Way in the back of the picture, near the image of Mary,” Martin continued, isJulia Osęka,then a 22-year-old undergraduate at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said to be the youngest woman in attendaence. Martin, who is staying in Rome through the conclave, which will begin on Wednesday, May 7, as a commentator for ABC News, says that he looks at the photo often, refreshed by the “delight” in it. “There’s delight that comes from being around the pope, there’s delight that comes from finishing the synod, and there’s simply a delight from being in a community like that. It’s just a picture of great joy.” The image stands in stark contrast to the conclave. That forum will be all men, all cardinals, all in late middle age or older, all dressed in red and white. And rather than jostling spontaneously together, the cardinals will likely be kept in line both byconclave ritualsand by the Vatican habit whereby clerical eminences flock together in language groups or blocs. Will the Italians regain the papacy, and if so, will it be through an alliance with the North Americans, or the Latin Americans? Will theLadbrokes-touted man whose skull-capped visage is all over social media wind up confirming the adage that “he who enters the conclave a pope leaves it a cardinal”? Those questions, legitimized by the hit filmConclave,will dominate the coming days. But Martin’s photograph is a reminder that things don’t have to be that way. This digital tableau reflects the variety and openness Francis brought to the Catholic leadership—qualities that this observer hopes the next pope will carry forward.

On Monday, influential guests from all corners of culture made their way acrossthe Met Gala 2025 red carpetever-so-elegantly draped walking over the museum’s storied steps, in celebration of the Costume Institute’s spring exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” The exhibit, which includes a collection of garments, accessories, paintings, photographs, decorative art, and more from the 18th century to the modern day, presents visitors to the New York City landmark with a cultural and historical examination of Black style that has dandyism at its epicenter. It opens on Saturday, May 10 and runs through October 26, 2025. It is partially inspired bySlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,Monica L. Miller’s 2009 book, and she served as guest curator alongsideAndrew Bolton,the Costume Institute’s curator in charge. As always, theMet Gala’s dress codewas inspired by the spring exhibition. In support of “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” the Met Gala 2025 dress code was Tailored for You, in tribute to the show’s focus on suiting and menswear.According to The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, the directive was designed to “purposefully designed to provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.” When the Met Gala 2025 red carpet officially opened on Monday evening, the star-studded host committee was among the first to arrive.

    "title": "Rihanna Makes a Fashionably Late Entrance—and a Pregnancy Reveal—at Met Gala 2025",
    "article_text": "Rihanna,whoseincreasingly elaborate Met Gala ensemblesnever disappoint, carried on her reign as Queen of the Met at theMet Gala 2025on Monday. Though she has reinvented her look at the gala every time she attends, some things never change: Rihanna once again kept her devoted audience in anticipation of her arrival well after the red carpet opened, finally arriving at the event after 10 p.m. In fact,when she last attended, in 2023, very pregnant and swaddled in oversized white Valentino blooms, Rihanna and her partner,A$AP Rocky,were the very last arrivals at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for theCostume Institute’s annual fundraiser. And Rihanna's arrival at the Met Gala wasn't the only attention-grabber: She appears to be expecting her third child with Rocky. Ahead of the event, Rihanna was photographed in a body-hugging gray two-piece knit skirt and top paired with stilettos and monochromatic sheer knee-high socks, rocking a retro cloche hat. Inimages posted to social media earlier Mondayby photographerMiles Diggs, who has helped Rih with pregnancy reveals via photos in the past, she's visibly pregnant. Hours after she set the internet abuzz without approaching The Met, heposted another photoof her in her final custom Marc Jacobs look, slyly captioning it, “Fashionably late.” To meet the evening’s dress code guidance, Tailored for You, Rihanna opted for a custom wool suit by Marc Jacobs, menswear-inspired but deeply feminine and all Rihanna. She paired a bonded barathea wool Spencer jacket with a wool morning-stripe bustier bodysuit and pinstriped skirt featuring a bustle fashioned from a tied jacket. An oversized custom Marc Jacobs x Stephen Jones hat shaded her face and spectator-styled pumps continued the retro-influenced look. Of course, no dandy's look is complete without a cravat, so Rihanna sported a delicate satin one sprinkled with tiny white polka dots, attached to a white pique collar. Rihanna is no stranger to making a fashion statement at the Met Gala: She made her debut at the event in 2007, when she was just 19 years old, and in the intervening years has donned some of themost unforgettable looks in recent Met Gala fashion history, including that canary yellowGuo Peigown in 2015. Bow down, because at long last, the queen has arrived. For minute-to-minute coverage of all things Met Gala, be sure to head toVanity Fair’s Met Gala 2025 liveblog.

The former vice president and recent Democratic presidential candidate, whose turbocharged run ended up a loss toDonald Trump,has kept a relatively low profile since the election in November 2024. She is reportedly working on a book, andrumors have swirledabout a run for California governor, or even another presidential bid in 2028. On Monday evening, however, the staid pant suits and softly feminine bow-neck blouses of her abbreviated campaign were nowhere to be found as Harris stepped out for the annual fundraiser for the Met’s Costume Institute. Kamala Harris In a nod to the night’s dress code, Tailored for You, in support of the institute’s spring exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” Harris wore a bespoke black and cream silk Off-White dress, featuring colorblocking and a dramatic trailing sleeve, as well as a black scarf that doubled as a diminutive train for the look. Off-White creative directorIB Kamarapraised Harris in a statement Monday. “The precise simplicity of this black and cream look for Kamala D. Harris complements her own strength and confidence, two qualities I consider to be the core of dandyism,” he said. IB Kamara, Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff This marks Harris’s Met Gala debut. Of course, Harris and her family are no strangers to high fashion: Her stepdaughter,Ella Emhoff,made her ownMet Gala debut in 2021, donning a red Adidas byStella McCartneymesh bodysuit, oversized trousers, and red sneakers.

    "article_text": "On Monday night,Diana Rossmade a triumphant return tothe Met Gala red carpetfor the first time since 2003, and her long train turned heads on the museum steps. The singer and disco icon was joined by her son,Evan Ross,as she walked the carpet—and a team of attendants who helped her up the steps after her full 18-foot train was unfurled. The younger Rosshelpedthe Nigerian designerUgo Moziewith the look, a sumptuous white gown with crystals, beads, and a feather trim. Evan Ross and Diana Ross In an interview forVogue’s livestream,LaLa Anthonyasked Diana Ross if she had planned to shut down the carpet and her response was characteristically modest. “It was not the plan! Everything was very last moment,” she said. “My son persuaded me because I’m actually on tour! He said, ‘Mom, you’ve gotta go!’” Evan Ross, Diana Ross at The 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York, New York. She pointed out that the train had an emotional significance. “It has the names of all my children and my eight grandchildren, so everyone’s name is embroidered here,” she said, adding that her feathered hat represented a challenge. “I had to be careful with the hat because my head is pretty big.” Ross’s daughter,Tracee Ellis Rossarrived on the carpet later, with an explanation for why her mother drew so much attention when she stepped on the carpet. “She’s the best thing of all time,” Ellis Ross told Anthony. “What I explain to people is that my mother stops time. Obviously it stops when you look at her, and when she shows up at something like this—because she never goes out—it’s a show stopper.” NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 05: Diana Ross attends the 2025 Met Gala Celebrating \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 05, 2025 in New York City. Ellis Ross arrived wearing a pink number designed by Marc Jacobs, along with a matching hat by British milliner Stephen Jones. She said this year’s theme, focused on tailoring and the history of Black dandyism, appealed to her sense of style. “I feel like I’m naturally a dandy. I don’t live by anyone’s definition of me,” she said. “I just feel like [being a dandy] has a sense of claiming and owning your own identity and fashioning it by your own terms.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom.

    "article_text": "However, critics warn new ‘small-scale’ reclamation legislation could spark privatisation fears amid public access debate Yacht bays proposed for Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour could be the first private projects to benefit from new legislation facilitating small-scale reclamation, expected to be passed on Wednesday, according to a watchdog and a surveyor. However, the amended law, which exempts small projects from the reclamation ban in Victoria Harbour, has also sparked concerns about the potential privatisation of natural resources amid calls for authorities to ensure public access. The current legal framework forbids any reclamation in the harbour unless it is proven to have an “overriding public need” supported by “cogent and convincing materials”. The government deemed this too stringent for minor works intended to enhance the waterfront. The Development Bureau’s proposed legal changes would allow small-scale reclamation of 0.8 hectares or less, including for erecting specified structures designed to enhance the harbour, such as piers, boardwalks and moorings. However, such projects would require approval from the financial secretary following consultation with the government-appointed Harbourfront Commission advisory body and district councillors. The legal amendments would also permit temporary reclamation not exceeding three hectares, with a seven-year completion time frame, subject to stakeholder consultation and government approval, and the submission of an annual progress report.",

    "title": "Hong Kong to review regulations after abrupt closure of Alliance Medical Group",
    "article_text": "City leader vows to better protect consumer rights by considering statutory cooling-off period or limiting duration of healthcare contracts Hong Kong’s leader has vowed to better protect consumer rights by studying the possibility of introducing a statutory cooling-off period or limiting the maximum duration of prepaid healthcare contracts following the abrupt closure of a medical group. As of Tuesday, the city’s consumer watchdog had received 773 complaints concerning the group’s closure, with the amount involved rising to nearly HK$4.3 million (US$554,800). The government set up an interdepartmental task force to handle the matter last week after customers discovered the group’s two clinics in Tsim Sha Tsui and Sha Tin had closed without warning. The company offered prepaid vaccination packages for children, among other services. Lee said his administration would review current regulations in light of the incident. “Currently, the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance regulates the facilities and safety of healthcare services, while prepaid consumption is governed by contracts,” he said ahead of his weekly meeting with advisers in the Executive Council. “The government will examine whether the existing regulations are adequate, particularly for prepaid consumption, and consider various proposals, including the introduction of a statutory cooling-off period, limiting the maximum contract period.”",

    "title": "“There’s a Lot of Tension”: Democrats Are Locked in a Generational Fight",
    "article_text": "The impending Democratic opening at the top of the House Oversight Committee has reopened rifts between the party establishment and its younger insurgent wing. Back in December, then 74-year-oldGerry Connolly—who was being treated for esophageal cancer—was elected ranking member of the powerful watchdog panel overAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez,the 35-year-old progressive who has emerged as one of the party’s most dynamic stars. The snub seemed, at the time, a reflection of adeeper issuefor Democrats: that the party’s aging old guard was too reluctant to abandon its power, and valued seniority and longevity over the kind of change that Democrats’ 2024 losses seemed to call for. Five months later, withDonald Trumprunning roughshod over democracy, Connollywill be stepping down from his leadership roledue to a reemergence of his cancer. But AOC, who had been said to be considering another run for the Oversight post, ultimately decided against throwing her hat into the ring: “It’s actually clear to me,” shetold reportersMonday, “that the underlying dynamics in the caucus have not shifted with respect to seniority as much as I think would be necessary.” Ocasio-Cortez’s decision leaves an open lane for other younger Democrats to make a run at the position, includingJasmine Crockett,Maxwell Frost,andRobert Garcia.But it could also make the path for 70-year-old Massachusetts representativeStephen Lynch—who has been endorsed by Connolly and some other more establishment figures—all the clearer. To be sure, the divide isn’t just about age, as Pennsylvania progressiveSummer Lee—one of the younger members of the Oversight Committee—told me. “I know some old folks who got fire still, and maybe are more ideologically connected to me,” the 37-year-old said. But, Lee suggested, some of the younger Democrats are better able to rise up to these “unprecedented times” because they are able to see them more clearly, without the fog of nostalgia. “There are, quite frankly, people who were here at a time when bipartisanship existed. I’ve never seen it. There are people who were here before the Tea Party and before Trump as a politician existed, and they have a nostalgia for the institution as it existed then,” Lee said. But “we are in times that take different tactics.” The fight over Oversight is, of course, a proxy fight for a bigger battle among Democrats. Many of its leaders have faced criticism—within the conference and among the base—for taking a perhapstoo careful,sometimes anemic,occasionally helplessapproach to Trump’s all-out assault on America’s democratic system. Some have downplayed interparty divides: RepresentativeWesley Bell,a 50-year-old Oversight member, told me that any differences among Democrats are “boutique” issues compared with the unified front they are presenting against the Trump administration. “I think there’s a great dynamic of young people with energy and bringing a different perspective, but then also folks who are veterans, who have the experience and wisdom,” Bell said. “I think Democrats are doing everything that we possibly can to push back.” But the base—already frustrated with a party that, in sticking with a senescentJoe Bidenlast year until it was too late, has lost two out of the last three elections to Trump—has shown an appetite for a more aggressive approach to fighting the current administration: “We don’t need [an Oversight leader]…who’s going to be sending, like, strongly worded letters,” saidSantiago Mayer,founder of Voters of Tomorrow, the Democratic-aligned Gen Z political group. “I think we’re now in a moment where we need that energy and we need that fight.” There have been some signs of a changing of the Democratic guard; just in the past two weeks, two prominent lawmakers—SenatorDick Durbin, the minority whip, and fellow IllinoisanJan Schakowsky,who has served in the House since 1999—announced that they would not seek reelection, with both 80-year-olds citing a desire to pass the torch. Meanwhile, a growing number of long-serving members are expected toface primary fightsfrom younger challengers—a movement that has the backing ofDavid Hogg,a 25-year-old vice chair of the Democratic National Committee. (Hogg’s active support of primary challenges to incumbent Democrats has been controversial, drawing a rebuke from DNC ChairKen Martin:“No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,” hesaidlast month.) At the very least, Lee suggested to me, there is a “more robust conversation” underway about the party’s leadership and approach. The question is what that conversation will mean for Oversight, where the next leader will be tasked with bringing together what Lee called a “constellation” of stars working to provide some check on Trump: “There’s a lot of tension between what direction we’re going in” as a party, Lee told me. “The Oversight Committee obviously epitomizes that.” See All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet Hawk TuahOpens Up About Her Crypto Scandal Plus, Who MadeVF’s Met GalaBest-Dressed List?
