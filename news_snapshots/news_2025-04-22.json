    "title": "Teachers union boss Randi Weingarten shares her 'concern' with SCOTUS case on LGBTQ books",
    "article_text": "American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten addresses the Supreme Court case on LGBTQ books and curriculum in classrooms and comments on students’ test scores on ‘The Story.’ The Supreme Court is taking on a high-profile First Amendment case aftera Maryland school boardwithdrew its original opt-out policy for books related to gender and sexuality, prompting a federal lawsuit. While the high court appears to be siding with parents ahead of the final ruling, American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten shared her misgivings about the case. \"My concern about this case is that it could pit people against each other when what we really need to be doing is we need to be making sure that every one of God's children is accepted in our classrooms,\" Weingarten said on\"The Story\"Tuesday. \"Whether that person is an evangelical Christian or whether that is the daughter or the son of gay parents, that is our obligation in schools. So it's a failure of all of us that this case is in the Supreme Court right now.\" TRUMP PREPARING TO MAJORLY REVAMP DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS MATH, READING SCORES SHOW STUNNING LOWS Back in 2022, Montgomery County, Maryland introduced new books with LGBTQ+ characters and themes into the elementary school curriculum, as part of the district's \"inclusivity\" initiative. Theschool district refused to allow parents to opt outof the reading program - the same way older students can forego sex-ed instruction. While the school board initially allowed parents to keep their children out of this curriculum, the plaintiffs say officials quickly reversed course, announcing in March 2023 that exceptions would not be granted and that parents would not be notified before the books were introduced into their children's classrooms. Officials cited increased absenteeism as one of the reasons for the change. Although Weingarten's union does not have teachers involved in the Maryland county case, she commented on the larger issue of woke ideology andparental rights in educationTuesday. The union boss affirmed that parents have \"rights\" when it comes to their children's education, but she also emphasized the critical role of communities at the local level in needing to hold \"sufficient conversations\" about \"age-appropriate\" or \"controversial\" material. EDUCATORS HOPE ‘ABYSMAL’ NATIONAL LITERACY RATES WILL BE ADDRESSED NOW THAT DEI, GENDER IDEOLOGY OUT THE DOOR Although affirming parental rights, Weingarten was pressed on her emphasis on creating a \"welcoming and safe environment\" in the classroom despite growing concerns around the nation's test scores. \"What teachers have to do is we have to embrace everything…that society throws at us,\" she told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum, arguing that the federal role in education is to \"fill opportunity gaps\" and \"help every single child succeed.\" MacCallum pushed back, noting the steep decline inreading and math scoresacross the nation over the past two decades. Often called the \"Nation’s Report Card,\" the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is given every two years and considered one of the best indicators of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and eighth-grade students on their math andreading skills. The results showed that, compared to 2022, theaverage math scorefor eighth grade students was virtually unchanged, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third of eighth grade students scored below \"basic\" in reading, more than ever in the history of the assessment. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math, where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. But it's still 3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average. Some states have also seen individual successes,including Mississippiwhich has expanded school choice and teacher training. Weingarten called the progress \"terrific\" and explained her union is working to do \"more\" of what Mississippi did to see improvements for students. Weingarten agreed with MacCallum that an emphasis on woke issues is a \"distraction\" from learning, but she remained a staunch champion of \"both\" creating a welcoming and safe classroom and helping students succeed in reading, writing and math.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Laura Ingraham calls out censorship of free speech on 'The Ingraham Angle.' A mom is suing a Missouri school for suspending her 13-year-old son after he arranged cans of Dr. Pepper in the shape of a rifle and posted a photo of the creation on Snapchat. \"This is unconscionable—my son never hurt or threatened a single person,\" Riley Grunden, the mother of the student, who is being called W.G., said in a statementreleased by Goldwater Institute, who is representing the 13-year-old. \"Instead of using common sense, our own school district treated my child like a criminal for arranging empty soda cans in a way they didn’t like,\" Grunden added.  \"What happened to hisFirst Amendmentrights?\" DAD CLAIMS SON WAS HARASSED BY STAFF FOR WEARING ‘LET’S GO BRANDON’ SHIRT, SUES SCHOOL DISTRICT Riley Grunden is suing a Missouri school for suspending her 13-year-old son for making a rifle out of cans of Dr. Pepper and then posting a photo of the creation on Snapchat. (Photo: courtesy Riley Grunden and Goldwater Institute) W.G. posted a photo of the Dr. Pepper cans on Snapchat with audio titled \"Ak47\" which had a musical beat with a voiceover saying, \"This is the famous AK47, with over 50 million manufactured in ten countries, the AK47 is the most popular assault rifle in the world.\" After the post, which was made off of school grounds, W.G.'s belongings were searched on Sept. 16, 2024, and he was subsequently suspended by the Mountain View-Birch Tree R-III School District for three days. Grunden met with the superintendent and principal on Sept. 17, 2024. The school allegedly made a permanent note on his school record that he had taken part in \"cyberbullying.\" In a statement toFox News Digital, Lanna Tharp, Mountain View-Birch Tree R-III School District superintendent, said, \"The School District is aware of the lawsuit that was recently filed. Unfortunately, because the lawsuit involves a student, we are significantly limited in what we are legally permitted to share publicly. For now, we can only say that we have legal counsel, who will present our side of the story and defend against these allegations.\" W.G. posted a photo of the Dr. Pepper gun on Snapchat. (Photo: courtesy Riley Grunden and Goldwater Institute) The Goldwater Institutefiled a lawsuiton April 10, 2025, alleging that the Mountain View-Birch Tree R-III School District and school officials misinterpreted W.G.’s post \"in order to justify punishing him for creative expression protected by the First Amendment.\" The Goldwater Institute maintains that because of the U.S.Supreme Court’s2021 decision in Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L., schools have a narrow amount of power to control speech that is made off-campus. They also highlight the Missouri’s Constitution's protections for free speech in Article I, Section 8, which gives a Missourian the right to \"communicate whatever he will on any subject,\" which the Institute says makes \"clear that creative expression like this soda can art project falls squarely within protected activity,\" in an April 15, 2025,postabout the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, Tharp allegedly said, \"We have enough information to believe the video has caused fear to at least one student and understandably so. The safety and well-being of our students is our top priority, and we responded swiftly to address the concerns.\" MARYLAND MOM TAKES LGBTQ+ CURRICULUM BATTLE TO STATE SUPREME COURT Riley Grunden with son, W.G. (Photo: courtesy Riley Grunden and Goldwater Institute) This despite Tharp also allegedly saying, \"We want to inform you that we have become aware of a rumor circulating on social media regarding a potential threat. Following a thorough investigation, we have found no credible evidence of any danger.\" The aim of the lawsuit is to clear W.G.'s record and prevent the school from taking further action against the student in regard to the Dr. Pepper cans photo. It also asks the court to declare the school district's actions unconstitutional. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Dave Roland, director of litigation and co-founder of the Freedom Center of Missouri, said that Goldwater Institute is \"pursuing this case to turn the tide against a troubling national wave of schools overreaching their proper authority when it comes to policing and punishing off-campus student expression.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Through Goldwater’s American Freedom Network of pro bono attorneys, Dave Roland, director of litigation and co-founder of the Freedom Center of Missouri, Marc Ellinger and Stephanie Bell, partners at the Missouri-based firm Ellinger Bell, are representing W.G. \"From students suspended for posting memes to punishments for fictional creative writing, schools are increasingly treating ordinary adolescent communication as grounds for disciplinary action,\" Roland added. \"The consequences extend far beyond individual cases - each unjust punishment sends a message to all students that their constitutional rights disappear the moment they log onto social media.\" Rachel del Guidice is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: What America owes Elon Musk after DOGE",
    "article_text": "DOGE leader Elon Musk chats with 'Special Report' about reducing government waste, the declining birth rate and the Minnesota governor taking aim at the Tesla stock. AsElon Muskprepares to step back from his service in the Trump administration, the nation owes him a debt of gratitude for breaking through decades of empty promises about exposing and ending waste, fraud and abuse in Washington. Musk shared on Tuesday that his time focused on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) would \"drop significantly\" as he moves to refocus on the businesses and ventures he left behind to serve Trump and the American people. As head of theDOGE, Musk has actually done something about out-of-control spending, and more importantly, he has put systems in place to further and continue this vital work even once he is gone. TESLA EARNINGS FALL SHORT; ELON MUSK SAYS DOGE TIME WILL 'DROP SIGNIFICANTLY' According to its website, DOGE has saved the federal government $106 billion dollars thus far, or about a thousand bucks per American citizen, which is not chump change. In fact, it is exactly the kind of change our country has long needed. Some of these savings came from laughable software errors, or basic and obvious redundancies, but others, such as the firing of probationary employees in many departments, were hard choices to cut hard-working people. If, as Musk believes, his big cuts in the size of federal bureaucracy do not result in chaos in government services, then it will represent a sea change in how we look at the federal workforce, one that could finally place America on a road to fiscal solvency. It has been a bumpy ride for the eccentric richest man in the world, once a climate-saving liberal darling, now arguably as hated as PresidentDonald Trumphimself by the far left. And while his decision to take on the task of leading the DOGE may not have been entirely selfless, attaining power rarely is, it has come at real personal and economic cost. TEXAS POISED TO CREATE ITS OWN VERSION OF DOGE AS BILL PASSES BOTH CHAMBERS As far as Musk’s bottom line is concerned, his service at DOGE has undoubtedly hurt his Tesla electric car company as the vehicles went from symbol of progressive environmental virtue to some kind of supposed Hitler-mobile. Thank you, Elon Musk, for doing the things that so many said could never be done. For challenging the status quo and tightening the belt of a federal government that had grown obese at the buffet of taxpayer dollars. In fact, part of Musk’s decision to return to private life is to throw a life jacket toTesla, as well as his other ventures such as SpaceX. But financial harm is not what has cut the deepest. Elon Musk is a person who likes to be liked. He is playful and likes to make jokes. With bright wide eyes, he invites everyone into his extraordinary mind to explore getting to Mars, or saving the planet, or the implications of artificial intelligence and low birth rates. But now, millions absolutely hate him. DOGE REVEALS WHAT YOU GET FOR THE HALF MILLION YOU'LL PAY IN TAXES OVER YOUR LIFETIME As strange as sympathy for the wealthiest man to ever live might seem, no amount of money can purchase respect or a glowing legacy, both of which Musk has risked, and in the case of liberal opinion, sacrificed, at least for now. Elon Musk has served as a heat shield, or lightning rod, throughout Trump’s tumultuous and historic second first 100 days. In fact, at the protests I have covered, it is Elon, not the Donald, who is the target of the most ire. Now, the lunatic left will have to find a new public enemy No. 1. They won’t have Elon Musk to kick around anymore. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION One must wonder if anybody other than an eccentric outsider with screw you money could possibly have taken aim at so many powerful and moneyed interests on the government dole, without being completely destroyed. Musk is anything but destroyed. Now, the man on a mission to bring a man to Mars may go back to making science fiction come to life, with his self driving cars and vaguely terrifying robots. Whether Elon gets to witness that first human footprint stamped onto the Red Planet and into history remains to be seen, but few who have witnessed his furious race to cut government waste will tend to doubt him. So thank you, Elon Musk, for doing the things that so many said could never be done, for challenging the status quo and tightening the belt of a federal government that had grown obese at the buffet of taxpayer dollars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the head of DOGE, just as he is was as an automotive and space innovator, and owner of X, a bastion of free speech in a deeply censorious social media landscape, Musk is challenging us to make our country and our world a better place.

    "title": "Maine Rep Laurel Libby appeals Biden-appointed judge's verdict on controversial trans athlete censure",
    "article_text": "Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Maine, joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss a judge ruling against keeping transgender athletes out of women's sports and her censure over the issue. Maine GOP state Rep. Laurel Libby filed an emergency appeal with the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday over arecent rulingthat upheld her censure in the legislature. The state's Democrat majority voted to censure her for writing a social media post that identified a trans athlete who won a girls' state pole vault competition in February. Libby filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Ryan Fecteau to have it overturned, but Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose ruled against Libby on Friday. DuBose was appointed byformer President Joe Bidenjust before he left office in January. Libby previously told Fox News Digital that she would appeal the ruling once it was announced, and now she has, and she is willing to take her case to the Supreme Court. \"Our appeal asks the court to correct this abuse of power and reaffirm that legislative leadership cannot use procedural maneuvers and sweeping assertions of immunity to sideline dissenting voices and disenfranchise entire communities,\" Libby told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"I remain optimistic that the court will recognize what is plainly at stake: the integrity of representative government and the foundational principle that no elected official, no legislative leader, and no partisan majority is above the Constitution. The people of House District 90 deserve full representation, and we intend to see that right restored.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Libby represents 9,000 constituents in Maine's 90th District and has not been able to speak or vote on their behalf in the state legislature for two months. \"This appeal is about far more than one legislator’s seat – it’s about defending the constitutional rights of 9,000 Mainers who currently have no voice and no vote in the Maine House of Representatives,\" Libby said. \"I’m grateful for the support of my constituents and so many others across Maine who understand the importance of speaking truth and standing firm. I will continue to press forward until the voices of the people I was elected to represent are heard once again in Augusta.\" DuBose presided over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Judges John C. Nivison, John A. Woodcock, Lance E. Walker, Karen F. Wolf, Stacey D. Neumann and Nancy Torresen signed recusal orders shortly after the case was initially filed. No reason was given. So the case went to DuBose in Rhode Island. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER The censure so far has cost her a chance to vote on the state's biannual budget and propose a bill to expand access to mental health resources for residents. It also prevents Libby from voting on or speaking on the House floor about a bill that would add trans inclusion in girls' sports to the state constitution. Her colleagues will vote on the Democrat majority's bill after it passed with a slim simple majority in the House on Thursday, but it needs a two-thirds majority in both chambers before it can go before voters. If passed, it would codify in the state's constitution theMaine Human Rights Act, which protects the rights of transgender athletes to compete for sports teams of the opposite sex. The U.S. Department of Justice fileda lawsuitagainst the state for its ongoing defiance of Trump's Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports executive order. Maine has faced federal pressure in the last two months over its refusal to comply, including two federal investigations, a funding freeze by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and now a lawsuit. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Democrat leadership in the state, led by Gov. Janet Mills, has fought back by filing its own lawsuit against Trump over the funding freeze. Another federal judge has already ruled the USDA must unfreeze the funding. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "title": "As REAL ID rollout approaches, congressional privacy hawks largely silent on concerns",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use Real ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. With PresidentDonald Trumpback in the White House and the final rollout of federalREAL ID requirementsset to take effect in May, many of the loudest privacy advocates in Washington have been largely silent. While privacy-minded lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have spent years blasting the Patriot Act, among other measures, few are raising alarms over the Trump administration's looming implementation of the REAL ID Act — a law passed in 2005 that critics describe as a national identification system. Some of the privacy-hawk lawmakers remaining silent on REAL ID were very vocal when another expansion of the national security surveillance apparatus came about – the Patriot Act of 2001 – but not so when the U.S. is only days away from REAL ID implementation. Sens. Edward Markey, D-Mass., Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., were all in Congress when the Patriot Act faced ultimately-successful renewal in 2010s and when the 2020 bill amending and reauthorizing the related Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court came up for a vote. ‘MASS SURVEILLANCE’: CONSERVATIVES SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP ADMIN'S REAL ID ROLLOUT REAL ID is going into effect soon.(Getty) \"Congress has a duty to safeguard Americans’ privacy, but the USA Freedom Reauthorization Act fails to adequately limit the types of information that the government can collect about Americans, and it fails to adequately limit how long the government can keep the information it collects about us,\" Markey said in a 2020 statement objecting to the FISA renewal. \"I am unwilling to grant any president surveillance tools that pose such a high risk to Americans’ civil liberties,\" he said. In 2011, Merkley was one of eight senators who voted to prevent the Patriot Act renewal from even coming to the floor for debate, according toOregon Live. His Beaver State colleague, Wyden, ultimately voted to allow debate, but said on the Senate floor during such discourse that it needs to be potentially reconsidered. WHAT IS REAL ID? DEADLINE APPROACHES FOR NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS REQUIRED TO FLY DOMESTICALLY \"The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago during a period of understandable fear,\" Wyden said at the time. \"Now is the time to revisit this… and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty.\" Merkley expressed concern at the time about the Patriot Act’s ability to let law enforcement collect many types of personal data like emails and phone records. In order to get a REAL ID, licensees must provide their Social Security number and other documentation. While the REAL ID implementation was delayed 20 years by several factors including COVID-19, Merkley cast a \"protest vote\" at the time of the Patriot Act renewal that a four-year extension of the post-9/11 act was being put forth without sufficient time for debate. In 2005, Wyden also gave aSenate floor speechopposing the first reauthorization of the Patriot Act. Markey did not respond to multiple requests for comment, left at his Washington and Boston offices. Merkley also did not respond to a request for comment. BLUE STATES RALLIED FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO OBTAIN DRIVER'S LICENSES AHEAD OF TRUMP'S REAL ID CRACKDOWN A representative for Wyden acknowledged Fox News Digital’s comment request, but said the Oregonian was traveling and holding town halls with constituents back home and could not be immediately reached. On his senatorial webpage, Wyden offered a rundown of all his comprehensive actions in favor of privacy, as well as \"le[ading] the fight to address the Intelligence Community’s reliance on secret interpretations of surveillance law.\" \"When the American people find out how their government has secretly interpreted the Patriot Act, they will be stunned and they will be angry,\" he said in 2011. Wyden was also outraged in 2013 when the NSA was found to be secretly interpreting the act to collect personal data of millions of Americans without a warrant. In a statement to Fox News Digital on privacy concerns with REAL ID, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said REAL IDs rightly \"make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.\" \"Eighty-one percent of air travelers [already] hold REAL ID-compliant or acceptable IDs,\" McLaughlin said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"DHS will continue to collaborate with state, local, and airport authorities to inform the public, facilitate compliance, curb wait times and prevent fraud.\" Fox News also reached out for comment to a bipartisan series of lawmakers who have been party to pro-privacy bills or taken pro-privacy stances in the past, including Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital. He joined Fox News in 2013 as a writer and production assistant.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in her weekly briefing that the Trump administration will go after those who don't repay the loans instead of placing the burden on taxpayers. \"The government can and will collect defaulted federal student loan debt by withholding money from borrowers, tax refunds, federal pensions and even their wages,\" she said.

The student loan portfolio is nearly $1.6 trillion, Leavitt said, with fewer than four out of ten borrowers up to speed with their loans. Altogether, the official said that there are 4 million borrowers who are in the late-stage delinquency stage on payments, meaning that they are between 91 days and 180 days late on payments. \"This is unsustainable, unfair and a huge liability for American taxpayers. Debt cannot be wiped away. It just ends up getting transferred to others,\" she said. \"So why should Americans who didn't go to college, or went to college and responsibly paid back their loans, pay for the student loans of other Americans?

Justices Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor snapped at each other during Tuesday's arguments over parental rights in LGBTQ curriculum after the liberal justice attempted to jump back into the questioning as Alito was speaking. The short quarrel happened as the high court listened to arguments in Mahmoud v.

Sotomayor just tried to disagree with Alito's portrayal and Alito pushed back and asked to allow him to finish,\" Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley observed on X. Sotomayor initially asked Mahmoud attorney Eric Baxter about a particular book titled \"Uncle Bobby’s Wedding\" that included a same-sex relationship storyline and whether exposure to same-sex relationships in children’s books could be considered coercion.

Sotomayor continued with her line of questioning to further clarify Baxter's objection to the books. Baxter stated, \"Our objections would be even to reading books that violate our client's religious beliefs.\" Alito then jumped in with additional questions related to the book. \"I've read that book as well as a lot of these other books,\" Alito began. \"Do you think it's fair to say that all that is done in 'Uncle Bobby's Wedding' is to expose children to the fact that there are men who marry other men?\" Baxter objected to Alito's question. Alito then said that while the book \"has a clear message and a lot of people think it's a good message,\" some with \"traditionalreligious beliefsdon't agree with\" it. As Alito continued with his explanation, Sotomayor jumped in. \"What a minute. The reservation is—\" Sotomayor began.

Iran has carried out 1,051 state executions sincePresident Masoud Pezeshkiantook office on July 8, 2024 – a surge that security experts say the U.S. must weigh as it resumes nuclear negotiations with Tehran. The figure, reported to Fox News Digital by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), represents a more than 20% increase from the number of Iranians killed in 2023, which saw853 Iranians executedby the regime. In his race for the presidency, Pezeshkian aligned himself with moderates and reformists angry with the regime following the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini and the subsequent protests.

But executions targeting those arrested for drug-related offenses, dissents and those involved in the 2022 protestshave only increased– including the increased killings of women and those who were minors at the time of their alleged offense. \"Such levels of savagery and brutality reflect the deadly deadlock in which the ruling religious fascism in Iran is trapped,\" the NCRI said in a statement on Monday. \"[Supreme Leader of Iran Ali] Khamenei is desperately trying to prevent a nationwide uprising and the inevitable overthrow of his regime through executions and killings.\" Amnesty Internationalreported earlier this monththat girls as young as 9 years old can be sentenced to execution, while for boys it starts at age 15.

    "title": "The long line of the papacy: Francis' death renews focus on the church's most powerful figures",
    "article_text": "Cardinal Timothy Dolan speaks from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on the death of Pope Francis. There have been 266papal leadersof the Catholic Church since Jesus Christ’s death in the AD 30s through Pope Francis – Jorge Mario Bergoglio – who died on Easter Monday at 88. The most prominent pope is considered to be St. Peter, the first holder of the title. Christ had appointed him the inaugural Bishop of Rome, and the papal church – St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City – is named in his honor. St. Peter’s writings to persecuted people in the Asia Minor region are also chronicled in the New Testament’s epistles. Pope Francis appears on the central lodge of St. Peter's Basilica to bestow the Urbi et Orbi blessing at the end of the Easter Mass presided over by Cardinal Angelo Comastri in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican on Sunday, April 20, 2025.(Gregorio Borgia/AP) ITALIAN PM MELONI VISITS POPE FRANCIS Peter reportedly died around 64 and was succeeded by Pope Linus. In the present day, there is wide agreement across the Catholic world that one of the most recent popes, John Paul II, deserves to be in consideration as the most influential pontiff. John Paul II was also the first non-Italian pope since Pope Adrian in the 1500s. Born Karol Wojtyla in Poland, John Paul’s lengthy three decades in the Vatican were marked with very prominent situations for the Catholic Church. John Paul IIoversaw the movement into the digital age, but he continued to be a prolific writer. He revised the Canon Laws for the church, wrote more than a dozen encyclicals, apostolic exhortations, nearly 50 apostolic letters and several books, as chronicled by Father William Saunders in his cataloging of \"great\" popes. While Pope John Paul II has not officially been dubbed John Paul the Great, there is wide consensus that one day he will be. MORE ABOUT POPE FRANCIS' MEDICAL CONDITION John Paul notably held a Mass praying for God’s forgiveness for the past sins of the Catholic Church itself and made more than 100 state visits, which included engaging with non-Christians,Saunders wrote in Catholic Answers. One of those visits featured the pope offering Mass to 80,000 people at Yankees Stadium in The Bronx, New York in 1979. Only a few popes – Leo I, Gregory I and Nicholas I – have been given the moniker \"the great.\" In the 400s, Pope Leo met with Attila the Hun and prevented a siege of Rome, though the Vandals took it over later. Pope Gregory I was the Catholic leader who in the late 500s stylized \"Gregorian Chant\" – a tradition still present in many Catholic churches today. Born wealthy, Gregory I later gave up his riches and moved into a monastery and aided the poor. FLASHBACK: POPE JOHN PAUL II ELECTED Gregory was considered the treasurer of Rome, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, which chronicles his efforts to prevent sieges from groups like the Lombards. He also repaired Roman infrastructure, sought détente with the Lombards and Gauls and enforced government laws he personally disagreed with and protested against – explaining that he did his duty to obey [Emperor Maurice] while not \"restrain[ing] what ought to be said on God’s behalf.\" Pope Nicholas became pontiff in the mid 800s. He notably urged against the attempt by a king to divorce his wife and marry another woman. He also believed the Holy See was the head of the Catholic Church and urged the \"supremacy of Rome,\" according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. Other popes may not have been monikered \"the great\" but have had lasting impact on the world and society. One such pontiff was Pope Gregory XIII. Pope Francis meets President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump at the Apostolic Palace on May 24, 2017, in Vatican City.(Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Purported miscalculations in the Julian calendar spurred Gregory XIII to decree a new calendar in 1582 – as the spring equinox had fallen back to early March over a span of 1,400 years. On Oct. 4, 1582, Gregory XIII ordered the next day be considered Oct. 15, not Oct. 5 – therefore fixing the lunar discrepancy. By the end of the 16th century, most Western lands had come around to following the new \"Gregorian calendar.\" Another historically influential pontiff was Pope Innocent III. Around 1200, Innocent III launched several \"Crusades\" against Muslim-held lands in what is now France, Spain and Portugal, as well as an effort to take back the historic Holy Land near today’s Israel and Jordan. He also extended his power into personal affairs, ordering King Philip of France to return to his separated wife. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The most recent pope, Francis, was considered influential in that he was one of few to delve more into the political sphere than past pontiffs. In 2015, Francis published the first papal encyclical to be focused on the environment: Laudato Si.

The church here should be paid attention to.\" \"I think it’s been very significant,\" he added. Gabrielli asserts that Pope Francis was playing \"a long time\" with theCatholic Churchby expanding its own broader geographical reach. \"The church is growing most rapidly in Africa, and we don't think about that as much in the Northern Hemisphere,\" he said. \"Resources for the future of the church are in those places.\" THEOLOGIAN ON ‘CONCLAVE’ ACCURACY, EXPECTATIONS FOR NEXT SECRETIVE EVENT AFTER POPE FRANCIS' DEATH Pope Francis traveled to areas of the world where popes didn't often visit.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) In 2017, Pope Francis convened a Synodal Assembly, a gathering of bishops, to discuss the Amazon region and climate change, which was a focus during his sovereignty. \"It strikes me as Pope Francis saying, ‘Hey, this region that is largely seen as a suppository of resources, whatever we can exploit from this great lush region, well, there’s a church operating there. There are people living there who we don’t pay much attention to,’\" Gabrielli said. \"That is in tune with his emphasis on economic exploitation,\" he added.

Still, Feely believes he's a \"uniter\" ahead of what’s expected to be a competitive midterm cycle as Republicans have an extremely narrow majority in the House. \"I think one of the things from a Republican perspective is we haven't stayed united. Democrats stay united even when they completely disagree on issues. They're a united front. And I give Speaker Johnson a lot of credit right now because he has kept this since President Trump was sworn into office.

U.S. Attorney GeneralPam Bondion Tuesday hosted Cabinet officials from across the Trump administration for the first meeting of a new interagency task force aimed at eradicating \"anti-Christian bias\" within the federal government. During Tuesday's meeting, Bondi described the task force as one aimed at remedying the \"abuse\" under the Biden-led Justice Department and at other federal agencies prior to Trump's second presidential term. \"As President Donald Trump has stated, the Biden administration engaged in an egregious pattern of targeting peaceful Christians while ignoring violent, anti-Christian offenses,\" Bondi told a small group of reporters. \"The president is right.\" FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS HALT TO TRUMP ADMIN'S CFPB TERMINATIONS U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi hosted Cabinet officials from across the Trump administration for the first meeting of a new interagency task force aimed at eradicating \"anti-Christian bias\" within the federal government.(OLIVER CONTRERAS/AFP via Getty Images) Bondi was joined Tuesday by a long list ofsenior Cabinet officialsfrom across the federal government, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, FBI Director Kash Patel, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Other senior agency officials were also present. Bondi also used the meeting to highlight some of the actions the Trump administration has taken to crack down on anti-Christian biases. To date, the Justice Department has dropped three ongoing cases against pro-lifers and \"redefined the FACE Act\" to help protect against what Bondi and others have described as the weaponization of pro-life groups and others.

It's the cornerstone of our American memory,\" Bondi said. \"It guarantees every citizen the right to speak freely, worship freely, and live according to their conscience without government interference. Protecting Christians from bias is not favoritism. It's upholding the rule of law and fulfilling the constitutional promise.\" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the group planned to use the meeting to hear from individuals who had been harmed as a result of \"anti-Christian sentiment\" under the Biden administration, and the various ways this bias may have shown up in their departments or agencies. That part of the meeting was closed to the press.

The officials in attendance did not immediately answer the question, and Justice Department officials told Fox News and other reporters present that they would circulate more information after the meeting. Trump first created the task force via an executive order in February, with the goal of rooting out \"anti-Christian targeting and discrimination\" within the government. The president also selected Bondi to head up the task force — whom he praised as someone he trusted to \"fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society.\" The task force's first meeting comes just days after Politico reported that the Trump administration sent an internal cable to State Department employeesordering them to report any instancesof coworkers displaying \"anti-Christian bias\" as part of the task force initiative.

    "article_text": "Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Penn., weighs in on the Trump administration’s immigration strategy along with the potential implementation of a 40% tax bracket for millionaires. Rep. Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, is supporting the White House'sproposed tax hikefor people making more than $1 million. \"I believe we must help the President deliver on his promise of a tax and regulatory plan that supports pro-American economic and manufacturing growth, and delivers for the vast majority of Americans – while creating savings and promoting fiscal responsibility. Any adjustments in taxes to accomplish these goals should be considered,\" Meuser told Fox News Digital in a statement on Tuesday. Last week,White Houseaides began quietly floating a proposal toHouse Republicansthat would raise the tax rate to 40% for Americans making more than $1 million, sources told Fox News Digital about the preliminary discussions. The plan would shore up income to fund President Donald Trump's ambitious campaign promises to eliminate taxes on overtime, tips and Social Security. On Thursday, Meuser said on \"Mornings with Maria\" that he suggested a less than 2% tax hike for the \"wealthy, high-end income\" tax bracket months ago. He noted that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the top tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, so raising it to 38.6% would still keep it below the pre-TCJA level by nearly one percentage point.

We’re fighting for all of America and for the job creators that might be in those categories. So, if you were to bring it up by 1 point, it brings $15 billion in revenues, right?

So, if it did come up to 39[%], it’s almost $25 billion,\" Meuser said, touting the billions in revenue that a small tax hike could reap for the economy.

Rep. Dan Meuser(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/File) \"The president is determined not to have a standard – and this is my view, from what I’ve based upon him, I’m not putting in words in his mouth – a standard Republican-style budget. What he wants to see is something that is in the interest of all America, middle-income America, small businesses, and by the way, we would be talking about an exemption for pass-through small businesses so they would not be paying at the higher rate, as they do now, at their income level rate,\" Meuser said. While Meuser has indicated his warmth to the idea of tax hikes for the ultra-wealthy, other conservatives have remained steadfast in their rejection of any tax increases. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,told Fox News Digitallast week that tax cuts are \"what Republicans are good at\" as he urged his fellow Republicans to protect tax cuts for working-class Americans who fuel Trump's base.

    "article_text": "Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski sounds off on why he made the decision to have his office begin assisting ICE with immigration enforcement \"It's just doing the right thing.\" That's how Portage County, Ohio Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski summed up for Fox News Digital his decision to buck the trend of local leaders vowing to resist theTrump administration’s deportation effortsby allowing his deputies to assist ICE with immigration enforcement. While many state and local leaders have doubled down on their support forundocumented migrantsand pledged to resist theTrump administration’sdeportation efforts, Zuchowski has gone in the exact opposite direction. Zuchowski has entered his northeastern Ohio sheriff's office into what is called a 287(g) agreement with ICE, which will allow several of his deputies to be \"dual commissioned\" to enforce immigration law in addition to their regular law enforcement duties. Portage County joins just two other counties in Ohio — Butler and Seneca — that have agreed to assist with immigration enforcement by signing onto the 287(g) program. According to Zuchowski, the agreement allows his deputiesto make immigration arrestsand to more efficiently coordinate with ICE to get criminal illegal aliens off the streets. NEW MEXICO JUDGE RESIGNS AFTER ALLEGED TDA MEMBER ARRESTED AT HIS HOME Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski spoke to Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.(Portage County Sheriff's Office/ICE) Despite all the controversy surrounding his decision, Zuchowski saw it as an obvious choice. \"People expect — there is an expectation that law enforcement is going to keep them safe and we're going to do it by whatever means we have available to us,\" he explained. \"There's nobody, and I don't care what party you are, that wants anybody criminal, whether they're here legally or not, roaming around in their county and their communities. So, that's all we've done,\" he added. \"At the end of the day, it's just doing the right thing.\" Zuchowski, himself a former deputy sheriff, said that in the past, deputies would have to wait hours or even days for ICE to be able to pick up a criminal illegal alien. During theBiden administration, he said that he was even told that unless the illegal criminal had \"severed heads\" in the back of their vehicle or had committed some extreme heinous crime, ICE agents could not even come to check on the illegal.

    "article_text": "Vince Fong blames the blue state's policies for issues in the energy sector, which could impact consumer prices. Rep. Vince Fong, R-Calif., is one of the many voices sounding the alarm about a recent oil refinery closure announcement having a greater impact on American wallets. Valero Energy Corp. announced that it will likely close its Benicia refinery nearSan Franciscoin April 2026, putting more than 400 jobs in jeopardy. \"We understand the impact that this may have on our employees, business partners, and community, and will continue to work with them through this period,\" Lane Riggs, board chair, CEO and president of Valero, said in a news release on April 16. Fong said the state’senergy policiesare making it tough for the industry to survive. CALIFORNIA CAREER POLITICIAN BARBARA LEE WINS MAYOR RACE IN EMBATTLED OAKLAND (Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images/File) \"This is in addition to other refinery closures that have been announced. So, in totality, what we're looking at is 20% of California's refining capacity disappearing. And that's significant,\" Fong told Fox News Digital in an interview. Valero also operates a refinery in Los Angeles, but the move regarding the Benicia location is seen as a major hit. \"It's a warning that California's fuel supply is in jeopardy, and it's all caused because of [Democrat Gov.] Gavin Newsom's poor energy policies. That's the root cause, and the rigid regulatory environment, all the mandates, all the new regulations that have been put on these refineries, and now it's putting our fuel supply in jeopardy. And this isn't just an energy issue. This is an affordability issue. This is a jobs issue. This is a reliability issue,\" he continued. ALASKA SENATOR LITERALLY SHREDS BIDEN'S ENERGY ORDERS, BOOSTS WH EFFORTS TO LEVERAGE ARCTIC GAS PIPELINE California Gov. Gavin Newsom(AP Photo/José Luis Villegas/File) The Golden State’s policies are major contributors to higher gas prices in the state, according to a recent study by University of Southern California professorMichael Mische. \"California's energy policy is at a breaking point,\"Fong said. \"This is not a market failure. This is because of regulations and mandates that are pushing refineries to close. They can't survive in this and make it economically feasible to function in California. And those who are going to suffer are everyday Californians.\" As the state is a major energy supplier, the congressman said its regulations have occasionally gained bipartisan scrutiny from neighboring Arizona and Nevada. \"This is going to impact California drivers significantly,\"Fong said. \"When there's gasoline shortages, what you're going to see is the price of gasoline go up.

    "title": "The Supreme Court appears to side with parents in religious liberty dispute over storybooks",
    "article_text": "Montgomery County Mom Grace Morrison joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her ongoing legal battle over the lack of opt-out for LGBTQ+ curriculum in schools. The Supreme Court'sconservative majority offered strong support for parents seeking the religious liberty right to be informed about and opt their children out of reading material in elementary schools that they say conflicts with their faith. The Montgomery County, Maryland school board withdrew its original opt-out policy for books related to gender and sexuality, prompting a federal lawsuit. In a marathon two-and-a-half oral argument, the justices debated whether parents have been unfairly burdened in exercising their constitutional rights. It is one of three high-profile religious-themed cases the high court will decide this term—including disputesover tax exemptionsfor religious groups, and taxpayer funding for private religious charter schools—which will be argued next week. GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING Justice Sonia Sotomayor and her liberal colleagues appeared to back the county's position on the storybooks. She noted a lower appeals court had refused a preliminary injunction to temporarily reinstate the opt-out policy. \"They never reached the issue of whether or not there was disruption, or what the motive was for taking away the opt out,\" said Sotomayor. \"What they decided was that there wasn't coercion here, that there was mere exposure. I understood from the record that all that was required is that the books be put on the bookshelf. If that's all that's required, is that coercion?\" But Justice Samuel Alito echoed the views of several of his conservative colleagues, about returning to the previous policy that he said most schools around the country permit. \"What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?\" he asked. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.(Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File) Alito also questioned the content of several of the books raised in the appeal dealing with same-sex marriage. \"I don't think anybody can read that and say: well, this is just telling children that there are occasions when men marry other men,\" said Alito. \"It has a clear moral message, and it may be a good message. It's just a message that a lot of religious people disagree with.\" Hundreds on both sides of the issue rallied outside the court, some carrying signs like \"Let Parents Parent\" and \"Include All Families.\" The suburban Washington county introduced new books with LGBTQ+ characters and themes into the elementary school curriculum in 2022, as part of the district's \"inclusivity\" initiative. PROSECUTION CALLS THEIR SECOND WITNESS AT KAREN READ’S RETRIAL FOR MURDER One of the challenged storybooks raised in the appealsis \"Prince & Knight,\" described as a \"modern fairy tale\" for ages 4-8, of the two males falling in love after working together to battle a dragon threatening their kingdom, and later marrying. Another book mentioned repeatedly in thecourt's public sessionwas \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" about a little girl's reaction to her favorite relative's plans to marry a man. The school district refused to allow parents to opt out of their Grace Morrison is one of the parents petitioning the Supreme Court to rule that a Maryland school district's ban on parental opt-outs is unconstitutional.(Becket/Getty Images) The school district refused to allow parents to opt out of their elementary school from the reading program - the same way older students can forego sex ed instruction. While the school board initially allowed parents to keep their children outof this curriculum, the plaintiffs say officials quickly reversed course, announcing in March 2023 that exceptions would not be granted and that parents would not be notified before the books were introduced into their children's classrooms. Officials cited increased absenteeism as one of the reasons for the change. \"We felt as parents that we would present these things to our children like we always have, when they're ready to receive them. And especially a child with special needs, it's even more difficult for her to understand,\" said Grace Morrison, one of the plaintiffs. She and her husband, both Catholics, now homeschool their daughter, after the school refused an accommodation. \"Starting to present issues of gender ideology to a child like this could be extremely confusing and damaging, let alone to the faith that we're raising her in,\" she told Fox News Digital. A federal appeals court ruled for the school district, concluding educators did not apply any pressure on children to abandon their religious beliefs, and \"simply hearing about other views does not necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differently than one’s religious faith requires.\" State officials told the court that parents who choose to send their children to public school are not \"coerced\" simply by their classroom exposure there to religiously objectionable ideas. The practical feasibility of an opt-out policy at was the key focus of the high court's public session. \"Once we articulate a rule like that,\" said Justice Elena Kagan, \"it would be like, opt outs for everyone.\" SCOTUS HEARS ARGUMENTS OVER PARENTS' FIGHT TO OPT CHILDREN OUT OF LGBTQ CURRICULUM But Kagan also raised concerns about young children being exposed to some of the books offered in Montgomery County. \"I too, was struck by these young kids picture books and, on matters concerning sexuality. I suspect there are a lot of non-religious parents who weren't all that thrilled about this.\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who noted he grew up in the affluent county and still lives there with his wife and two school-age daughters, said he was \"mystified\" at the why the county canceled its original opt-out policy. Some on the bench raised concerns about a sweeping \"a la carte\" discretion parents would have to object to what goes in schools. \"What about a trans student in the classroom?\" said JusticeKetanji Brown Jackson. \"There's a student who's in the class. Must the teacher notify the parents of the student's existence and give them an opt out to not be in the same classroom with this child?\" Dozens of briefs were filed by advocacy groups on both sides of the issue, including competing coalitions of states and lawmakers. Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stands as she and members of the Supreme Court pose for a new group portrait following her addition, at the Supreme Court building in Washington, Oct. 7, 2022.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File ) Many educators say they should be given deference to develop lesson plans that reflect the community at large, and that navigating a flood of individual religious rights claims would make classroom instruction and collaboration extremely problematic. Parents rights and religious groups counter impressionable children should not be forced to participate in reading activities that undermine their families' teachings and spirituality. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, representing the parents who sued, called the school policy \"compelled instruction.\" The Trump administration is backing the parents, saying in a written brief the board's no opt-out policy \"compromises parents’ ability to act consistent with those [religious] beliefs regardless of whether their children feel pressured or coerced by the instruction.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The case is Mahmoud v. Taylor (24-297). A ruling is expected before the court's summer recess in late June. Kristine Parks and Jessica Sonkin contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the the warning from a U.S. admiral of increased military 'rehearsals' by China near Taiwan on ‘Special Report.’ A three-judge appeals panel in Washington, D.C., grilled the Trump administration over its expected implementation of thePentagon's transgender military ban policyand a lower court's finding of animus behind the ban. Judges Cornelia T.L. Pillard, an Obama-appointee, and Trump-appointees Gregory G. Katsas and Neomi Rao presided over Tuesday's oral arguments over an order blocking PresidentDonald Trump’s executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military from going into effect. \"We have a sitting president issuing an executive order that has animus on its face, not directing anyone, any panel of experts, to study this issue, but simply directing the Secretary of Defense to implement a ban on transgender service by transgender persons,\" Pillard told Justice Department attorney Jason Manion. \"And within a month, the Secretary of Defense doing so with no further study other than the Mattis policy.\" FEDERAL JUDGE DENIES TRUMP ADMIN'S EFFORT TO BAN TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM MILITARY A three-judge appeals panel in Washington, D.C. grilled the Trump administration over its expected implementation of the Pentagon's transgender military ban policy and a lower court's finding of animus behind the ban.(Getty) D.C.-based District Judge Ana Reyes had previously blocked the Trump administration from implementing its ban in March, with Reyes writing in her opinion that the order was \"soaked in animus\" and discriminated based on a person's transgender status. Rao asked Manion if the government conceded that there was animus behind the order, to which Manion said they did not. \"The relevant question is whether the policy can be explained by any reason other than animus,\" Manion responded. Counsel for the appellees, Shannon Minter, also focused on the finding of animus by the lower court, arguing that the policy at hand\"does something that is so extraordinarily unusual.\" \"The government openly, just with complete transparency, expressing animosity towards a group of people and relying on that as a justification and the district court properly noted that,\" Minter said. Pillard, who notably asked a majority of the questions, also honed in on the \"irreparable harm\" the government argues it will suffer if the appeals court does not stay Reyes' order. HEGSETH SUGGESTS JUDGE REPORT TO MILITARY BASES AFTER RULING THAT PENTAGON MUST ALLOW TRANSGENDER TROOPS Manion argued that Reyes' order not only affects themilitary's competenceand readiness as the ban is put on pause, but it also conflicts with the president's constitutional powers. Manion argued that the \"main injuries\" include the inability to enforce what the Department believes \"to be a valid policy.\" Pillard responded back, asking why the government has not previously expressed such concerns of military readiness and competence in past years before the policy came about. \"How has the military worked under a different policy?\" Pillard asked. \"It’s striking to me that the government…has not stymied that.\" Katsas specifically asked the government how it expected to go about implementing the policy, asking what procedure would take place \"on the back end when there is a servicemember serving who… is found to have some condition that would have been disqualifying at the exception stage.\" Judges Cornelia T.L.

Is it administrative separation?\" Katsas asked. Manion said he believed some conditions \"undergo an individualized process\" in those situations. Pillard expanded upon this line of questioning, asking if there were any other conditions that did not have to undergoa medical evaluation. Manion said he could not think of any at that moment. \"This is a core area of presidential power,\" Manion said. \"[The military] has determined this will increase readiness and not being able to enact it will harm the military and all of those factors add up to irreparable harm here.\" Minter likewise argued that there is \"no other medical condition that puts a person automatically into separation,\" saying \"every other condition goes into a med process are you able to do your job.\" SKEPTICAL JUDGE QUESTIONS EXECUTIVE ORDER BARRING TRANSGENDER SERVICE MEMBERS FROM JOINING THE MILITARY \"We don’t talk about people with diabetes or heart conditions being dishonest… that’s just a red flag,\" Minter said.

Minter told Fox News Digital after the oral arguments that they were \"encouraged by the argument and hopeful the court will deny the stay.\" \"The plaintiffs in this case are serving with honor and distinction.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commended Zeldin for the trip during the White House press conference on Tuesday, adding that President Donald Trump is committed to having the \"cleanest air and the cleanest water.\" \"I would also add from the president himself, he has always maintained he wants America to have the cleanest air and the cleanest water. And we want to do what's right for our environment and for our earth,\" she said. United States Naval Special Warfare Command is headquartered in San Diego and is also where Navy SEAL candidates complete their arduous six-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. In February, the Department of Defense's inspector general released a report finding that the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses among SEAL candidates between January 2019 and May 2023 alone. \"Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water occurred because (Naval Special Warfare Command) did not follow San Diego County's Beach and Bay Water Quality Program's beach closure postings,\" the inspector general report found. \"As a result of Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water during training, candidates are presented with increased health risks and NAVSPECWARCOM's training mission could be impacted.\" Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) class participate in a surf passage training exercise at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in Coronado, California.(Getty Images) Veterans who spoke to Fox News Digital earlier in April described the contaminated water a national security crisis. \"This is a huge national crisis,\" Navy SEAL vet Jeff Gum, who was sickened by the water when he was working through SEAL training in 2008, told Fox Digital in a Zoom interview. \"Like half the SEAL teams are located in San Diego; the other half are in Virginia Beach. So when you've got half the SEAL teams who are getting exposed to this, then it's a major issue.\" The CEO of VetComm, which advocates for disabled veterans and those navigating the VA's complicated health system, compared the crisis to the Camp Lejeune water crisis. Thousands of Marines and others were sickened at North Carolina's Camp Lejeune base between 1953 and 1987 as a result of water contaminated by industrial solvents used to drink, bathe and cook at the training facilities and on-base housing. Sewage water spills into Playa Blanca beach in the coast of Tijuana, Baja California state, Mexico, on March 21, 2024.(Getty Images) \"This is going to be, in my opinion, the next Camp Lejeune water problem that cost our government $21 to $25 billion,\" VetComm CEO Kate Monroe told Fox Digital earlier in April. \"That's just in the compensation directly, like the lawsuit portion of it. That doesn't cover all the compensation you have to pay these veterans tax-free for the rest of their lives. I would say that this issue here in San Diego, if you look at it over the time that people have been training here, you're looking at another $21 to $25 billion, plus all of the compensation that's going to come. It would be cheaper for our country to fix this than it would to allow it to continue.\" US SENATOR BLASTS PRESIDENT OF MEXICO, SAYS TOXIC SEWAGE DUMP THREATENS ‘NATIONAL SECURITY’ Zeldin first addressed the sewage problem in March before previewing the trip to take the issue head on. \"I was just briefed that Mexico is dumping large amounts of raw sewage into the Tijuana River, and it’s now seeping into the U.S.,\" he posted to X March 8. \"This is unacceptable.Mexico MUST honorits commitments to control this pollution and sewage!\" Local leaders have been sounding the alarm on the sewage problem, including Imperial Beach's Mayor Paloma Aguirre, who sent a letter to Zeldin in March describing how the raw sewage has sparked one of \"America’s most horrendous environmental and public health disasters\" as billions of gallons have polluted the Pacific Ocean since 2023 alone. EPA chief Lee Zeldin traveled to San Diego County over concerns that Mexican officials are not doing enough to address sewage in the Tijuana River that pollutes beaches on the U.S. side of the border.(Getty Images) SAN DIEGO SUBURB FACES 'SEWAGE CRISIS' FROM LOCAL BEACH \"The toxic sewage coming across the border from Mexico into South San Diego County is among America’s most horrendous environmental and public health disasters,\" Aguirre's March 3 letter to Zeldin and published online reads. \"Since 2023, over 31 billion gallons of raw sewage, polluted stormwater and trash have flowed across the Mexican border, down the Tijuana River, through the cities of San Diego and Imperial Beach and into the Pacific Ocean.\" A photo of Mexican sewage flowing into the U.S.(Rob Sweetman) The letter called on Zeldin to assist with the crisis by authorizing a new review of the Lower Tijuana River Valley’s sewage crisis for Superfund designation. The crisis has not only affected Navy SEALs, but also tourism and homeowners, according to the mayor's letter. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our residents, are gettingill due to polluted air,\" the letter stated. \"Workers, including Navy Seals training in the area, have been sickened on the job by waterborne and aerosolized diseases.

    "article_text": "Colten Stanberry, Counsel at Becket says the case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, is \"coming at an opportune moment.\" Counsel representing a coalition of parents fighting for the choice to opt their children out of LGBTQ-related curriculum says the case is about letting parents \"be the parents.\" \"We're just saying if the school board is going to make that decision, let us have the chance to leave the classroom,\" Colten Stanberry, counsel at Becket and attorney for the parents bringing the suit, told Fox News Digital. \"And so I think for my parent clients, they're saying let us be the parents. Keep us involved in the school decision-making process. Don't try to cut us out.\" The Supreme Courtheard oral arguments Tuesday in parents' fight to opt their children out of LGBTQ-related curriculum. The issue at hand in the case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, is whether parents have a right to be informed about and to then opt their children out of reading books in elementary schools that conflict withtheir faith. MARYLAND MOM TAKING FIGHT TO OPT CHILD OUT OF LGBTQ STORY BOOKS BEFORE SUPREME COURT The issue at hand in the case, Mahmoud v. Taylor, is whether parents have a right to be informed about and to then opt their children out of reading books in elementary schools that conflict with their faith.(Becket/Getty Images) \"Our case is not a book ban case,\" Stanberry emphasized. \"We're not saying that these books can't be on the shelves. We're saying we want to be out of the class,\" Stanberry continued. \"And we're also not saying that teachers can't teach this material.\" A coalition of Jewish, Christian and Muslim parents with elementary school children in Montgomery County Public Schoolsin Marylandbrought suit against the school board after it introduced new LGBTQ books into the curriculum as part of the district's \"inclusivity\" initiative. The curriculum change came after the state of Maryland enacted regulations seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" according to the petitioner's brief filed with the high court. The school board introduced books that featured transgender and non-binary characters and storylines, according to the brief. The parents' coalition stated in its brief that the Board \"initially honored parental opt-outs in accordance with its own Guidelines and Maryland law\" after parents raised concerns over the new curriculum. After the board issued a public statement in line with this stance, the petitioners stated that the board \"reversed course\" without prior notice. \"Without explanation, it announced that beginning with the 2023-2024 school year, ‘[s]tudents and families may not choose to opt out’ and will not be informed when ‘books are read,’\" the brief reads. SCOTUS RULINGS THIS TERM COULD STRENGTHEN RELIGIOUS RIGHTS PROTECTIONS, EXPERT SAYS The school board introduced books that featured transgender and non-binary characters and storylines, according to the brief.(Becket) The parents sued the school board, arguing that the denial of notice and opt-outs \"violated the Free Exercise Clause by overriding their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children and by burdening their religious exercise via policies that are not neutral or generally applicable,\" petitioners wrote. The parents cited Wisconsin v. Yoder, a 1972 Supreme Court case, to support their argument. In Yoder, the Court held that a state law requiring children to attend school past eighth grade violated the parents'constitutional rightsunder the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to direct their children's religious upbringings. Stanberry says that while this case is much narrower than Yoder, the issue at hand is \"a right parents have had from the Supreme Court for over 50 years.\" The school board argued in its brief, \"The record contains no evidence that teachers have been or will be ‘directed’ or ‘instructed’ to inject any views about gender or sexuality into classroom discussions about the storybooks.\" The school board writes that the storybooks were \"offered as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or reading groups; or used for read-alouds.\" \"Teachers are not required to use any of the storybooks in any given lesson, and were not provided any associated mandatory discussion points, classroom activities, or assignments,\" the brief continued. The lower court denied the parents' motion, finding that they could not show \"'that the no-opt-out policy burdens their religious exercise.'\" On appeal to the Fourth Circuit, the appeals court affirmed the district court's decision, with the majority holding that the parents had not shown how the policy violated theFirst Amendment. SUPREME COURT APPEARS LIKELY TO SIDE WITH CATHOLIC CHURCH AND TRUMP IN KEY RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION CASE The case comes at a time when President Donald Trump and his administration have prioritized educational and DEI-related reform upon starting his second term.(Getty Images) Despite the lower court proceedings, Stanberry shared they are \"hopeful and excited\" as the high court considers the case. \"We think this court will really consider the case,\" Stanberry said ahead of Tuesday's arguments. \"Obviously, I don't have a crystal ball. I can't predict how it's going to come out, but we're feeling good going into it.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, the school board said its policy \"is grounded in our commitment to provide an appropriate classroom environment for all of our students,\" saying the board believes \"a curriculum that fosters respect for people of different backgrounds does not burden the free exercise of religion.\" \"Based on established law, as discussed in our brief and by our counsel at today’s argument, we believe the Supreme Court can and should affirm the lower courts’ rulings,\" Liliana López,Public Information Officer for the public schools, said. \"Regardless of the outcome, we are grateful for the opportunity to have our case heard by the highest court in the land. We await the Court's decision.\" The case comes at a time when PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration have prioritized educational and DEI-related reform upon starting his second term.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think that this case could be seen as people of faith coming forward and saying, 'Hey, we want to be accommodated in this pluralistic society.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., referred former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomoto President Donald Trump's Justice Department for criminal prosecution. Cuomo – the Democratic scion now considered thecurrent frontrunnerin the New York City Democratic mayoral primary in June – was first referred to the Biden Justice Department for criminal prosecution in October 2024. Former Rep. Brad Wenstrup, then-chairman of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, said Cuomo made \"multiple criminally false statements\" to Congress about his handling of the 2020 COVID-19 nursing home death scandal. In a new letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday, Comer said \"to our knowledge, the Biden Administration ignored this referral despite clear facts and evidence.\" He requested that Bondi review the referral and \"take appropriate action.\" ANDREW CUOMO DENIED ALMOST $3 MILLION IN PUBLICLY MATCHING FUNDS FOR MAYORAL BID, CITES 'SOFTWARE ERROR' Gov.

Let’s be clear: lying to Congress is a federal crime. Mr. Cuomo must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The House Oversight Committee is prepared to fully cooperate with the Justice Department’s investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s actions and ensure he’s held to account.\" Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Cuomo's spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, dismissed Comer's letter as \"nothing more than a meritless press release that was nonsense last year and is even more so now.\" \"As the DOJ constantly reminds people, this kind of transparent attempt at election interference and law-fare violates their own policies,\" Azzopardi said. \"Referrals like these – which have been also made against Planned Parenthood, Hillary Clinton and Anthony Fauci – don’t have to be resubmitted with a new administration, so the only point to doing this is politics.\" Mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo arrives to attend a Sunday service at First Corinthian Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City on April 13, 2025.(Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images) NEW YORK REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN MAKES 7-FIGURE CAMPAIGN HAUL, AIMS TO FLIP DISTRICTS TO RED IN 2026 The Cuomo administration issued a directive on March 25, 2020, mandating that nursing homes admit or re-admit potentially COVID-19 positive patients \"while simultaneously prohibiting nursing homes from testing these patients before admission or re-admission,\" Wenstrup wrote to former Attorney General Merrick Garland in October. The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) issued a subsequent report on July 6, 2020, titled \"Factors Associated with Nursing Home Infections and Fatalities in New York State During the COVID-19 Global Health Crisis.\" The report alleged nursing home staff – not the March 25 directive – caused excess COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. Comer said witness testimony and new documents revealed in the select subcommittee’s referral showed Cuomo \"personally drafted and edited portions of this purportedly independent and peer-reviewed report.\" New York state Attorney GeneralLetitia Jamessaid in a January 2021 investigative report of her own that the Cuomo administration may have undercounted the total number of nursing home deaths by as much as 50% Photos of seniors who died during the COVID-19 pandemic in nursing homes are displayed as family members attend a memorial event on March 23, 2025, in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City.(Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images) The select subcommittee launched its investigation in May 2023. It issued a subpoena for Cuomo's testimony in March 2024 after months of delays. Cuomo sat for a transcribed interview on June 11, 2024. He later testified in front of the select subcommittee on Sept. 10, 2024. Wenstrup noted that Cuomo claimed he was neither involved in the drafting nor the review of the July 6 report. Cuomo also testified that he did not have any discussions about the July 6 Report being peer-reviewed and that he did not know whether the July 6 report was reviewed by persons outside the NYSDOH. On all three accounts, Wenstrup said documents obtained by the select subcommittee demonstrate Cuomo's statements to be false.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is known to have a direct impact on heart attack and stroke risk — but a new study has revealed its surprising link tobrain health. In a large, randomized trial, researchers led by First Hospital of China Medical University discovered that \"intensive blood pressure control\" resulted in a 15% reduced dementia risk among participants and a 16% reduced risk of cognitive impairment. The study included 33,995 people in rural China aged 40 or older who had \"uncontrolled hypertension.\" 7 BLOOD PRESSURE MISTAKES THAT COULD BE THROWING OFF YOUR READINGS The participants were divided into two groups. One received \"usual care,\" while the other was assigned to \"trained non-physician community healthcare providers\" who prescribed \"titrated antihypertensive medications.\" Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is known to have a direct impact on heart attack and stroke risk — but a new study has revealed its surprising link to brain health.(iStock) For the latter group, the medications helped them achieve a systolic blood pressure goal of <130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure goal of <80 mm Hg, according to the study findings in Nature Medicine. \"The primary outcome ofall-cause dementiawas significantly lower in the intervention group than in the usual care group,\" the researchers wrote. They were also less likely to experience \"serious adverse events.\" HEALTH BOOST AND DEMENTIA PREVENTION IN JUST 5 MINUTES A DAY This was one of the first large-scale, randomized, controlled effectiveness trials to demonstrate a \"significant reduction in all-cause dementia associated with lowering blood pressure,\" the researchers concluded.

    "article_text": "Rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani shares strategies for preventing what a new study projects will be a prevalence of Parkinson's disease on 'America Reports.' With around one million people living withParkinson’s diseasein the U.S. — and 90,000 getting new diagnoses each year — the race is on for a cure. Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) have announced progress on that front — they have developed a new therapy that uses stem cells to treat advanced Parkinson’s. In the phase 1 trial, the researchers used donated stem cells (taken from early-stage embryos) to create nerve cells (neurons) and transplanted them into the brains of 12 Parkinson’s patients, according to a press release from MSK. NEW DRUG FOR PARKINSON’S SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CLINICAL TRIALS: 'VERY ENCOURAGED' Once the cells are injected, they produce dopamine, a hormone in the brain that helps with movement and coordination. (One of the hallmarks of Parkinson’s is low levels of dopamine, which causes the typical symptoms of tremors, stiffness, balance issues and difficulty walking.) Around one million people are living with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S., with 90,000 getting new diagnoses each year.(iStock) After 18 months, the injected cells had \"taken hold in the brain with no serious side effects,\" the researchers reported. Based on the MDS-UPDRS — a ratings scale for symptoms developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society — the participants experienced \"noticeable improvements,\" especially the group that received ahigher dose. Patients in the high-dose group reported 2.7 hours of additional \"on time\" each day. \"Neurologists say things usually get a little bit worse every year with this disease, meaning the score goes up by a few points,\" study co-author Lorenz Studer, MD, director of MSK’s Center for Stem Cell Biology, said in the press release. \"In our study, not only did the score not get worse, it dropped by more than 20 points in the high-dose group.\" The researchers used donated stem cells (taken from early-stage embryos) to create nerve cells (neurons) and transplanted them into the brains of 12 Parkinson’s patients.(iStock) On average, patients in the high-dose group reported 2.7 hours of additional \"on time\" — indicating periods of normal functioning with minimal symptoms — \"a result that could be quite meaningful for their everyday life,\" Studer noted. Given the success of the phase 1 trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval for the researchers to go straight to aphase 3 clinical trialin a much larger patient group — around 100 people — which will take place in the first half of 2025. The findings were published in the journal Nature. PARKINSON’S CASES COULD DOUBLE GLOBALLY BY 2050, STUDY REVEALS \"The study showed that developing specific nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells in the lab, then injecting them in the brain of people with Parkinson’s disease, is safe and holds significant promise as apossible future treatment,\" lead study author Viviane Tabar, MD, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told Fox News Digital. \"The findings were rewarding, as this work is more than a dozen years in the making.\" Dr. Mary Ann Picone, medical director of the MS Center at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, said that cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease could offer potential for not only slowing disability, but also stopping progression and bringing about improvement in motor function. \"Although there is risk involved in the immune suppression necessary before thestem cell implantationand the procedure itself, it would be a major step forward in replacing the dopaminergic neurons lost in the disease,\" Picone, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Levodopa, currently the first-line treatment for Parkinson’s, is limited in that patients need greater dosage amounts as time goes on, according to Picone — \"and regulating off and on periods of either stiffness or dyskinesias (uncontrolled muscle movements) becomes more difficult.\" After 18 months, the injected cells had \"taken hold in the brain with no serious side effects,\" the researchers reported.(iStock) Dr. Ann Murray, director of movement disorders at WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute in West Virginia, referred to the study as \"unbelievably exciting\" for Parkinson’s patients. \"Although the goal of this particular research project was to ensure safety, getting that significant clinical improvement in the UPDRS is absolutely groundbreaking,\" Murray told Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Former NFL wide receiver told Fox News Digital what he thinks about Travis Hunter's position fit at the pro level ahead of the NFL Draft this week. NFL prospectTravis Hunteris projected to play both wide receiver and cornerback in the pros, as he did in college. But some experts have questioned the validity of a player excelling at both positions at the pro level. A player who came close to Hunter's aspirations in the NFL is his former University of Colorado and Jackson State head coachDeion Sanders. Sanders was known almost entirely as an elite cornerback during his pro career, but also played wide receiver at rare times, mostly during the Dallas Cowboys' 1996 season. Now, former NFL wide receiver and three-time Super Bowl champion Ed McCaffrey thinks Hunter should follow a similar blueprint to Sanders. McAffrey believes Hunter is more valuable as a cornerback, and doesn't expect Hunter to play every down on offense and defense in the pros, which Hunter often did in college.

Maybe for a game or once in a while you could play a significant number of snaps in the NFL, but long-term, I don't think you can hold up,\" McCaffrey said. \"It's different in college when you're significantly better and more physically gifted than the guys you're going up against. When you get to the NFL, there isn't as much of a gap in talent.\" McCaffrey also didn't rule out the possibility of Hunter focusing on wide receiver either, but suggested Hunter's mechanics are more refined as a cornerback, currently. \"Could he play receiver? Absolutely, he's athletic enough to do it.

TheTennessee Titanshave made clear their intentions with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, at least when it comes to keeping it or not. There has been speculation the Titans could trade out of position to kick offthe draftin Green Bay this Thursday. However, GM Mike Borgonzi said the team is staying put. \"We’ve come to a consensus,\" he said. \"We’ll pick at No. 1 on Thursday night.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tennessee Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi speaks during the NFL Scouting Combine at the Indiana Convention Center.(Kirby Lee-Imagn Images) TheNFL Networkreported Tuesday that the Titans \"never opened the door\" to trade possibilities. Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns, who choose second overall, and the New York Giants, who follow them at No. 3, are doing their due diligence by taking calls for potential trades. With Borgonzi saying it is a \"consensus\" move to keep the top overall selection, it appears the front office is aligned with where they want to go. And all signs point to a quarterback. Miami’s Cam Ward has been the pick in virtually every mock draft by experts and fans alike, and it makes sense considering the team’s current quarterback situation. Will Levis, the team’s second-round pick in 2023, has not panned out over the past two seasons, and Tennessee brought in free agents Brandon Allen and Tim Boyle to compete this preseason. However, neither of the three are strong starting options for a squad that has good offensive weapons inCalvin Ridley, Tony Pollard and more, with head coach Brian Callahan leading the way. With better quarterback play, the Titans could compete in the AFC South immediately. Miami Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward(Sam Navarro-Imagn Images) Ward had a tremendous year with the Hurricanes last season after transferring from Washington State. The team went 10-3 under his leadership, completing 67.2% of his passes and leading the ACC with 39 touchdown passes while throwing only seven interceptions. Ward’s confidence has been through the roof during the pre-draft process, constantly reiterating his belief that he’s the best quarterback in this class.

TheTennessee Titansare reportedly not going to trade the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft ahead of the first round on Thursday. The Titans had teams interested, but according toNFL Network, they \"never opened the door\" to moving out of the top pick. It is widely expected that the Titans will select Miami quarterback Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick to begin the draft. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Detailed view of the Tennessee Titans helmet during a game against the Saints at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Aug. 25, 2024.(Stephen Lew-USA Today Sports) Ward transferred from Washington Stateto Miamibefore the 2024 season, and he had a great season in his lone year with the Hurricanes. Miami went 10-3 last season, and Ward was sensational. He completed 67.2% of his passes for 4,313 yards, and he led the ACC with 39 passing touchdowns while throwing seven interceptions. Ward has hinted that he will be selected with the top pick in theNFL Draft. While playing Fortnite in a livestream, he mentioned a few Titans’ players as among the best in the league at their position.

He completed 63.1% of his passes for 2,091 yards and threw 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. As Levis continued to struggle, it became apparent that they would be in the market for a quarterback this offseason.

    "article_text": "Archaeologists in Brussels, Belgium, recently came across the remnants of an old cemetery located in a busy part of the city. The remains date back to the Middle Ages. (Source: @mijnmivb via Facebook) Hundreds of skeletonswere recently uncovered by archaeologists while they were excavating a British university's property – the discovery a complete surprise. The skeletons, along with an ancient church, were found on the school's City Campus property, which was acquired by the university in 2021. The University of Gloucestershire announced the discovery in an April 11 press release. The City Campus property, which formerly housed a department store, is expected to open this year. DOZENS OF ANCIENT SKELETONS FOUND IN HEART OF BUSTLING CITY: 'HARD TO IMAGINE' The university commissioned the archaeological organization Cotswold Archaeology to excavate the location – and it was in this area that the medieval church was found. The ruined structure was identified as St. Aldate’s Church, which was demolished in the mid-1650s. It dated back to the Middle Ages. Archaeologists found hundreds of skeletons while excavating the City Campus property of the University of Gloucestershire in the U.K.(University of Gloucestershire) The excavators found \"limestone and brick foundations, along with around 83 brick-lined burial vaults both within the church itself and in the associated burial ground,\" according to the press release. \"Approximately 150 post-medieval burials, not contained in burial vaults, were identified in the courtyard,\" the statement continued. \"Deeper excavations revealed approximately 170 earlier burials, the majority of which are provisionally thought to relate to the medieval church.\" EXPERTS SHOCKED BY ANCIENT KING ARTHUR MANUSCRIPT FOUND TUCKED INSIDE BOOK: 'SURVIVED THE CENTURIES' In total, 317 skeletons and 83 brick burial vaults were uncovered and carefully excavated. The discovery came as a complete shock to archaeologists, who were unaware of the church or its burial ground.

    "title": "Insurance data breach exposes sensitive info of 1.6 million people",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it’s that you should never take a company’s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed. Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don’t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773. Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals. The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed. A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH The company says the forensic investigation is still ongoing and that the total number of affected individuals may continue to rise. Personalized notification letters are being mailed out in phases, detailing exactly what type of data was compromised in each case. \"Landmark began reviewing the affected systems to identify the specific individuals and the types of information that may have been compromised,\"reads the latest notice. \"While this process remains ongoing, Landmark will notify affected individuals by mail as the information becomes available.\" To help mitigate the fallout, Landmark is offering 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. The notice also advises recipients to monitor their credit reports and consider placing fraud alerts or a security freeze for extra protection. A dedicated helpline is available for 90 days after notification to address questions and concerns. A man working on his laptop and scrolling on his phone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it’s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself. 1) Consider identity theft protection services:Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it’s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it’s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. 2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. 3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification. 4) Use personal data removal services:The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 5) Have strong antivirus software:Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you’re not without defenses. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 6) Enable two-factor authentication:While passwords weren’t part of the data breach, you still need to enabletwo-factorauthentication(2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data. WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark’s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public’s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.

    "title": "Discover the world’s first hydrogen outboard engine-powered boat",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson talks about how Yamaha’s hydrogen outboard motor could revolutionize boating with zero emissions. ​​Imagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That’s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They’re developing the world’s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable. This is part of Yamaha’s big plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using a mix of electric, alternative fuels and now hydrogen technology. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha’s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it’s fueled by gaseous hydrogen. Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who’s been deeply involved in the project, called it \"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly. Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen’s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version. The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that’s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha’s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications. Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There’s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot. Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises. Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS HIT THE ROADS IN GEORGIA Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They’ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They’re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient. Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn’t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges. And it’s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they’re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies. Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we’re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We’re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\" SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Yamaha’s hydrogen outboard project is about rethinking how we power our boats in a way that’s safe, practical and sustainable. While there’s still work to do, this collaboration is making real progress toward cleaner waters and greener adventures. If hydrogen can take off in boating, it could change the game for the entire marine industry.

    "title": "UN marks Holocaust Remembrance Day by redefining the Holocaust, comparing Israelis to Nazis",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. On Thursday, April 24th, the State of Israel and Jews around the world mark Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day.  At the very same time, to paraphrase U.S. U.N. Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the United Nations has unleashed a great evil upon the world: Holocaust revisionism. To begin with, there is a concerted campaign to sever any connection between theHolocaustand Israel. Yom HaShoah was created by the State of Israel in April 1955. But on April 21, 2025, the United Nations commemorated Yom HaShoah by holding an event at United Nations headquarters inNew York Citywithout any input or invitation to participate by anyone from Israel. Organized and hosted by the U.N. Department of Global Communications, Israel was never mentioned. ROSE GIRONE, OLDEST LIVING HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR, DIES AT 113 Moreover, now hanging on the wall of U.N. Headquarters outside the Security Council chamber is a \"Holocaust\" exhibit that has wiped any reference to Israel, even in sections on \"after the Holocaust,\" \"the Aftermath,\" and \"remembrance.\" The Holocaust was the fate of the Jews in the absence ofIsrael. The majority of survivors returned to their ancient homeland.  As the embodiment of Jewish self-determination, Israel is the ultimate hope and commitment to \"never again.\" Survivors of the Auschwitz concentration camp walk by the main gate bearing the motto \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" at the former Auschwitz I site on January 27, 2020, in Oswiecim, Poland. International leaders as well as approximately 200 survivors and their families are gathering at Auschwitz today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation. The Nazis killed an estimated one million people at the camp during the World War II occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany.(Omar Marques/Getty Images) The U.N.’s omission of Israel is not an oversight. It is part of a much broader, and insidious, agenda. The U.N. has strategically placed its Holocaust exhibit in consecutive sequence to an exhibit entitled \"The United Nations and the Question of Palestine.\" Onlookers are encouraged to make the obscene analogy of the experience of the Jews in the Holocaust to the experience of Palestinian Arabs. The message is that the creation of the Jewish state was a great wrong (\"violated the provisions of the U.N. Charter\"), and was foisted upon peaceful Arabs without agency. The current U.N. Holocaust exhibit has also eliminated key features of the original display from 2008. It no longer includes the infamous photograph of naked skeletal Jewish men crammed into wooden barracks in the Buchenwald concentration camp – one of whom was Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel. Survivors at Buchenwald Concentration Camp remain in their barracks after liberation by the Allies on April 16, 1945. Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize-winning author of \"Night,\" is on the second bunk from the bottom, seventh from the left.(CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images) Also gone is the notorious photograph of a terrified little boy with his hands up in the air, as a Nazi points a rifle at him for the crime of being Jewish. They have been replaced by slide shows that include dozens of happy faces doing ordinary things before, during and after the war. No crematoria, open pits of the dead, humans cataloged by numbered tattoos, or emaciated Jews in striped uniforms behind barbed wire. DEFACED HOLOCAUST MURAL FINDS NEW HOME IN ROME'S SHOAH MUSEUM Even the title of the current exhibit now reads, generically: \"A warning to all people of the dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice.\" In the same vein in 2024, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres opened the U.N.’s \"International Day\" to commemorate the Holocaust by talking about \"antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry around the world.\" The U.N. has strategically placed its Holocaust exhibit in consecutive sequence to an exhibit entitled \"The United Nations and the Question of Palestine.\"(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Perhaps most important, is the U.N. exhibit’s audacious redefinition of the word \"Holocaust.\"  The move marks the culmination of a long public campaign at the U.N. to deny Jews recognition even in death, and to impede our understanding of the Holocaust andantisemitismthen and now. A Roma speaker invited to address the General Assembly in 2020 on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, put it this way: \"It is time now, 75 years since the ending of the Second World War…that the very definition of the Holocaust is corrected.\" \"Corrected\" for the one million visitors – including tens of thousands of American students – who visit U.N. headquarters every year. SECRET DOCUMENTS ON NAZIS WHO FLED TO ARGENTINA AFTER WWII BEING DECLASSIFIED Thus, according to the U.N. permanent exhibit: \"the Holocaust was the state-sponsored, ideologically-driven persecution and murder of six million Jews across Europe and half a million Romas and Sinti by Nazi Germany (1933-1945) and other racist states. Nazi ideology built upon preexisting antisemitism and antigypsyism.\" By contrast, according to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center located in Jerusalem, Israel, \"the Holocaust was unprecedented genocide, total and systematic, perpetrated by Nazi Germany and its collaborators, with the aim of annihilating the Jewish people.\" FILE – Yad Vashem Chairman, Ambassador Dani Dayan speaks to the European Jewish Association symposium audience in the Conference Centre of Hilton hotel in Krakow, Poland, ahead of the 79th anniversary of Auschwitz liberation on January 22, 2024. The symposium focuses on the rise of antisemitism in Europe after the brutal October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the indiscriminate military reaction of Israel to Palestinians.(Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) And according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum located inWashington, D.C., \"The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its allies and collaborators.\" The redefinition comes after the U.N. mounted temporary exhibitions with such titles as \"Holocaust of the Roma People.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Acknowledging other atrocities, crimes or genocides is entirely appropriate. Appropriating the Holocaust and Jewish history is not. The first does not, and should not, require the second. Instances of special U.N. focus on specific populations abound, including for people of African descent, Muslims, and indigenous peoples. Beyond U.N. exhibits are decades of U.N. authority figures who have equated Israelis to Nazis, likened Hamas to Second World War resistance fighters, and boasted talk of a \"Palestinian Holocaust\" on their resumé. Twenty years ago, U.N. sources alleged \"Gaza is a huge concentration camp.\" After October 7, 2023, U.N. officials claimed Israel was conducting \"a new holocaust,\" \"extermination fields,\" and \"death marches.\" As the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) rightly points out: \"comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis\" is not only a lie, but also antisemitism. Indeed, the very same U.N. actors defend or deny Palestinianterrorism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We are witnessing a calculated effort by theUnited Nationsto thwart the essential conditions of \"never again,\" namely: comprehending the depravity of Nazi treatment of the Jews, the unique evil of Jew hatred, and the devastation that antisemitism wreaks on human civilization. On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, it is painfully clear that the institution built on the ashes of theJewish peopledeserves to be relegated to the ash heap of history.

    "title": "America still can't put down the race card. And it's the shame of our nation",
    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says we not only have a 'tribal' left, we also are watching the rise of a 'tribal' right. When race is the only lens, it blinds us to due process and justice. Those screaming the loudest and strutting like cocks on social media are not trying to heal. They’re hustling in the tradition ofAl Sharpton. All because, in today’s culture, the race card is still too valuable to put down. When a black teenager stabbed a white teenager at a recentTexashigh school track meet, it was not long before Americans online predictably turned this into a racial controversy — even before the facts were known. The name of the black boy facing most, if not all, of his life in prison is Karmelo Anthony and the name of the white boy whose life was tragically and senselessly ended far too early was Austin Metcalf. I mention their names only for public record, but we know in the social media culture wars there was no meaning to their actual names. They were largely invisible. Their white and black skins were made to represent their races. TEXAS PRESS CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS OVER TRACK MEET STABBING The controversy ignited when conservative influencers complained that this tragedy was not getting much attention when it first became public. They argued that had it been the black teen who was stabbed to death there would have been a larger outcry. No doubt that they are right. That is a racial unfairness that we need to hold media and others to account. But aside from this issue of media bias, was the actual incident between the two teens a racial one? There reportedly have been over 30 witnesses interviewed and we do not know their version of the story. RADICAL ACTIVIST WHO FUELED CORI BUSH'S CAMPAIGNS EMERGES AS SPOKESPERSON FOR TRACK STAR'S MURDER SUSPECT All we have is apolice reportwhere the black teen admitted to the fatal stabbing. According to witness statements and an arrest affidavit, the incident began when the white teen told the black teen to move from under a tent designated for Memorial High School students. The black teen reportedly reached into his bag, saying, \"Touch me and see what happens,\" followed by, \"Punch me and see what happens.\" The white teen then grabbed or pushed the black teen to move him, at which point the black teen pulled out a black knife and stabbed the white teen once in the chest before fleeing. A bloody knife was later recovered in the bleachers. After his arrest, the black teen complied with officers and made several spontaneous statements, including, \"I was protecting myself,\" \"He put his hands on me, I told him not to,\" and \"I’m not alleged, I did it.\" He also asked if the white teen would be OK and whether his actions could be considered self-defense. Then the online controversy took a dark turn. The DailyWire’s Matt Walsh led the charge into racial tribalism when he said, \"Young black males are violent to a wildly, outrageously disproportionate degree. That’s just a fact. We all know it. And it’s time that we speak honestly about it, or nothing will ever change.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION So, a black teen kills a white teen and the entire black population is indicted? Walsh’s rhetoric along with others makes the mistake of framing these issues in binary terms (e.g., \"speak honestly or nothing will change\"), which leaves us with a framework that only leads to worthless tribal bickering that achieves nothing. Also, this linear causality — where crime is attributed primarily to individual or group behavior—epitomizes reductive thinking’s focus on direct cause-and-effect over complex dynamics. But clearly Walsh and others are done. They’re washing their hands of this problem. That’s fine. They were never part of the solution. They sit in their podcast booths making millions off race and contribute nothing on the ground. You will have to forgive me but I thought a major point of conservatism over the past several decades was to argue for the move to the individual. Is that the point thatThomas Sowelland Shelby Steele have been making all along? They have argued against the liberal policies that destroyed the black family and how we must fight this bad-faith culture that has taken over certain segments of the black underclass. But these conservatives ignored these deep and profound complexities for cheap tribalism. So, instead of a solid and principled conservative coalition opposing the tribal left we have a significant tribal right rising. The left saw a young black man involved in an alleged crime and instead of waiting for the facts, they weaponized identity politics. They led a fundraiser for an admitted murderer that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The tribal right condemned all blacks for the black teen’s murder. They shouted, \"Fix the black culture,\" but they’re chasing clicks. They even attacked a judge for being black and ignoring herRepublican pedigree— all blacks must be alike, I guess. They went after the black teen for using the monies raised to buy/rent a house and a car — a story that may be a tall tale since it has been reported that the raised funds have not been released. But who cares about facts when there’s a racial narrative to be had? Like I said, the race card is too valuable to put down and that is the shame of our nation.

    "title": "BISHOP ROBERT BARRON: The legacy of Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Cardinal Timothy Dolan speaks from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on the death of Pope Francis. At one of the meetings of cardinals in advance of the conclave of 2013,Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, rose to speak. In simple but provocative language, he called for aChurch that goes outfrom itself to the margins, both physical and existential. A Church that remains focused on itself, preoccupied with its own disagreements and tensions, will be, he insisted, ineffectual. By all accounts, this was the speech that secured his election as pope just a few days later. And it is, furthermore, the speech that set the tone for the entire Francis papacy. Pope Francis waves from his popemobile after the weekly Angelus prayers, at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican on Oct. 20, 2024.(Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty) In word, gesture and deed,Pope Francisconsistently reached out to those on the edges – the poor, the disenfranchised, migrants, those disaffiliated from the Church – and endeavored to bring them to the center. POPE FRANCIS WAS DISRUPTIVE. NOW, THE NEXT POPE MUST CLEAN UP THE 'MESS' One could sense this instinct too in the way he chose cardinals, often overlooking traditional power centers and offering the Red Hat to bishops in places such as East Timor, Mongolia, El Salvador and even Newark, New Jersey. He was the pope of simplicity, a man with the common touch, or in his memorable phrase, \"a shepherd with the smell of the sheep.\" Just days after his election, he returned to the rather ordinary priests’ residence where he had been lodging in order to pay his bill in person; he lovingly embraced a man with severe facial disfigurement; he washed and kissed the feet of prisoners on Holy Thursday; he chose to live, not in the splendid papal palace but in a small apartment within the Casa Santa Marta; he never visited the summer palace at Castel Gondolfo, much loved by his predecessors; and he eschewed elegant limousines for an almost comically small Fiat. Through all of these gestures, he was signaling that he wanted a \"poor Church on behalf of the poor.\" At a time when the reputation of the Church was at historic lows due to the clergy sex scandals, this was a source of great encouragement to many Catholics around the world. He was apope of the Earth. I realize that in saying this, I risk portraying him simply as a Euro-left environmentalist, but this would be a gross misrepresentation. FAITH LEADERS REFLECT ON POPE FRANCIS' DEATH, PAPACY AND LASTING LEGACY: 'MADE HIS MARK' Pope Francis meets with former Pope Benedict XVI to exchange Christmas greetings, in the Mater Ecclesiae monastery on Dec. 23, 2013, in Vatican City.(Maurix/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) In summoning the Church to a concern for nature, which in his phrase had become \"a pile of filth,\" he was hearkening back to a biblical and premodern sense that the human drama plays out in the far wider context of God’s good creation. The title of his encyclical letter dedicated to this topic –Laudato si –came from St. Francis of Assisi’s Canticle of the Creatures, an ecstatic hymn to the beauty of \"brother sun and sister moon.\" When one reads throughLaudato si, one is struck by the steady polemic against \"modernity\" and its \"technocratic mentality,\" which makes of the environment nothing but an object for human manipulation. Francis was most certainly a pope preoccupied withissues of justice, especially between nations. In his encyclicalFratelli tutti, he called upon the classic Catholic teaching regarding the universal destination of goods and was called a Marxist for his troubles. Pope Francis is welcomed as he arrives at the Apostolic Prefecture on Sept. 1, 2023, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) The doctrine, sharply articulated by St. Thomas Aquinas, holds that private ownership is valid but that the use of what one owns should be determined by a primary concern for the common good. A novelty of Pope Francis was to apply this principle not just to the individual but to nations, so that prosperous countries must consider the suffering and need of their poorer neighbors. POPE FRANCIS AND US PRESIDENTS: A LOOK BACK AT HIS LEGACY WITH THE NATION'S LEADERS Nowhere did this teaching come to a sharper point than in the pope’s consistentadvocacy of migrantsseeking a better life. If I were to speculate, I imagine what he would most want to be remembered for is his advocacy of synodality. By this admittedly rather slippery term, he meant a Church marked by listening, accompaniment and consultation. Pope Francis was always suspicious of over-centralization, and synodality in practice is the means by which the local churches in all of their variety and particularity are brought into the ecclesial conversation. This commitment to synodality was undoubtedly born of the pope’s deeply Jesuit formation in the process of spiritual discernment, which is to say, a patient listening to the promptings of the Holy Spirit in advance of making a serious decision. In pursuit of this goal, Pope Francis sponsored two international synods on the topic, gathering 400 bishops, priests and lay people for intense conversations. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I was privileged to be an elected delegate to these assemblies, and I can testify that conversations across ideological, geographical and cultural boundaries unfolded. Whether this effort will have a long-lasting effect on the life of the Church is debatable. On the negative side of the ledger, I might indicate that, for many, the pope’s generous outreach amounted to a watering-down of Catholic moral teaching, especially in regard to marriage and sexuality. Pope Francis places a white rose on the names of the September 11 victims at the edge of the South Pool of the 9/11 memorial in New York on Sept. 25, 2015.(AFP via Getty Images) Amoris Laetitia(which at least hinted at the possibility of Communion for the divorced and remarried) andFiducia Supplicans(which allowed for the blessing of those in same-sex relationships) remain highly controverted documents. The latter was effectively vacated by the bishops of Africa. And the synodal process strikes many in the Church as a turning away from evangelical witness and a turning toward endless and finally fruitless dialogue, the Church chattering to itself rather than boldly announcingChrist to the world. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At times, too, Pope Francis could appear the master of the false dichotomy: mercy rather than moral demand, going to the margins rather than maintaining the center, privileging laity over the clergy, etc. All of this has led some to hope for a more moderate and prudent pope after the 12 years of the relatively free-wheeling Francis. In the end, I believe we should appreciate him as a man deeply marked by his Jesuit training to identify withthe person of Jesus Christ. And this meant, for Pope Francis, to be the bearer of the divine mercy, the one who would invite deeply wounded souls into the field hospital of the Church.

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: Please, a pope significantly younger than 75",
    "article_text": "Bishop Robert Barron reflects on his personal connection to Pope Francis and discusses faith in America. Which way the Catholic Church? With thedeath of Pope Francisa thousand articles have already been written and a thousand times that number are coming in the weeks leading up to the introduction of the new pope. After the conclave has done its work, thenew popewill appear on the balcony at St. Peter’s and wave, and an avalanche of essays on the first question posed above will follow. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS And of course, we won’t know or even be able to guess the answer. I’ve had seven popes in my lifetime and only have fixed opinions on the last three: Saint John Paul II, Benedict and Francis. This process just doesn’t happen often. Like the proverbial \"first reports,\" first opinions and impressions of and reactions to popes are almost always wrong. St. John Paul II was 58 when his surprise election was announced in 1978. He served until his death at 85. Pope Benedict was elected at the age of 75 and served less than eight years before his retirement.Pope Franciswas 77 when elected Pope and served a dozen years. It has thus been more than 30 years since Roman Catholics and the world have had a leader at least 75 years young. (St. John Paul turned 75 in 1995). That’s a very long time for old men to hold that office of worldwide consequence. For thirty years theRoman Catholic Churchhas, to put it charitably, drifted. The arguments among Catholics are long, deep and enduring, but there is one metric about which most Catholics will agree as a metric on the health of the Church: Mass attendance. \"Attendance at Mass has been declining for many years in much of Europe, whereas the numbers of active believers have been growing significantly in Africa,\" according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday. \"In Latin America, the long-dominant Catholic Church has been losing ground to other faiths, especially evangelical Protestantism.\" It should not surprise that an institution led by septuagenarians for three decades is not growing in its core mission: Mass attendance. In the avalanche of commentary to come, keep an eye on the candidates’ alleged abilities to attract young men to the priesthood and all people to Mass. There were 407,000 priests at the end of 2023. That number began to fall in the mid-1950s, and the decline accelerated after Vatican II wrapped up in 1965, but has been relatively level since St. John Paul II brought a surge of energy with him to Rome in 1978. The key demographic, however, is the average age of a priest, which today is 70. It’s an old church run by old men. The lists of \"papabili\" are interesting and provide a snapshot of the College of Cardinals but little else. What we won’t know for a few weeks is whether the Cardinals are \"self-aware\" of their age problem. The youngest cardinal is Mykola Bychok, 45, who is the highest-ranking Catholic official in Australia. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Cardinal Giorgio Marengo who is 51, is in charge of an area including Mongolia. Also, just past the 50 mark are Cardinal Américo Manuel Alves Aguiar of Portugal, Cardinal George Koovakad of India, now serving in Rome, and Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas of Lithuania, also serving in Rome. There are at least 10 more cardinals in their 50s. My prayer for the conclave is that the cardinals assembled realize that the Church needs energy to go along with its doctrine and mission. Whoever emerges from the deliberations of the 185 talented and dedicated men, let it be like 1978 again, when Karol Józef Wojtyła went into a conclave an obscure prelate from Poland and emerged a pope ready and able to lead with joy and energy the world’s Catholics and millions more who pay attention to the words coming out of St. Peter’s. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The commentary will stress the divisions within the Church, but there is much more unity than there are divides. The local parishes I attend on both coasts do not reflect the debates that catch the passing glance of writers and columnists. They are well-attended and happy places, but the priests are increasingly from abroad as the United States is not meeting its mark in inspiring young men to dedicate their lives to the Church. That single factor will not drive the conclave, but I can hope whatever does move the group assembled ends up producing a pope who cures that problem and not just in America, but around the world. The Church needs priests. That would probably require an inspiring and relatively young pope. We can pray.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: Democrats have a Joe Biden problem. And there's no way to fix it",
    "article_text": "Wall Street Journal reporter Annie Linskey, who broke the news of former President Biden's decline, joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the pushback she received and the impact of his administration dodging questions on Biden's mental acuity You almost have to feel sorry forJoe Biden. One minute he’s president of the United States, the most powerful person on earth, and the next minute his own party is begging him to disappear. Michael LaRosa, Jill Biden’s former communications director, is quoted in a Hill piece saying, \"the intense level of anger or indifference to [the Bidens]… isn’t going away anytime soon.\" Biden is so out of favor he can’t even circulate an Easter message without attracting ridicule. Biden’s Easter greeting featured a family snapshot that trended on X for hours, with most viewers deciding the president had been photoshopped in, so unartfully was he positioned and so peculiarly dressed. The picture raises several questions including: where was the president if not among family members? Where was Hunter, conspicuous by his absence? We don’t know the answers to these questions, because Biden has been keeping a low profile of late. His rare public appearances have not gone well. Several days ago, he spoke before a conference onSocial Securityin Chicago, his first address since leaving office in January. He used the opportunity to scare seniors into believing that the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce waste and fraud in Social Security (estimated by the Social Security Inspector General to total $72 billion from 2015 through 2022) might mean their checks will be delayed or interrupted. He claimed the Trump White House wants to \"wreck\" the program so they can \"rob it,\" using the money to reward billionaires with tax cuts. BIDEN RETURNS TO PODIUM FOR FIRST TIME TO SLAM TRUMP'S SOCIAL SECURITY PLANS: 'WRECK IT SO THEY COULD ROB IT' None of that is true, of course, but the public is used to the former president misrepresenting his successor’s programs (and his own.) The reality is that PresidentDonald Trumpis attempting to preserve Social Security, which is slowly going bankrupt; ignoring reality and doing zero to fix our entitlements programs was only one of many Biden lapses. Former President Joe Biden gestures during a speech at the Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled conference in Chicago on April 15, 2025. That wasn’t the only falsehood uttered by the former president. He also said, \"They want to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations.\" This statement is completely false, and Biden must know it.  A new study has been released, based on IRS data, showing the actual impact of Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This is important, sinceCongressis hard at work on a new reconciliation bill that will extend those tax changes, and perhaps add further sweeteners, like no taxes on tips, for working-class Americans. The study, authored byJustin Haskinsfor the Heartland Institute, concluded that \"every income bracket received a tax cut because of the TCJA, but the taxpayers who received the biggest cuts, in terms of percentage saved, went to those who earned less than $75,000.\" The study shows that the average filer, making between $40,000 and $50,000, paid almost 19% less in taxes in 2022 than they did in 2017. Wealthy filers did not fare as well. People making between $5 million and $10 million paid 2.3% less over the same period. As Haskins notes, \"So much for the \"billionaire tax cut\" narrative.\" NEW STUDY ABOUT IRS REVEALS JUST HOW MUCH TRUMP TAX CUTS SAVED YOU The savings have been significant for middle-class families. Americans earning between $50,000 and $75,000 saved more than $4,500 on average between 2018 and 2022 because of the 2017 tax revisions; those earning between $75,000 and $100,000 saved $5,923. Overall, the 2017 TCJA made our tax system more – not less- progressive, something Republicans have argued for some time. In other words, the wealthy’s share of the total tax burden increased because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, contrary to Democrats' arguments. For the left, tax cuts are instantly suspect, since they hamper their ambitions to grow the federal government. In hisChicagoaddress, Biden had the temerity to warn that the GOP will fund lower taxes by \"running up the national debt,\" an ironic caution from Biden, who added more to the debt than any president in history. At least Trump won’t be borrowing money to fund lease payments on empty office buildings or DEI programs at government agencies. In his Chicago speech, Biden also reminisced that he learned about segregation from seeing \"colored kids\" go by on a bus when he was in fourth grade, another embarrassment. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Biden’s only other recent public outing was to visit Harvard, for a closed-door session with students. Reports indicated the 82-year-old confused Iraq with Ukraine and then spilled his ice cream. Fortunately, a former aide, Mike Donilon, was there to clean up. Outings like these have Democrats hoping that Biden will stay out of the public eye -- and who can blame them? Every time Biden speaks, voters are reminded of the Big Lie – the coverup of the former president’s declining mental acuity. The Biden presidency was one of the worst frauds perpetrated on the American public in our history. It is still unclear who actually ran the government over the past four years. The entireDemocratic Party(and their allies in the liberal media) has been tarnished by their participation in that pretense, which may be one reason their approval ratings are so dismal. A new Gallup poll finds confidence inDemocratic Congressional leadershipat an all-time low of 25%; that compares with 39% confidence in GOP leadership. A CNN poll from last month shows Democrats’ overall approval rating also hitting record lows. Unfortunately, Biden wants to earn some money, and raking in $300,000 per speech is one way to do that. Though there evidently have not been many takers, Biden will likely continue to show up. That will add to Democrats’ angst and may push them to undertake less subtle encouragements. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The DNC posted anEaster greeting on Xthat included photos of four former presidents and their families but omitted Biden. That stings. Will it convince Biden to exit the public arena? Doubtful. After all, he’s so out of touch with reality that he still thinks he could have beaten Donald Trump. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE LIZ PEEK",

    "title": "To bolster diplomacy and deterrence make our enemies fear the bomber",
    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on countering China's influence at the Panama Canal and nuclear talks with Iran. Iran isn’t negotiatingin good faith and President Trump warned that if it doesn’t, it faces \"great danger.\" Adversaries cannot perceive the president's warning as a bluff— especially amid high-stakes U.S. efforts to deter Russia and China. To make our enemies believe Trump's willingness and the United States' ability to hit the hardest-to-reach weapons that the adversary regime values most, the administration should stoke fears of the American stealth bomber. According to public estimates, Iran is days away from having a nuclear warhead. Any deal that permitsIranto keep a threshold nuclear program is worse than the Iran deal negotiated by then President Obama that President Trump rightly withdrew the United States from in 2018, especially after Iran's complicity in the brutal Hamas attacks against Israel on October 7th. The only acceptable outcome of a negotiation is the complete dismantlement of the program with U.S.-led international inspectors' unfettered access to provide constant verification of compliance—an outcome Iran and its patron, Russia, have hitherto blocked. In recent weeks, the U.S. sent B-52 heavy bombers from the U.K.’s RAF Fairford Base, showcasing U.S. strength, global reach, and its potential added advantage when collaborating with allies in a strong signal to Iran. Now six of the nation’s stealth bombers, the B-2 Spirits, are on the tarmac at a joint U.K.-U.S. island military base on Diego Garcia. We don’t know what is in each of the two internal weapons bays per bomber. But each bomber can carry conventional, nuclear, precision-guided or gravity bombs including ones that are designed to destroy the most deeply buried and hardened targets—like the ones housingIran’s illicit nuclear weaponsprogram. Instead of letting Iran string along useless talks while its military builds up, Trump should make it clear that he isreallywilling to green-light the Israelis to lead a military campaign to destroy the entire nuclear program and the U.S. would play a significant assist role with its stealth bombers. He should further make it clear that he is not impressed with Iran’s delay tactics and its unwillingness to declare it is willing to forgo its entire nuclear weapons program. This is a unique moment and has the potential to send a serious message about the resolve of this administration to deter major wars and to re-establish stability after four years of a cascade of destabilizing aggression across continents. Credible threats of force go hand in glove with successful diplomacy and it would be prudent for this administration to communicate this in a strategic deterrence communication campaign. DELEGATES FROM IRAN, US HOLDING TALKS IN OMAN AMID ONGOING TENSIONS: WHAT TO KNOW Getting serious about the possibility of amilitary optionwill bolster the possibility of actual successful diplomacy towards dismantlement. That’s why it’s important for public officials to establish the benefit of a possible effort to assist in a military campaign: first, it would impose a deserved cost on the Iranian regime for its brutal aggression against U.S. allies and against U.S. forces; second, it would demonstrate that Trump—although willing to give diplomacy a chance—will not permit bad actors to pay lip service to negotiations while in reality buying time to build up a better military advantage; third, it will show that despite the need to improve and strengthen the military, the U.S. has the world’s most capable fighting force, and the bombers can take out hardened and buried military targets. Those are messages others would receive, too, including Beijing who may be under the illusion that some of its most valuable military assets have sanctuary within the interior of China. Israel has already this year destroyed the last three of Iran’s Russian-made and provided S-300 air defense systems. ButIran will get moreand will be stronger when it does and so Iran is uniquely vulnerable right now. If Trump agrees to work with the Israelis to destroy the program, it certainly does not necessarily mean that he would be willing to use military force against our foremost military adversary, China, should Xi Jinping decide to invade democratic Taiwan. Trump has remained ambiguous about how he would respond in that scenario. However, if Trump does agree to collaboratively take out Iran’s nuclear program, it would surely cause Xi to believe that Trump just might be willing to do the same thing with a coalition in defense of Taiwan. China has long fretted about American bombers. State-run Chinese propaganda outlets like the Global Times highlight the threat of American bombers more than other weapon systems. People's Liberation Army schools note the formidableness of American bombers, their stealth, combat effectiveness, and large payloads. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The United States should use this moment, with six B-2s deployed to Diego Garcia staring down Iran to force the regime to negotiate, to boost the Iranians’ and the PLA’s fears and further complicate their calculations as they wonder about Trump’s resolve to prevent wars and win them if our adversaries insist on them. Furthermore, Chinese leaders should be reminded in stark terms that the next generation bomber, the B-21 Raider, will be even stealthier and able to take out the more difficult to reach and highly defended weapons far inside the Chinese mainland and in underground tunnels. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Here are just a few powerful ways to communicate the possible impact of the stealth bomber that could further these aims: Trump should post a video demonstrating the extraordinary destructive power of the B-2 on social media just as he has done so with the effective U.S. anti-Houthi strikes. Hegseth could follow up with a posted image of the bomber with an array of the weapons it could carry. It would be brilliant if, in a statement, Hegseth could also mention that it could also carry maritime strike weapons or hypersonic strike weapons (a message for Xi); and last, we are only a couple of months away from the 250th anniversary of America’s independence and it would send a strong signal if there was a fly-over on the National Mall of the current and next generation aircraft including the B-21 bomber and F-47 fighter. The American people often heard President Biden warn of the dangers and capabilities of our enemies' militaries. It’s time President Trump warned America’s enemies of ours.

The electric automaker reported $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue after delivering almost 337,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year. The company’s net income reflects a 71% drop from the same quarter last year. It was the worst quarter for Tesla deliveries in more than two years and came on the heels of the company’s first-everyear-to-year drop in sales. Tesla’s income was buffered by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, according to its earnings report — without those, it would have posted a loss. And yet, Tesla stock rose in after-hours trading as investors put more weight on the company’s plans to begin production on an affordable EV in June and CEO Elon Musk’s comments during an earnings call that he would reduce his role with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more attention on Tesla. Musk did not commit to ending his DOGE work altogether though, notinghe may continuein some capacity through the remainder of President Donald Trump’s second term. TechCrunchpublished a roundup of other Musk commentscovering tariffs, robotaxis, AI, and EVs, during Tesla’s earnings call. Tesla also cautioned shareholders about how the trade war may affect its business moving forward. The company said President Trump’s tariffs and “changing political sentiment” could have a “meaningful impact on demand for our products.” The company noted the current tariffs, the bulk of which are directed at China, will have “a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.” Tesla said it is taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long term and focus on maintaining its health, but it also cautioned investors that it can’t say whether it will be able to grow sales this year. Tesla is sticking to its ambitious (but mysterious) plans around making more affordable models, stating it remains on track for start of production of these vehicles in the first half of 2025. During the earnings call, Musk was more specific, stating production would begin in June. These vehicles will use aspects of a next-generation platform that powers the robotaxi, but will rely on its existing one that powers the Model Y and Model 3, the company said in its shareholder’s letter. As such, these cheaper vehicles will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as the current vehicle lineup, the company said. This flies in the face of a Reuters report from last week that claimed the first of these new EVs isdelayed by months. Tesla’s sales are up against a number of headwinds. The company’s EV lineup is aging (though the sedans and SUVs have now all gotten face-lifts) and its newest product, the Cybertruck, is nowhere near the hit that CEO Elon Musk thought it could be. And Musk’s far-right politics, along with his involvement in the Trump administration, have created a sizable backlash to Tesla’s brand. At the same time, Musk has oriented the company toward its Robotaxi and Optimus robot projects. He has promised to launch an initial version of the Robotaxi service in Austin this June, with other cities potentially coming by the end of this year, but has been light on details about how it will work. Musk has yet to demonstrate that Teslas are capable of driving themselves without human intervention despite years of making that promise. What’s more, The Information recently reported that an internal analysis done at Tesla showed the Robotaxi program would lose money for a long period of timeeven if it were to work. At this time last year, Tesla was grappling with some gloomy numbers. In case you forgot, the company’s profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from the same period in 2023. Tesla said it was due to a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and “several unforeseen challenges” cut into the automaker’s bottom line. Tesla tried to turn that profit ship around, but faced continued pressure. In Q2 of 2024, Tesla reported $1.5 billion in profit, down 45% from the same period in 2023. Profits were hit by a $622 million restructuring charge. Although it’s worth noting, that profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales.This article originally published at 1:15 pm PT.

It’s been a hot target. Cursor is one of the most popular AI-powered coding tools, and its revenue has been growing astronomically — doubling on average every two months, according to another source. Anysphere’s current average annual recurring revenue is about $300 million, according to the two sources. The company previously walked away from early acquisition discussions with OpenAI, after the ChatGPT maker approached Cursor, the two sources close to the company confirmed, andCNBC previously reported. Anysphere has also received other acquisition offers that the company didn’t consider, according to one of these sources. Cursor turned down the offers because the startup wants to stay independent, said the two people close to the company. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital atabout a $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month. Although it didn’t nab Anysphere, OpenAI didn’t give up on buying an established AI coding tool startup. OpenAI talked with more than 20 others, CNBC reported. And then it got serious over the next-fastest-growing AI coding startup, Windsurf, with a$3 billion acquisition offer, Bloomberg reported last week. While Windsurf is a comparatively smaller company, its ARR is about $100 million, up from$40 million in ARRin February, according to a source. Windsurf has been gaining popularity with the developer community, too, and its coding product is designed to work with legacy enterprise systems. Windsurf did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. OpenAI declined to comment on its acquisition talks. OpenAI is likely shopping because it’s looking for its next growth areas as competitors such as Google’s Gemini and China’s DeepSeek put pricing pressure on access to foundational models. Moreover,AnthropicandGoogle have recently released AI modelsthat outperform OpenAI’s models on coding benchmarks, increasingly making them a preferred choice for developers. While OpenAI could build its own AI coding assistant, buying a product that is already popular with developers means the ChatGPT-maker wouldn’t have to start from scratch to build this business. VCs who invest in developer tool startups are certainly watching. Speculating about OpenAI’s strategy, Chris Farmer, partner and CEO at SignalFire, told TechCrunch of the company, “They’ll be acquisitive at the app layer.

Musk said he plans to reduce his role with DOGE to a “day or two” per week starting next month, “or as long as the President would like me to do so, and as long as it is useful.” The executive made his comments on Tesla’s quarterly earnings call, just about an hour and a half after Tesla admitted in a shareholder letter that “political sentiment” is harming the company’s sales. Combined with other factors — including increased competition and Trump’s tariff mess — Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration helped drive a 71%drop in profitcompared to the first quarter of last year. Musk’s comments come just a few days after one of Tesla’s biggest supporters on Wall Streetsaidthe company is in a “code red” situation if the CEO didn’t pull back from his government work. The work Musk has done with DOGE to gut government agencies and — in his words — feeding one into “the wood chipper” has resulted in worldwide protests against him and Tesla. Musk tried on Tuesday’s call to blame the protests as being “paid for,” without offering any evidence.  He claimed the people in attendance are “protesting because they’re receiving fraudulent money, or the recipients of waste,” again without providing any proof or trying to justify this line of thinking. Musk said the “major work of establishing” DOGE is over, which would allow him to pull back his involvement. He is technically a “special government employee,” which is supposed to limit his work to 130 days in any 365-day period. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But Sand AI appears to be censoring images that might raise the ire of Chinese regulators from the hosted version of the model, according to TechCrunch’s testing. Earlier this week, Sand AI announcedMagi-1, a model that generates videos by “autoregressively” predicting sequences of frames. The company claims the model can generate high-quality, controllable footage that captures physics more accurately than rival open models. 👀 You won’t believe this is AI-generated🧠 You won’t believe it’s open-source🎬 You won’t believe it’s FREE Magi-1 video model just humiliated commercial video tools Details and examples below: 👇pic.twitter.com/zlXRecWeqH — Farhan (@mhdfaran)April 21, 2025 Magi-1 is too impractical to run on most consumer hardware. It’s 24 billion parameters in size, and requires between four and eight Nvidia H100 GPUs to run. (Parameters are the internal variables models use to make predictions.) For many users — this reporter included — Sand AI’s platform is the only place they can test drive Magi-1. The platform needs a “prompt” image to kick off video generation. Not all prompts are permissible, TechCrunch quickly discovered. Sand AI blocks image uploads of Xi Jinping, Tiananmen Square and Tank Man, the Taiwanese flag, and insignias supporting Hong Kong liberation. Filtering appears to be happening at the image level; renaming image files didn’t skirt the blocking. Sand AI isn’t the only Chinese startup preventing uploads of politically sensitive images to its video generation tool. Hailuo AI, Shanghai-based MiniMax’s generative media platform, blocks photos of Xi Jinping as well. But Sand AI’s filtering appears to be particularly aggressive; Hailuo allows images of Tiananmen Square. As Wiredexplainedin a piece from January, models in China are required to follow stringent information controls. A 2023 law forbids models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony” — that is, counters the government’s historical and political narratives. To comply, Chinese startups often censor their models, either through prompt-level filters or fine-tuning. Interestingly, while Chinese models tend to block political speech, they often have fewer filters than their American counterparts for pornographic content.404 recently reportedthat a number of video generators released by Chinese companies lack basic guardrails that prevent people from generating nonconsensual nudity.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us This might be the most hyped Tesla earnings in recent memory. And not for all the right reasons. Tesla has takenmany hitsthis year as its CEO Elon Musk leans further into right-wing politics and overseesDOGE, the advisory body that President Trump has bestowed the power to slash federal spending. For Tesla, that has meant watching both its stock price and global sales plummet. And that’s not even taking into account pressure from competitors in China, Europe, and North America. As Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note this morning, Tesla is facing the lowest margin expectations this quarter in 12 years. How Tesla’s stock performs will be reliant on the company’s ability to explain why its profit margins are worse than Volkswagen’s amid “likely cash burn,” instill confidence in its autonomy plans, and wrangle Musk’s attention away from the White House. Analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance are expecting revenue of around $21.41 billion, which would be flat year-over-year and down from $25.7 billion in Q4 2024. Tesla’s Q1 2025 earnings call is at 2:30 p.m. PT / 5:30 p.m. ET. The public can listen along to the call by tuning inhere,here, or on X.Here’s what we’ll be listening for. DuringTesla’s last earnings call, the company said it expects its vehicle business to “return to growth in 2025.” Will that still be the case, given Tesla’s unimpressive delivery numbers for Q1 and weak customer demand driven in part by Musk’s politics? Tesla recorded336,681 deliveriesin the first three months of the year, its worst quarterly performance in more than two years. The automaker does have some tailwinds. It is better positioned than other OEMs to weather Trump’s tariff storm due to its domestic sourcing and high degree of vertical integration. That said, Musk’s proximity to Trump probably doesn’t help his popularity in China, one of Tesla’s biggest markets. That dynamic coulddrive more customersinto the open arms of rival BYD. Sources at Tesla have told us that the company has all but abandoned its plans for acheap EV, though others have reported the automaker has merelydelayed the car’s rolloutby months. Either way, we’ll be listening out for updates there. During Tesla’s full-year 2024 earnings call, Musk said the company would launch a paidride-hailing robotaxi service in Austinstarting this June. He has said in the past that Tesla would first use Model Y and Model 3 vehicles with “unsupervised” FSD, rather than its two-seater Cybercab concept that’s built without a steering wheel or pedals. As research analysts at Cantor said: “Tesla has not yet quantified the commercialization of its Robotaxi segment, or disclosed initial routes/territory.” So investors and analysts will be on the lookout for more concrete details of Tesla’s Austin plans. The automaker has also said that it plans to launch in California this year, but has been mum on those details. We’re also hoping to hear some updates onTesla’s Cybercab. Federal regulations don’t currently allow for operators to mass produce and deploy autonomous vehicles without human controls built-in without an exemption. Musk will likely bend that regulation to his will, as he is wont to do, so we might get some insights later into when Tesla plans to start production on those futuristic-looking vehicles. In Q4, Musk said he expected Tesla to startusing Optimus humanoid robotsinternally this year, particularly for the “boring” tasks. We’ll be listening for a timeline for that, as well as when Tesla says it will begin high volume production of Optimus, and when it expects to begin initial deliveries. Musk and Tesla have been quiet on Dojo since August 2024, a surprise given how gung ho they were about the supercomputer that would help the company achieve its full self-driving dreams. Then there’s Cortex, which is Tesla’s other new giant AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to help solve real-world AI. InTesla’s Q4 shareholder deck, the company shared updates on Cortex, but nothing on Dojo. The latest update we’ve seen show some kind of computing cluster came from theTesla AI X accountwith the words, “Quiet please. The machines are learning.” Though it’s not clear if it’s Dojo or Cortex. Per Jonas’s note, investors will be searching for “any signs of Tesla’s CEO reprioritizing the efforts of Tesla versus politically oriented endeavors.” Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst and other Tesla bull, said in a note Sunday that Musk is facing a “Code Red Situation.” He reiterated his previous stance that Musk needs to distance himself from DOGE so that the Tesla brand ceases to be a political talking point.

    "title": "Vibe coding helps Supabase nab $200M at $2B valuation just seven months after its last raise",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In 2020, when open source databaseSupabase was founded, its New Zealand-based CEO, Paul Copplestone, couldn’t have imagined it would be sitting in the sweet spot for 2025’s biggest trend: vibe coding. But on Tuesday, the fruits of that became evident when itannounced a $200 million Series D at a $2 billion post-money valuationled by Accel, with Coatue, Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, and longtime investor Felicis participating in the round, Fortune reported. This fresh $200 million comesjust seven months after Supabase announced it raised $80 millionled by Peak XV (a Sequoia spinoff) and David Sacks’ Craft Ventures. Supabase wouldn’t comment on the valuation at that time, but PitchBook put it at about $900 million. All told, the startup has now raised about $398 million. Supabase is another example of how commercially successful open source projects can be. It offers an open source version of Firebase, Google’s database AI app development platform, and hosts the appsfor up to $600 a month, or more for enterprise users. Supabase combines the open source SQL database Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). Essentially, it’s like vibe database management, easing the pesky parts of getting a SQL database set up as part of app development. Consequently, it has become a popular back end for the vibe coding toolslike fast-growing Lovable. As a Y Combinator alum, Supabase has become a go-to tool for YC startups, Copplestone previously told TechCrunch. But it’s really coming into its own with independent and enterprise developers. The company has had “insane growth” especially in the last two years, Felicis managing partner Aydin Senkut tells TechCrunch. “Its biggest asset is the community of developers, which rocketed past 1 million and growing by thousands every day.” Indeed, Supabase now claims over 1.7 million developers and the project has over 81 thousand stars on GitHub, too. “It’s becoming the default back end for AI apps and myriad other categories of apps,” Senkut  says. Because it’s based on Postgres, Supabase has street cred with developers that need to support thousands to millions of users. Postgres has long-been an open source database for enterprise developers when they don’t need the superpowers — and high price tag — of an Oracle or Microsoft database. Supabase goes so far as to have a marketing tagline of  “build in a weekend: scale to millions” While nothing will truly threaten Oracle’s current standing — it’s as deeply embedded in the tech of existing Fortune 1000 companies as possible — the rise of Supabase is interesting to watch. The next crop of billion-user apps will be AI-developed, AI-powered, AI-managed. And Supabase is already one of the go-to databases for that.

Available in closed beta, the model animates the platform’s characters in a variety of styles and voices, from human-like characters to 2D animal cartoons.

Mind-blowing. Dive in:https://t.co/aF5zDrKLIK#CharacterAI#AvatarFXpic.twitter.com/Rkqo4SXEgX It’s immediately evident how this kind of tech could be leveraged for abuse — users could upload photos of celebrities or people they know in real life and create realistic-looking videos in which they do or say something incriminating. The technology to create convincing deepfakes already exists, but incorporating it into popular consumer products like Character.AI only exacerbates the potential for it to be used irresponsibly. We’ve reached out to Character.AI for comment. Character.AI is already facing issues with safety on its platform. Parents have filed lawsuits against the company, alleging that its chatbotsencouraged their childrento self-harm, to kill themselves, or to kill their parents. In one case, a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after he reportedly developed anobsessive relationshipwith an AI bot on Character.AI based on a “Game of Thrones” character. Shortly before his death, he’d opened up to the AI about having thoughts of suicide, and the AI encouraged him to follow through on the act, according to court filings. These are extreme examples, but they go to show how people can be emotionally manipulated by AI chatbots through text messages alone. With the incorporation of video, the relationships that people have with these characters could feel even more realistic. Character.AI has responded to the allegations against it by building parental controls and additional safeguards, but as with any app, controls are only effective when they’re actually used. Oftentimes, kids use tech in ways that their parents don’t know about. Topics Senior Writer Amanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

    "title": "Burning questions (and some answers) about Bluesky’s new verification system",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Bluesky’s launch of averification systemhas raised a slew of questions among its user base, from who will be picked — and why — to what outside organizations might be involved and whether the self-verification process will end. TechCrunch has some answers. After aleak last week, Bluesky officiallyannouncedMonday the arrival of its verification system, which is designed to ensure that notable people are who they say they are on the social network. While similar in some respects to the system that Twitter had once used before pivoting topaid verificationunder Elon Musk, Bluesky’s verification builds on the company’s decentralized ethos by giving other entities the authority to verify users independently. Bluesky briefly explained how this process workedin a blog post. However, the numerous questions found in the replies to Bluesky’s posts and on other forums, likeReddit, indicate that many don’t fully understand verification. We’ve rounded up some of the more common questions that seem to be on users’ minds to try to help explain the verification process and its rollout. While Bluesky didn’t respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment, we’re referencing the company’s own documentation and its leaders’ posts to try to answer the questions we found many were asking. One missing piece of information from Bluesky’s blog post was which organizations outside of Bluesky are being given the tools to verify others. The company explains that “Trusted Verifiers” will be those organizations that Bluesky allows to issue blue checks. However, the only example of this that was shown was The New York Times, which is now allowed to issue checks toits journalists. What Bluesky hasn’t said is which other organizations now have this power, or how they were chosen. It’s also unclear if Bluesky has others lined up for early access; the company didn’t reveal any future partners on this effort. This makes Bluesky’s announcement of verification feel somewhat premature, as people want to see the working examples of decentralized verification systems from the get-go, even if it’s initially with only a few testers. We’ve found that beyondThe New York Times, there are only a couple of other organizations that have been given Trusted Verifier status at this time. These includeWiredandThe Athletic,accordingto Bluesky software engineerSamuel Newman. Bluesky itself said it’s only starting out with a “small and non-comprehensive group of accounts.” CEO Jay Graberaddedthat the initial set includes “news orgs” that have agreed to verify their journalists. Later, the company will launch a form that will allow other organizations to apply for Trusted Verifier status, but Bluesky has not indicated when this will happen. One of the problems with Twitter’s old verification system is the verification badge became a coveted achievement. If a user was noteworthy enough, had gained a certain number of followers, or was an expert in their field, they began to feel they should be verified. But they may not have received a verification badge because Twitter disagreed with them about their importance. Other times, they just didn’t know the right people at Twitter to ask. How Bluesky feels about this matter is still somewhat vague. The company’s blog post suggests that its own verification will work to “proactively verify authentic and notable accounts,” but doesn’t explain the criteria it’s using to deem an account “notable” enough to be worthy of verification. When it was suggested to Bluesky CTO Paul Frazee that people were curious about thewho,when,andwhyaround Bluesky’s verification,he only respondedby saying “yep yep.” How mysterious! We’ll mark this one “TBD.” As with any launch of verification, people are quick to focus on the haves and the have-nots. Who got verified first and why? And why did this person or organization get verified over that one? When Bluesky announced that verification had launched, many assumed they would immediately see blue checks everywhere. Instead, people were struggling to understand how news organizations likeCNN,The WSJ,andBloombergreceived the blue-and-white verification badge but others likePoliticoorMSNBCdid not (as of the time of writing!). This is likely because Bluesky has not completed its rollout of verification. The company suggested in a post on the network that the launch of verification was not an instant process, when itannouncedthat users would “start seeing” blue checks appear in Bluesky following the launch. Plus, Bluesky noted it wasn’taccepting any verification requests “currently,”which could imply that, at a later date, it will have a process for doing so. In other words, we wouldn’t read too much into who is verified as of today or what that means, as we’re only at the beginning of this rollout. Before the launch of verification, Bluesky offered another way for users to verify that they are who they say they are: with domains. In 2023, the company began allowing organizations and individuals to set a domain as their username, and since then, over 270,000 accounts have done so, Blueskysays. This system is not going away, Bluesky notes, as it will “continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky.” Instead, it will now become another layer of verification. It will remain an optional way to confirm an identity, however, not a mandate for getting verified. Still, Bluesky says it “highly recommends” official organizations and high-profile individuals do this andprovides how-to documentationto get started. Also worth noting: Thecompany said in December 2024that after someone changes a Bluesky username to a website URL, their old bsky.social username will still be reserved for them. This prevents account impersonation by bad actors. For that reason, the reservation will never expire. As one example,Hunter WalkerandGuan Yanghave been running alabelerto unofficially verify a range of diverse media outlets, large and small, national and local. This labeler also verified elected officials, prominent activists, political operatives, and other celebrities, according to its website. Walker noted in a post on Bluesky the company had not approached him about the official verification system. “No one at Bluesky has ever talked to me about verification. I sure have a lot of legwork done if they’d like to!” hewrote. So far, these “unofficial” labels and badges havenot disappearedfrom users’ accounts, but the future of the labeler remains uncertain. “We will keep going if it’s needed but, frankly, I hope this ultimately moves to a single, clear source of credible verification,” Huntersaidon Bluesky. Rapper and musicianFlavor Flavhad also helped toconfirmwhich Bluesky accounts were authentic in the social network’s earlier days. His guidance may also no longer be required once the verification system fully rolls out. (Unless he becomes a Trusted Verifier on his own, we suppose!) In theory, those granted a Trusted Verifier status should be … trustworthy. But what happens if one goes rogue and begins to operate unethically, like taking payments for verification? There’s no detailed process for how this will be handled, nor is there an official set of rules that Trusted Verifiers have to agree to as of yet — as far as we can tell. But it appears that Bluesky has considered the possibility. When asked in a Bluesky post what would happen in the case that a Trusted Verifier abused its privilege in some way, CTO Paul Frazeerespondedthat “Bluesky can intervene if needed.” Lastly, some people wondered if adopting a similar look and feel to Twitter’s checks made sense. Bluesky is different, so shouldn’t it use some other design language? Frazeereplied to questionsabout this, too, sayingat different timesthe company had tried other colors, like green, but found that blue better matched Bluesky’s existing color palette. The team has not officially explained why it went with a traditional checkmark instead of a blue butterfly, for instance,as many have suggested. Likely, though, it’s just a matter of the check being a recognized symbol with an understood meaning. Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The app is available oniOSandAndroid. All of the app’s features will be accessible for free at launch. However, Instagram head Adam Mosserisaid earlier this monththat later versions of Edits may include paid features. The company first shared that it was working on Edits back in January after ByteDance-owned CapCut was removed from U.S. app stores when the TikTok ban momentarily went into effect. Although the app has since come back online and is available to download, TikTok’s future in the U.S.remains uncertain, so Meta is ready to capitalize on CapCut’s possible absence in the future. The launch of the new app also allows Meta and Instagram to push creators of all kinds to use Edits as opposed to CapCut for all of their short-form content. In its announcement post, Instagram notes that Edits is designed to help creators make videos not just for Instagram or Facebook, but also for “any platform,” which is likely a reference to competitors like TikTok and YouTube Shorts. It’s worth noting that one major difference between Edits and CapCut is the fact that Edits lets you export videos watermark-free. In comparison, you need to pay for CapCut Pro to export a video without a watermark. As for the features themselves, the app’s “Ideas” tool allows you to jot down ideas for new videos, while the “Projects” feature helps you organize and manage different creations in one place. The “Inspirations” tool lets you browse through trending audio to create videos with audio you discover. Edits’ “Green screen” feature lets you replace the background of your videos. Plus, the “Timeline” feature helps you arrange and adjust clips. You can also add automatic captions to your videos, along with music from Instagram’s library. In addition, you can turn static images into videos using AI thanks to the app’s “Animate” feature. The app’s “Cutouts” feature allows you to isolate specific objects with precision tracking. Once you’re happy with your video, you can share it directly to Instagram or Facebook from within the app. Or, you can choose to export the video to post it on other platforms. Edits also features insights that can help you learn about your content strategy and factors that could impact your reach and distribution. Meta has teased a few new features that will be available on Edits in the future, including a “Modify” tool that will allow creators to use AI to alter the “look and feel” of their videos. Additionally, a “Keyframes” feature lets users pick specific moments to change the position, rotation, or size of their clips. Plus, creators will soon be able to collaborate with other creators or brands to get feedback on their drafts. Meta also plans to release more fonts, text animations, transitions, voice effects, filters, sound effects, and music options in the future.

During his time there, Valkov realized that artificial intelligence “was about to unlock capabilities…in the application layer in the software stack.” He left Meta in late 2021 to startLace AI, a startup that has developed AI-driven customer service software for home service companies. The path to entrepreneurship started when Valkov was a boy, working in the family grocery store business. It taught him the power of telephone customer service. As an adult, he began to look for ways to combine his interest in AI and customer service. The idea for Lace was born. Taking his years of software engineering experience at VMware and Meta, Valkov teamed up with Stan Stoyanov and aimed to marry AI with customer service to help businesses generate additional revenue. The pair talked to more than 100 companies in different industries and verticals and discovered that in the home services vertical, many sales begin with a call made to a call center. Home services include companies such as HVAC, plumbing, and roofing, among others. The premise behind Lace is that if a customer calls in to one of these businesses, it can either convert into a sale — or not. The company claims its software can help improve the chances of call conversions. Specifically, Lace’s revenue intelligence software uses AI technology to analyze all the calls coming into these businesses to detect lost revenue opportunities. It claims that it’s more comprehensive than other similar offerings in that it monitors 100% of the calls rather than a portion of them. It analyzes each interaction “to ensure that no potential lead or opportunity is missed,” according to Valkov. The Mountain View-based company works with over 100 businesses, such as A1 Garage Door Service, Sage Home, Eco Plumbers, Matrix, and Lee’s Air. Valkov declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only that Lace saw 1,000% annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth in 2024. (However, it only started selling to customers at the end of 2023.) The company operates a SaaS (software-as-a-service) business model, charging a monthly fee per agent or customer support representative. Even just a 1% increase in bookings could be material for a home services or a home remodeling company. For example, a company with $300 million in revenue experiencing a 1% increase would see its revenue increase by $3 million. Some businesses that use Lace see double-digit revenue growth, Valkov said. And today, Lace is announcing a total of $19 million in funding since its early 2022 inception, the company tells TechCrunch exclusively. The total raised includes a previously unannounced $5 million pre-seed round led by Canvas Ventures and, more recently, a $14 million seed raise led by Bek Ventures. Other backers include Horizon VC, Launchub, and Snowflake’s co-founder Marcin Zukowski, Vivino’s Heini Zachariassen, and other founders. Valkov declined to reveal valuation, saying only that the seed financing was an “up” round. Mehmet Atici, managing partner at Bek Ventures, said he was drawn to invest in Lace in part because of its experienced team. “There’s a growing trend of applying AI to make a real impact in sectors historically underserved by tech, and this team has a keen understanding of how to do just that — accurately identifying and addressing the needs of these often overlooked segments represents an enormous opportunity,” he told TechCrunch. Presently, Lace has 20 employees. It plans to triple the size of the company with its new funding.

The Bengaluru-based startup confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s targeting a post-money valuation of $1.4 billion. Last September, the startup sought a valuation of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, TechCrunch reported at the time. Ather cited market conditions for trimming its IPO size and target valuation. Existing Ather shareholders will sell 11.1 million shares, down from the 22 million shares mentioned in last year’s draft prospectus. Bidding for Ather shares will open for three days starting April 28; anchor investors are set to participate in a private placement on April 25. Ather co-founders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, as well as National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Limited (NIIF) and Tiger Global Management’s Internet Fund III, plan to offload their stakes in the IPO, according to the draft prospectus. However, the Indian two-wheeler giant Hero MotoCorp, which owns over 40% of the startup, will not sell its shares. Ather said it will use 9.27 billion Indian rupees ($108.8 million) from the net proceeds to set up an electric two-wheeler facility in Maharashtra. Another 7.5 billion rupees ($88 million) will be invested in research and development and 3 billion rupees ($35.2 million) in marketing initiatives. The startup will also use 400 million Indian rupees ($4.7 million) to repay its borrowings. The startup saw a 21% increase in sales in 2024, reaching 126,353 units, according to government data. It commanded a 10.7% market share that year, per the CRISIL Report referenced in the draft prospectus. Incorporated in 2013, Ather launched its first electric two-wheeler in 2018. The startup reported it generated 15.79 billion Indian rupees ($185.4 million) in revenue in the nine months ended December, with a net loss of 5.78 billion Indian rupees ($67.8 million) — down from 7.76 billion Indian rupees ($91.1 million) a year earlier. Ather’s rival Ola Electric — which held a 34.1% market share last year — listed on the Indian stock exchanges last year.

The market for synthetic speech tools is vast and growing. ElevenLabs is one of the largest players, but there’s no shortage of challengers (seePlayAI,Sesame, and so on). Investors believe that these tools have immense potential.According to PitchBook, startups developing voice AI tech raised over $398 million in VC funding last year. Toby Kim, one of the Korea-based co-founders ofNari Labs, the group behind the newly released model, said that he and his fellow co-founder started learning about speech AI three months ago. Inspired by NotebookLM, they wanted to create a model that offered more control over generated voices and “freedom in the script.” Kim says they used Google’s TPU Research Cloud program, which provides researchers with free access to the company’s TPU AI chips, to train Nari’s model, Dia. Weighing in at 1.6 billion parameters, Dia can generate dialogue from a script, letting users customize speakers’ tones and insert disfluencies, coughs, laughs, and other nonverbal cues. Parameters are the internal variables models use to make predictions. Generally, models with more parameters perform better. Available from the AI dev platformHugging FaceandGitHub, Dia can run on most modern PCs with at least 10GB of VRAM. It generates a random voice unless prompted with a description of an intended style, but it can also clone a person’s voice. In TechCrunch’s brief testing of Dia through Nari’sweb demo, Dia worked quite well, uncomplainingly generating two-way chats about any subject. The quality of the voices seems competitive with other tools out there, and the voice cloning function is among the easiest this reporter has tried. Here’s a sample: Like many voice generators, Dia offers little in the way of safeguards, however. It’d be trivially easy to craft disinformation or a scammy recording. On Dia’s project pages, Nari discourages abuse of the model to impersonate, deceive, or otherwise engage in illicit campaigns, but the group says it “isn’t responsible” for misuse. Nari also hasn’t disclosed which data it scraped to train Dia. It’s possible Dia was developed using copyrighted content —a commenteron Hacker News notes that one sample sounds like the hosts of NPR’s “Planet Money” podcast. Training models on copyrighted content is a widespread but legally dubious practice. Some AI companies claim that fair use shields them from liability, while rights holders assert that fair use doesn’t apply to training. In any event, Kim says Nari’s plan is to create a synthetic voice platform with a “social aspect”  on top of Dia and larger, future models. Nari also intends to release a technical report for Dia, and to expand the model’s support to languages beyond English.

After co-founding AI note-taking app Mem —one of OpenAI’s earliest venture investments— he has now launched a new startup calledAdaptive Computer. Its grandiose mission is nothing less than a complete reimagining of personal computer software. He wants non-programmers to be using full-featured apps that they’ve created themselves, simply by entering a text prompt into Adaptive’s no-code web-app platform. To make that happen, Xu and co-founder Mike Soylu just announced a $7 million seed round, led by Pebblebed with participation from Conviction, Weekend Fund, Jake Paul’s Anti Fund, Roblox CEO Dave Baszucki, and others. (Pebblebed is a relatively new seed fund founded by Pamela Vagata, an AI engineer formerly of Stripe, and Keith Adams, former chief architect at Slack.) Prior to LLMs, Xu said he had to work with designers, who worked with the engineers “basically influencing people” to build the things he envisioned. (He left Mem in 2023.) But now, “we’d be able to put something in every person’s pocket where they could actually build the personal computer of their dreams,” as he describes it. To be certain, this isn’t about the computer itself or any hardware — despite the company’s name. The startup currently only builds web apps. However, for every app it builds, Adaptive Computer’s engine handles creating a database instance, user authentication, file management, and can create apps that include payments (via Stripe), scheduled tasks, and AI features such as image generation, speech synthesis, content analysis, and web search/research. In demoing its product, called ac1, which is still in “alpha mode” (meaning it has limited features and functionality), I gave it a text prompt asking for a bicycle ride log app. A minute later,it built a JavaScript-based app, complete with back-end database, with no further configuration needed on my part. While this app didn’t integrate with third-party services like my fitness watch, it did automatically add features like sorting rides, tallying total distance, and comparing rides. This was also a fully functional website, not a prototype, that could be shared with others to log their own rides, without sharing my personal data. As interesting as this idea is, Adaptive Computer is hardly the first and only “vibe coding” platform out there, meaning writing code based on text prompts. Competitor Replit claims to haveover 30 million usersand has begun to cater to non-programmers so heavily that its founder CEO, Amjad Masad, caused outrageby declaring on X last month.“I no longer think you should learn to code.” Fast on both companies’ heels is Lovable, which claims its vibe coding project is not just good fornon-programmers, but better for designing than Figma.The early-stage Swedish startup claims it grew its customer base to $10 million in ARR in its first 60 days. Xu says the difference between these more established products and his startup is that the others were originally geared toward making programming easier for programmers. And that means non-programmers could struggle to use them. “Try building an AI tool with either, and they’ll ask you for API keys,” Xu says, noting that it’s these kinds of details that create difficulty for non-programmers. “We’re building for the everyday person who is interested in creating things to make their own lives better. Their users are people who are building apps for other people.” Besides taking care of the back-end database and other technical details, Adaptive apps can work together. For instance, a user can build a file-hosting app and the next app can access those files. Xu likens this as more like an “operating system” rather than a single Web app. Other examples of apps created by early users include AI generated storytelling; a coffee bean e-commerce site; and a text-to-speech reader for PDF files. Adaptive Computer has three subscription levels: a limited free version; a $20/month tier; and a $100/month Creator/Pro. Here’s a peek.

The tie-up with Delta is designed to further align the ride-hail giant with airport travel, which has historically been a lucrative segment for Uber. The ride-hailing company also announced plans Tuesday to expand its new affordable Airport Shuttle product to Atlanta after successful launches in New York City. Uber’s airport plays come at a time when market uncertainty, lower consumer confidence, and increased border scrutiny are leading many Americans topull back on travel spendingthis year. Perhaps such uncertainty means that now, more than ever, price-savvy customers have to find ways to game the system. Uber customers who joined the waitlist will be able to link their accounts starting Tuesday, and everyone else can start Thursday. Here’s how Uber users with Delta SkyMiles memberships can rack up miles once they’ve linked their accounts: Uber riders can’t stack up miles by reserving an airport ride, but an Uber spokesperson said the customer will get SkyMiles from the trip that yields the highest reward. Aside from the ability to rack up miles, Uber and Delta are integrating in other ways. Customers who buy a flight using the Fly Delta app will be able to tack on an Uber Reserve booking so they can reserve their ride to and from the airport. And later this year, SkyMiles Members who log into WiFi on their flights will receive an offer of 30% off to book an Uber for pickup when they land.

    "title": "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge",
    "article_text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk says he will cut back his role in Donald Trump's administration after the company's profits and revenues plunged during the first three months of the year. Sales slumped and the electric carmaker faced a backlash as Musk became a political fixture in the White House. On Tuesday, the firm reported a 20% drop in automotive revenue in the first quarter of 2025, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand. The recent dip in the company's fortunes came amid an outcry over Musk's role in Trump's new administration, which he acknowledged had taken his focus off the company. The tech boss contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election. He also leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) initiative to cut federal spending and slash the government workforce. Musk said his \"time allocation to Doge\" would \"drop significantly\" starting next month. He would, he said, spend only one to two days per week on government matters \"as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful\". His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla around the world. He blamed the \"blowback\" on people who would \"try to attack me and the Doge team\". But he called his work at Doge \"critical\" and said \"getting the government house in order is mostly done\". Tesla brought in $19.3bn (£14.5bn) in total revenue in the quarter, down 9% year on year, according to the new numbers. That was less than the $21.1bn expected by analysts, and came as the company cut prices in a bid to woo buyers. Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla, the company indicated. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company. \"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said. Musk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro. Earlier this month, he called Navarro a \"moron\" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but a \"car assembler, in many cases\". On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\". \"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said on Tuesday. Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past. Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations \"rock-bottom\" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years. The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks. \"Tesla's problems are mounting,\" he said. Trump also expressed optimism that trade relations with China can be improved and a deal can be reached. The influential financial agency is projecting slower economic growth in the US due to uncertainty around President Trump's tariffs. A team of Democratic lawmakers have met with two students who are currently in immigration detention in Louisiana. Over 1,300 VOA employess - including about 1,000 journalists - were put on  leave  following President Donald Trump's executive order. The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",

    "title": "Three more UK interest rate cuts this year, predicts IMF",
    "article_text": "The Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year despite the UK grappling with higher-than-expected inflation, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. The organisation predicted UK inflation would be the highest in the world's advanced economies this year at 3.1%, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water. The fund also said the UK economy would grow less than previously predicted, up 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs. The report comes as top economic policymakers meet in Washington this week at the IMF's spring gathering. The downgrade in the outlook for the UK economy is neverthelessahead of predictions for France, Italy and Germany. US President Donald Trump's tariffs, a steep increase in borrowing costs and a hit from inflation all contributed to the downgrade. IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters that the IMF expected three more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England in 2025 after a quarter-point cut in February. The report said that the spike in inflation expected this year would be a \"temporary phenomenon\" which would leave room for rate cuts. However, Trump tariffs could also push down the pace of UK price rises as goods are diverted away from the US. The IMF expects UK inflation to slow to 2.2% by 2026, close to the Bank's 2% target. In response to the predictions, Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted how the IMF still saw stronger economic growth in the UK in 2025 than in Europe's other big countries. \"The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade,\" Reeves said. She is due to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent where she is expected to make Britain's case for a trade agreement with Washington that would lower or eliminate US tariffs on British goods. Mr Gourinchas said the global economy still bore \"significant scars\" from the \"severe shocks of the past four years\". \"It is now being severely tested once again,\" he added. The US growth forecast for this yearwas given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the IMF becayse of uncertainty caused by trade tariffs. US growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% in January. Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries. In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% on US products. The US has also introduced a 10% tax on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while suspending much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days. Trump argues that tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country. Economic uncertainty globally and in the UK means there are conflicting forces at play with prices. Inflation falls in the year to March as the price of petrol drops. The rate at which prices are rising remains above the Bank of England's 2% inflation target. Choice of home loans requiring small deposits of 5% or 10% reaches levels last seen in the 2008 financial crisis. The number of job vacancies and people on payrolls fell ahead of changes to  National Insurance and wages.",

    "title": "World leaders from Trump to Zelensky to attend Pope's funeral",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis's funeral will take place on Saturday in St Peter's Square, the Vatican has confirmed, with hundreds of thousands expected to attend. The head of the Catholic Church died of a stroke on Monday, aged 88, less than 24 hours after leading an Easter address. He had been in poor health after recently battling double pneumonia. A host of world leaders and royals  - including Sir Keir Starmer, Donald Trump, the Prince of Wales, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, home to the biggest Catholic population in the world - have confirmed their attendance. Thousands of mourners have already flocked to Vatican City, carrying flowers, crosses and candles and reciting prayers. On Tuesday, the Vatican released further details of the Pope's final 24 hours. Francis, who had recently spent five weeks in hospital, was slightly apprehensive about appearing on the balcony on Sunday. \"Do you think I can do this?\" the Pope asked his personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti. Strappetti reassured him and moments later the pontiff appeared on the balcony, blessing the crowd gathered in St Peter's Square below. The following morning at around 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT), Francis began to feel unwell. An hour later, he waved at Strappetti before slipping into a coma. \"Those who were near him in those moments say he didn't suffer,\" the Vatican said in a statement. \"It was a discreet death.\" On Wednesday morning, Pope Francis's body will be taken in a procession led by cardinals from the Chapel of Santa Marta to St Peter's Basilica, where he will remain in an open coffin until Friday to allow mourners to pay their respects. Just before the procession, a moment of prayer will be led by the camerlengo, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is running the Vatican in the wake of the Pope's death. The Vatican has released photos of the Pope's body lying in the chapel at Casa Santa Marta  - his residence during his 12-year papacy - dressed in a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary in his hand. The general public will be able to visit St Peter's Basilica from 11:00 to midnight on Wednesday, 07:00 to midnight on Thursday and 07:00 to 19:00 on Friday. Bucking tradition, there will be no private viewing for cardinals, at Pope Francis's request. The Pope's coffin will also not be raised on a pedestal. The funeral will start at 10:00 in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. Patriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests from across the globe will take part.  The dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, will lead the service. Cardinal Battista Re will deliver the final commendation and valediction - a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God - and the pontiff's body will be moved to St Mary Major for the burial. A nine-day mourning period, known as Novemdiales, then begins. Huge crowds are anticipated on Saturday, with as many as 250,000 people expected to attend the funeral. Many heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance,including Prince William, US President Donald Trump, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia and French President Emmanuel Macron. Other political figures who have announced theywill attend include: Pope Francis, who famously eschewed some of the pomp of the papacy during his life, will continue to break with tradition in death. Historically, popes are buried in triple coffins in marble tombs inside St Peter's Basilica at the heart of the Vatican. Pope Francis requested that he instead be buried at Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. He will become the first pope in more than 100 years to be laid to rest outside the Vatican. In his final testament, Pope Francis also asked to be buried \"in the earth, simple, without particular decoration\" and with the inscription only of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus. His body was moved into the Santa Marta chapel on Monday evening, and his apartment formally sealed, the Vatican said. Following the funeral, a conclave of cardinals will convene to elect a successor. The dean of the College of Cardinals has 15 to 20 days to summon the cardinals to Rome once the Pope is buried. Several names have already been floated as potential successors, with more likely to emerge in the coming days.

Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff. Pope Francis met former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle in 2018 as part of a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland. Pope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire. Tributes have been paid after Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at his residence in the Vatican.",

    "title": "Will the next Pope be from Africa?",
    "article_text": "If the sole predictor of who would become the next Pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa. The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase. While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago - many would argue it is high time for another. When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making? \"I think that it will be great to have an African Pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation. But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\". \"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said. \"If you think about African cardinals who are potential popes, who is prominent in global Catholicism today? The answer is none.\" A contrast, he said, to 2013 when Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson was a strong contender for the position and 2005 when Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI. This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center. \"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilu said. Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in Catholics on the continent. They now make up 20% of the worldwide congregation, with the latest figures showing how they surged from 272 million in 2022 to 281 million in 2023. But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at Notre Dame University in Indiana. For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism. \"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a Pope,'\" he told me. \"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate. \"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\" The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the Pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\". \"The Pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said. In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican. He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\". \"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\" Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa. For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers. His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015 and kissing the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later. But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues. Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples. The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\". It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries. The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Robert Sarah of Guinea and DR Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue. The Congolese cardinal has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\". Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\" And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\". Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church. And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa. \"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said. \"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African Pope.\" As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised. It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\". But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable. \"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction. \"I would pray that God will give us a Pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.\" Go toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.

    "title": "'One-of-a-kind' girl born with heart outside chest has pioneering surgery",
    "article_text": "Vanellope Hope Wilkins made medical history whenshe was bornwith her heart outside of her body in 2017. Described by experts as \"one of a kind\", Vanellope had three operations to place her heart back in her chest due to an extremely rare condition called ectopia cordis. The hospital where she was born - Glenfield Hospital in Leicester - says it knows of no other case in the UK where the baby has survived. Now seven years old, Vanellope has undergone groundbreaking surgery to reconstruct a protective cage around her heart - using her ribs. The BBC was given exclusive access into theatre, when the operation took place at the East Midlands Congenital Heart Centre, based at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, last Wednesday. Warning: This story contains an image of surgery It's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place. Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin. Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest. Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November. Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before. \"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\" He remembers how \"everything was unknown\" when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case. A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition. Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival. But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital. Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart. She has complex medical needs, which require one-to-one care, 24 hours a day. She is autistic and non-verbal. Mum Naomi Findlay, 39, who lives in Clifton, Nottinghamshire, described her daughter as \"a happy little thing\" who \"brings a lot of joy and a lot of happiness\". She added: \"It makes me extremely proud to see actually how how far she's come, what she's overcome and what she is achieving. It's a real journey of strength and bravery... she's so brave.\" Having to kiss her daughter goodbye at the theatre door is difficult and the tears flow. \"A lot of anxiety, a lot of worry and so many emotions,\" she says. \"For me, the biggest fear is handing her over and not getting her back.\" The team waiting in theatre include specialists from the Congenital Heart Centre, Leicester Children's Hospital and a visiting cardiothoracic surgeon from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Consultant congenital cardiac surgeon, Ikenna Omeje, operated on Vanellope just 50 minutes after she was born. He recalls there being a lot of \"head scratching\" among surgeons, because the condition was so rare. \"It was exciting for everyone because it was something we had never seen before. So you made the news, not just within the UK, but all over the world,\" he says. Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope's chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it. Detaching it \"is risky\", he confesses. \"You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,\" he said. Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart. Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs. This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the \"very tricky\" procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin. Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart. Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says. The extremely complex procedure lasts more than nine hours. And it's a success. The surgeons are delighted. Mr Omeje is beaming as he says it \"went a lot better than we expected\". He describes how he examined an X-ray of Vanellope's chest after the operation, and called it \"really beautiful\". Mr Omeje called Vanellope \"one of a kind\" and explained how fulfilling it was to have everything go so well. \"The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mum to say 'thank you, you guys are amazing',\" he says. \"I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying.\" Vanellope is taken to the children's paediatric intensive care unit and will spend some time in hospital recovering. After a few weeks, she will be able to take off her protective chest brace and won't require any further surgery in the future. Her mum called the NHS \"amazing\", and says she can't wait to take her home to her older brothers and little sister. Looking to the future, she hopes this surgery will improve Vanellope's \"already really, really good quality of life\". And Naomi says this time, she's ready for the long journey ahead. \"When [Vanellope] was born I was fearful. It was very scary for me, but this time round I'm ready. \"We've got this,\" she added.

    "title": "Gaza health ministry denies manipulating death toll figures",
    "article_text": "At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Alam Hirzallah resigns himself to a grim task: registering the deaths of the wife and two children of his grieving cousin. His family brought the bodies here on an electric rickshaw or tuk-tuk. They found them in their house in eastern Gaza City after Israeli shelling hit the family home. Asma Hirzallah, Mayar, 5, and Abdullah, 3, were killed. \"The hospital asked for their full names and ID numbers,\" explains Alam, referring to the numbers all Palestinians are given in a population registry administered by Israel. \"They gave us a paper to confirm they were martyred and told us to come back for the death certificate. Now we don't know where to go to bury them as the cemeteries are in areas under Israeli control.\" At least 51,266 people have been killed in the 18 months since the Gaza war began, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, with nearly a third of the dead aged under 18. Israel has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the Palestinian fatalities list - in terms of overall numbers, and in particular, the demographic breakdown - claiming it is used as Hamas propaganda. The figures are cited with attribution, by UN agencies and widely in the media. The list does not distinguish between civilians and members of Palestinian armed groups who are killed in the war, and Israel has accused Hamas of inflating the percentages of women and children. Recently, several media reports have raised questions about the reliability of the statistics by highlighting anomalies between the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities.  The reports focus on how some 3,000 names of people originally identified as fatalities were removed from later revised lists. A Gazan health official, Zaher al-Wahidi, denied to the BBC that victims had vanished or that there was a lack of transparency, insisting: \"The health ministry works towards having accurate data with high credibility. \"In every list that gets shared, there is a greater verification and revision of the list.  We cannot say that the health ministry removes names.  It's not a removal process, rather it is a revision and verification process.\" So how are the statistics gathered and how accurate are they? Until the first months of this war, the number of people killed in Gaza was calculated from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals - like those of Asma Hirzallah and her children. Medics could log data for all deaths into a centralised computer system, which was based at a Ministry of Health office at al-Shifa hospital, with a back-up at al-Rantissi hospital. However, as conditions became more chaotic and medical sites repeatedly came under attack, this method became less reliable. During the war, Israel says it has targeted hospitals – which have protected status under international law – because Hamas has used them to hide its fighters and infrastructure – something the armed group denies. From the start of 2024, Gazan health officials introduced online forms which relatives could use to report their loved ones dead or missing. According to Mr Wahidi, the head of statistics at the health ministry, most of the names which were recently removed from the official list as part of a new checking process had originally been submitted using these forms.  He says that names which are taken off may later be added back \"A judicial committee was set up and it looks into all of the cases received,\" Mr Wahidi says. \"To ensure credibility we verify the data so that it will be accurate.\" During investigations by the judicial committee, some people were found to have died of natural causes – not directly because of the war.  When Gazans die from lack of medical treatment, malnutrition or hyperthermia, Mr Wahidi clarifies \"these cases are indirect and do not get added to the lists.\" Other individuals were wrongly listed as dead but then found to have been among thousands of Gazans imprisoned by Israel. Mr Wahidi confirms that in August and then October, a total of more than 3,000 names were removed from the list, saying this was a precautionary measure pending full checks. For some pro-Israel groups, such as media watchdog HonestReporting, this was strong indication of \"deliberate manipulation, not honest error\". There had been a widespread presumption that only checked names were included on the online lists published. \"It seems like they're actually updating the lists more in real time, as more information appears,\" says Professor Mike Spagat of Royal Holloway College, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. \"We should have regarded the previous lists as a little bit more provisional than I had assumed.\" However, he says he detects no attempt by health officials to mislead and sees the changes as \"a big clean-up operation\". He points out that the latest modifications to the list led to a small increase in the percentage of adult males among those killed, countering the idea that the original inclusion of the 3,000-plus names was done in an attempt to exaggerate the proportion of women and children. The Gaza health ministry says it has also recently audited data in its official fatalities list from hospital mortuaries for errors and omissions. When deaths were registered by friends or neighbours, it says, they often did not know the ID numbers of those killed or their full names - which include the father and grandfather's names. In some cases, this resulted in the wrong people being marked as dead. Thousands of bodies that are still under the rubble left by Israeli air strikes, as well as about 900 which are unidentified, are not currently included in the health ministry list, the ministry says. However, the recent two-month ceasefire - which allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to what was left of their homes - saw nearly 800 corpses being retrieved, identified and registered. In late January,the BBC filmed workers from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agencyas they set about retrieving human remains which had been left for months in Wadi Gaza - also known as the Netzarim Corridor – after a pullout by Israeli forces. With no DNA testing available in Gaza, each corpse was given a serial number. Long forms were filled in to log the bones and clothing collected to try to identify the dead. \"We look for distinctive personal belongings: a watch, a necklace or an earring. When we search the bodies, it's very possible that we'll find a driver's licence or ID card,\" said Sameh Khalifa, who led the team. \"Even a broken tooth can be a distinguishing mark that will help a family recognise a missing loved one.\" Since the resumption of Israel's military offensive in Gaza on 18 March, the numbers killed have risen daily. Israel periodically estimates the number of Palestinian fighters killed. At the start of this year, it assessed that 20,000 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among the dead. In mid-April it said there had been \"more than 100 targeted eliminations\" in the past month. Israel does not provide its figures for civilian deaths in Gaza and has not officially challenged any of the names on the local health ministry casualty list. The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas led a cross-border attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people into captivity in Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military says that 408 of its soldiers have been killed in combat. International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side. We rely heavily on local Palestinian journalists working with us to access information about deadly attacks - interviewing witnesses as well as visiting bomb sites and hospital mortuaries to film footage, which is shared with us. Overall, the numbers killed in the past year and a half dwarf those from previous rounds of fighting in the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict and yet, for the moment, there is no end in sight to the war. Footage posted online shows a swimmer flailing in the distance as beachgoers yell in shock. Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed when the Israeli military opened fire on a convoy of vehicles in Gaza last month. Witnesses in al-Mawasi told the BBC that people were burned alive as tents were engulfed in flames. The group says it wants a deal that would free all hostages in return for an end to the war. The president of the Board of Deputies says he disagrees with the letter criticising the war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Who will be the next Pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable contest",
    "article_text": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics. It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons. The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails. With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective. For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\". For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next Pope. Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian Pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration? Here is a selection of names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor, and we expect more to emerge in the coming days. Pietro Parolin Nationality: Italian Age: 70 Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the Pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration. Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner. He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength. But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\". The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\" Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now. Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle Nationality: Filipino Age: 67 Could the next pope come from Asia? Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law. The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle. He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope. He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia. But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect. The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected. Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\" Fridolin Ambongo Besungu Nationality: Congolese Age: 65 It's very possible the next Pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis. He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\". Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church. But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\" Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world. Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson Nationality: Ghanaian Age: 76 If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years. Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a Pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013. Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next Pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the Pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\". He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II. Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential Pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting. A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence. Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana. In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence. Back in 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised. Pope Francis met former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle in 2018 as part of a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland. The pontiff's body will lie in St Peter's Basilica from Wednesday until Friday to allow mourners to pay their respects. The Vatican has released photos of Pope Francis in an open coffin, dressed in a red robe with the papal mitre on his head and a rosary in his hands. Hereford and Worcester church leaders say the late Pope has left a strong legacy. The 88-year-old's death has set in motion the centuries-old process of electing a new Pope.",

    "title": "Veteran Vatican reporter David Willey reflects on changed Church",
    "article_text": "David Willey, who spent decades reporting from Rome for the BBC, reflects on the transformation of the Vatican under Francis - the eighth Pope of our former correspondent's lifetime. I have suddenly realised with something of shock that I am already not only four years older than the late Pope Francis, but that my own life now extends through no fewer than eight successive papal reigns. During my professional lifetime I have managed to meet, report on and follow the lives of five of them. So I have a fairly panoramic view of the Church leadership of the past century. The age of Pius XI (1857-1939), during which I was born, already seems wreathed in remote history, compared with the modern Vatican, which communicates through its own video service and website, and runs public debates on how to deal with the longevity problems of an ever more ageing priesthood. It also aids media savvy outlets like the BBC in documenting the historic events through which we are currently passing during the so-called Vacancy of the Holy See, accurately and extensively. On my first ever visit to the Vatican when I was a student, I remember glimpsing Pope Pius XII being carried aloft inside Saint Peter's on his gestatorial chair flanked by elaborately costumed flunkies bearing ostrich plumes. It resembled a scene from one of Verdi's operas. Then when I started my apprenticeship in international journalism in Rome with Reuters News Agency back in the 1950s, I also remember we depended upon a corrupt Vatican official to get the text of an important papal speech ahead of delivery. It was my job to take the bus down to the cafe opposite the main workers' entrance to Vatican City at eight in the morning one Easter Sunday to surreptitiously pick up a document that he had smuggled out. Now after following three different popes on their journeys around the world as a member of the Vatican's travelling press corps, and witnessing the changes in Catholic mentality inspired by Pope Francis, I see a very different Vatican. The crowds of pilgrims and tourists are back here, for this is currently a Jubilee year, celebrated by the Catholic Church once every 25 years. Michelangelo's awesome frescoes of the Sistine Chapel are still stunning first-time visitors, but the papal crown has long been put aside and the Pope moves among adoring crowds on a popemobile, or a small family car, not a sedan chair. Dogma is out, empathy is in, and Francis's question about an errant bishop: \"Who am I to judge?\", still tingles in my mind. He once used an unexpectedly shocking simile to denounce what he termed \"hypocritical clericalism\". \"An example I often use to illustrate the reality of vanity is this,\" he said. \"Look at the peacock; it's beautiful if you look at it from the front. But if you look at it from behind, you discover the truth… Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them.\" One of the cardinals touted as a possible successor to Pope Francis is a modest Italian priest I used to meet in the Rome streets of Trastevere, where he was once of the founder members of a small Catholic community devoted equally to helping poor people and dabbling in high diplomacy on an international level. Yet after domination by Italians and cardinals of other European nations for generations, and the first ever pope from Latin America, the Vatican leadership is now genuinely open to other continents. There is a very really possibility of the next pope coming from Asia or Africa. Much will depend upon the personal contacts that develop among the cardinals themselves, both electors and those over the age of 80 who have lost the right to vote, arriving in Rome from around the world during the coming days. Many of them come from countries that have never before had a ranking church leader. The daily confidential pow wow that precedes the actual conclave will enable many of them to meet for the first time and decide to what extent they want to restore the past or look to the future. Popes enjoy rockstar status in overwhelmingly Catholic Philippines. And yet, Pope Francis was special. Pope Francis met former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle in 2018 as part of a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland. The pontiff's body will lie in St Peter's Basilica from Wednesday until Friday to allow mourners to pay their respects. Pope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire. The Prince of Wales will represent the King at the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican on Saturday.",

    "title": "Pope Francis lies in open coffin in Vatican chapel - in pictures",
    "article_text": "The Vatican has released several photographs of Pope Francis lying in an open coffin in the chapel of the Casa Santa Marta, his former residence. We've taken a look at who was in the chapel and some of the symbolism on show in the images. The most notable figure in the room is Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's \"camerlengo\" or chamberlain and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen. The cardinal - in redmozzettaand cassock - is shown blessing the body of the late Pope during the rite of the declaration of death. Pope Francis is dressed in red robes, holding a rosary and wearing the papal mitre - the large white ceremonial headdress. He is also wearing a simple silver ring. During his inauguration, Pope Francis was given the Fisherman's Ring - a symbol of his office - which Cardinal Farrell has the responsibility to destroy so it cannot be used by anyone else. Pope Francis sometimes used this ring during ceremonies but  was more often seen using the simple silver ring adorned with a cross. One of the significant changes in tradition is the coffin that Pope Francis will be buried in. The coffins used for previous papal burials consisted of three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak - but Pope Francis asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket. He will remain in the open coffin for the lying in state, whereas other popes have been laid out resting on cushions on a platform. The chapel itself is nestled within the Casa Santa Marta, a residential building containing more than 100 simple rooms that was built in 1996. Triangular shapes are present throughout the chapel, in the construction of the ceiling and on the floor tiles, representing the Holy Trinity - a key belief in Christianity where God exists as the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. On the ceiling behind the coffin is an inscription in Latin, which translates as \"Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of your faithful\". The Pope's body is guarded by members of the Vatican's Swiss Guard. They have protected the Pope since 1506, when Julius II first hired Swiss mercenaries for his personal protection. Pope Francis will stay in the chapel until Wednesday morning, when his body will be transferred to St Peter's Basilica in a procession starting at 09:00 local time. From then, he will lie in an open casket in the basilica, where mourners can pay their respects ahead of his funeral on Saturday. Popes enjoy rockstar status in overwhelmingly Catholic Philippines.

    "title": "What happens after the death of Pope Francis?",
    "article_text": "The funeral of Pope Francis will take place on Saturday, in front of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Preparations have begun for the conclave, the process by which cardinals will elect the next Pope. Pope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic Church, died on Easter Monday aged 88. The Vatican said he died following a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure at 07:35 local time (06:35 BST). His death was announced less than 24 hours after he led an Easter Sunday address in front of thousands of worshipersin St Peter's Square. It followed a period of ill-health that saw the Pope spend five weeks in hospital with double pneumonia. Francis, who was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Argentina, was elected Pope in 2013. Read more: The person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope is known as the \"camerlengo\" - currently Irish-American cardinal Kevin Farrell. He confirmed the Pope's death, with a doctor and death certificate. No autopsy is performed. Cardinal Farrell also locks and seals the Pope's home, and destroys the Pope's ring and lead seal, which is used to authenticate official documents. The camerlengo is also responsible for organising the conclave. They can become pope, but this has only happened twice: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. Read more: The Pope's funeralwill take place on Saturday, 26 April at 10:00 local time(09:00 BST). Papal funerals have historically been very elaborate, but instructions set out by Francis are much simpler. He will be the first Pope in more than a century not to be buried in the crypt of St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Instead, he will be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Francis asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket lined with zinc - unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. Dozens of world leaders and religious figures are expected to attend the funeral, alongside thousands of worshippers. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and French President Emmanuel Macron have said they will attend, as has EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. From Wednesday, the Pope's casket will be displayed in St Peter's Basilica for members of the public to pay their respects. Read more: The new Pope is elected by the College of Cardinals. They are all men who were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. There are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, but only 135 can cast ballots as those over the age of 80 can take part in debate but cannot vote. Traditionally the conclave doesn't start until after a 15-day mourning period. However, in 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict changed the rules to allow it to begin earlier if the cardinals wished. Read more: During the voting period, the cardinals are cut off from the outside world – denied phones and access to the internet or newspapers. They sleep in Casa Santa Marta, a five-story guesthouse within the Vatican complex. The election is held in strict secrecy inside the Sistine Chapel, famously painted by Michelangelo. Each cardinal votes for the candidate they wish to become Pope. They can vote for themselves if they wish. A new Pope is elected when a candidate has 90 votes - which can take several rounds. In previous centuries, conclaves have gone on for weeks or months. Some cardinals have even died during the process. Read more: To the outside world, the only information about how the conclave is progressing is smoke from the chapel's chimney when ballot papers are burned after each round of voting. Black smoke signals failure. White smoke means a new Pope has been chosen. The new Pope normally appears on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square within an hour of his selection. The senior cardinal confirms the decision with the words \"Habemus Papam\" - Latin for \"we have a Pope\" - and introduces the new pontiff by his chosen papal name, which may not be his original given name. For example, Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi. In theory, any Roman Catholic man who has been baptised can be considered. In practice, however, the cardinals prefer to select one of their own. In 2013, Francis became the first pontiff to hail from South America - a region that accounts for around 28% of the world's Catholics - and the southern hemisphere. Historical precedent suggests the cardinals are far more likely to pick a European - and especially an Italian. Of the 266 popes chosen to date, 217 have been from Italy. Several Vatican analysts have suggested Francis's successor could come from outside Europe - not least because the late Pope appointed more than 140 cardinals from beyond the continent. The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and is an important source of authority for the world's roughly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. They believe the Pope represents a direct line back to Jesus Christ. He is considered a living successor to St Peter, who was chief among Christ's initial disciples, the Apostles. About half of all Christians worldwide are Roman Catholics. Other denominations, including Protestants and Orthodox Christians, do not recognise the Pope's authority. The Pope lives in Vatican City, the smallest independent state in the world. It is surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. The Pope does not receive a salary, but all his travel costs and living expenses are paid for by the Vatican.

    "title": "'I've had 100 operations and will never stop' - inside China's cosmetic surgery boom",
    "article_text": "Abby Wu was just 14 when she had cosmetic surgery for the first time. After receiving hormone treatment for an illness, Abby's weight increased from 42kg (6 stone 8lbs) to 62kg (9 stone 11lbs) in two months. The change hadn't gone unnoticed by her drama teacher. \"My teacher said, 'You were our star but now you're too fat. Either give up or lose weight fast,'\" recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time. Abby's mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs. Abby remembers her mother's words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation. \"Just be brave and walk in. You'll become pretty once you're out.\" The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout. \"I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,\" she says. Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars. She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China's plastic surgery boom. But the surgeries have come at a physical cost. Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear \"firmer and less chubby\" after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone. But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago. \"The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.\" Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media. Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures. Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25. While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing. For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face. But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal. Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face. Lower eyelid surgery, inspired by the glassy gaze of anime heroines, widens the eyes for an innocent, childlike look. Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth. But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child. Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of \"facial imperfections\" - have been surging in popularity. After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation. These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal. As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched. Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's \"magic mirror\" feature, the app still points out \"imperfections\" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries. \"It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.\" Abby seems amused. \"Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?\" Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice. To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China. But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence. According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications. As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics. Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing. \"I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,\" Dr Yang says. \"Some even had surgery inside people's homes.\" Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have surgery that went badly wrong. In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened. \"My skin felt like there was cement underneath,\" she says. Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse. One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose. Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight. \"My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.\" She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic. But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent. \"I don't want to become prettier any more,\" she says. \"If I could go back to how I looked before surgery, I'd be quite happy.\" Every year, tens of thousands like Yue Yue fall victim to unlicensed cosmetic clinics in China. But even some licensed clinics and qualified surgeons aren't following the rules strictly. In 2020, actress Gao Liu's botched nose operation - in which the tip of her nose turned black and died - went viral. \"My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career.\" She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She's Time's from Dr He Ming, who was described as its \"chief surgeon\" and a nose surgery expert. But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission. Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months. However, weeks before She's Time's was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address. BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Time's and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He. The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021. Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches. Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. The Chinese Embassy in the UK said: \"The Chinese government consistently requires enterprises to operate in strict compliance with national laws, regulations, and relevant policy provisions.\" Four years and two repair operations later, Gao Liu's nose remains uneven. \"I really regret it. Why did I do it?\" China's Central Health Commission has been trying to crack down on the issue of under-qualified health practitioners performing tasks beyond their expertise in recent years - including ordering local health bodies to improve regulation and issuing stricter guidelines - but problems persist. In today's China, looking good is important for professional success. A quick search on popular job recruitment platforms reveals many examples of employers listing physical requirements for roles, even when they have little to do with the actual work. One receptionist role asks for candidates to be \"at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing\", while an administrative job demands \"an appealing look and an elegant presence\". And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers. Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a \"beauty consultant\" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024. After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening. But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job. Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide. Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (£1,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest. She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called \"beauty loan,\" falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved. By noon, she was undergoing medical tests. An hour later, she was on the operating table. From job offer to debt and surgery - all within 24 hours. The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her. She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real. \"They wanted me to leave from the beginning,\" she says. Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months. BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's \"capital of cosmetic surgery\". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years. The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role. This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries. Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame. But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table. In a bohemian-style café in Beijing, the perfect setting for a selfie, Abby meets her friends for coffee. The trio adjust their poses and edit their faces in great detail - extending eyelashes and reshaping their cheekbones. When asked what they like most about their facial features, they hesitate, struggling to name a single part they wouldn't consider altering. The conversation turns to chin implants, upper-lip shortening, and nose surgery. Abby says she's thinking about another nose job - her current one is six years old - but surgeons are finding it difficult to operate. \"My skin isn't as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don't have much to work with. You can't give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress.\" The metaphor lingers in the air, underscoring the toll taken by all of the operations. But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop. \"I don't think I'll ever stop my journey of becoming more beautiful.\" Zhong Changchun was sentenced to death in January for attacking the boy who later died of his injuries. The toy, sold by Chinese company Pop Mart, has become the must-have fashion accessory. The Yizhuang half marathon is the first time robots have raced alongside humans over such a distance. China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up? The charges will start in 180 days and rise in the coming years.",

    "title": "Why should I care if the US dollar falls?",
    "article_text": "The US dollar has seen big declines in recent months. Currencies rise and fall all the time but the recent drop in the dollar has been particularly dramatic. So why has the dollar been falling and why does it matter? The dollar was rising in the autumn in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election off the back of relatively strong US economic growth, and continued to strengthen after Trump's victory in November on hopes he might extend that trend. Talk of his trade policy also had an effect, as many investors thought the tariffs that he promised to bring in would push up inflation, forcing the US central bank, the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or at least not cut them as fast as expected. The prospect of higher rates in the US makes the dollar more attractive as it means investors will make more money on their cash in dollars compared to other currencies. But the calculus has shifted in recent months as the details of his tariffs have emerged - often followed by pauses or, in the case of China, extensions - leaving much uncertainty surrounding the impact they will have. US growth is now widely expected to weaken. That has had a knock-on impact on the dollar, which has seen steep falls.Trump's attacks on Fed chief Jerome Powellfor not cutting interest rates also appear to have added pressure to the greenback. The value of all currencies goes up and down influenced by many factors such as inflation expectations and central bank policies. But the dollar index, which measures its strength against a set of currencies, has fallen to its lowest level for three years. The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment in troubled times. So the sharp drops in the currency - as well as the recent sell-off inUS government bonds, also generally considered a safe US asset - are unusual. The fall in the dollar after Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement was \"quite shocking\", says Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy at Rabobank. \"For several years, the market's been buying this US growth story, the US stock market's been outperforming other stock markets, and suddenly you had economists thinking tariffs would push the US into recession,\" she says, pointing to the massive sell-off of US stocks, US bonds and the dollar. That has raised speculation about whether the drop might signal a more far-reaching turn away from the US, as well as away from the dollar. The first time ordinary Americans might notice a weaker dollar is when they go abroad, as their money will not go as far. While foreign tourists in the US will find their currency will buy them more. But movements in the dollar also have a massive impact internationally, more so than swings in other currencies do. That's because it is the world's primary reserve currency, meaning it is held by central banks around the world in large quantities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Central banks use US dollars in international transactions, to pay for international debt, or to support domestic exchange rates. The dollar is also the main currency used in international trade, with around half of world trade invoices done in US dollars, says Jane Foley. A fall in the dollar means US goods exports become cheaper. But imported goods may become more expensive due to the weaker currency, as well as any direct impact from tariffs. Many commodities that trade internationally, such as oil and gas, are also priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes crude oil cheaper for countries that hold other currencies. In the US a strong dollar has been seen as a symbol of American political might. The very idea that it might lose its status as the world's reserve currency has been unthinkable. Ms Foley says that while other currencies may become more important, the dollar won't lose its number one status any time soon, although one Federal Reserve official suggested last year thatthe US can no longer take this for granted. Ms Foley thinks the dollar will win back some ground over the next few weeks but will not get back to where it was. That's because with very significant market moves, there's always the possibility of profit taking. For instance, if investors decide to sell euros while they're trading strongly, that could lead to the euro falling and the dollar rising. The markets will be watching this week to see if Trump continues his attack on the head of the Federal Reserve. He has called Mr Powell \"a major loser\" and has publicly called for his \"termination\". If there is pressure on Powell to leave office, the markets will start to wonder about the Fed's credibility, something which is seen as crucial. \"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. The influential financial agency is projecting slower economic growth in the US due to uncertainty around President Trump's tariffs. The US suffers the biggest downgrade to growth among advanced economies, in the influential International Monetary Fund's latest forecast. US Vice-President JD Vance is currently on a four-day visit to India with his wife and three children. Beijing was responding to reports that the US will pressure other nations to restrict trade with China. The postal giant will stop shipping packages to American consumers after a rise in red tape at customs.",

    "title": "The record-breaking tunnel being built from Denmark to Germany",
    "article_text": "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe. Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel. It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together. The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark. The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\". \"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel. To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete. Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France – burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks. \"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\" With a price-tag around €7.4bn ($8.1bn; £6.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with €1.3bn from the European Commission. It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying. Once completed, the journey between Rødbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage. Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers. \"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\" Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead. \"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element. There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor. At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\" Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats. Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision. \"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\" Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes. With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark. A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration. \"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\" So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\" Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact. One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise. However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead. \"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock. When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day. According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says. It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions. \"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\" Trump also expressed optimism that trade relations with China can be improved and a deal can be reached. The tech boss says he intends to spend only one to two days a week on Trump administration matters. Signage states only buses, taxis and bicycles are allowed to pass through the bus gate in Bristol. Stagecoach will not accept cash for adult single fares will on two services in Kent. Several Chinese solar companies with factories across the region could face steep new tariffs.",

    "title": "Starmer does not believe trans women are women, No 10 says",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer does not believe transgender women are women, his official spokesman has said. It comes after the UK Supreme Court ruled last week that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. In March 2022, when he was leader of the opposition,Sir Keir told the Timesthat \"a woman is a female adult, and in addition to that transwomen are women, and that is not just my view - that is actually the law\". Asked if Sir Keir still believed that a transgender woman was a woman, the PM's official spokesman said: \"No, the Supreme Court judgment has made clear that when looking at the Equality Act, a woman is a biological woman.\" The spokesman added: \"That is set out clearly by the court judgment.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having U-turned in reaction to the judgement, accusing Labour ministers of needing the Supreme Court to tell them what to think on the issue. Pressed over when the PM had changed his mind earlier, his spokesman insisted the Labour government had been consistent that single-sex spaces \"are protected in law\". The ruling also makes it clear that a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have the right to use spaces or services designated as for women only. The spokesman stressed the PM had repeatedly said \"a woman is an adult female\" before the court judgment. In 2023,Sir Keir told The Sunday Timesthat for \"99.9%\" of women \"of course they haven't got a penis\". Later that year he told BBC Radio 5 Live \"a woman is an adult female\". And in April 2024 he said Rosie Duffield, who quit the party last year, was right to say \"only women have a cervix\", telling ITV: \"Biologically, she of course is right about that.\" Sir Keir had previously been critical of Duffield's views on trans people when she was a Labour MP, saying in 2021 that shewas \"not right\"to say only women have a cervix. Asked whether Sir Keir would now use a trans woman's preferred pronouns, the spokesman declined to comment on \"hypotheticals\" but insisted the PM had \"been clear that trans women should be treated with the same dignity and respect as anyone else\". Earlier on Tuesday Sir Keir welcomed the court's decision, saying it had given \"much-needed clarity\" for those drawing up guidance. In his first public comments since the ruling last week, the PM told ITV West Country: \"We need to move and make sure that we now ensure that all guidance is in the right place according to that judgment.\" Asked if he does not believe a transwoman is a woman, he said: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\" During a Commons debate on the ruling on Monday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson welcomed the \"added clarity\" of the ruling and said the government would work to \"protect single-sex spaces based on biological sex\". But Badenoch attacked Labour ministers' previous record, accusing them of being \"so desperate to jump on a bandwagon that they abandoned common sense\". \"I know what a woman is and I always have,\" she said. \"The people of this country know what a woman is. \"We didn't need the Supreme Court to tell us that - but this government did.\" Badenoch added: \"The idea that they have supported this all along is for the birds... They have never said this before, this is a U-turn, but we welcome it.\" Earlier, Phillipson was pressed over whether a trans woman should use a women's toilet or a men's toilet. \"That should be on the basis of biological sex - that would apply right across the board to all single-sex provision,\"she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"But the EHRC [Equality and Human Rights Commission] will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate and respect their privacy and dignity.\" Phillipson added that \"many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone\". Asked whether there was unity in the Labour Party about this issue, she replied: \"I speak for the government on this matter and I can be crystal clear with you that we welcome the ruling.\" Many Labour MPs will be uneasy about the comments from Sir Keir and Phillipson, although frustration did not seem to extend to being willing to criticise the government, but instead expressing concern about anxieties within the trans, non-binary and intersex community. In the debate following Phillipson's statement, Labour's Emily Thornberry said LGBT helpline calls had \"skyrocketed in recent days\" and highlighted that \"the overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community is the violence that we suffer from cis men\". Nadia Whittome pointed out that a ban on trans women using women's toilets, or trans men using men's toilets, would leave them using facilities they \"would not feel comfortable or safe in\". Liberal Democrat women and equalities spokeswoman Christine Jardine warned the ruling threatened the human rights and security \"of another vulnerable group in society\" and questioned where trans people should now seek refuge. Women and Equalities select committee chair, Labour's Sarah Owen, said the judges made their decision \"without a single contribution from trans people\" and won a commitment from Phillipson that trans \"stakeholders\" would be involved in the creation of upcoming guidance. Some MPs who have campaigned in support of trans rights pointed to commitments in Labour's general election manifesto to introduce a \"trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices\" as well as to \"modernise, simplify, and reform\" gender recognition law. Those are still Labour Party policies, as far as we are aware, but any sign of backsliding on that and this debate may again become a tense one within Labour's ranks. Correction: This article originally said that the ruling means that transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) can be excluded from single-sex spaces if \"proportionate\". However this is inaccurate and so this line has been removed from the story.

    "title": "Paddleboarder was guided to her death, court told",
    "article_text": "A paddleboarder was \"guided to her death\" on an excursion that saw four people killed, a court has heard. Paul O'Dwyer, 42, Andrea Powell, 41, Morgan Rogers, 24, and Nicola Wheatley, 40,drowned while paddleboardingin \"extremely hazardous conditions\" on the River Cleddau in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, in October 2021. Nerys Bethan Lloyd, 39, from Port Talbot, is the former owner of Salty Dog, the now-dissolved company that operated the tour, who is being sentenced over the deaths. Lloydpleaded guilty to manslaughterlast month and it was revealed she did not have the correct qualifications to run the tour. The group of seven participants and co-instructor Paul O'Dwyer set off after 09:00 on 30 October 2021. Mark Watson KC, prosecuting, told the court there had been heavy rain in the days before and \"the river was in flood conditions\" with a \"visibly strong current\". \"Of the eight individuals who went over the weir that day only four survived,\" he said. Mr Watson explained there were desperate attempts of \"bystanders who tried to throw lifelines into the weir\" but the intensity of the water \"was the equivalent of two tonnes of water crossing the 1m of the weir crest every second\". The court was shown photos of the weir, including the section between the right and left crest called the fish pass, which the group was trying to navigate. Mr Watson said the fish pass was 11m (36ft) long and on an incline of about 14%. The court was also shown conditions at the weir on the day after the incident. Mr Watson explained it showed \"immense turbulence\" of the water which meant the side walls of the fish pass could \"barely, if at all, be seen\". Once the tour was advertised, there was a \"significant amount of interest\" and a WhatsApp group was set up, but in the days leading up to the trip, some participants raised concerns. Mr O'Dwyer responded to a message from Ms Wheatley to tell her that every paddleboard trip they had done was \"aimed at beginners\". He also suggested alternative tours routes to Lloyd, one of which she said sounded \"boring\" before later adding: \"Maybe stick to the original.\" No risk assessments, waivers or details of next of kin were found by police. Lloyd claimed she believed Mr O'Dwyer gave a safety briefing to the group while she went to the toilet but all participants said no safety briefing was given. Mr O'Dwyer's body was found down river by the RNLI later on 30 October. Ms Powell was resuscitated at the scene and taken to hospital by ambulance staff but had suffered \"catastrophic brain damage\" and died on 5 November. In a call to her partner that day Lloyd said: \"It's my fault, 100%. I went down first I just turned around and they all, like, fell over.\" Lloyd spoke with police at the scene at 11:10 and claimed she had carried out health and safety checks and described the participants as \"intermediary\". She said was \"qualified to give tours and lessons\" and she and Mr O'Dwyer were \"happy with the conditions, flow and level of capabilities\". Speaking to police on 30 October 2021, she said she \"instructed people to follow me\" but when she turned back she saw many of them had not. She said she heard Mr O'Dwyer's wife Ceri say \"help me help me\" and saw her hand in the water as she was \"holding on to Nicola, who seemed lifeless\". Mr Watson said it was clear Mr O'Dwyer \"bears a share of responsibility\" for what happened but Lloyd was ultimately responsible. In Swansea Crown Court on Tuesday, Ms Roger's mum Theresa Hall said Lloyd \"guided Morgan to her death\" and the \"physical and mental pain that I now live with is too much to bear\". Speaking to Lloyd, she said, \"you in your arrogance have stopped me being able to fully grieve for my daughter\". \"Every day of my life is absolutely horrendous knowing she died a horrific death\". Breaking down in tears, she told Lloyd she would never forgive her \"for what you have taken away from me\". Ms Rogers' dad Robert Rogers said a \"warm, courageous, happy shiny star to all she knew was extinguished.\" \"As a father to have to bury your own daughter is not a path you want any other human being to walk,\" he added. \"The open wound inflicted will never ever heal. My family will have a life sentence of grief for our remaining days.\" Nicola Wheatley's husband Darren called Lloyd \"a coward\" who had \"hidden behind your carefully orchestrated smoke screen\". He added: \"I hugged and kissed Nicola goodbye, she was so trusting. The next time I would see her would be to identify her body in the mortuary. \"This was not the Nicola that left our house less than 24 hours earlier but it is the face I see every day when I open my eyes.\" With audible anger in his voice he said while they \"cried all day\" that Christmas, Lloyd was posting pictures on social media celebrating Christmas lights with her family and friends. Lloyd was straight-faced in the dock as Mr Wheatley spoke directly to her. Ending his speech he said: \"Nerys Lloyd you are a vile person and you disgust me.\" Mark Powell, the husband of Andrea Powell told the court the pair had moved to Wales to raise their son. Breaking down in tears he explained the last time he saw Andrea \"happy and content\" was the day before she died when they said goodbye as she left for the trip to Haverfordwest. He then saw Andrea in the town's Withybush Hospital where she was in coma and he \"burst into tears\" seeing the cuts and bruises to her face and body. Mr Powell said their son Finn \"had the most amazing bond\" with his mum. When he told Finn, who was seven at the time of her death, that she had died, he burst into \"uncontrollable tears\" and that noise would stay with him forever. He said it was \"heart-breaking\" to hear Finn say he wanted to die \"so he can be with his mother again\". Mr Powell said the fact she did not die peacefully still distressed him and he \"cannot forgive\" Lloyd's lack of remorse. John Taylor, Ms Powell's dad said his daughter was the \"life and soul of every party\". \"Our past, our present and our future will never ever be the same again,\" he said. He called Lloyd and her business partner Mr O'Dwyer \"not remotely qualified\", as they only had a \"basic entry level qualification\" which was unsuitable for this tour. An advert for the trip said it was run by \"two fully qualified instructors\". Mr O'Dwyer and Lloyd sat two courses on 23 and 24 April 2021 but Mr Watson said it was \"clear from the promotional material for the courses\" it was not enough for this trip. Lloyd - a former police officer - had first aid training from both South Wales Police and as part of the RNLI. Ms O'Dwyer had a statement read on her behalf. She said she was \"tortured\" by what happened and described her husband as the kindest man \"with the biggest heart\". She told Lloyd she was once her friend but was met with \"blame, rejection and gaslighting\" when she tried to \"shift blame\" on to her husband. Paul made a \"devastating mistake\" but \"died trying to save others\". \"Grief is in our household every single day. You carried on as if nothing ever happened,\" she added. \"Nerys, I do not believe you will ever learn from this, you've had three years to show remorse and yet you have continued like this is an inconvenience to your life.\" Mr O'Dwyer's dad John added: \"You wake up in the early hours and you cry. You carry on with your day but everything is hollow.\" Jemma Dugdale, one of the survivors, said: \"This tragedy happened because of poor decision making of people who did not have the skills knowledge or expertise.\" Fellow survivor Gemma Cox said it turned her world upside down and the pain \"became unbearable\". But she said Lloyd had shown remorse to her and her children, adding: \"I have seen her suffering day after day for the decisions and mistakes that were made.\" Melody Johns said losing her sister-in-law Ms Powell was \"incomprehensible\".

    "title": "Cyber attack on M&S leads to click and collect delays",
    "article_text": "Marks and Spencer (M&S) says it has been dealing with a \"cyber incident\" affecting some of its services over the last few days. The UK retailer said its Click and Collect service had been impacted by technical issues along with its ability to collect contactless payments - with many customers taking to social media to complain about delays. M&S chief executive Stuart Machin apologised to customers in a note on Tuesday. He said the company had been forced to temporarily make \"small changes\" to store operations \"to protect you and our business\". \"There is no need for you to take any action at this time and if the situation changes, we will let you know,\" he said. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, has been notified. \"Marks & Spencer plc has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided,\" an ICO spokesperson told the BBC. In anotice to investors, M&S said it had engaged \"external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident\". \"We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,\" it added. The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre. M&S told customers it was working to resolve some \"limited\" delays to Click and Collect orders. It comes after some shoppers complained over the weekend about various issues - including being unable to use gift cards or vouchers in stores. One person called the issues a \"total failure for customers\"in a post on X. \"A simple message out to customers to save a journey would have worked a treat,\" they said. And another said they wereunable to pay for clothes using a gift cardwhile shopping at a M&S store in Liverpool. M&S has confirmed it is still experiencing technical difficulties affecting its ability to process gift cards, alongside Click and Collect orders. Daniel Card of the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) said the M&S incident was \"a reminder of the gap that often exists between our perception of cyber resilience and the reality\". \"Even well-resourced organisations aren't immune, which underlines the importance of action at every level,\" he said. He said while this may feel daunting for some smaller organisations, many common vulnerabilities \"can be addressed through practical, proportionate steps\". These may include securing devices and email accounts to protect from targeted attempts to compromise a person or business. This is just the latest in a series of IT problems to hit major high street names. Morrisonsexperienced significant problemswith their Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied on the biggest grocery shopping day of the year. This was followed by two major outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year. And in January, serious IT problems at Barclaysaffected the bank's app and online banking. It was later disclosed the firm could face compensation payments of £12.5m. In February, several banks – notably Lloyds – faced outages,leaving businesses unable to pay staff. Ian McShane, a security expert at cyber security company Arctic Wolf, said the issues experienced by M&S over Easter showed that \"cyber attackers never take a day off\". \"Criminals are always on the look out to cause the most disruption for the least amount of effort,\" he added. \"Given the long weekend is the second biggest trading event for food and drink retailers after Christmas, this is exactly what happened here as the majority of the British public enjoyed the long weekend.\" Additional reporting by Graham Fraser M&S say they will not renew the lease for their existing store in Blackburn town centre. Feasibility studies are under way, with the council intending to keep the frontage \"intact\". M&S says it has been looking to open in the town for some time. The store would bring clothing and homeware departments to Hull for the first time since 2019. Stuart Machin says the sector is facing a wave of tax rises and the government needs to \"lighten the burden\".",

    "title": "The Vivienne hid ketamine struggle to protect family, sister says",
    "article_text": "The sister of James Lee Williams, better known as The Vivienne, says her family only learned of the drag performer's battle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK. In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Chanel Williams, 35, says James had kept the struggle - including being hospitalised because of the drug - a secret from the family \"to protect them\". The 32-year-old died in January, with the familylater announcing the cause of deathas a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine. Chanel says her brother had \"a really long period of sobriety\" before relapsing, something she says the family only discovered after James's death. \"A big thing for me now is, had I asked the questions or just looked for the signs, would the outcome be different?\" she says. The Vivienne was praised for speaking openly about ketamine abuse and the struggle of becoming sober while appearing on Drag Race UK, which aired in 2019. Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse. She believes the stigma around addiction, and herbrother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help. \"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says. \"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\" Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible. James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January. Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\" A full inquestis scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine. Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction. \"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says. \"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different. \"That's why we've shared James's story.\" Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine. \"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says. \"But it's not just about reclassification […] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\" The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over therise in young people taking the drug. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine. \"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\" Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\". \"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says. \"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\" You can see the full interview with The Vivienne's sister Chanel on BBC Newsnight at 10:30 on BBC Two andBBC iPlayer.

    "title": "Gamers shocked as Elder Scrolls IV revealed and launched on same day",
    "article_text": "Video game studio Bethesda has announced the long-rumoured launch of a remastered version of its 2006 hit Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The fourth instalment of the series has maintained a cult following among fans despite it being almost two decades since its original release. Now, gamers have been surprised as a remaster of the classic game has not only been announced - but released to digital stores immediately. It comes as fans await the next game in the series, with the most recent entry - Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - having been released in 2011. More than 600,000 people watched the live announcement on YouTube. And the reveal that the game would be available immediately drew shock and excitement from those watching, with many viewers writing \"Praise be Todd\" in the comments - in reference to Bethesda director Todd Howard. In 2006, Oblivion launched on PC and the Xbox 360 console as the product of a co-publishing agreement between Bethesda and Take-Two Interactive's label, 2K Games. \"Oblivion was a really defining moment in the series,\" Howard said in the announcement. \"I think with a remaster, we want people to feel the way they did then - but it's still a game of its time, you want to keep the bones in place,\" he said. Bethesda showed off a series of significant graphics upgrades in its launch video, with updated gameplay, user interface and audio systems. Players will also be able to upgrade their characters in a new way, combining systems both from the original and the sequel. One of the developers called the remaster \"a love letter\" to the original game. Set in the open world of Tamriel, the game places players in an empire on the verge of downfall - after the mysterious death of Emperor Uriel Septim VII leaves behind a vacant throne and missing heir. Rachel Howie, a content creator and Twitch partner, said the game was \"long overdue the currently very trendy remaster treatment\". \"It's such a great opportunity for the generation who grew up thinking Skyrim was peak role-playing game to meet its charming little brother,\" she added. Oblivion racked up 9.5m salesaccording to gaming website Polygon, and is fondly remembered by fans. Skyrim then released five years later to a massive response, selling more than 40 million copies across generations of consoles - it has been re-released on two generations of consoles since it first came out. The news will now leave fans wondering if they may now soon see some news about Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced in 2018, some seven years after Skyrim's release. Since then, information on the game has been sparse, and mostly limited to rumours. But gamers have come to expect a long wait from Bethesda, which is facing demand for a new Fallout game as well - which remains under wraps despite the success of a hit Amazon TV show based on the series.",

    "title": "Nationalities of foreign criminals to be published for first time",
    "article_text": "The nationalities of foreign criminals in the UK are due to be published for the first time under plans being unveiled later. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is understood to have ordered officials to publish the data, including crimes that have been committed, by the end of the year. There were more than 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year, up from almost 18,000 when the Conservatives left office, figures show. A Home Office source said the government wanted the public to be better informed about foreign criminals, including where they come from. The Tories say Tuesday's commitment showed Labour had \"buckled\" after beingpressured to disclose the figures. In response, government sources insist the move was only possible because Cooper ordered Home Office statisticians to overhaul their systems. Foreign nationals sentenced to 12 months or more in prison are subject to automatic deportation. The home secretary has the power to deport people who receive a shorter sentence if she decides their presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good. Home Office sources blame the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation onearly releases due to prison overcrowding, instability in some countries making deportations difficult, and a litany of appeals against deportation on human rights grounds. The rise came despite more offenders being deported since Labour came to power. Home Office figures are expected to show the main three nationalities for foreign criminals living in the community are Albanians, Romanians and Poles. It is understood their most common offences were the production of drugs, theft and robbery, and acts of violent assault. Government sources insist the change has only come about because ministers have addressed an issue that their Conservative predecessors ignored. A Home Office source said: \"Not only are we deporting foreign criminals at a rate never seen when Chris Philp and Robert Jenrick were in charge at the Home Office, but we will also be publishing far more information about that cohort of offenders than the Tories ever did.\" The source added: \"We want to ensure the public is kept better informed about the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, where they are from and the crimes they have committed.\" Welcoming the news, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said: \"We will finally see the hard reality that mass migration is fuelling crime across our country.

    "title": "Passionate Guardiola continues to solve Man City puzzle",
    "article_text": "Pep Guardiola's side are third in the Premier League and in the FA Cup semi-finals Sometimes there is no need to say anything. When you are as expressive on the touchline as Pep Guardiola, visual evidence can be enough to gauge the importance of an occasion. In Tuesday's 2-1 victory over Aston Villa, there was a long period of simmering discontent, then thinly disguised fury at the penalty given against his team after referee Craig Pawson had been told to stop the game to check Ruben Dias' 'foul' on Jacob Ramsey. Most thought video assistant referee (VAR) John Brooks was right. Guardiola was not among them. He shook his head, ranted at his coaches on the bench, then launched a tirade towards the nearby fourth official. Guardiola was booked for his emotive reaction but he felt wronged. He was still shaking his head forcefully, his face set like stone, as the replay was shown on the big screen at the exact moment he returned to his seat after half-time. Then there was a demand for more noise, gesturing to all parts of the ground for City's fans to turn up the volume, and a familiar sink to the knees as James McAtee's delicate lob dropped just the wrong side of the post. Finally there was the tension release of Matheus Nunes' injury-time winner. Guardiola reacted as though he had scored himself, acknowledging the noise from the fans he wanted more from earlier. There was a storming of the pitch as the whistle blew, a hug - tight - for Nunes, a laugh and a joke with Kevin de Bruyne, who at the weekend revealed his manager hadnot even made an offer for him to stayat the end of the season. Make no mistake, this win was big. \"You don't have to be a scientist to realise that we were playing against Aston Villa, one of the best teams, as you saw against Newcastle and PSG,\" said Guardiola. \"They are an extraordinary team but we performed as we did in the past with the commitment. \"Qualification for the Champions League is important, of course, but sometimes we have to be calm. We must focus on the semi-final and after we have days to prepare for the four 'finals'. Two at home, two away.\" By that, Guardiola means Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, and then back to the Premier League for key games against Wolves and relegated Southampton before the final two - Bournemouth at home, Fulham away - interspersed, he hopes, with another trip to Wembley. Four points separate five teams - who will prosper in race for Europe? Nunes sends Man City third with late winner against Villa Manchester City fans have been protesting against ticket prices In Guardiola's mind, it is all so clear. It is why detached observers are led to the conclusion City's football is regimented. Yet, the reality is Guardiola is making subtle tweaks as the season goes on. He accepts what he has now is not what even he expected when the campaign began, when Rodri and Erling Haaland were available, not on the bench as they were again against Villa due to injury. No-one would have predicted Saturday's hero at Everton would be 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly, making his fourth league start. Against Villa it would be Nunes, signed from Wolves for Â£53m in September 2023 when a plan to bring in Lucas Paqueta from West Ham had to be aborted, who turned into a right-back rather than his central midfield scheming role. \"If you told me at the beginning of the season that at the end of it we would be fighting for the FA Cup final or to qualify for the Champions League with Nico and Matheus at full-back, I'd say: 'What are you talking about?'\" said Guardiola. \"Matheus is a person that is incredibly loved. When you talk with the journalists he's always so serious but in the locker room he's always laughing. \"He has physicality for when he has to run and sustain the wingers. Step by step he has been so important.\" It's another puzzle solved for Guardiola. Another solution found. It will be fascinating now to see if City can keep alive their hopes of domestic silverware alive. They have failed to win at least one trophy only three times since they won the FA Cup in 2011 to end their long wait for success. Since Guardiola's first season in 2016-17, City have always won at least one of the three domestic competitions on offer. In theory, the supporters have never had it so good. But many are not happy. Protests against ticket prices took place again before kick-off. Those running the club argue the finance generated allows Guardiola to have the squad he demands. The fans do not agree - and Guardiola agrees with them. \"I am on the side of the people,\" he said. \"I'm a supporter for Manchester City as well. \"I don't have to pay [for] the tickets but I understand the feeling. \"When I go to the theatre or to a concert and I pay for the ticket, I want to see something I like. \"We want them here and we want a full stadium every time.\" Latest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views Get Manchester City news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Returning O'Sullivan holds narrow lead over Carter",
    "article_text": "Ronnie O'Sullivan won the World Snooker Championship in 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2020 and 2022 Ronnie O'Sullivan made his return to snooker and secured a one-frame lead over Ali Carter after the opening session of their World Championship first-round match. O'Sullivan, 49, had not played competitively since January when he snapped his cue and threw it in the bin following four losses in five matches at the Championship League event. He subsequently withdrew from a number of tournaments, including the Masters, the Welsh Open and the Grand Prix, saying he \"needed to prioritise his health and wellbeing\". But the seven-time world champion recovered from losing the opening frame to take a 5-4 advantage, needing five more frames for victory when the match resumes on Wednesday afternoon (14:30 BST). He hit a break of 107 to move 3-1 in front with the 1,283rd century break of his career and his 208th at the Crucible. He had a chance for another century, only to falter at 85 after missing a red into the middle pocket. O'Sullivan looked on course to gain a 6-3 advantage, but missed a long red when 46-5 ahead, with Carter recovering to take the last frame of the session. Before the tournament, O'Sullivan told BBC Sport \"to come here is an achievement in itself for me\" as he documented his mental health struggles. No player has won the world title on eight occasions in the modern era, with O'Sullivan aiming to move clear of Stephen Hendry's seven successes. All the updates from day four at the Crucible World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage Emotionally 'drained' Higgins defeats O'Connor to advance Long-time rivals Ronnie O'Sullivan and Ali Carter shook hands before the match started O'Sullivan only confirmed his appearance at the tournament late last week, marking a 33rd successive year at the Crucible after he made his debut in 1993, aged 17. He received an excellent ovation from the Sheffield crowd as he made his way into the arena and shook hands with long-time rival Carter before the match started. O'Sullivan had beaten Carter in world finals in 2008 and 2012 and the Masters final in 2024, although Carter did gain a win over 'The Rocket' in a bad-tempered last-16 tie at the Crucible in 2018. Carter, the world number 18, had to win through two rounds of qualifying to get to the Crucible, despite suffering with a neck injury that had left him close to withdrawing. Neither player was at their best, with Carter twice losing frames on the black having been in a strong position. But Carter taking the final two frames of the session has left the match finely poised before Wednesday's second session. Last year's world champion Kyren Wilson, speaking on BBC Two, said: \"There was so much built-up expectation with Ali coming in as a qualifier and Ronnie coming in as an unknown this year, which is so strange. \"I'm sure Ronnie will go away and be happy with a one-frame lead. Ali seemed to have the bit between his teeth. That will feel massive going in at 5-4 rather than 6-3 [down]. \"There have been positives from both guys that they can take into Wednesday's session.\" Shaun Murphy is the 15th seed and won the world title in 2005 Former world champion Shaun Murphy cruised to a commanding 7-2 lead after the first session of his first-round match against Crucible debutant Daniel Wells. In a high-quality session, 42-year-old Murphy - aiming to win a second world title 20 years after his first success - won four frames in a row to take control. He needs to win only three more frames when the match resumes on Wednesday morning (10:00 BST). Murphywon the Masters in Januaryand is looking to become the first player since Judd Trump in 2018-19 to win that tournament and the World Championship in the same season. He made a fine start with a break of 64 but Welshman Wells, who had to battle through three qualifying rounds to secure his place at the annual 17-day event, showed his break-building ability with a clearance of 131. But Murphy made breaks of 63, 100, 57 and 138 to move into a dominant 5-1 advantage. Wells, 36, made his second century with 109 in frame seven, only for Murphy to instantly restore his four-frame lead with a run of 76. A missed black off the spot cost Wells the chance to reduce his arrears in the final frame of the session, with Murphy taking advantage with a break of 89. World number one Judd Trump also began his campaign on Tuesday and holds a 6-3 lead against China's Zhou Yuelong in a match that concludes on Wednesday night (19:30 BST). Breaks of 93, 61, 117 and 62 helped Trump to a 5-1 lead before Zhou, 32nd in the world, edged a scrappy seventh frame, which lasted more than 40 minutes. The pair shared the last two frames to leave Trump needing four frames on Wednesday. Halo World Snooker Championship 19 April to 5 May Crucible Theatre, Sheffield Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live Tenth seed Ding Junhui moved into the last 16 thanks to a 10-7 win over world number 73 Zak Surety. Ding held a 6-2 advantage lead but Surety responded with four centuries - 104, 109, 136 and 110 - in five frames, although it was not enough to turn the match around. Si Jiahui became the fifth player from China to reach the next stage as he sealed a 10-6 victory over David Gilbert in the evening session. Gilbert trailed 6-3 after the opening session and in the second frame of the night made nine reds and nine blacks as he looked to make only the 15th maximum 147 in Crucible history, before he missed the 10th red with the break ending on 72. \"From ball one I was chasing the cash. I was fuming that I missed the red into the middle,\" said Gilbert. \"I thought Si was very poor and I was very poor, but to be down 6-3 and 9-4 was unbelievable.

    "title": "Can Leeds and Burnley survive in Premier League?",
    "article_text": "Leeds and Burnley sealed promotion on Easter Monday Leeds United and Burnley have sealed their places in the Premier League with two games to spare. Both could end the season on exactly 100 points - yet will be immediately tipped for relegation next season. For the Clarets it is an immediate bounce back, while the Whites took two years to secure their top-flight return. Both clubs' managers have similar records in English football management - with three promotions from the Championship, but no seasons of staying in the Premier League. So how will they fare back in the top flight? The past two seasons have shown they will have their work cut out. Six moments that mattered as Leeds won promotion We bored our way to the Premier League - Brownhill Leeds & Burnley promoted to the Premier League - reaction & Phil McNulty Q&A This video can not be played Parker 'hugely proud' of Burnley promotion Burnley's last season in the Premier League was under Vincent Kompany. They had cruised their way to promotion, playing attractive football. But they continued trying to play like that in the Premier League and it did not work. Well it worked for Kompany, who washired as Bayern Munich managerat the end of the season, but not for the Clarets who went down. However, this promotion campaign has been very different. It was based on a solid defence - conceding only 15 goals in 44 league games so far. They are on a club record 31-game unbeaten league run. Manager Scott Parker had previously won promotion with Fulham and Bournemouth. His record in the Championship is three promotions from three seasons. In his two and a half years with Fulham they were relegated from the Premier League twice, and promoted in between. At Bournemouth he got them promoted in his first season in charge but left just weeks into the following season, after a 9-0 loss to Liverpool. Former Clarets defender Michael Duff told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"There are going to be tough times next season [for Parker]. He's proven that he's a good manager, and he's not going to become a bad manager in three or four games.\" Former England goalkeeper Joe Hart, who played for Burnley from 2018 to 2020, added: \"There is no way he is going to come away from that [defensive strategy] next season, absolutely no way, especially after what he has seen in the last two seasons from newly promoted sides.\" Daniel Farke has managed something only Marcelo Bielsa has done with Leeds since 1990 - winning promotion to the top flight. The German led Norwich to promotion from the Championship twice, but they went straight back down the first time and he was sacked in the November of the second Premier League campaign. They have more points than they did in their 2019-20 Championship title-winning campaign under Bielsa (93) - having lost in last season's play-off final. But no manager will ever compare to the iconic Argentine Bielsa -who was sacked 18 months into his Premier League stint- to Leeds fans. Former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford said: \"When you've got players such as Archie Gray, Georginio Rutter and Crysencio Summerville - three key players leaving last summer, after missing out in the play-offs, who would have foreseen the overturn in fortunes? \"The players that came in - man for man - may not have been as good individually as the players that left. But what they did bring was unity and team spirit. \"We've scored more goals, conceded less goals, we've got more points [than under Bielsa]. It's phenomenal, but those stats do get overlooked because Daniel Farke is not Marcelo Biesla.\" This video can not be played Monday Night Club: How will Leeds and Burnley cope in the Premier League? Leeds and Burnley will hope they can buck the new trend of promoted teams going straight back down. Only once between the Premier League's foundation in 1992-93 and 2022-23 had all the promoted teams gone straight back down. But it is set to happen for the second season in a row now. Last season it was Sheffield United, Luton and Burnley. This season Leicester and Southampton are down and Ipswich will join them soon. Not only that but, barring a huge turnaround in the final few weeks, they will be the two lowest ever points totals for three relegated teams. It used to be more common for no promoted teams to go back down - happening four times. Hart added: \"I think fans are going to have to get on board that their teams are going to be looking to grind out results, earn their status in the Premier League. \"I think it has been shown over the last two seasons what an impressive league this is, and you really have to be squeaky clean if you want to play that sort of football - because you will get picked apart and hurt.\" One thing hindering promoted clubs is the profit and sustainability rules (PSR) - which punishes clubs which post losses of more than Â£105m over a three-year reporting cycle. Burnley chief finance officer Sasha Ryazantsev told BBC Sport: \"A promotion to the Premier League has the obvious positive impact of the higher broadcasting and commercial revenues, yet, Burnley will have one of the lowest revenues. \"Player wages is the best predictor of on-the-pitch performance in the Premier League. \"In 2024, the average wages of the three promoted clubs were five times lower than the average for the top three clubs, and half of the average of the seven clubs immediately below them. \"Such disparity means that it has become increasingly difficult for newly promoted sides to stay up, and clubs need to find a way to outsmart the opposition, as outspending them is just not a viable option.\" Is this the worst bottom three in Premier League history? The Premier League's worst bottom three ever? This video can not be played Joe Hart on goalkeepers Meslier and Trafford Leeds have been more impressive going forward this season, with Burnley more impressive at the back. \"Dan James, Joe Rodon and Ethan Ampadu look capable of coping with the step up,\" said BBC Radio Leeds reporter Adam Pope of the Wales internationals. Winger James has played in the Premier League with Leeds, Manchester United and Fulham and centre-back Rodon, also 27, has been there with Tottenham. Captain Ampadu, aged just 24, has already played in the top flights in England, Germany and Italy. \"There is an argument to suggest Ao Tanaka, Jayden Bogle and Willy Gnonto could follow suit, with the latter pair having had 74 appearances between them in the Premier League already,\" added Pope. \"Joel Piroe has the quality to finish at the top level, if not the pace required.\" Dutch forward Piroe is the Championship's top scorer with 19 goals - including four in Monday's6-0 win over Stoke. The man who has dominated headlines for Burnley this season has been England Under-21 goalkeeper James Trafford. He has kept 28 clean sheets in 43 Championship games, including a run of 12 in a row, conceding 15 goals - one every 258 minutes. Last season he had conceded 62 goals in 28 Premier League games, with only two clean sheets. Former Clarets keeper Hart said: \"I love him, he is so confident and charismatic. He really believes in himself and I know for a fact he has been working hard on his physical development. He will be at the centre of plenty of activity this summer.\" Ex-Clarets winger Glen Little, who is BBC Radio Lancashire's summariser, says their centre-backs - who like Trafford are both 22 - have been their best two players. \"I'd have Maxime Esteve as the player of the season and CJ Egan-Riley right behind him. The defence have been really good,\" he said. Both clubs are owned by Americans, with investment from people linked to American football. ALK Capital LLC has majority control of Burnley, with Alan Pace the chairman. Former NFL player JJ Watt is a minority stakeholder in the club. Leeds are owned by the San Francisco 49ers Enterprises group, with investors including American golfers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. Red Bull has a minority stake in the club. Leeds reporter Pope said: \"I expect Daniel Farke will be backed by the owners, unlike his time post winning two titles at Norwich City. \"Financially Leeds United are in as solid a position as I can recall. \"The one concern is that the club has Â£142m to fork out in unpaid transfer fees, but the profit from the sales of Crysencio Summerville, Archie Gray and Georginio Rutter will offset some of that.\" Burnley's owners have a decision to make. Two summers ago they spent a fortune and got relegated with 24 points. \"A couple of years ago they shocked everyone,\" said Little. \"They spent about Â£100m. It was a disaster. It didn't work. \"Will they reign it in a bit this time and go for more experienced Premier League players? Or will they take the money and say 'it's a young team, shall we go with it and see how we get on?' \"The one thing they didn't do last time, which was a mistake, was they didn't sign a proper centre-forward. This time around hopefully they've learned their lesson there. That would be my first business.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Boulter breaks new ground with first WTA clay win",
    "article_text": "Katie Boulter has been British number one for almost two years British number one Katie Boulter has broken new ground by earning the first WTA Tour clay-court win of her career at the age of 28. Boulter moved into the Madrid Open second round with a 4-6 6-2 6-1 victory over Czech opponent Katerina Siniakova. Despite being established at the top end of the game, Boulterâs experience and exposure on the red dirt has been limited. The world number 40âs appearance at the WTA 1,000 tournament in the Spanish capital - an important event in the build-up to next monthâs French Open - is only the fifth time she has competed in the main draw of a tour-level clay event. \"I've always known clay is going to be my toughest surface but I never really gave myself the chance to play well on it and build on it,\" she told BBC Sport. \"With injuries, and the timing of them, last year was my first clay-court season. \"I felt my level last year was really improving. I got unlucky not to beat [Paula] Badosa in the first round of the French Open - and I felt I deserved more from last season.\" Sinner does not deserve any hate - Draper Raducanu happy with 'informal' coaching set-up The curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second Serve Boulter's reward is a second-round match against Italian sixth seed Jasmine Paolini, who reached the French Open final last year. \"I hope I can show that - even if not this week or next week - I can play well on clay,\" she added. \"You see a lot of big ball-strikers playing well and I asked myself why it can't be me.\" Meanwhile, British number fiveFrancesca Jonesmoved into the main draw after winning her second qualifying match. Jones, playing in her second event sincecollapsing on courtthis month, won 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-1 against Spain's Cristina Bucsa. It will be the first time the 24-year-old plays in the main draw of a WTA 1000 tournament - the most prestigious outside of the four majors. Victory for Boulter comes as she battles to keep the British number one ranking with Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal closing in. Boulter has been the nation's leading women's player since June 2023, but has dropped down the world rankings in a stop-start season. Raducanu is up to 49th after reaching the Miami quarter-finals last month, while Kartal's rapid rise has moved her up to 60th. Both play their Madrid first-round matches on Wednesday. \"I don't feel any pressure at all,\" Boulter told BBC Sport before beating Siniakova. \"I'm very comfortable in the seat that I am and I know that every single person has a different journey and my journey is not going to be compared to anyone else's - I'm proud of that. \"I've been the British number one for two years, it's been a fair while now. It's something which I'm quite used to.\" After winning one and losing one of her Billie Jean King Cup singles matches last week on indoor clay in the Netherlands, Boulter went to Alicante - where her fiance Alex de Minaur has long been based - for a training week. She decided that was the sensible option - instead of squeezing in another WTA clay-court event before Madrid - as she continues to manage a foot injury. The issue has left her only able to play five tournaments this season, missing almost two months of the WTA Tour between the Australian Open in January and Indian Wells in March. \"I want to see the girls going higher and higher [in the rankings], but personally I have my own goals and try to focus on those a lot,\" added Boulter, whosecured GB's place in the Billie Jean King Cup Finalsalongside Jodie Burrage in the deciding doubles. \"For me I just need to try and stay healthy. That's that most important thing and then the ranking will take care of itself.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "article_text": "McIlroy missed the cut despite a spirited second-round charge up the leaderboard when The Open returned to Royal Portrush in 2019 Newly crowned Masters champion Rory McIlroy will have \"unfinished business\" when the Open Championship returns to Royal Portrush this summer, says R&A chief executive Mark Darbon. Northern Irishman McIlroy, who won at Augusta National earlier this month to complete a career Grand Slam, missed the cut when The Open was held at the Dunluce Links for the first time in 68 years in 2019. On Tuesday, Darbon announced that this year's championship, which takes place from 17-20 July, will be the biggest sporting event held in Northern Ireland, with 278,000 fans expected on the Antrim coast links. \"I think he's probably got some unfinished business here,\" Darbon told BBC Sport NI of McIlroy's chances. \"We're looking forward to a brilliant event.\" Darbon, who was appointed R&A chief last summer, added: \"We were excited enough as it was, having the Open Championship back here, but I think that [McIlroy's Masters win] is the icing on the cake and sets us up for a fantastic summer of golf.\" This year's Open, which will be the biggest held outside St Andrews in Scotland, is expected to generate Â£213m of economic impact. The 2019 tournament proved a memorable occasion as Ireland's Shane Lowry won his first major title. When asked how this summer's Open can top 2019, Darbon said: \"I think we can. You look for certain things when staging an Open Championship. \"You want a brilliant links course to test the best golfers in the world, you want passionate fans and you want a location to tell stories about this wonderful championship and Royal Portrush delivers on all those things in spades.\" Darbon also reaffirmed the R&A's desire to take the Open outside the United Kingdom for the first time, to Portmarnock in Dublin. \"We're really excited about the investigative work we're doing at Portmarnock and pleased with the support we're receiving from local authorities and the government,\" he said. \"We have a lot of work to do to bring that project to life but we're really optimistic that it will happen.\" Darbon is also keen to return the Open to \"brilliant\" Turnberry on the Ayrshire coast in Scotland and says \"feasibility\" work is being undertaken. The resort, which has been given Â£200m of improvements since being bought by US president Donald Trump in 2014, last held the Championship in 2009. Despite the facelift, Darbon says there are still \"logistical and commercial challenges\" around \"road, rail and accommodation infrastructure\" to overcome. \"In 2009 we had just over 120,000 people at Turnberry, and this summer we're welcoming nearly 280,000 people to Royal Portrush,\" he said. \"We know the golf course is brilliant so we'd love to be back there.\" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "‘The devil wants this pattern of mass death repeated’: Actors Guild of Nigeria calls for better regulation after two actors die",
    "article_text": "The president of theActors Guild of Nigeriahas called for mass prayers and increased unionisation after the death of two actors in Owerri, the capital city of Imo State. Posting on Instagram, Emeka Rollas advocated spiritual intervention and better workplace regulation to try to prevent future tragedies after the two men, who have not yet been named, died on Friday. “So sad some Actors who are not members of the Actors Guild lost their lives while filming,” ran the message on his main post. “We have repeatedly warned that actors must join the guild to practice in Nollywood.” In a caption alongside, Rollas reflected that the deaths had occurred “barely a week after the [1 year] memorial service” ofJunior Pope, one of the country’s most influential actors and producers. Pope, 39, died on 10 April 2024 alongside three crew members in a boat accident on the River Niger, while travelling to Asaba to shoot a new film. Rollas concluded from the apparently unrelated events that “the devil still wants this pattern of mass death repeated on an annual basis”. Details of the deaths last weekend remain unclear but reports suggest the two actors died at a house party given by a director, which left two others hospitalised. The director and three other people present were later arrested. A spokesperson for the Imo State Police Command, Henry Okoye, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the cause of the deaths had begun. “The command is aware of the unfortunate incident of unnatural death,” he said. “I can confirm that two people were pronounced dead while two were hospitalised.” In his Instagram post, Rollas credited God with the death toll in Owerri not being four – the same number, he said, as “last year in Asaba”. He continued by saying that he had organised a prayer programme before concluding with a caution to those who might sign up to work on productions without union representation. “This is a bad trend. These people camp themselves in an unhealthy, unverified environment making content,” wrote Rollas. “Content creators have to be licensed.RIP 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭” Rollas has served as AGN president since 2017. In a 2019 speech, he said his organisation had more than two million registered members across 36 states and is the largest actors’ association inAfrica.",

    "title": "‘I hope I’ll one day be at peace’: civilians seek mental health help in war-ravaged eastern DRC",
    "article_text": "On a sunny morning in the city of Goma in easternDemocratic Republic of the Congo, where fighting between the M23 rebel group and the Congolese army raged earlier this year, men and women rushed towards a line of chairs outside a medical facility. Since 24 March, the Saint Vincent de Paul neuropsychiatric hospital, a medical facility for people with mental health issues, has been offering free consultations on a first-come first-served basis for people affected by the fighting. Dozens have lined up to be seen each day. As she waited in the queue, 35-year-old Patience Kahindo described the horror she had witnessed at the peak of the fighting. “For the first time in my life, I saw corpses lying on the ground for days,” she said. “Crows and other birds came to eat the human flesh. Sometimes, when I think of all this, I’m plunged into unprecedented sadness. “If someone licked my heart, they’d be poisoned.” The fighting in eastern DRC has roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that targeted Tutsis. M23, one of dozens of armed groups fighting Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region, says its objective is to safeguard the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities, including protecting them against Hutu rebel groups who escaped to DRC after taking part in the genocide. DRC, the US and other countries say Rwanda is backing M23 in order to exploit the area’s natural resources. In January, M23 started a rapid advance against the Congolese military and its allied forces in eastern DRC, capturing the region’s largest cities –GomaandBukavu. The recent fighting has left a trail of destruction and exacerbated the humanitarian situation in the region.Thousands of peoplehave been killed andhundreds of thousandsdisplaced. Adding to that, peoplehave sustained serious long-term injuriesfrom shootings and bombings. And some Congolese displaced by previous rounds of fighting have been told by M23 to return their ruined home towns, where they arestruggling to make a living and rebuild their lives. “We have seen that since the clashes at the end of January, the population has been really stressed, and there has been a resurgence of mental health cases,” said Dr Neema Kahatwa, a psychiatrist from the neuropsychiatric hospital in Goma. When the hospital announced the scheme last month, the facility highlighted a number of symptoms that people could look out for and that could necessitate medical attention, including insomnia, difficulty in concentration, unexplained anger, extreme sadness, panic and loss of interest. As he queued to see a mental health specialist in one of four rooms at the facility, Jospin Kasereka, 42, described how he had lost his sister-in-law in the unchecked violence in Goma that followed its capture by M23 and how he saw Congolese soldiers throwing their weapons on the streets as they retreated. “Every day, I wonder of what use these weapons are to us. Perhaps, they were used to eliminate my sister-in-law,” he said. “Mentally, I’m cornered. I hope I’ll one day be at peace.” Obedi Alias, 47, has been out of work as a civil servant since rebels took over Goma. “I’ve got a big family to support, but there’s no work and I can’t find any money,” he said after his consultation. “I feel the pressure of carrying the whole world on my back. I feel helpless and fear for the future.” People who need to be checked first go to the reception, after which they are directed to the triage, where personnel check their vital signs. From there, they see psychiatrists, who prescribe additional tests and, if necessary, refer patients to psychologists for psychotherapy sessions. More than 300 people from Goma and its surroundings have gone through consultations since the campaign started. Stress, anxiety and depression have been among the conditions diagnosed. Although the consultations are free, the patients pay for other services, such as complementary examinations, laboratory tests and treatment. M23’s recent advance is the worst escalation in years of the conflict in eastern DRC. Attempts to end it through dialogue have failed. On Saturday the government suspended the former president Joseph Kabila’s political party and ordered his assets seized over accusations of supporting M23. The 53-year-old, who ruled from 2001 to 2019 and only stepped down after deadly protests against him, has said he wants to return to the country to help seek a solution to the war. There was no immediate response from Kabila, but Ferdinand Kambere, the secretary of his Party for Reconstruction and Democracy, called the suspension a flagrant violation of Congo’s constitution and laws.",

    "article_text": "A record 7.3 million people have cast their ballots over four days of advanced voting in Canada’s election, official figures showed on Tuesday, in a possible sign of elevated interest in the 28 April poll. Elections Canada said its estimated tally for voting from Friday through Monday marked a 25% increase over the 5.8m advanced ballots cast in the 2021 vote. Canada, a country with a population of 41 million, has 28.9 million eligible voters, Elections Canada said in November. There are further indications the election campaign dominated by threats fromDonald Trumphas galvanized voters, including unusually high ratings for two debates last week. The Liberal leader, Prime Minister Mark Carney, is the frontrunner, but some polls showPierre Poilievre’s Conservative partyincrementally gaining ground. As of Tuesday, the public broadcaster CBC’s poll aggregator gives the Liberals 43.1% support, with the Tories at 38.4%. The Conservatives have gained one point in the last two weeks, according to the CBC data. Carney, a 60-year-old who previously led the central banks of Canada and Britain, says his global experience managing economic crises makes him the ideal candidate to guide Canada through a trade war brought on by Trump’s tariffs. Poilievre, meanwhile, says that lacklustre growth under ex-premier Justin Trudeau’s decade in power left Canada vulnerable to Trump and the country cannot afford a fourth consecutive Liberal government. Most Canadian elections are multi-party battles with the leftwing New Democratic party and Quebec separatist Bloc Quebecois playing crucial roles in the makeup of parliament. This year, polling points to a two-party Liberal-Conservative race, with smaller parties facing significant setbacks.",

    "title": "Brazilian judges accept coup plot charges against more Bolsonaro allies",
    "article_text": "A panel of Brazil’s supreme court justices has unanimously accepted criminal charges against six more key allies of former presidentJair Bolsonaroover an alleged coup plot to keep him in office after his 2022 election defeat. Last month, the panelunanimously accepted chargesagainst Bolsonaro and seven close allies over the alleged coup plot following his loss to current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and ordered the former rightwing leader to stand trial. When the prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup, he divided them into five different groups, based on their roles and positions in the alleged plot. Bolsonaro and his closest allies, including running mate Gen Braga Netto, were placed in the “core group”, according to the charges. On Tuesday, the supreme court panel reviewed charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles. The second group includes the former presidentialforeign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen Mario Fernandes, former federal highway police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col Marcelo Câmara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar. These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of emergency. Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he is being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasília, he gave an interview to the local television network SBT and said that his trial was not technical, but political. Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars. Bolsonaro is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil’s supreme court.",

    "title": "‘He listened to everyone’: Buenos Aires remembers pope as voice for the poor",
    "article_text": "Before he leftArgentinaand moved to Italy to become pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio would visit the country’svillas miserias, not in a car flanked by security guards, but by bus – and this is what his people remember. “He would come here, kiss our feet, the feet of the people,” said Aida Bogarin, aged 44. “It was everything to us.” For decades, Bergoglio was dedicated toworking in the capital’s poorest neighbourhoods,earning him the nickname the “priest of the slums”. In Villa 21-24, locals have gathered for months to say their prayers for the pontiff, as he experienced a serious case of double pneumonia. But on Monday, the Vatican confirmed thatPope Francis, the first Latin American leader of the Roman Catholic church, had died. “It was a privilege when he came here to us,” said Juan Ramón Congo, a 60-year-old cook, speaking at the Virgen de los Milagros de Caacupé parish church in Villa 21-24. Ramón Congo was confirmed by Pope Francis – then an archbishop – in the late noughties, he said, flicking through photos of the pair shaking hands. “He would walk around, listen to us, it helped us a lot. I miss him being here, eatingchipás[cheesy buns], and sharingmate[an Argentine tea].” Bergoglio was born in 1936 in the working-class barrio of Floresta to a family of Italian migrants: his grandparents had emigrated on the steamer Giulio Cesare in 1929 for new opportunities, and also to escape the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. In his youth, Bergoglio was a “mischievous child”, according to his autobiography, but he also felt a calling to the church. When he was 16, he said he felt compelled to enter the Basilica of St Joseph in Buenos Aires, saying it was as though “someone grabbed me from inside”. As a young man, Bergoglio initially found work as a bouncer and janitor, before later graduating in philosophy. After 13 years of study, in 1969, Bergoglio became a priest, and in the following decades he was placed in charge of the Jesuits of Argentina, became an auxiliary bishop and then archbishop of Buenos Aires. In 2001 he was created cardinal, and in 2013 made history by becoming the first Latin American pope. Father Lorenzo de Vedia, known as Padre Toto, first met Bergoglio when he was still a young priest. “He would come into the villas and listen to everyone,” he said. “The people of the villa have always felt very marginalised, underlooked, cast aside. But his presence, and the way he treated them, gave them dignity.” Toto remembered how Bergoglio “would wash the feet of the people, kiss the feet of the people”, adding: “He wouldn’t just come for the ceremonies. He would stay afterwards, and listen.” But most importantly, Toto said, Bergoglio acted too. “After a big storm crushed someone, and the insurance did not pay out, he secured assistance for the family. After another storm destroyed the roof of a sports centre, he helped get it fixed. He always had a smile, but beyond that he made tangible changes,” he said. “His qualities – his humanity, his humility – surprised the world when he became pope, but it did not surprise those of us who knew him,” he added. Sitting in the church pews, Sebastian Morales, aged 37, said the pontiff had helped “build up the community”. “I started coming here 10 years ago, when I was a drug addict, and the priests – led by the pope’s messages – helped me,” he said. “A few decades ago, there was none of this, but he helped us grow a community.” But the pope’s followers were disappointed, too, that the 88-year-old had not returned to his homeland since becoming head of the Catholic church in 2013 – despite making dozens of other international trips. “I don’t know why he has never come back. Perhaps because of politics, perhaps because Argentina legalised abortion,” said Bogarin. During his papacy, Argentina has suffered various economic crises and political volatility. In September, the popetold reportershe had wanted to return to Argentina, saying “they are my people”, but that “various matters had to be resolved first”. Jimmy Burns, author of the 2015 biography Francis, Pope of Good Promise,told Reutersthat he believed Francis did not want to be seen siding either with the left-leaning Peronists or the conservatives. “Any visit would try and be exploited by one side or the other, and he would unwittingly fuel those divisions,” he said. The current government is led by hard-right president Javier Milei, who during election campaigning said the pontiff was “always standing on the side of evil”.Francis also criticised Milei’s government, accusing it ofpreferring to use pepper sprayagainst protesters than pay for social justice. The pope did, however, welcome Milei to Rome last year, where the pair exchanged gifts. “Despite differences that seem minor today, having been able to know him in his kindness and wisdom was a true honor for me,” Milei wrote on social media on Monday. “As president, as an Argentine, and, fundamentally, as a man of faith, I bid farewell to the Holy Father and stand with all of us who are today dealing with this sad news.” Many Argentinians say they would like to welcome Francis home, regardless of recent political challenges. They are now preparing to hold special services for the pope, to honour and celebrate their fellow countryman.The Argentinian government has declared seven days of national mourning. “Even though he was not here, we always felt his closeness,” said Toto. “We always will.” Additional reporting by Casey Wetherbee",

    "title": "Populist party in New Zealand introduces bill to define gender as biological",
    "article_text": "A populist party in New Zealand’s governing coalition has introduced a bill to parliament that if enacted would define women and men by their biology, preventing trans women and men being recognised by law. The New Zealand First member’s bill is a long shot to become law as it has to be selected at random from a ballot and then garner majority support in parliament. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, who is also New Zealand’s deputy prime minister, said in a statement that laws should reflect biological reality and provide legal certainty. Peters said events at home and internationally showed “the pendulum is swinging back towards common sense and proving us right”. The bill defines a woman as an “adult human biological female” and a man as an “adult human biological male”. New Zealand opposition leader Chris Hipkins told the Stuff news website that the bill was “typical populist politics”. At a time when New Zealanders were struggling with the cost of living, job losses and a health system in crisis, this was not a priority, he said. The legislation the bill intends to amend sets out how terms and words commonly used in other legislation should be interpreted, such as “de facto partner”. The bill was lodged by a member of parliament – not the government – making it less certain that parliament would allot time for it to be debated. The proposed lawfollows a ruling by Britain’s highest courtlast Wednesday that only biological and not trans women meet the definition of a woman under equality laws. It was a landmark decision greeted with concern by trans supporters but welcomed by the government as bringing clarity. The British ruling centred on whether a trans woman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC), a formal document giving legal recognition of someone’s new gender, is protected from discrimination as a woman under Britain’s Equality Act. Transgender rights have become a highly political issue in many countries, with some critics saying the conservative right has weaponised identity politics to attack minority groups, while others argue that liberal support for transgender people has infringed on the rights of biological women. In the United States, legal challenges are under way after President Donald Trump issued executive orders that include barring transgender people from military service.",

    "title": "Rice crisis: Japan imports grain from South Korea for first time in more than 25 years",
    "article_text": "Japanhas imported rice from South Korea for the first time in a quarter of a century in an attempt to address soaring prices and growing consumer anger. South Koreanricearrived in Japan last month for the first time since 1999, according to media reports, as the price of domestically produced grain continued to rise, despite government attempts to relieve the pressure on shoppers. The price of Japan-grown rice has more than doubled since this time last year, fuelling demand for cheaper foreign grain, despite the heavy tariffs imposed on imports. The quantity of South Korean rice, which was sold online and at supermarkets, is still relatively low at just two tonnes, but there are plans to ship a further 20 tonnes in the coming days, the public broadcaster NHK said. While Japanese consumers have traditionally been sceptical about thequality and taste of foreign rice– Thai rice imported after an unusually cool summer in 1993 largely went unsold – the current crisis has forced Japanese consumers to develop a taste for foreign rice. South Korea’s rice exports to Japan are expected to reach their highest since 1990, according to the Yonhap news agency, while the crisis has also opened up potential export opportunities for producers in the US. Arata Hirano, who runs a restaurant in Tokyo, switched from Japanese to American rice last year when a shortage of the domestic grain triggered a steep rise in prices. Hirano told Reuters that the price of the Californian product he now served had doubled since his first purchase last summer, but was still cheaper than homegrown rice. And he has had no complaints from diners, including Miki Nihei, who was surprised to find out the rice she had eaten wasn’t grown in Japan. “I had no idea,” she said. “I have no qualms about eating imported rice. Prices have gone up, so I’m always looking for cheaper options.” In the week to 6 April, Japanese supermarket rice prices reached an average of ¥4,214 ($30/£22) for 5kg – more than double the same period a year earlier. The trend has forced the Japanese government to take the unusual step of dipping into its vast rice reserves. In March itbegan releasing 210,000 tonnes of stockpiled ricein an attempt to arrest price rises caused by a combination ofrecord summer heat, panic buying and distribution problems. Japan had previously dipped into its rice reserves in the aftermath of natural disasters or crop failures, but this was the first time it had intervened over distribution issues. The measure has had little impact, however. Last week the agriculture ministry said “logistical problems” meant only a tiny quantity of the released rice had reached shops. About 142,000 tonnes of stockpiled rice were released in the first auction held in mid-March, but as of the end of the month just 426 tonnes, or 0.3% of the total, had reached supermarkets and other outlets, the ministry said, blaming the bottleneck on a shortage of delivery vehicles and the time needed to prepare the grain for sale. Japan’s rice stockpiles had already depleted after record-breaking temperatures affected the 2023 crop. Stockpiles shrank again last year, partly due to a rise in consumption caused by record numbers of tourists. Supplies were also hit bypanic buyingin the wake of typhoon and earthquake warnings, forcing some retailers to restrict sales.",

    "title": "‘He left an indelible impression’: Catholics across Asia-Pacific mourn the Pope",
    "article_text": "The death ofPope Francishas left millions of people in south-east Asia and the Pacific in deep mourning, as they remember a Catholic leader known for his humility, interfaith commitment and dedication to their region. In tinyTimor-Leste, where more than 95% of people are Catholic, Francis was the first pope to visit since its independence. When he touched down in Dili last September as part of afour-nation Asia-Pacifictour, nearly half of the country’s population of 1.3 million turned out for his mass, sporting umbrellas in the papal colours of yellow and white to block the tropical sun. Timor-Leste’s president, Jose Ramos Horta, said on Monday that flags would be flown at half-mast for a week to honour the late pontiff and a mass would be held in his honour. “He leaves behind a profound legacy of humanity, of justice, of human fraternity, a tremendous loss for the world, not only for Christians,” Horta said in a phone interview, praising Francis’s courage to speak out “for the poor, for the weak … against arrogance, against abuse, against wars”. In the Philippines, home to one of the world’s biggest Catholic populations, churches across the country were ordered to ring bells for Francis,who died on Monday aged 88, while special masses are scheduled on Tuesday, including at Manila Cathedral. Across the country he was known affectionately as “Lolo Kiko”. “Kiko” is often used as a nickname for men whose name is “Francisco”, while “Lolo” means “Grandpa”. In the coastal town of Lingayen, Archbishop Socrates Villegas described Pope Francis as the “Jesus for our age”. “We knew that in him, Jesus was in our midst,” he told the Inquirer newspaper. The Philippines’ president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, also paid tribute, describing Francis as the “best pope in my lifetime” and “a man of profound faith and humility”. Millions of Filipinos turned out in 2015 when Francis famously rode on a popemobile based on the design of a “jeepney”, a vehicle synonymous with the Philippines and originally built from repurposed US army jeeps that serves as the backbone of its transport system. Almost 80% of Filipinos are Catholic, or about 85 million, with one former archbishop of Manila, Luis Antonio Tagle, 67, beingconsidered a potential candidatefor the next pope. If chosen he would be the first pontiff from Asia, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. Even in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country,Indonesia, which Francis also visited last year, the pope is fondly remembered. During his stop in Jakartathe pope visited the country’s largest mosque andattended an interfaith dialogue, which was seen as a powerful show of religious tolerance and bridging inter-faith divides. “The pope’s message of simplicity, pluralism, benevolence to the poor and concern for others will always be an example to us all,” said the Indonesian president, Prabowo. “Farewell, Pope Francis. Your message to defendbhinneka tunggal ika[unity in diversity] will always remain in our hearts.” In neighbouring Papua New Guinea, the prime minister said the late pope’s visit to his country’s capital and a jungle outpost last year left an “indelible” impression. James Marape extended his Pacific nation’s “deepest condolences” for the pontiff’s death,praising a tripin which Francis held a mass for tens of thousands in Port Moresby and then travelled to meet the faithful in the jungle-clad coastal community of Vanimo. The visit was “a moment of immense spiritual significance for our country”, Marape said. More than 90% of Papua New Guinea’s 12 million residents call themselves Christian, and about a quarter of those are Catholic. “His engagements with our young people and church leaders left an indelible impression on all who witnessed them,” Marape said. The country is set to have its first saint after Pope Francis approved the canonisation of local preacher, Peter ToRot this April. Born at Rakunai village in 1912, Peter ToRot led a Catholic mission during the Japanese occupation in the second world war, where the Vatican said he carried out his apostolate in secret, fully aware that he was risking his life.

    "title": "Peter Dutton to promise Australia will boost defence spending to the 3% of GDP demanded by Trump administration",
    "article_text": "A Coalition government, if elected, would boost Australian defence spending to the 3% of GDP demanded by the Trump administration of America’s allies, opposition leaderPeter Duttonwill promise on Wednesday. The opposition leader, in Perth after anoccasionally acrimonious leaders’ debate in Sydneyon Tuesday night, will pledge to spend $21bn over the next five years on Australia’s defence, lifting it, as a proportion of Australia’s gross domestic product, to 2.5%. Labor was quick to criticise the proposal as unreliable and a “pathetic whimper”. Under theCoalitionproposal, defence spending would continue to increase, as a proportion of GDP, to 3% within a decade. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “The prime minister and the deputy prime minister regularly tell Australians that we live in the most precarious period since the end of the second world war,” Dutton said in a statement. “Yet, over the last three years, Labor has done nothing about it, other than rip money out of defence, weakening strength and morale. “The Coalition will strengthen the Australian Defence Force and support our servicemen and women to keep us safe today and into generations ahead.” Australia’s current defence budget is $56bn annually, forecast to rise to $100bn a year by 2034 – about 2.33% of GDP – under Labor’s projections. The details of the Coalition’s proposed defence spending have not been unveiled publicly but are expected to include new drones, missiles and expanded Aukus-related infrastructure in Western Australia. The opposition has already announcedit would spend $3bn on new F-35 jets, bringing the RAAF’s joint-striker fleet to 100. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, said the costings for the Coalition’s defence commitments would be released before the 3 May election. “There will always be trade-offs when you’re making decisions of state,” he told Radio National. “But what price do we put on defence? I think, with the growth of authoritarian powers, with the war in Ukraine, with the changes in the Indo-Pacific region, with the Trump administration moving deeper into an ‘America first’ perspective and position, we need to be able to defend ourselves.” On Wednesday morning, the deputy prime minister and defence minister,Richard Marles, condemned the opposition defence’s announcement as unreliable, and a “pathetic whimper”. “I just don’t think you can trust the Liberals when it comes to anything they say in respect of defence,” he told the ABC. “There are some reports that the 2.5% is a target, there’s no explanation of how they’re paying for this, where the money’s coming from, or really is there an explanation of where the money is being spent on?” He said the Labor government had engaged in the biggest peacetime increase in defence spending since the second world war and said the government’s commitments were “not a target … not an aspiration” but funded and in the budget. “What we have here is not really a defence policy from the Liberals. It is a pathetic whimper.” The US president, Donald Trump, has consistently lectured allies about the need for America’s allies to spend more on their own defence, rather than relying on the protection of the US military umbrella. Trump has demanded Nato allies lift their spending to 5% of GDP, far in excess of the 2% Nato countries have agreed to, and the 3% the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, has urged those countries to reach. Trump told a campaign rally he had even threatened one Nato ally the US would disregard Nato’s collective defence imperative in the face of Russian aggression for countries who had not spent enough on their own defence forces. “‘You didn’t pay? You’re delinquent?’”Trump recounted telling a Nato member representative. “‘No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay. You gotta pay your bills.’” The US under-secretary of defence policy, Trump’s No 3 man at the Pentagon, Elbridge Colby, told a Senate hearing the US wanted Australia to reach a 3% defence spending threshold. “The main concern the United States should press with Australia ... is higher defence spending. Australia is currently well below the 3% level advocated for by Nato secretary general [Mark] Rutte, and Canberra faces a far more powerful challenge in China.” with Australian Associated Press",

    "title": "Australians could be waiting more than 70 years for affordable housing if prices follow path pushed by major parties",
    "article_text": "Australians would have to wait 70 years for affordablehousingif property values follow the “sustainable growth” path advocated by the two major parties. Labor and the Coalition this weeklaunched signature policiesto tackle the worsening housing affordability crisis, but both sides of politics said they did not welcome the idea of falling house prices. “Our plan is to get our country back on track to help young Australians realise the dream of home ownership again,” Peter Dutton said in his opening remarks in Wednesday night’ssecond leaders’ debate. “I want to see them [home prices] steadily increase. I don’t want to see a situation where Labor crashes the economy and somebody who’s paid $750,000 for a house today is worth $600,000 in 18 months’ time under an Albanese-Bandt government – that would be a disaster,” the opposition leader said. Anthony Albanese in a radio interview dodged the question of whether he wanted home prices to drop. “Look, historically in Australia … prices tend to rise. What we want to do is to make sure that people have accessibility for home ownership,” the prime minister said. Leery of advocating for falling house prices, politicians have instead backed the concept of “sustainable” price growth – where affordability is eventually restored by incomes growing faster than property values. But according to independent economist Saul Eslake: “This might sound nice, but it’s actually a con.” A simple analysis shows why. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter At the end of last year, the median price for a house in a capital city at $933,000 was 12.8 times the average adult Australian’s annual income of about $73,000. In comparison, at the turn of the century, the median house price of $178,000 was 6.5 times the average income of $27,600. While not a perfect measure of affordability, this doubling in the house price-to-income ratio shows how property has become far less affordable over time. Assuming home values from here climb in line with the Reserve Bank’s inflation rate target of 2.5%, and wages grow by 3.5% a year, it will take 70 years for this “sustainable growth” path to push the house price-to-income ratio back down to 6.5. In other words, the bipartisan approach to solving unaffordable housing is: waiting until the end of this century to return affordability to where it was at the close of the last. Even then, factoring in house price growth of 2.5% a year is a heroic assumption. Over the two decades to 2024, the price of the median capital city house has almost tripled to $933,000, according to CoreLogic. That’s equivalent to compound annual house price growth of 5.4%. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, also has a version of the sustainable growth solution to housing affordability, even as he touts more ambitious policy measures than the major parties. “We think having house prices stay the same for a while to give wages a chance to catch up is a reasonable compromise that will give first home buyers and renters some hope,” Bandt said. But even in this more hopeful scenario – where house prices stagnate and wages grow by 3.5% – it would take 20 years to return the affordability measure to where it was at the start of 2000. Similarly, it would take 11 years if home values dropped by 2.5% a year. And it would still take eight years if prices dropped by an extraordinary 5% annually. Eslake said rapid house price falls in the order of 20% would be disruptive, have wider economic consequences, and probably be triggered by a rapid rise in unemployment. Witness the experience such as Spain, Ireland and the US after the global financial crisis. “But what would be wrong with a 5-10% fall in house prices over a three-year period? That would do more to boost affordability than anything any government has done in the past 60 years,” Eslake said. Such a result was difficult to engineer via government policy, but Eslake said governments should at least not actively work to stem falling prices, as they have repeatedly done in the past. Ironically, this has been done via first homeowner grants – the same type of measures the two major parties are offering now as a cure for high prices. Cameron Kusher, an independent property expert, said the question of whether house prices should fall was a fraught one. “We have created this housing system where most of our wealth is held in residential property, especially when you exclude super,” Kusher said. “We’ve become accustomed to the idea that the way you get wealthy in Australia is you buy and hold property, and get wealthier over time. “It will take a big shift in mindset to change that.” Kusher said the most likely answer was to create more homes at lower price points, most obviously via a big lift in the number of apartments. This is something Auckland achieved via a massive rezoning of land that led to lower prices and rents than in the rest of the country. This, however, would demand another major shift in mindset: letting go of the dream of a standalone house. This article was amended on 23 April, 2025. A previous version said house prices had almost doubled, not tripled, over the past two decades. A previous version also said that was equivalent to annual average house price growth of more than 9%, rather than a compound annual house price growth of 5.4%.",

    "title": "Fears Australia underestimated Trump’s trade war after IMF slashes $13bn off forecast growth",
    "article_text": "Treasury may be underestimating the threat posed by Donald Trump’s trade war, after the International Monetary Fund slashed its outlook for Australia’s economic growth in 2025. Australia’s annual output will be $13bn lower in 2025 than predicted in January, the IMF’s latest forecasts revealed, with real GDP growth predicted to drop to 1.6%, from 2.1%. The grim outlook from the Washington-based body contrasts withTreasury’s sanguine assessment of only “modest” economic damagefrom the rise in global protectionism. It also suggests that whoever forms government after 3 May could be forced to respond to a drastically weaker economy than anticipated. The 25 March budget forecast Australia’s economy would grow by 2.25% in 2025 – substantially more than the IMF expected. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The pre-election fiscal outlook (Pefo) was released on 7 April, the Monday after Trump’s “liberation day” trade announcements, butdid not flag any substantial changes to the budget estimates. On the same day as Pefo, Jim Chalmers released updated Treasury modelling which showed only a “modest” impact on Australia from US tariffs, even as thelocal share market plungedand financial markets around the world convulsed. The IMF’s World Economic Outlook, however, implied Treasury officials may have been too sanguine about the risks. It lent credence to the Coalition’s claims that a failure to properly account for the economic fallout from tariffs may lead to major budget downgrades, especially if prices for key commodities – iron ore and coal – fall more quickly than expected. In a statement, Chalmers said the IMF report “confirms that trade tensions are weighing heavily on the global outlook and putting upward pressure on inflation around the world”. “We’re not immune from the turmoil in the global economy but the progress we’ve made together puts us in good stead,” he said. “Under the Albanese government, inflation is down substantially, real wages are up, unemployment is low, growth is rebounding solidly and interest rates have started to come down.” That “solid rebound”, however, may be in jeopardy. The new outlook also foreshadowed a major growth downgrade in the Reserve Bank’s next set of economic forecasts, which will be released in tandem with the next monetary board policy meeting on 19-20 May. The IMF’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, said the US president’s increase of import duties represented a “major shock”, and that it was difficult to judge the severity of the consequences. “The global economic system under which most countries have operated for the last 80 years is being reset, ushering the world into a new era,” Gourinchas said. “Existing rules are challenged while new ones are yet to emerge,” he said, warning of a collapse in mutually beneficial international arrangements as countries are pushed to a zero-sum world of “winners and losers”. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The IMF slashed its forecasts for real GDP growth in the US from 2.7% in 2025, to 1.8%. Even as activity slows, the IMF lifted its American inflation forecast for this year by one percentage point to 3% – well above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2%. Gourinchas said central bankers faced a tricky task balancing the inflationary pressures from tariffs – which would demand higher interest rates than otherwise – with slower growth, which would demand the opposite. And after Trump doubled down on his attacks on the chair of the US Federal Reserve Bank –calling Jerome Powell a “major loser” for not lowering interest rates– the IMF’s top economist responded. “Monetary policy credibility will be important in all cases, and central bank independence remains a cornerstone,” he said. China, which is a target of US import duties of more than 100%, will grow by 4% in 2024, down from 4.6%. China last month recommitted to a 5% annual economic growth target for this year, underpinning expectations of further rounds of public stimulus aimed at shoring up activity. Global growth will be substantially lower in 2025, according to the IMF, although not so low as to constitute a worldwide recession. “Growth prospects could, however, immediately improve if countries ease their current trade policy stance and forge new trade agreements,” Gourinchas said. Even as the IMF’s top economist called on countries to step back from the brink of a global trade war, he said “we should ask ourselves why our global system warrants remapping – and recognize that decades of deepening trade ties fostered rapid but uneven economic growth”.",

    "title": "Russia ‘may be willing to drop claims to parts of Ukraine it does not occupy’",
    "article_text": "David Lammy, the foreign secretary, will host US and European negotiators for fresh talks about Ukraine on Wednesday amid speculation that Russia has told Washington it might be willing to drop its claim to parts of Ukraine it does not occupy. The price would include the US making concessions to Moscow such as recognising the 2014 annexation of Crimea, though Ukraine’s presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid no such proposal had been shared with him by the White House and that his country could not endorse it. The emerging US-Russia plan would then envisage a ceasefire along roughly the existing front lines once Moscow’s territorial demand has been dropped, leaks suggest – something thatUkrainehas indicated it could accept, as long it did not have to recognise Russian occupation as permanent or legal. Ukraine would be prevented by a US veto from joining Nato, a point largely accepted by a reluctant Kyiv. The only future security guarantees for Ukraine will be provided by a UK-French 30-country coalition of the willing to provide a “reassurance force”, but this will not include the US. It had been hoped that Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, would attend the talks, but the state department said on Tuesday that would no longer be possible and that Keith Kellogg, the White House’s Ukraine envoy, would be present instead. The meetings in London take place amid European scepticism that the Russian leader is seriously willing to end the war, reinforced by events over Easter weekend, whenUkraine reported of thousands of violations of a short truceannounced by Russian president Vladimir Putin. John Healey, the defence secretary, told the Commons that the UK agreed with Ukraine that the Russian leader’s public pledges were not borne out by military reality. “Despite President Putin’s promise of a 30-hour pause in fighting, I can confirm that Defence Intelligence [an MoD unit] has found, and I quote ‘no indication that a ceasefire on the frontline was observed over the Easter period’,” he told MPs. “So, while Putin has said he declared an Easter truce – he broke it. While Putin says he wants peace – he rejected a full ceasefire. And while Putin says he wants to put an end to the fighting – he continues to play for time in negotiations.” On Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that Russia had continued to bomb the frontline with first-person view drones over Easter, though he said that the attackers had scaled back the number of operations and did not use long-range weapons. Healey also said he would meet Ukrainian defence minister, Rustem Umerov, “as the government is bringing together US, UK and European ministers and national security advisers to discuss next steps”. Ukrainian sources indicated that foreign secretary Andrii Sybiha was expected in London to meet Lammy, Kellogg and delegations from France and Germany at meetings expected to last throughout the day. Healey said the meetings in London would include discussion of “what a ceasefire might look like and how to secure peace in the long term”. Despite nearly three months of talks led by the White House there has until now been no breakthrough in ending the war. European officials had believed Moscow is not ready to agree to a ceasefire because Putin has not abandoned his efforts to dominate Ukraine while talks between the Kremlin and the White House continue. Russia has been demanding that Ukraine hand over the entirety of four eastern and southern regions its forces only partly occupy. That would include Kyiv ceding Kherson, which its forces recaptured in November 2022, and Zaporizhzhia city, proposals Ukraine would not be able to accept. But the FT reported on Tuesday thatthe Kremlin would soften its demands in direct discussions with the US, and would accept a freezing of the conflict on the frontline if the US agreed that Crimea, seized by Moscow in 2014, belonged to Russia. However, Zelenskyy ruled out recognising Crimea as Russian territory. “There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea,” he said, pointing out that it would be incompatible with Ukraine’s constitution. No details of any revised peace plan had been formally shared with Kyiv, Zelenskyy added. He said discussions should take place in the London format, rather than through the media, with the UK, France and the US as participants. According to one report in the Telegraph, Russia would hand over control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe, not to Ukraine but to the US – though it is unclear how Kyiv would respond to this. Putin floated on Tuesday that he wasopen to direct negotiations with Ukraine, which would be the first time the two countries had held peace discussions since spring 2022. This could involve discussing the issue of not striking civilian targets, his spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, later added. The US is expected to relay Ukraine’s response to Putin after the London meetings. Steve Witkoff, who is a close friend of Donald Trump and his informal envoy, is set to visit Moscow later this week. Witkoff has held three in-depth meetings with Putin, and his apparently warm relationship with the Kremlin has raised concerns in Ukraine that he may be amplifying Russian narratives.",

Highly unlikely,”Anders Arborelius, told Swedish public broadcaster SVT. The Italian government has declaredfive days of mourningafter pope’s death, a decision made at this morning’s meeting of the ministers. The period of mourning willlast until Saturday,the day of the funeral. US presidentDonald Trumpsaid overnight that he was planning to travel to Vatican for the funeral ofPope Francis, expected later this week. Ina post on Truth Social, he said: “Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome. We look forward to being there!” Outgoing German chancellorOlaf Scholzis the latest national leader to confirm his plans to attend the funeral on Saturday. Polish presidentAndrzej Dudawill also attend and proposed to declare a day of national mourning on Saturday, the day of the funeral.

Queen SonjaofNorwaywas discharged from an Oslo hospital on Tuesday after being admitted the previous evening for breathing difficulties, the royal palace said. China’s foreign ministry expressed condolencesover the death ofPope Francis, but said it had no information to share on who might attend the funeral, Reuters reported.

Spainwillmeet Nato’s target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defence this year, much earlier than its previous self-imposed deadline of 2029, prime ministerPedro Sánchezsaid. Kensington Palace said the decision on William’s attendance follows UK government advice. William, a future head of the Church of England, did not meetPope Francis. The Prince of Wales is to attend the Pope’s funeral on behalf of the King, Kensington Palace has announced. Heir to the throne William, a future head of the Church of England, will represent his father by travelling to Vatican City for Pope Francis’s funeral mass in St Peter’s Square on Saturday. The decision is in keeping with modern tradition and will be seen as a major milestone in William’s role as a global statesman and future king. Charles as the Prince of Wales went to Pope John Paul II’s funeral, representing his mother the late Queen, in 2005. The first time he spoke toPope Francisduring the pontiff’s nightly calls to the Holy Family Catholic church in Gaza City, the congregant George Antone, 44, found himself at a loss for words. It was October 2023, a few weeks after Hamas ignited a devastating war in theGazaStrip by attacking Israel. The Palestinian territory’s tiny Christian community had taken shelter in the strip’s three churches, but that didn’t mean they were safe. An Israeli airstrike had just hit the Greek Orthodox church, killing 18 people; soon, snipers and bombs would also kill civilians at the Holy Family. “I was so shy when Father Yousef handed me the phone, and there was his holiness on the screen looking at me. I thought, ‘Am I dreaming, what do I talk to him about?’ He was smiling and sweet, he asked me about what I’d had to eat that day, about my family,” Antone said. “We spoke about everything. He got to know all of us … Despite everything on his shoulders in this world he cared about us in Gaza. It feels like we have lost our father.” Argentina-bornPope Francisis being honoured at his local home town football club in Buenos Aires, San Lorenzo de Almagro, where the football-loving head of the Roman Catholic church remained a member during his 12-year papacy. Fans from the first-tier Primera Division club started gathering from Monday at the club’s chapel to the south-west of the Argentine capital to bid farewell to their best-known member. “The pope leaves an unbreakable legacy,” San Lorenzo club president Marcelo Moretti told Reuters. “For all San Lorenzo fans, he was a source of great pride. It is a very sad day.” At the chapel fans lit candles near a statue of Francis adorned with the team’s red and navy blue colours. San Lorenzo fans took to social media on news of the pope’s death to point out that his club membership number – 88235N-0 – coincided exactly with his age and the time of death. “He died at 88 years old, at 2:35am (in Buenos Aires, 5.35 GMT) and was member 88235. It really caught my attention,” wrote one San Lorenzo fan on X. The club confirmed the pope’s membership number to Reuters. … and on that note, it’s a wrap from me,Jakub Krupa, but I leave you withTom Ambrosewho will guide you through the afternoon and bring you all the latest updates from theVatican. Peoplewill be able to pay their final respects to Pope Francisin St. Peter’s Basilica from Wednesday through Friday, the Vatican said in a statement reported by Reuters. Catholicfaithful and the general publicwill be able to visit: from 11:00 am (0900 GMT) to midnight onWednesday, 7:00 am to midnight onThursday, and 7:00 am to 7:00 pm onFriday. TheVaticanhas now publisheda booklet for tomorrow morning’s “translation of the coffin,”the process of moving it from Santa Marta to St Peter’s Basilica, with all relevant texts. Here is a taster of what to expect in remarks to be delivered by CardinalKevin Joseph Farrell, Camerlengo of the church: Dear brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow, we now accompany the mortal remains of our Pope Francis to the Vatican Basilica, where he often exercised his ministry as Bishop of the Church which is in Rome and as Pastor of the universal Church. As we now leave this home, let us thank the Lord for the countless gifts that he bestowed on the Christian people through his servant, Pope Francis. Let us ask him, in his mercy and kindness, to grant the late Pope an eternal home in the kingdom of heaven, and to comfort with celestial hope the papal family, the Church in Rome and the faithful throughout the world.

In 2002, the Boston Globe published aseries of articlesexposing the scale ofchild sexual abuse in the local Catholic church.It shone a spotlight – the title of a latermovie based on the investigation– on the church’s dark shameful secrets. Eleven years later, Francis became pope. Wave after wave of abuse revelationscontinued to crash at the Vatican’s doorsamid mounting anger and revulsion among the faithful and beyond. The issuethreatened to derail Francis’s papacyand dominate his trips abroad. He was slow to grasp the scale and systemic nature of the issue and apparently reluctant to take firm action to deal with abusers and those who covered up abuse. Within hours of Francis’s death on Monday, survivors of clerical sexual abuse sounded a discordant note amid the lavish tributes. They saidthe pope failed to fundamentally change the culture of deferencethat allowed abusers to flourish and failed to deliver decisive action. It was the “tragedy of his papacy”, said one organisation. Members of the conclave that will meet in the coming days to choose a successor to Francis will know survivors will be watching closely. “The next pope must act wherePope Francisdid not,” said Ending Clergy Abuse group. “He must implement a universal zero-tolerance policy – one that holds clergy fully accountable for abuse and its concealment. He must reject secrecy and complicity and place the protection of children and vulnerable adults at the heart of the church’s mission.” Shaun Dougherty, the Survivors’ Network of those Abused by Priests’s president, said: “We cannot afford another papacy that makes promises but fails to deliver real protection for children and justice for survivors.” Peoplearound the world are mourning the death of Pope Francis, and our picture editors picked some of the best photos for you in their daily selection.

Queen SonjaofNorwaywas discharged from an Oslo hospital on Tuesday after being admitted the previous evening for breathing difficulties, the royal palace said. “Her Majesty the Queen has been discharged from Oslo university hospital,” the palace said. “The Queen was admitted due to shortness of breath. Examinations show thatthe situation has normalised,” it said, adding that she would be on sick leave for the rest of the week. Sonja, 87, had been transported by medical helicopter from the royal chalet in Sikkilsdalen, where she and King Harald – Europe’s oldest reigning monarch at 88 – were spending the Easter holidays. French foreign ministerJean-Noël Barrotcalled Russian presidentVladimir Putin’sUkraine Easter truce announcement“a marketing operation”aimed at mollifying US leader Donald Trump, AFP reported. “The Easter truce that he announced somewhat unexpectedly wasa marketing operation, a charm operation aimed at preventing President Trump from becoming impatientand angry,” Barrot told the FranceInfo broadcaster, a day after Russia launched aerial attacks on Ukraine in an abrupt end to the fragile Easter truce. The new attackscast doubt on Trump’s hopes for a broader ceasefirebetween the two sides, after he said a “deal” could be struck this week. On Wednesday, key representatives from the US, Ukraine, Britain and Francewill meet for further talks on Ukraine in London. Meanwhile,the Kremlin said it was open to direct talks with Ukrainebut declined to back Kyiv’s proposal to extend the Easter ceasefire. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday that there wereno concrete plans for negotiationson halting strikes against civilian targets, but that the Russian president was willing to discuss this directly with Ukraine if Kyiv removed “certain obstacles”. Formore updates on Ukraine,you can follow our Ukraine live blog here: Spainwillmeet Nato’s target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defence this year, much earlier than its previous self-imposed deadline of 2029, prime ministerPedro Sánchezsaid. Reuters reported that Spain, which spent just 1.3% on defence in 2024, the lowest among Nato members, and other European countries are under pressure from US presidentDonald Trump,who is pushing Nato allies to lift military spending to as high as 5% and is reluctant to continue funding Kyiv in the war in Ukraine. Sanchez said hewould meet the goal through additional spending of €10.47bn, with a focus on increasing the size of its military, telecommunications, cybersecurity and procurement of military equipment. “This plan will help us meet (the target) in record time,” Sanchez said. “Spain will contribute to defending Europe.“ Reuters noted thatItaly said last week it will also meet Nato’s 2% targetthis year through a series of accounting changes. Let’s take a brief detour to bring you the latest news from aroundEuropeon other topics. A Swedish cardinal considered to be among the potential favourites to succeedPope Francissaid thathe did not expect to be electedat the coming conclave, AFP reported. “Itwould be funto have a Swedish pope but I think it’s pretty unlikely. Highly unlikely,”Anders Arborelius, told Swedish public broadcaster SVT. Arborelius, the first Swedish Catholic bishop since the Protestant Reformation more than 500 years ago, was appointed as the Scandinavian country’s first cardinal in 2017. He converted toCatholicismat the age of 20 in the overwhelmingly Protestant country but also home to one of the world’s most secularised societies, AFP noted. Arborelius confirmed he would take part in the conclave to elect the next pope but told SVT that he had asked Francis to release him from his duties as cardinal, because he wants to return to live in his monastery in southern Sweden. He said the pope had approved his request but no date had been set for the end of his tenure.",

    "article_text": "Dmitry Peskov says Russia ready to consider Zelenskyy’s proposal to halt attacks on infrastructure such as energy facilities as Ukraine says Russian attacks have killed six Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskovhas been speaking to journalists in his regular media briefing. He said Russia is ready to consider a proposal by Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyfor a halt to attacks by both sides on each other’s civilian infrastructure, such as energy facilities. But Peskov said there are no concrete plans in place yet for direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow,something Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed an openness towards yesterday. Zelenskyy said on Monday thatUkrainewas ready for any form of discussion to bring about an end to attacks on civilian facilities, which include water, transportation, electricity and communication systems. “Ukraine maintains its proposal not to strike at the very least civilian targets. And we are expecting a clear response from Moscow,” he said. “We are ready for any conversation about how to achieve this.” Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Peskov was quoted by the Reuters news agency as having said: Actually, the president explained the complexity of this topic just yesterday, answering journalists’ questions. That is, if we talk about civilian infrastructure facilities, we need to clearly differentiate in what situations these facilities can be a military target, and in what situations they cannot. Peskov quoted Putin as saying that a civilian facility could become a military target if enemy combatants were meeting there. “Therefore there are nuances here that it makes sense to discuss,” he added. Russian attacks againstUkrainehave killed at least six civilians over the past day, officials said. TheKharkiv,KhersonandSumyregions and he Ukrainian city ofZaporizhzhiahave all been targeted in the attacks. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovsaid Russia is ready to consider a proposal by Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyfor a halt to attacks by both sides on each other’s civilian infrastructure, such as energy facilities.

Putin’s so-called Easter truce was part of a “charm offensive” aimed at appeasing Donald Trump, the French foreign ministerJean-Noel Barrotsaid. Representatives from Ukraine, the UK, France, and the US will meet in London tomorrow to continue talks on a potential ceasefire in the war. Media reports suggest the US is promoting a “peace deal” that heavily favours Russia. Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coveragehere. My colleagueJennifer Rankinhas written an analysis piece about howViktor Orbán’shostile stance on Ukraine is straining Hungary’s relations with the EU. Here is an extractfrom her story: Hungary has repeatedly sought toblock EU sanctions against Russia, eventually backing down. It has vetoed the release of €6bn funds to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and flatly refused to sign two EU declarations in support of its invaded neighbour. But now its attempts to stymie EU support for Ukraine could force a reckoning in its relations with the bloc at a moment when Orbán contends with his most serious political challenger in years. EU member states are considering more seriously than ever how to use their ultimate sanction against Hungary: the removal of voting rights under theEU treaty’s article 7. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchezhas said his government will raise defense spending by €10.5bn ($12bn; £9bn) to reach Nato’s 2% of GDP target. The spending would go toward telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment, he said, as well as raising salaries and adding troops to the armed forces. Spain, which spent the least of all Nato members last year on defence as a share of GDP, had previously committed to reaching the 2% target by 2029. But it has come under pressure for not spending enough compared to other Nato members (such as Poland) at a time when Russia continues to attackUkraineand the Trump administration pulls its commitment to propping up European security. Vladimir Putin’s so-called Easter truce over the weekend was a “charm offensive” aimed at appeasing Donald Trump, the French foreign ministerJean-Noel Barrothastold FranceInfo. “A charm offensive aimed at preventing President Trump from becoming impatient and angry, so to speak,” he told the broadcaster, adding that the 30 hour truce was a marketing ploy by the Kremlin. Both Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of violating Putin’s 30 hour “Easter truce” over the weekend, with drone strikes and shelling. Ukrainian forces reported nearly 3,000 violations of Russia’s ceasefire with the heaviest attacks and shelling seen along thePokrovskpart of the frontline. As we mentioned in a previous post, representatives from Ukraine, the UK, France, and the US will meet in London tomorrow to continue talks on a potential ceasefire in the war, as Washington signals its impatience with the lack of progress in negotiations. Britain and France have proposed that a mainly European “reassurance” force should be deployed inUkraineif a ceasefire starts. But many European leaders say such a force would need US support. The Kremlin says it is open to direct talks withUkrainebut has declined to back Kyiv’s proposal to extend the Easter ceasefire. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday that there were no concrete plans for negotiations on halting strikes against civilian targets, but that the Russian president was willing to discuss this directly with Ukraine if Kyiv removed “certain obstacles”. While rare, it is not unprecedented for Putin to suggest direct talks with the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russia has frequently claimed it was open to talks withUkrainebut that Kyiv made that legally impossible under a 2022 decree barring negotiations with Putin. The Russian leader has previously suggested Ukraine must hold elections and choose a new president before any such talks could take place. There have been no official direct talks between the two sides since the early weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. British prime minister Keir Starmer praised the “resilience” of Ukrainians as he addressed personnel taking part in training being provided by British personnel and other allies to Ukrainian troops. Addressing Ukrainians taking part in the programme to train troops, the prime minister thanked them for attending and said it is “incredible to see the resilience and inspiration that you have” as they head to the Russian frontline. He said that some attending were there for the second “or even the third time” and that it was “humbling” to see “so many people have come from different backgrounds, civilian backgrounds, doing all sorts of other jobs, and now heading either to the frontline for the first time or heading back to the frontline”. Starmer added: “I don’t think it could come at a more important point. “I think it’s incredible that all of the predictions at the beginning of this conflict were that the aggressor Russia would succeed very quickly, and they didn’t. “Because of the resilience of the Ukrainians, because as you fought back and forth for your country and fought for all of us in fighting for your country.” Russia struck the Ukrainian city ofZaporizhzhiawith two guided aerial bombs on Tuesday, killing a woman and injuring at least 22 other people, including children, regional governor Ivan Fedorov said. He said the attack damaged residential buildings and an infrastructure facility. Fedorov said doctors were treating children as well as others injured in the attack, during which one of the guided bombs reportedly struck a densely populated area of the city at about 1140am (0840 GMT). Over the course of its war onUkraine, Russia has frequently targeted Zaporizhzhia, which was home to approximately 710,000 residents before Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The attack on Zaporizhzhia comes as Kyiv says it is prepared for any discussion with Moscow to halt attacks on civilian targets. Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskovhas been speaking to journalists in his regular media briefing. He said Russia is ready to consider a proposal by Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyfor a halt to attacks by both sides on each other’s civilian infrastructure, such as energy facilities. But Peskov said there are no concrete plans in place yet for direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow,something Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed an openness towards yesterday. Zelenskyy said on Monday thatUkrainewas ready for any form of discussion to bring about an end to attacks on civilian facilities, which include water, transportation, electricity and communication systems. “Ukraine maintains its proposal not to strike at the very least civilian targets.

Peskov quoted Putin as saying that a civilian facility could become a military target if enemy combatants were meeting there. “Therefore there are nuances here that it makes sense to discuss,” he added. Russia’s defence ministry says its forces have taken the village ofSukha Balkain eastern Ukraine’sDonetskregion. Russia has been slowly increasing the amount of territory it controls over the past year, mostly in eastern Ukraine, with Moscow’s forces continuing to make incremental battlefield gains despite heavy casualties. In a televised meeting with his commander-in-chief on Saturday, Vladimir Putinsaida temporary Easter ceasefire would last from 6pm Moscow time (4pm BST) on Saturday until midnight (10pm BST) on Sunday. Putin claimed he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the frontline during this window for “humanitarian reasons”. But both Kyiv and Moscow subsequently accused each other of violating the ceasefire, with drone strikes and shelling. Washington said it would welcome an extension of the truce, andVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid Ukraine would pause strikes for 30 days. Putin, however, did not give orders to extend the 30 hour ceasefire – which never was -nbeyond Sunday. Here is some more detail and context onVladimir Putinsaying he is open to the possibility of bilateral talks with Ukraine for the first time in years. As we mentioned in the opening post, the Russian president told state TV yesterday that Moscow has a “positive attitude towards any peace initiatives”, adding he hopesVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Ukrainian officials “feel the same way”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin’s comments showed an openness to engage in direct talks with Kyiv about not striking civilian targets, something Zelenskyy proposed over the weekend. Zelenskyy saidUkrainewas “ready for any conversation”, suggesting he is willing to engage in ceasefire talks with Russia on condition it doesn’t cross any of his red lines and protects civilians from attacks. There have been no direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow sinceRussialaunched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Unlike former US president Joe Biden, Donald Trump – and his team – have directly engaged in talks with Russia. Last Friday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,warned that the US could walk away from its mediating rolewithin “days” if there were no signs of progress in talks. Trump later backed up this sentiment, but did not provide a timeline. Russian forces have retaken theSt. Nicholas Belogorsky monasteryin the village ofGornalin Russia’sKurskregion, where Ukrainian troops had been holed up, Russian state news agency Tass reported, citing a security source. A Russian military Telegram channel saidUkrainehad deployed troops, artillery and drone launchers at the historic site, which it said Russia had retaken after 10 days of fierce fighting. We have not been able to independently verify these claims. Russia has been trying to eject Ukrainian forces from Kursk since last August afterUkraine launched a daring incursionthat Volodymyr Zelenskyy hoped would give him a bargaining chip in any future talks to end the war. However, in recent weeks Russia has retaken a swath of territory inside Kursk and has begun to push ahead into Ukraine’s neighbouring Sumy region. Russian attacks againstUkrainekilled at least five civilians over the past day, officials said. Two deaths (of a 54-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man) were reported in the village ofPetropavlivkain theKharkivregion. Officials said a 24-year-old man was killed by a Russian drone in the village ofIvashky, also in Kharkiv, yesterday evening. The governor of theKhersonregion said one person was killed and seven others injured in Russian attacks on 36 settlements across the oblast over the past day. In theSumyregion, Russia targeted the Esman community, reportedly killing one person yesterday. We have not been able to independently verify this information yet. As we mentioned in the opening post, Ukraine is due to participate in talks with US and European countries in London on Wednesday. British prime ministerKeir Starmerhas toldVolodymyr Zelenskyyhe supports Kyiv’s calls for a full ceasefire and said the UK and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have proposed providing a “reassurance” force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The US, however, has so far held off its support as it pulls back from its long role as a bulwark of European security. In a post on X, Zelenskyy said: Already this Wednesday, our representatives will be working in London. Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States - we are ready to move forward as constructively as possible, just as we have done before, to achieve an unconditional ceasefire, followed by the establishment of a real and lasting peace. Russia has maintained its maximalist demands: thatUkrainecede all the land Putin claims to have annexed and accept permanent neutrality. Ukraine says that would amount to surrender and leave it undefended if Moscow attacks again. The opposing demands have frustrated Washington, with US President Donald Trump wanting to bring a quick end to the war, which he has described as a huge drain on American resources. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war onUkraine. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas said for the first time in years that he is open to bilateral talks with Ukraine, having previously demandedVolodymyr Zelenskyybe replaced before it could happen. Speaking to Russian state TV, Putin said: We have always talked about this, that we have a positive attitude towards any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way. His comments were followed by Russian forces launching a mass overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Black Sea port city ofOdesa, which, according to local officials, injured three people and damaged many apartment buildings. “The enemy targeted a residential area in a densely populated district of Odesa,” mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov wrote in a post on Telegram. Putin’s change of rhetoric on truce talks came as representatives from Ukraine, the UK, France and the US were set to meet in London tomorrow to talk about a potential ceasefire agreement. Zelenskyy, under pressure from Washington to agree to some sort of agreement or have support potentially withdrawn, said the London talks “have a primary task: to push for an unconditional ceasefire. This must be the starting point”. In some other developments: The Ukrainian air force said on Tuesday that Russia launched 54 drones during an overnight attack. The air force said it shot down 38 drones and another 16 did not reach their targets, likely due to electronic warfare countermeasures. Russia’s air defence units destroyed 10 Ukrainian drones overnight, downing half of them over the Crimean Peninsula, according to reports. Leaks suggest the Trump administration is now pushing for a “peace deal” that heavily favours Russia. It would include a pause to the war along the existing 1,000km frontline; recognition that Crimea belongs to Moscow; and a veto on Ukraine’s Nato membership. There are also unconfirmed reports that theZaporizhzhia nuclear power station– which Russia seized in 2022 – would be part of a “neutral” zone.",

    "title": "Spain unveils €11bn plan to reach long-delayed Nato defence spending target",
    "article_text": "Spain has announced a €10.5bn investment plan to ensure it will reach its long-delayed Nato commitment of spending 2% of its GDP on defence this year, saying it has become obvious “onlyEuropewill know how to protect Europe” from now on. The country – which lags well behind other western nations by dedicating about 1.3% of its GDP to defence spending – is one of theNato members that has been pressured by the Trump administrationto increase its spending, and had previously committed to hitting the 2% threshold by 2029. But speaking on Tuesday morning, Spain’s prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, unveiled a €10.5bn (£9bn) “industrial and technological plan for security and defence” that will allow Spain to meet the 2% commitment in 2025. Sánchez said the plan, which has been approved by his cabinet and will now be submitted to the EU andNato, was needed to address the current and future defence challenges. Its main focus will be telecommunications, cybersecurity and buying military equipment. “The enemies of Europe are not just using missiles – as we have seen in Ukraine over the past three years,” he said. “They’re also using unmanned drones and paramilitary forces to sabotage supply chains and to cut gas lines and underwater cables. They’re using social networks to issue disinformation and to polarise people and spread disaffection towards democratic institutions. They’re using AI cyber-attacks and quantum computers to compromise out telecommunications, our supply networks, and our public services in order to target our way of life.” The prime minister – who pointed out that his administration was finally making good on the 2% commitment pledged by its conservative predecessor in 2014 – said the new plan would help reinforce European security in record time. “In a world that’s dominated by uncertainty, Europe is hope and it is certainty – and that certainty must be protected by strengthening our security and defence systems because given what’s going on, it’s obvious that only Europe will know how to protect Europe,” he added. “AndSpainwill contribute to protecting Europe.” Sánchez said Vladimir Putin’s “neo-imperialism” was a threat to European security, no matter how far any EU member state was from the frontlines of the conflict in Ukraine. “The security and stability of Ukraine, of eastern Europe and the Baltic and Nordic countries, is also the security and the safety of Spain,” he said. “The people who live in those countries know that Putin is serious – and that his words are backed by deeds – and that’s why they look to Europe for protection. They’re looking for something important, and that is unity. Spain will not be indifferent to that demand. Ukraine resists, Europe responds and Spain fulfils its obligations.” Sánchez also repeated his assurances that the additional spending would not lead to increased taxes, raids on the welfare state budget, or deficit increases. The plan has faced criticism from coalition partners in the leftwing Sumar platform, who described the plans as “incoherent” and “absolutely exorbitant”. In January, Donald Trump increased pressure on Nato, claiming the US had shouldered the global defence burden for too long and saying he would ask all Nato members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP. The Nato secretary-general, Mark Rutte, has urged member states to use the threats from Washington as an incentive to take unilateral action on raising defence contributions. Last month, Rutte said the pressure was already paying off in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Italy. “I tell them that, well, now I am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2% by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2% because we have to spend much, much more than 2% but now I am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from Washington on the line if you don’t listen to me,” he said.",

    "title": "French minister reports #SkinnyTok to regulator over anorexia concerns",
    "article_text": "The French government is seeking to take action against aTikTokgroup promoting extreme thinness among young women and girls. France’s minister for digital media, Clara Chappaz, has reported #SkinnyTok to the country’s audiovisual and digital watchdog and the EU over concerns that the trend is body-shaming victims into anorexia and that algorithms are targeting the most vulnerable. The hashtag has been associated with more than half a million posts on the app. “These videos promoting extreme thinness are revolting and absolutely unacceptable,” Chappaz said. “Digital tools are marvellous in terms of progress and freedom, but badly used they can shatter lives … the social networks cannot escape their responsibility.” Last month, French lawmakers approved the creation of a parliamentary commission to examine the psychological effects of TikTok on children and adolescents. Martin Ajdari, the president of the regulator Arcom, is due to give evidence to the commission next month. Arcom said it was aware of the issue “as a public health risk” and was in the process of gathering information about the scale of the problem and to establish “what resources TikTok has put in place in response”. The EU’s Digital Services Act requires internet platforms to “put in place measures to mitigate the risks and to protect minors”. In 2015, French MPs voted to make encouraging anorexia punishable by up to a one-year prison sentence and €10,000 fine. Charlyne Buigues, a nurse specialising in teenage eating disorders, has createda petitionalerting of the dangers of #SkinnyTok and similar social media trends. She wrote: “I am confronted with the devastating effect certain images and or messages carried by social media such as those on #skinnytok can have on the mental and physical health of our young people. “These videos, often seen by adolescents, promote unrealistic body norms and encourage dangerous eating habits such as restrictive diets, excessive exercise or starvation behaviour.” On TikTok, a #SkinnyTok search brings up dozens of videos encouraging young women and girls to restrict their eating. “If you cannot control what you put in your mouth, what can you control?” reads one. Another says: “Skinny, but not skinny enough.” Up to 40,000 people in France are believed to suffer from anorexia nervosa, 90% of them adolescents. It is the deadliest psychiatric illness in the country. TikTok said it had deleted a number of posts and had strict rules against online body shaming “and dangerous behaviour linked to weight loss”. It added: “Content that idealises certain body types is subject to an age restriction.” The company said it had added to posts a message with information on where to find help for eating disorders.",

    "title": "Tuesday briefing: The reforms, conflicts and legacy of Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Good morning. On Sunday, after a 38-day hospitalisation, Pope Francis greeted crowds in St Peter’s Square and wished them a happy Easter. At 7.35am yesterday,he died at the age of 88, of a stroke and subsequent heart faillure. “He taught us to live the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially in favour of the poorest and most marginalised,” said Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is tasked with running the Vatican’s day-to-day affairs until a new pontiff is chosen. “With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul ofPope Francisto the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.” Francis was widely seen as one of the most consequential popes of recent times: an unpredictable leader who took office at a time of crisis, and unafraid of upsetting traditionalists – but also far from the simplistic progressive figure sometimes portrayed in secular accounts. And as preparations begin for the conclave that will elect his successor, it remains to be seen whether his outlook on the church’s role in the world solidifies into an enduring legacy. For today’s newsletter, I spoke toAnna Rowlands, a political theologian and professor of Catholic social thought at Durham University, about a figure who often defied his portrayal by progressives and traditionalists alike – and whether the changes he sought in the church will survive him. Here are the headlines. Benefits| Ministers areprivately ruling out scrapping the two-child benefit capdespite warnings from charities that a failure to do so could result in the highest levels of child poverty since records began. Government sources said charities and Labour MPs hoping for a change are “listening to the wrong people”. Israel-Gaza war| Humanitarian agencieshave rejected the findings of an Israeli military investigationthat concluded the killings of 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers last month were caused by “professional failures”. Jonathan Whittall, the UN’s humanitarian chief for Gaza, said the report represented a lack of “real accountability”. Ukraine| Vladimir Putin has said for the first time in years that he isopen to bilateral talks with Ukraine– having previously demanded that Volodymyr Zelenskyy be replaced before it could happen. Zelenskyy, whom the Russian ruler has falsely called an illegitimate president, meanwhile said Kyiv was prepared for any discussion to halt attacks on civilian targets. US universities| Harvard Universityhas filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is trying to “gain control of academic decision-making at Harvard”. The move comes in response to a freeze on billions in federal funding over the university’s refusal to accept demands including an attempt to enforce “viewpoint diversity” in teaching. UK news| Almost 250 peoplehave been imprisonedfor breaching antisocial behaviour injunctions since 2020, with people being jailed for sleeping rough, begging, feeding birds and making a noise. Analysis by academics at York and Coventry universities found that more than half of people jailed had no legal representation at their hearings. Anna Rowlands was personally appointed by Pope Francis to a two-year governance role at the Vatican; in their first extended conversation, he teased her about the tribulations of her football team, Manchester United. Still, she said wryly, he was always sceptical of theologians like her. “A theologian was the worst thing you could be,” she said. “The idea of spending a lot of time debating abstract ideas that made very little difference in reality – he thought that was the antithesis of how you changed the world.” That practically minded outlook defined his papacy. At the same time, Rowlands said, “he was deeply convinced of certain metaphysical truths. He believed that most of the core truths of life are simple, that they can be communicated simply, and that mercy, forgiveness, and the joy of faith could bring transformation.” What were the expectations of his papacy? When the Argentinian cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis in 2013, the first non-European to be chosen in more than 1,200 years and the first-ever member of the Jesuit order, his selection was seen as evidence of the church’s understanding that its future lay in the global south, where most Catholics live. He was viewed as a steely administrator and reformist who might help deal with the administrative and moral crises that beset the Vatican under his predecessor, Benedict XVI – the first pontiff to resign in almost 600 years. (Julian Coman’sexcellent analysisexplains the cliques, corruption, and “bunker mentality” that had taken hold in Rome as Benedict defined the church through “hostility to ongoing secularisation and alleged relativism in the west”.) Even against that backdrop, few observers understood quite how significant a figure Francis would turn out to be. There were signs right away. AsPeter Stanford’s truly fascinating obituarynotes, he was the first pontiff “to take on the name of the radical saint from Assisi who had turned his back on privilege and status in this world, and lived with and for the poor”. He wore simple white robes instead of a fancy cape, and relinquished the gilded papal apartment in favour of a simple two-room residence. As Stanford also writes: “On the day after his election … he slipped away on foot to collect his suitcase and settle the bill at the modestpensionewhere he had been booked in before the conclave began.” All of that was echoed in his will, which specified that he should be laid to rest in a tomb that is “simple, without particular decoration”. Popes are traditionally buried in three nested coffins of cypress wood, lead, and elm; Francis will be buried in a simple coffin of wood lined with zinc. What approach did those gestures signify? The symbolism of those steps was followed through in practice. “He turned out to be more radical than anyone anticipated,” Rowlands said. “Other recent popes have been quite conflict-averse. He was unafraid of conflict, and he understood the difference between tension that could lead to transformation and conflict that had nothing productive about it.” She places him alongside John XXIII, who instituted major changes through the Second Vatican Council (or Vatican II) in the early 1960s in an attempt to modernise an increasingly out of touch church – but whose reforms, from decentralising power away from Rome to prioritising pastoral care over dogma, were left incomplete. “He is a bookend figure with John XXIII,” she said. “He had this sense of urgency about completing the reforms that John had set in motion. He understood that if you wanted to implement Vatican II, you had to upend the pyramid, and start with the grassroots. He wanted people to feel empowered as ordinary Catholics – to know that they didn’t need to wait for Rome to take action.” Was he a liberal figure? There is something unintentionally hilarious about the way Francis was co-opted as a political liberal in some quarters: for a while, his every step was viewed through the prism of a reductive kind of progressivism that wanted to understand him as a straightforward ally, to take his place alongside former supreme court president Lady Hale and former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern in the imaginaryFBPEAvengers. That was never likely to hold true: “Is the Pope Catholic?” is a rhetorical question, after all. “There were real reasons that progressives got excited,” Rowlands said. “He supported the rights of migrants, he said ‘Who am I to judge?’ when asked about gay Catholics, and he met with transgender people at the Vatican. He wasn’t doctrinaire.” He made his first pastoral visit outside Rome to the Italian island of Lampedusa, where refugees were arriving in vast numbers, and saw their plight as inextricably linked to the climate crisis. “And when he wrote his environmental cyclical, Laudato Si’, which was the most read cyclical since the one about the Cuban missile crisis, a lot of people thought: Wow, this isourpope, we can embrace him.” But even if those were all important parts of his papacy, “he still maintained a position of recognisably Catholic doctrine”, she said. As Catherine Pepinsterwrites in this piece, he refused to countenance women becoming priests; meanwhile, he did not change the church’s stance that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered”, or that priests should not marry. And the church is, unsurprisingly, still opposed to abortion as a grave sin. How did he appear to conservatives in the church? Traditionalists were disappointed, too, Pepinster notes: after he decided to let parish priests make individual decisions about whether divorced Catholics who remarried should be allowed to receive communion, “his fiercest opponents published an unprecedented document – adubia, or expression of doubt, about his teaching”. “Conservatives felt he was at war with them, almost,” Rowlands said. “One of the most political battles was over his decisionto limit the use of Latin mass– they couldn’t understand why he was taking away something that they felt to be precious and countercultural. Some of them felt persecuted. They didn’t see all the other ways that he very much was a conservative.” Some even viewed him as illegitimate, saying that Benedict’s resignation was illegal, and that he remained the “true” pope. To Francis himself, none of his stances had a straightforwardly political valence. “He didn’t see himself as progressive or conservative,” Rowlands said. “He was always confused by these kinds of criticisms, because he just believed that he was doing what was in the gospel. In a way, that was part of what made him a pope of his time: he arrived as these kinds of labels were breaking down in lots of other spheres, and the church had its own version of that.” What kind of a legacy does he leave? When we talk about US presidents, we’re accustomed to the idea that they make change in two ways: the aggressive and short-term, often through executive orders, that can be swiftly reversed by their successors; and the cumulative, consensus-driven reforms that come through legislation, which are very much harder to unpick. It is the latter form that usually leads us to conclude that a president was truly consequential. The analogy is obviously imperfect, but something similar applies to popes: do they make an impact through bold statements from the pulpit, or do they set about lasting reform? Francis’ greatest achievement, Rowlands said, was to pursue the second kind of change. She points, above all, to his chewily named “synod on synodality”: a mass listening exercise that canvassed the views of Catholics around the world on an unprecedented scale. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “That was the most interesting example of how he thought change would happen inside the church,” Rowlands said. While some viewed its outcome as underwhelming, she classes it as “the cleverest thing he did – almost the pope as community organiser. It included women as full voting members, and it gathered up the views of every parish and religious order and grassroots community and moved them upwards so that any decision in Rome was loyal to what they said.” Now the question is whether the changes that Francis began – from reforms to finances and safeguarding to a more active role for women in governing the church – will endure after the college of cardinals picks his successor. (You can read more about the conclave, a little different from the one in the movie,in Harriet Sherwood’s piece here, and seesome potential candidates here.) “There’s always a degree of factional rivalry,” Rowlands said. “While it’s not like having a single new executive who can just change everything, these changes are fragile.” But the implementation phase of the synod continues until an ecclesial assembly in 2028, which will include women and lay people alongside bishops. “That is very significant,” Rowlands said. “It will be very difficult for another pope not to remain loyal to what it says.” Line Vaaben was granted access to apalliative careunit at Hvidovre hospital outside Copenhagen for ten days last year.Her tremendously moving long readfinds an alternative to assisted dying that is not a relentless pursuit of a cure at any cost, but an attempt at preparation for the inevitable.

    "title": "Israel ends mention of humanitarian zones as Gaza war grinds on",
    "article_text": "Israel has quietly stopped designating areas of Gaza as humanitarian zones since it resumed its strikes on the Palestinian territory last month. The move has heightened fears among aid workers for the safety of civilians sheltering in places previously deemed protected. A small strip of land in southGazawas assigned by Israel in December 2023 as a “humanitarian zone” where civilians were told they could safely gather. The area was expanded last May to cover a larger area in south-west Gaza, including Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi. Up to January, the humanitarian zone had been marked on maps that were posted online and dropped from the air by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). More than a million people had flocked to the areas as a result. The humanitarian zones were not entirely safe. Official figures showed they were hit by at least 28 Israeli strikes before January andan investigation by the BBCput the number as high as 97, with 550 people killed. The IDF accused Hamas militants of using the zones as protection and as a launchpad for attacks on Israeli troops. Mention of the humanitarian zones has disappeared from maps since Israel’s ceasefire with Hamas collapsed in March. The IDF has resumed its airstrikes and seized swathes of land as a “security buffer zone” and the UN estimates that 70% of Gaza is now under either an evacuation order or is a “no-go zone”. In meetings with aid agencies, the IDF and Cogat – the Israeli government unit coordinating policy in Gaza – have sidestepped questions about humanitarian zones, according to a senior international official who asked not to be named in order to speak freely. The source added: “[The Israeli authorities] have not indicated if they will reinstate some of the humanitarian zone designations. There’s a logic there: if they don’t reinstate the humanitarian zones, they therefore can’t guarantee security of movement within that zone for aid workers or civilians.” The IDF did not respond to questions on the issue. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have continued to flock to al-Mawasi, a sandy area with few buildings, many in the belief it is still a protected zone. But the area has been hit by 23 airstrikes since the ceasefire ended, according to the UN. Last week, two Israeli missiles struck refugee camps in al-Mawasi, setting fire to dozens of tents, many with women and children inside. The attacks killed at least 16 people and wounded many more. “Images of children burning while sheltering in makeshift tents should shake us all to our core,” said Catherine Russell of Unicef. Nasser, a father of four, sought sanctuary with his family at al-Mawasi after their home in Deir al-Balah was wrecked last year. “Mawasi was not really better,” said the 35-year-old accountant. “The conditions were crowded, hot, and dirty, there was nowhere to wash or have any privacy. Sometimes there were airstrikes on al-Mawasi when we were displaced there and they set the tents on fire. The Israelis told us to move again even inside the camp.” The family went back home when the ceasefire was declared but Nasser said it was now clear to everyone in Gaza that nowhere was safe. “We don’t know what to do,” he added. “I spent all day looking for clean water and firewood to make a fire to boil wastewater. But Mawasi is dangerous too, it has been targeted 20 times in the last month and there were many martyrs.” The UN warned on Tuesday that Gaza was facing famine after more than 50 days of a total Israeli blockade on aid entering the territory. Also on Tuesday, Israel airstrikes killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, described Gaza as a “land of desperation”. “Hunger is spreading and deepening, deliberate and manmade,” said Lazzarini on Tuesday. He said the 2 million people of Gaza were “undergoing collective punishment” and he charged Israel with using humanitarian aid as “a bargaining chip and a weapon of war”. His comments were echoed by Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, who told reporters on Tuesday: “It is true that right now is probably the worst humanitarian situation we have seen throughout the war in Gaza.”",

    "title": "At least 26 tourists killed by suspected militants in Kashmir attack",
    "article_text": "At least 26 tourists have been killed and ten injured after suspected militants opened fire at a popular local tourist destination in Kashmir during a scheduled four-day visit to the country by the US presidentJD Vance. Most of the victims were Indian, although two foreign nationals were also reportedly among the dead. The attack occurred in the Baisaran Valley, a picturesque meadow in Pahalgam, a well-known tourist town located 30 miles south-east of Srinagar, the region’s main city, in what officials are describing as the deadliest attack on civilians in the region in recent years. At about 3pm local time, a group of gunmen, who apparently approached tourists from the direction of the nearby mountains, emerged from a dense pine forest. Graphic videos shared by locals on social media showed injured tourists lying in pools of blood, while their relatives screamed and pleaded for help. Due to the area’s lack of road access, helicopter services were deployed to evacuate the wounded. Describing the scene, a local tour guide told the AFP news agency he reached the scene after hearing gunfire and transported some of the wounded away on horseback. “I saw a few men lying on the ground looking like they were dead,” said Waheed, who gave only one name. A female survivor told the PTI news agency: “My husband was shot in the head while seven others were also injured in the attack.” Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, wrote on social media: “This attack is much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years.” Government officials said the dead included tourists from the Indian states of Karnataka, Odisha and Gujarat and two foreign nationals. At least six others were wounded. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, decried the “heinous act” cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia. “Those behind this heinous act will be brought to justice ... they will not be spared. Their evil agenda will never succeed. Our resolve to fight terrorism is unshakable and will only grow stronger,” said Modi,who met with Vance the day before. Donald Trump expressed his “full support” to India in a call with Modi late on Tuesday, Delhi’s foreign ministry said. The scene of the attack was cordoned off as police launched an operation to track down the attackers. According to local police officials, two to three gunmen opened indiscriminate fire on tourists in the area, which is accessible only by foot or on horseback, before fleeing the scene. A witness speaking to India Today said: “The shooting occurred right in front of us. At first we thought it was just firecrackers, but when we heard others screaming we rushed out of there to save ourselves.” Another witness, who also did not reveal his name, said: “We didn’t stop running for 4km … I’m still trembling.”Protests erupted in several areas of the Indian-administeredKashmircondemning the attack, with a rally led by rightwing vigilantes in the city of Jammu blaming Pakistan. A militant group identifying itself as “Kashmir Resistance” has claimed responsibility for the attack in a social media message. The group cited anger over Indian settlement of over 85,000 “outsiders”, which it said was driving a “demographic change” in the region. The mountain region is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, and has been riven by militant violence since the start of an anti-Indian insurgency in 1989. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, although violence has tapered off in recent years. Indiarevoked Kashmir’s special status as an autonomous state in 2019, splitting the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Who controls Kashmir? The region in the foothills of the Himalayas has been under dispute sinceIndiaand Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world's most heavily militarised borders: the \"line of control\" based on a ceasefire border established after a 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east. India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged. How did the dispute start? After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous \"princely states\" across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad. Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control. In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held. In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders. What was Kashmir’s special status? Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, had been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence. An additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest. On Wednesday 31 October 2019, the government formally revoked Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision had only ever been intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule. What do the militants want? There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing. Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed withextreme forcein 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters. For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists.Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe This also allowed local authorities to issue domicile rights to outsiders, allowing them to get jobs and buy land in the territory. Authorities have described the attack as targeted and intended to spread terror among the tourists visiting Kashmir. Tuesday’s attack seems to be a major shift in the regional conflict where tourists for many years have largely been spared from violence despite a spate of targeted killings of Hindus, including immigrant workers from Indian states, after New Delhi ended the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019 and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms. The Baisaran area attracts tens of thousands of Indian tourists daily, especially during the summer months, when temperatures in mainland India soar. Indian army and paramilitary forces have been deployed to the area to search for the attackers. In recent years, militants have increasingly targeted security forces in the region’s mountainous and forested areas. Kashmir remains one of the most heavily militarised zones in the world and is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, although each controls only a part. The two countries have fought multiple wars over the region.",

    "title": "AI images of child sexual abuse getting ‘significantly more realistic’, says watchdog",
    "article_text": "Images of child sexual abuse created by artificial intelligence are becoming “significantly more realistic”, according to an online safety watchdog. TheInternetWatch Foundation (IWF) said advances in AI are being reflected in illegal content created and consumed by paedophiles, saying: “In 2024, the quality of AI-generated videos improved exponentially, and all types of AI imagery assessed appeared significantly more realistic as the technology developed.” The IWF revealed in its annual report that it received 245 reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery that broke UK law in 2024 – an increase of 380% on the 51 seen in 2023. The reports equated to 7,644 images and a small number of videos, reflecting the fact that one URL can contain multiple examples of illegal material. The largest proportion of those images was “category A” material, the term for the most extreme type of child sexual abuse content that includes penetrative sexual activity or sadism. This accounted for 39% of the actionable AI material seen by the IWF. The governmentannounced in Februaryit will become illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to generate child sexual abuse material, closing a legal loophole that had alarmed police and online safety campaigners. It will also become illegal for anyone to possess manuals that teach people how to use AI tools to either make abusive imagery or to help them abuse children. The IWF, which operates a hotline in the UK but has a global remit, said the AI-generated imagery is increasingly appearing on the open internet and not just on the “dark web” – an area of the internet accessed by specialised browsers. It said the most convincing AI-generated materialcan be indistinguishablefrom real images and videos, even for trained IWF analysts. The watchdog’s annual report also announced record levels of webpages hosting child sexual abuse imagery in 2024. The IWF said there were 291,273 reports of child sexual abuse imagery last year, an increase of 6% on 2023. The majority of victims in the reports were girls. The IWF also announced it was making a new safety tool available to smaller websites for free, to help them spot and prevent the spread of abuse material on their platforms. The tool, called Image Intercept, can detect and block images that appear in an IWF database containing 2.8m images that have been digitally marked as criminal imagery. The watchdog said it would help smaller platforms comply with the newly introduced Online Safety Act, which contains provisions on protecting children and tackling illegal content such as child sexual abuse material. Derek Ray-Hill, the interim chief executive of the IWF, said making the tool freely available was a “major moment in online safety”. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the rise in AI-generated abuse and sextortion – wherechildren are blackmailedover the sending of intimate images – underlined how “threats to young people online are constantly evolving”. He said the new image intercept tool was a “powerful example of how innovation can be part of the solution in making online spaces safer for children”.",

George, 50, said in a statement on Tuesday: “I was shocked and surprised to have been informed by the Gambling Commission that I am facing charges for cheating.“To be clear, I have never cheated. However, given the Gambling Commission’s decision, and my understanding of what will follow, this is likely to be a lengthy process that may not be resolved by May 2026.“In the circumstances, I feel I have no alternative but to withdraw my candidacy for next year’s Senedd elections so that I can focus on fighting to clear my name.“I will of course continue to serve the people of Montgomeryshire to the very best of my ability.“I am grateful for the many messages of support that I have received in recent days, particularly from constituents.”Among others facing charges are: Craig Williams, the former MP for Montgomeryshire; Nick Mason, a former chief data officer for the party; Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West last July; and Tony Lee, the Conservatives’ campaigns director, who is married to Saunders.

    "title": "Gold climbs above $3,500 for first time as Wall Street rallies after slide",
    "article_text": "Gold has climbed above $3,500 an ounce for the first time while stocks on Wall Street and the dollar rose following Monday’s sell-off prompted by Donald Trump’s blistering attack on the Federal Reserve chair,Jerome Powell. Spot gold reached the record price of $3,500.01 (£2,620) on Tuesday, extending a rally that has pushed bullion up from $2,623 an ounce at the start of this year. Analysts now predict the metal could even reach $4,000 only a matter of weeks after the price moved through $3,000 for the first time. The US currency and its government debt are usually seen as a safe haven during times of market turmoil, but as the US itself has caused much of the recent volatility investors have been turning to another “port in the storm”, gold, in large numbers. Trump’s tariffs have unleashed a “major negative shock”into the world economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned on Tuesday, as it cut its forecasts for US, UK and global growth. Most major European markets closed up slightly on Tuesday, and US markets opened higher, recovering most of the previous day’s losses on Wall Street. News that US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent had told an investor conference he expected trade tensions with China tode-escalatecheered investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 large US companies, the broader S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all ended the day up more than 2.5%. The FTSE 100 index in London rose by 0.6% – its highest close in more than two weeks – while Germany’sDAX and France’s CAC were up about 0.5%. Many Asian markets, including Japan’s Nikkei, had closed modestly lower. Traders are anxious after the US president intensified his attacks on America’s top central banker,calling Powell “Mr Too Late” and “a major loser”for not lowering interest rates. This pushed the dollar down against a basket of currencies to its lowest level since March 2022 on Tuesday morning, although it was up by 0.2% by the afternoon. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: “Persistent comments from PresidentDonald Trump, which put the independence of the US Federal Reserve in question, resulted in weakness in the dollar, US Treasuries and Wall Street overnight. “If the administration is able or willing to follow through on its threat to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell before his term is up next year, it could provoke an even stronger reaction amid fears about the implications for inflation.” The pound was little changed on Tuesday afternoon after hitting a seven-month high of $1.3423 earlier in the day. Stephen Innes, managing partner at the Swiss wealth management firm SPI Asset Management, said: “This is about more than Trump vs Powell. It’s about every corner of fiscal and monetary policy flashing one big red warning: confidence erosion.”",

    "title": "UK ministers face questions over supreme court gender ruling repercussions",
    "article_text": "Ministers have come under pressure to provide answers on how last week’ssupreme court rulingon gender identity will affect the daily lives of transgender people, amid confusion over issues such as toilet provision and hospital wards. Keir Starmer saidhe welcomed what he called “real clarity” and “a welcome step forward” in his first response to the court decision, which ruled that “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman. But Bridget Phillipson, who holds the equalities brief alongside her job as education secretary, faced repeated questions about the repercussions of the decision as she gave a Commons statement saying the government would use it to protect single-sex spaces. The equalities minister was roundly criticised by Kemi Badenoch for what the Conservative leader said was aLabourchange of heart on the subject, with Badenoch saying ministers needed to “root out gender ideology from our institutions”. Phillipson hit back, describing the leader of the opposition as a “keyboard warrior” who had failed to grasp the issue as equalities minister, saying the Tory leader should “get offline and get onboard”. Recounting her pre-parliament role helping to run a women’s refuge, Phillipson said the supreme court decision would help secure the safety of such spaces, while also arguing that the ruling was not about “the triumph of one group at the expense of another”. “This is a government that will support the rights of women and trans people now and always,” she added. “This is a government that will support the rights of all people with protected characteristics now and always. This is a government that will support the rights of our most vulnerable now and always.” She faced questions from a series of Labour MPs about what they said was a climate of fear generated by the ruling, particularly the practical impact of consequences such as transgender people potentially being obliged to use the toilets of their biological sex. Sarah Owen, the Labour MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, said: “Far from this ruling providing clarity, trans intersex and non-binary people are instead anxious and unsure about where this ruling leaves them, legally and practically, as they go about their lives.” Another Labour MP, Meg Hillier, raised the concerns of a constituent who transitioned to becoming a woman in the 1970s and had “used female toilets now for more of her life than she ever did any other toilets”, asking if she would now start to use male toilets. Other Labour backbenchers, including Emily Thornberry and Catherine Fookes, said they had been contacted in alarm by LGBTQ and trans organisations, with Fookes saying they were “really concerned and frightened about the potential implications of this judgement”. The Liberal Democrat equalities spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said that while she accepted Phillipson’s argument about women’s spaces, this “should not be at the cost of the human rights and security of another vulnerable group in society”. Phillipson also faced calls from Tory MPs to set out how the ruling would affect provision on hospital wards for transgender patients. She said she recognised the concerns and promised to meet MPs and others. However, she gave no answers to practical concerns, beyond saying that the updated code of practice from equalities watchdog the Equality and Human Rights Commission would take these worries into account. Earlier on Tuesday, Downing Street struggled to explain the seeming contradiction between Phillipson and other ministers suggesting trans people could use unisex or gender-neutral toilets in public spaces when updated building regulations inherited from Badenoch’s tenure as equalities minister set out that new buildings should prioritise single-sex facilities. “I’m not aware of those specific building regulations,” Starmer’s spokesperson said, adding:“It’s not for the government to tell businesses how to to run their premises.” With Starmer most likely being quizzed on the subject at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, some Labour MPs say they are concerned over the current position. “Toilet policing is not where we need to be in 2025,” one senior backbencher said. “No 10 needs to act. I don’t think we can leave this to a venue being taken to court because there’s no unisex toilet. I wish they hadn’t said it brings clarity, but had said we need to think about what happens next.” Also on Tuesday, theScottish government saidit would abandon plans to change legislation on gender recognition, saying it “fully accepts” the ruling of the supreme court. The case was prompted by long-running legal action brought by the campaign group For Women Scotland against Scottish ministers.",

    "title": "Badenoch says Labour’s claims to have always defended single-sex spaces are a ‘shameless work of fiction’ – UK politics live",
    "article_text": "Minister for women and equality makes statement after supreme court ruling on gender recognition Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary and minister for women and equality, is making her statement about the supreme court judgement. She starts by saying this is personal for her. Before I was elected to this place, I ran a women’s refuge in the north-east for women and children fleeing domestic violence. I know how important it is, and always want survivors to have single sex spaces, based on biology – places of safety after trauma, time in a sanctuary which allowed them therapeutic support, healing from unimaginable male violence and fear. Phillipson says the government will continue to protect single-sex spaces, based on biological sex. And it will protect “the rights of all people with protected characteristics now and always”. Phillipson explains the background to the supreme court ruling. The people who brought the legal challenge (gender critical feminists) were “not always been treated with the respect that they deserve”, she says. She says the government supports freedom of speech. But, referring to the protests at the weekend against the judgment, she says “there can be no excuse for defacing statutes and feminist icons, no excuse for threats, no excuse for harassment”. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary and minister for women and equality, made a statement to the Commons about the supreme court judgement.She said the government will continue to protect single-sex spaces, based on biological sex. And it will protect “the rights of all people with protected characteristics now and always”. Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, claimed that Tories fought for women at every point but that it faced “hostility from activist groups”. She said that, when she was in government, she argued for sex to be defined as biological sex. And she said she blocked the SNP introducing from introducing “their mad self identity laws”. Business and trade minister Sarah Jones told the Commons that British Steel will end a consultation on up to 2,700 redundancies without action, after the Government took control of the firm earlier this month. She added the government has secured the raw materials needed to keep the glass furnaces operating in Scunthorpe and it is working at pace to secure a steady pipeline of materials. Rachel Reeves was due in Washington on Tuesday evening for what could be a pivotal week for a proposed US-UK trade deal. Officials say an agreement is ready to sign but may have to be ripped up at the last minute should the US president impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The chancellor was flying into the US capital for meetings she hopes will help persuade Donald Trump’s administration to reduce tariffs on UK steel, cars and aluminium. “The draft text is there and it is ready to sign,” said one UK government source. “We are happy with the draft we presented to the Americans weeks ago – though it does not currently cover pharmaceuticals.” Britons are opposed to President Trump being invited to address parliament when he visits the UK by almost three to one, a YouGov poll suggests. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said today’s IMF report downgrading its growth forecasts for the UK (and the rest of the world) shows the need for an “urgent rethink” in British economic policy. In a statement, Davey said: “Donald Trump’s damaging trade war has taken a wrecking ball to the global economy, with the UK set to be badly hit. The government needs to be working to boost trade with our allies in Europe and the Commonwealth and tackle Trump’s tariffs head on. Simply sitting back and hoping we won’t be impacted hasn’t worked. It’s time for an urgent rethink before it’s too late.” Most of the excess rubbish accumulated in Birmingham as a result of the bin strike has been cleared, MPs have been told. Jim McMahon, the communities minister, said that, even though the strike continues, “significant progress” has been made in clearing the backlog. The government is considering long-term alternatives to blast furnaces as a way of making virgin steel, the industry minister said. Sarah Jones said officials were looking at examples in Europe where countries were using hydrogen rather than blast furnaces. She was responding to a question from former Tory trade minister Sir Edward Leigh, whose Gainsborough constituency is in the same county as the Scunthorpe steelworks. Jones said: “The capacity for primary steel-making production is very important and the steel strategy is looking at exactly how we deliver that. “There are new ways of delivering primary steel using for example hydrogen, which other countries, other European countries are now using and developing and we will ensure that whatever the future might bring, we have the right level of production here in this country.” Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith has described the government’s interventions at Scunthorpe as “botched nationalisation”. He told the Commons: “We’re here once again because the Government had no plan – they failed to prepare, they bungled negotiations, they took too long to listen to the warnings, and what do we have to show for it? This botched nationalisation. “A potential bill for the taxpayer stretching into the billions. I say billions, but it remains entirely unclear how much this bungled eleventh-hour decision will cost while the assets still belong to China.” Griffith later said: “Steel nationalisation, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) downgrading growth forecasts, trade union summits in Number 10 – it’s all sounding a bit 1970s. “The simple problem is that we do not know the answers to any of these questions as the Government has failed to publish an impact assessment.” Responding, industry minister Sarah Jones said: “On nationalisation, last week, the shadow business secretary – who was also as we know the financial secretary when Liz Truss crashed the economy – said he backed full nationalisation of British Steel, but on the other hand, this morning the Leader of the Opposition (Kemi Badenoch) on Radio 4 said nationalisation should be the last resort. “It seems a bit muddled.” Jones said Griffith had asked “reasonable questions about the costs” but warned some of the detail is “sensitive and commercially confidential”, adding: “We will publish accounts in due course.” Rachel Reeves was due in Washington on Tuesday evening for what could be a pivotal week for a proposed US-UK trade deal. Officials say an agreement is ready to sign but may have to be ripped up at the last minute should the US president impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals. The chancellor was flying into the US capital for meetings she hopes will help persuade Donald Trump’s administration to reduce tariffs on UK steel, cars and aluminium. “The draft text is there and it is ready to sign,” said one UK government source. “We are happy with the draft we presented to the Americans weeks ago – though it does not currently cover pharmaceuticals.” Another said: “We know we’re going to have to react quickly if Trump puts tariffs on pharmaceutical products, but we’re ready to do so. We couldn’t account for that in the draft text because we didn’t know what tariffs there were going to be on the industry.” Industry minister Sarah Jones said the government does not “intend to replicate” state intervention into sectors beyond steel as she told MPs that both of the UK’s last remaining blast furnaces can continue to operate. She told the Commons: “It is regrettable that when this Government took office, we inherited a steel sector in crisis and an iconic British company facing an existential threat. “Since day one, we have worked tirelessly with British Steel and the trade unions to find a resolution, because blast furnace closures at Scunthorpe is an outcome this Government was simply not willing to allow. “To that end, I want to stress that this kind of state intervention is not one we intend to replicate in other situations or other industries. We recognise that unprecedented action was warranted for what was a truly unprecedented situation.” Referring to an extraordinary recall of Parliament on a Saturday during its Easter recess, Jones later added: “Officials were on site to help British Steel within hours of the Steel Industry Act becoming law and we are already seeing the real-world impact of our decisive intervention. “I am delighted to say that British Steel has also confirmed today that they can keep operating both of the UK’s last remaining blast furnaces, in contrast to Jingye’s plans to shut one of them down earlier this month.” The Scottish government has said it will abandon its plans to change legislation on gender recognition, the high watermark of Nicola Sturgeon’s progressive agenda, as it moved to reassure the trans community that “you are valued”. In a statement to MSPs on Tuesday afternoon, the social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said Holyrood “fully accepts” the judgment of the supreme court, which ruled against Scottish ministers last Wednesday in the culmination of a long-running legal action brought by the campaign group For WomenScotland. In a decision that was backed by gender-critical activists, five judgesruled unanimouslythat the legal definition of a woman in the Equality Act 2010 did not include transgender women who hold gender recognition certificates (GRCs). For WomenScotlandwere challenging Scottish government legislation aimed at improving gender balance on public boards, which allowed trans women with a GRC to sit in posts reserved for women. Somerville said the Scottish government would now amend guidance on this legislation to take account of the ruling. Speaking on the ruling and its potential impact, she added that her government had “no plans” to bring back Sturgeon’s flagship gender recognition agenda, which wasblocked by Rishi Sunak’s UK governmentin 2023. It marks a significant change of tone under the first minister, John Swinney, who has avoided re-engaging with an issue that has been divisive within his party – in particular those opposed to the Sturgeon-brokered governing partnership with the Scottish Greens and their focus on LGBT+ policies. Equalities ministerBridget Phillipsonearlier in response to questions on when she will issue guidance to schools about gender questioning children, told the Commons: “We will be issuing that guidance this year.” Giving a readout of Keir Starmer’s meeting with his New Zealand counterpart, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister hosted New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon at Downing Street today. “The two leaders reflected on their visit to Operation Interflex to see Ukrainian troops being trained earlier today and the importance of supporting Ukraine for the long term. “Discussing the coalition of the willing, the Prime Minister thanked Prime Minister Luxon for New Zealand’s ongoing support, adding that the planning phase was making good progress across all four domains – land, air, regeneration and sea. “The Prime Minister welcomed New Zealand’s recent uplift in defence spending and both agreed the direct link between defence spending, economic security and putting money back in the pockets of hardworking people. “Turning to the situation in the Indo-Pacific, the leaders agreed on the importance of working together to support regional stability and counter malign threats. “They also discussed the strong trade links between the UK and New Zealand, and the UK’s accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The leaders looked forward to speaking again soon.” Sarah Jones adds that the government has secured the raw materials needed to keep the glass furnaces operating in Scunthorpe and it is working at pace to secure a steady pipeline of materials. Sarah Jones says British Steel has cancelled the redundancy consultations started by Jingye. Business and trade minister Sarah Jones will now update the Commons on the future of British Steel. That concludes the statements on the Supreme Court Judgement in Parliament. Reform MP Lee Anderson says “a man is a man, and a woman is a woman” and asks “can a woman have a penis?” Equalities minister Phillipson replies: “Blokes shouldn’t beat up women, maybe he should have a word with his colleague”. Phillipson was citing the case of James McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, who did not publicly disclose his conviction for assault before being elected in 2024, and claimed he had “pushed” his partner when details were first disclosed. The Times later obtained information about his sentencing from the courts, which said he was detained for 21 days in a young offender institution for kicking the victim “around four times” in 2006 when he was a teenager. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi asked if the charities Stonewall and Mermaids will be held to account for the “damage” they have caused, and said she had witnessed a “lobby” push MPs into asserting that trans women are women. Antoniazzi said: “Since I’ve been in this House, I have felt the force of the lobby which has made people and MPs across this House stand there and say that trans women are women. “What happened last week was the Supreme Court said that sex in the Equality Act is actually biological sex. That, I welcome. But what is (Bridget Phillipson) going to do to deal with the types of damage, or the damage that Mermaids, and Stonewall have caused for a generation, that’s 14 years, under a Tory government. “What steps is she going to take to make sure that they rectify the damage they’ve done to a generation of trans and gender questioning children?” Equalities minister Phillipson said: “Where we are talking about children and young people, this has to be about their wellbeing, because we are often talking about young people who are very vulnerable, who are experiencing real difficulties in their lives. “Hilary Cass’s review made clear that young people in that situation do need support, do need protection, and that is why we will this year also publish revised gender questioning guidance for our schools as well, to provide that further clarity that is needed.” Dawn Butler asks the minister whether her department is liaising with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to seek assurances that they will work at pace and set timelines for updating statutory guidance. Bridget Phillipson said they are working with EHRC in this important area. Labour MP Butler also asked if people will need to prove their birth sex. “I don’t know if anyone else in the House has butch lesbian friends, and have been with them when they’ve been told to get out of women’s toilets, but I have. And it is not pleasant and it is not nice,” she said. Phillipson said: “Lesbians should not be treated in a discriminatory way and we must ensure that there are toilets and facilities available for everyone within our country.” The SNP needs to “ditch the divisive gender self-ID agenda once and for all”, Conservative MP John Lamont said. Lamont told MPs: “The Supreme Court’s ruling goes a long way to guarantee the rights and safety of women and girls. “But does the minister agree with me that the judgment highlights why it’s now right for the SNP Government to finally ditch the divisive gender self-ID agenda once and for all, and proves it was totally wrong for ScottishLabourto back the SNP gender recognition reform Bill?” Equalities ministerBridget Phillipsonsaid: “My understanding is that the Scottish Government do not intend to progress their gender recognition reforms. My officials will work with the EHRC (Equality and Human Rights Commission), who will in turn also work with the Scottish Government. “I believe Scottish ministers have indicated that they wish to engage with the EHRC on this guidance, which is an important and welcome development.” Dame Meg Hillier asks about the ban on toilets, citing one trans constituent who has used female toilets for much of her life. Bridget Phillipson replies that the provision of single sex spaces is on the basis of biological sex and the EHRC’s code of practise for businesses and others will ensure there is appropriate provision for all. Dame Emily Thornberry told the Commons: “The overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community” is violence by men. The MP for Islington South and Finsbury in London added: “Over the last few days, calls to Switchboard, the national LGBT+ helpline in my constituency, has skyrocketed from callers who are in fear for what this ruling means to them. “Because trans people frightened to use public loos today know one thing – and does the Secretary of State agree we should all be clear about this – the overwhelming threat to women and to all of the trans community is the violence that we suffer from cis men?” Equalities ministerBridget Phillipsonreplied: “I agree that male violence remains a very serious challenge that we face as a country, a challenge that this Labour Government is determined to confront. “But I would say to her that the ruling of the Supreme Court was clear about the importance of biological sex, but I would not want any trans person in her constituency or anywhere across the country to be fearful. “I believe that everyone has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, not to face discrimination or harassment, and that is why we will back the police to ensure that action is taken against anyone who behaves in that way.”",

    "title": "Elon Musk to pull back in Doge role starting May amid 71% dip in Tesla profits",
    "article_text": "The Tesla chief executive,Elon Musk, said he will start pulling back from his role at the so-called “department of government efficiency” starting in May. Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the White House. On an investor call, Musk said the work necessary to get the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done”. “Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” he said. That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”. Musk is scheduled to leave Doge on May 30, a strict 130-day cap on his service as a special government employee. Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below Wall Street expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share. Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year. The companysuffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022.Teslaclosed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered. Though Musk has acknowledged there have been “rocky moments” of late, he remained optimistic about the company’s future. “The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.” That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla hashistorically struggled to meettimelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving. “The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said. This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said. Despite missing Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries. “Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst atInvesting.com.“In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue. “If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year,” Monteiro continued. Analysts attribute the company’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately concludeMusk’s role in the White House has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in Doge and returns to Tesla as CEO full time. In addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the Vancouver International Auto show removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold. Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.” Analysts are not convinced. “If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage…but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a Wedbush Securities analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.” The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”. “While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.” The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.",

    "title": "RFK Jr calls sugar ‘poison’ but says government probably can’t eliminate it",
    "article_text": "The US health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jron Tuesday called sugar “poison” and recommended that Americans eat “zero” addedsugarin their food, while acknowledging that the federal government was unlikely to be able to eliminate it from products. Kennedy, however, said that better labeling was needed for foods and that new government guidelines on nutrition would recommend people avoid sugar completely. The health and human services secretary also announced plans to eliminate the last eight government-approved synthetic food dyes from the US food supply within two years. Kennedy said at a press conference on Tuesday: “Sugar is poison and Americans need to know that it is poisoning us.” He added moments later: “I don’t think that we’re going to be able to eliminate sugar, but I think what we need to do, probably, is give Americans knowledge about how much sugar is in their products, and also, with the new nutrition guidelines, we’ll give them a very clear idea about how much sugar they should be using, which is zero.” The secretary said the public is under-informed about food. “Americans don’t know what they’re eating. We’re going to start informing Americans about what they’re eating,” he said. Meanwhile, he did not talk about vaccines or vaccinations at the press conference, but itwas reportedby Politico, citing sources familiar with departmental discussions, that Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, was considering removing the Covid-19 shot from the official federal list of recommended inoculations for children. The outlet quoted an HHS spokesperson as saying a final decision on whether to continue recommending coronavirus vaccines for children had not been made. In the food discussions at the press conference, Kennedy talked about various dyes. Health advocates have called for the removal of artificial and petroleum-based dyes from foods, with some studies suggesting a link to neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children, although aconclusive linkis still contested. The Biden administration previously moved to ban Red No 3 food dye, citing cancer risks in animal studies. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has consistently maintained that the approved dyes are safe. Following Biden’s directive, Red No 3 must be removed from foods by 2027 and from medications by 2028. Kennedy aims to remove the remaining petroleum-based dyes, health officials said. “American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,” the FDA commissioner, Marty Makary, said. “These steps that we are taking means that the FDA is effectively removing all petroleum based food dyes from the US food supply.” The move could mark a major step in Kennedy’s broader campaign against potentially harmful food additives. But some are still questioning how successful this campaign will be, especially regarding the Trump administration’santi-regulatory stancetowards industry giants. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion When asked whether a formal agreement with food industry heads had been made, Kennedy responded: “I would say we don’t have an agreement. We have an understanding.” An enforcement strategy or a clear timeline for the upcoming ban remains unclear, though Makary said that the administration aims to eliminate the dyes “by the end of next year”. Kennedy questioned during the conference how the US would maintain world leadership “with such a sick population”, going on to refer to “all these autoimmune diseases” and “these exotic diseases”. He also expressed concern that the majority of American children cannot qualify for military service with certain conditions. He went on to speak about the apparent rise in several types of diseases and disorders, which he believes could be possibly linked to the use of food dyes or other additives. “I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy,” he said, referring to when he was a child. “I never knew anybody with a food allergy. Why do five of my seven kids have allergies?” The FDA has approved 36 food dyes for use in the US, nine of which are artificial and made from petroleum. The others are derived from natural sources, such as vegetables.",

    "title": "Trump says China tariffs will drop ‘substantially – but it won’t be zero’",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump said during a White House news conference that high tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero”. Trump’s remarks were in response to earlier comments on Tuesday by treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who said that the high tariffs were unsustainable and that he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Trump placed import taxes of 145% onChina, which has countered with 125% tariffs on US goods. Trump has placed tariffs on several dozen countries, causing the stock market to stumble and interest rates to increase on US debt as investors worry about slower economic growth and higher inflationary pressures. Details of Bessent’s remarks were confirmed by two people familiar with the remarks who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. “I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript obtained by the Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.” The S&P 500 stock index rose 2.5% after Bloomberg News initially reported Bessent’s remarks. Trump acknowledged the increase in the stock market in comments to reporters after the ceremonial swearing-in of Paul Atkins as the Securities and Exchange Commission chair on Tuesday. However, Trump avoided confirming if he, too, thought the situation with China was unsustainable, as Bessent had said behind closed doors. “We’re doing fine with China,” Trump said. Despite his high tariffs, Trump said he would be “very nice” to China and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” Trump said. The US president said that the final tariff rate with China would come down “substantially” from the current 145%. “It won’t be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said. China’s government was yet to respond to the news, but has consistently criticised Trump’s tariffs. On China’s social media platform, Weibo, Trump’s remarks trended under various hashtags including “Trump admitted defeat”. A Tuesday article in the English-language state mouthpiece, China Daily, described them as “emblematic of the MAGA agenda’s populist protectionism”, and destabilising global trade. After matching Trump’s successive tariff raises, the tit-for-tat ended when Beijing said its 125% against US imports had already crushed domestic market interest for US products. Trump’s subsequent 90-day pause on his wide-ranging global tariffs did not include China. The Trump administration has met for talks with counterparts from Japan, India, South Korea, the European Union, Canada and Mexico, among other nations. Trump has shown no public indications that he plans to pullback his baseline 10% tariff, even as he has insisted he’s looking for other nations to cut their own import taxes and remove any non-tariff barriers that the administration says have hindered exports from the US. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States that could negatively impact China. “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement. However on Tuesday Korean media reports suggested Beijing is now putting its own pressure on third countries to enforce Chinese restrictions on US sales. The Korea Economic Dailyreportedthat some Korean companies had received letters from the Chinese government, warning of “retributions” if they exported any products to US military contractors which contained Chinese critical minerals. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration has received 18 proposals from other countries for trade deals with the US, adding: “Everyone involved wants to see a trade deal happen.” The uncertainty over tariffs in the financial markets has also been amplified by Trump calling on the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate, with the president saying he could fire Fed chair Jerome Powell if he wanted to do so. Trump later saidhe wanted Powell to “be early” in lowering rates and that he has no intention of firing the Fed chair, despite previously suggesting that he would.",

    "title": "‘He gave us strength’: Gaza Christians remember calls with Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Gaza City, Palestine –For 72-year-old Kamal Anton,Pope Franciswas a source of comfort and support. Kamal has had to shelter since the start of the war in the sameCatholic church compoundin Gaza City – the Holy Family Church – that hiswife and daughterwere shot and killed by an Israeli sniper in. That was in December 2023, two months after the start of Israel’s war. Anton and the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza have often felt abandoned in the 18 months of conflict, in which more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, with hope of an end to the war still feeling remote. But the late pope, whodied aged 88 in the Vatican City on Mondayafter a battle with illness, was in constant contact with Gaza’s small Christian community. Before his illness, he held calls every evening with those sheltering at the church, and continued to reach out, on a less regular basis, even after he fell ill. Kamal remembered his most recent call on Saturday, just two days before his death. Pope Francis was greeting the members of the church for Easter. “During his call, he prayed for peace and resilience for us in Gaza,” Kamal said. “He never forgot the word ‘peace’ in any of his calls with us throughout the war. His support included all of us – Christians and Muslims alike. He prayed daily for our safety.” A deep sense of grief and sorrow permeates the Holy Family Church, where approximately 550 displaced Palestinian Christians continue to seek shelter. Israel has attacked the church and its neighbouring school several times during the war, including a July 2024 attack in which four people were killed. Another church, St Porphyrios Greek Orthodox Church, has also been bombed. But the Holy Family Church is still a refuge. People gather inside the church every day, piano music accompanies hymns during prayer, and people greet Father Gabriel Romanelli. He’s the parish priest, an Argentinian who came to Gaza to lead the church 15 years ago. After the death of the pope, those in the church have largely dressed in black, the colour of mourning. The loss of the leader of their church was a solemn enough event, but Palestinian Christians know they have also lost one of their greatest defenders – a world leader who has long backed the Palestinian cause, and has earned the anger of Israel on a number of occasions for his defence of Palestinians. In his final public speech delivered on his behalf on Easter, Francis called for peace in Gaza and urged the warring sides to “agree to a ceasefire, release the hostages, and provide aid to a starving people longing for a peaceful future”. Father Romanelli told Al Jazeera that the loss of Pope Francis was a tragedy for Christians around the world, and particularly in Gaza. He recalled that Saturday phone call with the pope. “He said he was praying for us, supporting us, and thanked us for our prayers,” Romanelli said. “People at the church waited for his call daily. He would speak to the children and reassure them. He was deeply human and incredibly supportive, especially during the war.” Kamal noted that support from Pope Francis was also material, in the form of aid arriving in Gaza until Israel blocked all entry of goods into Gaza in March, just before it unilaterally broke a ceasefire. “Everyone in Gaza knows how much the Vatican supported us,” Kamal said. “We always shared that aid with our Muslim neighbours too.” Kamal’s fellow Palestinian Christian, 74-year-old Maher Terzi, is also in mourning. Maher, who has been displaced since the first week of the war, had just sat in the mourning hall when he spoke to Al Jazeera. “He gave us strength,” Maher said. “He told us not to be afraid, that he was with us and would never abandon us, no matter what.” “He encouraged us to hold on to our land, and promised to help us rebuild our destroyed homes,” Maher added. “His death is a catastrophe and a shock for us during such a difficult time.”",

    "title": "US judge blocks Trump’s effort to shutter international news service",
    "article_text": "A federal judge has stated that US President Donald Trump illegally halted the operation of the Voice of America (VOA), a federally funded international news service created by Congress. In a ruling on Tuesday, US District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the Trump administration to restore the 83-year-old broadcaster’s capacity to the levels before Trump slashed funding and laid off scores of personnel. In a March court filing stating that all 1,300 employees had been placed on administrative leave, lawyers for VOA said that the broadcaster seeks to report the news “truthfully, impartially, and objectively”, pushing back against claims from the Trump administration that it promotes a “leftist bias” and is insufficiently “pro-American”. Judge Lamberth also ordered the administration to restore the capacity of two other broadcasters also funded by the federal Agency for Global Media, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks, while those lawsuits progress. The judge also denied a similar request for two additional networks, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Open Technology Fund. Trump and his allies have wielded federal funds to dismantle programmes and agencies within the government that they dislike and compel greater ideological compliance from media organisations and universities under the premise of combatting what the administration portrays as “left-wing” views. Kari Lake, a close Trump ally, was also placed in charge of the Agency for Global Media. The administration shuttered VOA in March, instituting funding cuts that Lamberth said reflected a “hasty, indiscriminate approach”. A labour union representing workers at the Agency for Global Media celebrated the ruling as a “powerful affirmation of the role that independent journalism plays in advancing democracy and countering disinformation”. VOA was first founded during World War II in an effort by the US government to counter Nazi propaganda and was later used to project pro-US views to countries around the world during the Cold War, a history that has led some to criticise the network as a means of promoting US interests around the world. “That simple mission [delivering impartial news] is a powerful one for those living across the globe without access to a free press and without the ability to otherwise discern what is truly happening,” lawyers for VOA wrote. Many other institutions created during the post-war era to project US political and cultural influence around the world, such as thehumanitarian assistance agency USAID, have also come under attack by a Trump administration that sees them as ideological enemies or sources of bureaucratic bloat. After largely gutting USAID, tech billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk said that the international assistance group had been a “viper’s nest of radical left Marxists who hate America”.",

    "article_text": "Yemen’s Houthis have said they shot down a US drone that was carrying out an attack on the northwestern Hajjah governorate whilst the Al Masriah news outlet has reported that United States air strikes targeted at least three areas across the country. In a statement on Tuesday, Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree said the group’s “air defence shot down a hostile American MQ-9 Reaper drone while it was carrying out hostile missions in the airspace of Hajjah Governorate”. Saree claimed that this is the seventh US drone that the group has downed so far this month, and the 22nd since Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began 18 months ago. Al Masirah, a Houthi-affiliated outlet, said a series of strikes on Tuesday night targeted Kamran Island in the Red Sea, two air strikes hit the Al Salif district in western Yemen, and four air strikes were reported in the Al-Saleem district in the Saada province in the north of the country. The US has been carrying out near-daily, deadly air attacks against what it claims are Houthi targets in Yemen,killing more than 200 people– including women and children – since March. The administration of US President Donald Trump has warned that its military campaign will continue until the Yemeni group halts all firings against vessels in the Red Sea,  a major conduit for international trade. The Houthis have rejected the US assault, stressing that they are targeting ships in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and will stop when Israel ends its punishing war on the enclave. The latest attack comes just days after 12 people were killed in air strikes conducted by the US on Yemen’s capital Sanaa. Last week, theUS launched 13 strikeson Hodeidah’s port and airport. It was three days after its deadliest attack to date targeted the Ras Isa port, also in Hodeidah, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 150 others. Since November 2023, the Houthis have reportedly launched more than 100 attacks on vessels they say are linked to Israel, in response toIsrael’s war on Gaza. The group halted attacks on shipping lanes during a two-month ceasefire in Gaza earlier this year. But they pledged to resume strikes after Israel renewed its assault on the besieged enclave last month. Houthi attacks have paralysed shipping through the Suez Canal, a vital waterway through which approximately 12 percent of global shipping traffic normally passes, forcing many companies to resort to costly alternative routes around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.",

The home win on Tuesday gave the Catalan club a seven-point lead over Real Madrid, which visits Getafe on Wednesday. Barcelona and Madrid will meet in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday in Seville. Olmo’s winner came a minute into the second half at the Montjuic stadium, with the playmaker finding the net from inside the area. It was the third consecutive victory for Barcelona in the league. Mallorca, which has only two wins from its last nine matches, stayed in seventh place.

    "article_text": "Opening statements are set for Wednesday in New York for disgraced former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark#MeToocase. Prosecutors and Weinstein’s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday after a selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors on Monday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can’t see the trial through. Weinstein wasconvicted at his first trial in 2020by a jury of five women and seven men. The verdict marked a pivotal moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, fuelled by a series of allegations against the producer of Oscar winners including Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love. In a blow to #MeToo activists, New York’s highest court last yearoverturned the convictionand 23-year prison sentence after it found that the original trial judge allowed women whose accusations were not part of the charges Weinstein faced to give evidence in court. Weinstein’s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013 and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn’t part of the original trial. In the meantime, Weinstein is also facing a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. He has insisted that all sexual encounters he was involved in were consensual. The 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields. Those chosen were questioned about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial in the highly publicised case. Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about #MeToo. Bombshell allegations against Weinstein erupted in 2017 and led to a flood of allegations against other powerful men as women fought back against sexual violence in what became known as the #MeToo movement. The Hollywood mogul underwent emergency heart surgery after being rushed from prison to a hospital in New York in September. He was later diagnosed with bone marrow cancer and received treatment in prison for chronic myeloid leukaemia.",

    "title": "Halliburton reports reduced North America drilling demand, warns of tariffs",
    "article_text": "Halliburton has reported a decline in first-quarter profit due to reduced drilling activity in North America, which weakened demand for its oilfield services and equipment. The Houston, Texas-based oil and gas giant warned on Tuesday of a second-quarter earnings impact from tariffs and lower oilfield activity in North America as producers reckon with weak oil prices, sending shares of the oilfield service provider down about 6 percent. The oilfield service sector worries United StatesPresidentDonald Trump’s tariffs on imported steel and parts will disrupt supply chains and drive up equipment costs, such as drilling rigs and well casings. Halliburton said its first-quarter North American revenue was $2.2bn, down 12 percent from a year earlier. Halliburton is the first of the big three US oilfield services providers (Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are the other two) and is among the first large oil companies to report earnings as US crude prices hover under $64 a barrel. Many companies say they cannot drill profitably if oil prices fall under $65 a barrel, denting demand for equipment and services provided by companies like Halliburton. “Many of our customers are in the midst of evaluating their activity scenarios, and plans for 2025 activity reductions could mean higher than normal white space for committed fleets and in some cases the retirement or export of fleets to international markets,” Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said about expectations in North American markets. White spaces refer to gaps in the calendar when the company does not have work lined up for its equipment. Halliburton shares were down about 6 percent at $20.62 a share after it forecast a 2-cent- to 3-cent-per-share impact in the second quarter from trade tensions. Second-quarter earnings were estimated to be 63 cents per share, according to LSEG data. Shares had fallen as much as 10 percent on Tuesday and were down 24 percent so far this year. Rival Schlumberger’s shares were down only 11 percent this year. Halliburton’s Q1 international revenue eased 2 percent primarily due to lower drilling and project management activity in Mexico. It forecast year-over-year international revenue to be flat to slightly down. Mexico is proposing new contract models for the oil sector while struggling to pay off billions of dollars of accumulated debt to oil service companies. In the meantime, state company Pemex’s oil output has continued falling this year to 1.62 million barrels per day, compared with 1.76 million barrels per day last year. Halliburton posted a profit of $204m, or 24 cents per share, in the three months that ended on March 31, lower than the $606m, or 68 cents per share, it had posted last year. The company also took a $107m severance cost in the first quarter. That came on the heels of a $63m severance charge in the third quarter of 2024 but the company did not provide more details. Excluding a $356m pre-tax charge, which included the severance charge, the company posted earnings of 60 cents, in line with analysts’ estimates. Revenue of $5.42bn beat analysts’ average estimate of $5.28bn.",

    "title": "GE Aerospace CEO calls for tariff-free trade in the aviation sector",
    "article_text": "GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp has advocated re-establishing a tariff-free regime for the aerospace industry under the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft during a meeting with United States President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, in an interview with the news agency Reuters, Culp said the company’s position was “understood” by the administration, adding that the zero-duty regime has helped the US aerospace industry to enjoy a $75bn annual trade surplus. “I have argued that it was good and would be good for the country,” Culp told Reuters. Trump’s trade war has created the biggest uncertainty for the aerospace industry since the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also led to a breakdown in the industry’s decades-old duty-free status, putting aircraft deliveries in limbo. The uncertainty has left some of GE Aerospace’s customers struggling to accurately forecast their business. Meanwhile, one of the company’s prominent suppliers, Howmet Aerospace, has warned that it may halt some shipments if they are impacted by tariffs. Culp said the company has not seen any disruption in deliveries from Howmet. The Pittsburgh-based supplier is currently working on the new high-pressure turbine blade for the Leap 1A engine, which GE Aerospace produces in a joint venture with France’s Safran SA. “That ramp has gone very well so far here in 2025,” he said. GE Aerospace has been grappling with supply chain challenges, leading to a drop in engine deliveries over the past year. Last week, Airbus said it was facing challenges with engine deliveries as CFM was “significantly behind the curve”. Culp said the company is “well aligned” with the European planemaker’s needs for this year, but added the tariffs have created supply chain risks. Tariffs are estimated to cost GE Aerospace more than $500m this year. The company is making greater use of foreign trade zones and available trade programmes like duty drawbacks to mitigate the impact. It is also employing cost controls and a tariff surcharge to protect its margins. Culp’s comments come amid pressure on another aerospace giant in recent days. Last week,China asked airlines basedthere to cancel aircraft orders for planes made by US company Boeing amid the looming trade war. Trade-induced economic uncertainty has taken a toll on travel demand as well. With travel spending softening, there is a growing risk that airlines could start deferring their engine orders. Culp said other carriers would step in if any airline decides to halt its deliveries. “There are plenty of other people who will step up in line and take their place,” he said.",

    "title": "Netanyahu’s survival tactics tested amid Israel Shin Bet head’s accusations",
    "article_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a knack for survival. The country’s longest serving leader – he has been in power for 18 years over three nonconsecutive periods – has seen off many rivals and outlasted several enemies. The latest fight is with Ronen Bar, the head of Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, the Shin Bet. Netanyahu fired Bar last month due to what he called abreakdown in trust, but the Supreme Court has suspended the dismissal, pending an investigation. In the meantime, there have been protests against Netanyahu – the prime minister isused to those– and now an affidavit filed by Bar on Monday, in which he lobs several accusations against the Israeli leader. They include demands from Netanyahu that Bar place his loyalty to him above that of the Supreme Court’s rulings if the two ever clash and that he spy on Netanyahu’s opponents. It all comes as the Shin Bet investigates financial ties between Netanyahu’s office and Qatar. Netanyahu has denied Bar’s claims, calling his affidavit a “false” one that would be “disproved in detail soon”. The response follows the Netanyahu playbook when facing opposition – a denial of any accusations made against him, a shifting of the blame and pushing a problem to the future if possible. The legal cases Netanyahu faces – he is on trial for corruption – are a case in point. The prime minister has been able to drag the court process out for years and most recently has used Israel’s war on Gaza to delay his court appearances. “There is scandal fatigue in the Israeli public,” Israeli political analyst Nimrod Flaschenberg told Al Jazeera. Flaschenberg added that Israeli society’s increased polarisation means another scandal will hardly shift where people stand on the divisive Netanyahu. “People who are against Netanyahu and against the government see this as another evidence of the corruption, the deterioration of democratic space and the end of Israeli democracy,” he said. “And people from the pro-Netanyahu camp see this as Bar trying to generate a coup against Netanyahu and his right-wing government.” This polarisation has been aided by the fact the Israeli political opposition is fractured. Opposition figure Benny Gantz was once the challenger to the throne but has been criticised for failing to take strong stances on complicated issues, and there is growing support for him to be replaced as the head of the National Unity political alliance. “Many Israelis think [the current situation is] an emergency but they don’t really have the tools to change it, and there’s no powerful opposition in the parliament that can do anything about it,” said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel with the International Crisis Group. The war in Gaza itself is a testament to Netanyahu’s survival skills. Despite being blamed by many Israelis for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, among the deadliest in the country’s history, and unable to free the remaining captives held in Gaza or fully defeat Hamas, Netanyahu remains in power. That is even as the war grows increasingly unpopular in Israel with 100,000 reservists failing to respond to their call-ups, according to the Israeli-Palestinian +972 Magazine. And yet Netanyahu is arguably in a stronger position politically than he was at the start of the war, expanding Israeli-occupied territory in Lebanon and Syria, all while seeing the administration of ally President Donald Trump take power in the United States. Netanyahu’s governing coalition may have lost some figures over time, including former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, but it has become more solidified by shifting further to the right. “His coalition is very much solid and intact,” Zonszein said. “Throughout the last year and a half, he’s only stabilised his coalition further.” Netanyahu has increasingly leaned on the ultra-Orthodox and far-right parties like those led by two of the most far-right ministers in his government – Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich. While analysts said a shift rightwards has upset many Israelis, there seems to be little chance of change at the moment. “It would take a very radical step to actually remove Netanyahu from power,” Zonszein said. “It’s like a grinding, deteriorating situation in which more allegations and evidence come to light,” Zonszein said, speaking of the scandals Netanyahu has faced. “But it doesn’t mean it’s going to change anything on the ground.” A sort of lethargy may have started to set in in some quarters of Israeli society as Netanyahu holds onto power. His coalition has enough seats in parliament to continue, and its members have their own reasons for wanting to avoid it breaking up. That means the only way Netanyahu is likely to be removed from power is through elections – the next of which does not need to happen until October 27, 2026. In theory, the attorney general could determine Netanyahu is unfit to serve, but analysts said that would prove contentious and unlikely to happen. Failing that, the only way Netanyahu might be removed from power would be through elections. A poll this month from Israel’s Channel 12 showed that the right-wing former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett’s new party would win a majority if elections were held today. But that alone is not enough to calm the worries of some people in Israel. “Some Israelis are concerned that there won’t be a free and fair election next year,” Zonszein said. Flaschenberg said he feared the police could be used by Netanyahu and his allies to suppress voting. There are, however, some possible moves for the Israeli public to play. Flaschenberg said public strikes have been effective in the past. In mid-2023, a public strike prevented Netanyahu from firing Gallant although another attempt at a strike in late 2024 failed because of a lack of clear demands. And the furore over the attempted firing of Bar is unlikely to change things. For the pressure to manifest into something tangible against Netanyahu, a number of factors would have to come to fruition. “If this legal security situation with Ronen Bar and with the Shin Bet will intensify and at the same time the refusal wave that we are seeing or the wave of protests of people from the army against the war, this might shake things up and maybe change course,” Flaschenberg said. “So I’m not entirely hopeless about what could develop in the next few months,” he said, before adding: “[But] I’m relatively hopeless.”",

    "title": "Detained Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi says he’s ‘in good hands’",
    "article_text": "A Palestinian man who led peaceful protests against Israel’s genocide in Gaza as a student at Columbia University, and was recently detained during an interview about finalising his US citizenship, has said he’s “in good hands” at the Vermont prison where he is being held. Mohsen Mahdawi, a legal permanent resident of the United States, was arrested on April 14 in Colchester, Vermont. He met on Monday with US Senator Peter Welch of Vermont, a Democrat. US President Donald Trump’s administration has been cracking down on pro-Palestine activities. In the first week of his presidency, Trump pledged to deport students who joined protests against Israel’s war on Gaza that swept US university campuses last year. “I’m staying positive by reassuring myself in the ability of justice and the deep belief of democracy,” Mahdawi said in Welch’s video posted on X. “This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, because I believe in the principles of this country.” I met with Mohsen Mahdawi today. Listen to his message.pic.twitter.com/MU280oAQ9T — Senator Peter Welch (@SenPeterWelch)April 21, 2025 Welch’s office said Mahdawi was being detained at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St Albans, Vermont. His case is scheduled for a status conference on Wednesday. His lawyers have called for his release. The US Justice Department has not said why he’s being detained. The New York Times reported April 15 that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote a memo that says Mahdawi’s activities could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process. Rubio did not provide any evidence of this. Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify the deportation of Columbia University graduate studentMahmoud Khalil. It gives the US power to deport those who pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”. Khalil says he is a political prisoner. He alsomissed the birth of his sonafter being refused temporary release to attend the birth, his wife Noor Abdalla said on Monday. Abdalla said that she gave birth to the couple’s first child in New York without Khalil present after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made the “purposeful decision” to make her family suffer. An immigration judge ruled April 11 that Khalil can be forced out of the country as a national security risk, after lawyers argued the legality of deporting the activist who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. His lawyers plan to appeal. A US immigration judge in the state of Louisiana ruled last week that Khalil, who was detained last month, can be deported – setting a precedent for the administration to proceed with its efforts to deport dissenting foreign students, despite them being in the country legally and not being charged with any crime. Trump has also threatened to halt federal funding for schools, colleges, and universities if they allow what he called “illegal protests”. In other high-profile cases, immigration officers have detained and sought to deportRumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkiye, and Columbia student Yunseo Chung, who is a US permanent resident originally from South Korea.",

    "title": "IMF warns Trump tariffs are fuelling uncertain global economic outlook",
    "article_text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have increased global financial stability risks. This warning was part of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report released on Tuesday, as world financial leaders meet in Washington to discuss the uncertainty caused by the tariff policies. The IMF pointed out thatTrump’s tariff rate surged past levelsreached during the Great Depression, which saw tariffs rise as high as 60 percent during one of the worst economic periods in modern history, a downturn that led to more than 12 million Americans losing their jobs. The global ripple effect took the spotlight in the IMF’s report. “Global financial stability risks have increased significantly, driven by tighter global financial conditions and heightened economic uncertainty,” the IMF said. The fund projects a slump in US economic growth at 1.8 percent for the year — a downturn from its previous forecast of 2.7 percent and down a full percentage point from this time last year. China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of imposed US tariffs, looming additional tariffs on goods including pharmaceuticals, and Beijing’s reciprocal tariffs on US goods. The IMF now expects it will expand 4 percent in 2025, which is more than a half-point decrease from previous forecasts. In Europe, the IMF forecasts that the 20-country eurozone will see 0.8 percent growth this year and 1.2 percent in 2026. The new report is a 0.2 percent decline from its forecast at the beginning of the year. The IMF also forecasts a decrease in Mexico for the year, with growth falling by 0.3 percent for 2025. But it expects that it will rebound next year with 1.4 percent growth. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, the organisation of 191 member nations is expecting a 1.4 percent decrease in growth from its 2024 forecasts, but it does expect growth to bounce back in 2026. “I don’t recall another instance in my professional life where a single act by a president or prime minister has resulted in such a sudden downgrade in growth in a matter of weeks,” Stuart  Mackintosh, executive director of the financial think-tank Group of Thirty, told Al Jazeera. The bond markets recentlysurged in the USearlier this month after Trump’s tariffs went into effect. As a result, interest rates went up in other countries around the globe, causing borrowing to become more expensive in other countries, too. “Emerging market economies already facing the highest real financing costs in a decade may now need to refinance their debt and fund fiscal spending at higher costs,” the IMF said. The IMF also said that other geopolitical risks such as military conflicts could further spur uncertainty. The concerns echo those of other prominent economists around the globe who expect a downturn. Goldman Sachs said it expects “very low US growth of 0.5 percent” and said chances of arecession next year are 45 percent, according to the investment bank’s “tariff induced recession risk” report released on Monday. Earlier this month, a survey of macroeconomic forecasts conducted by the National Association for Business Economics showed that more than half of respondents believe the probability of a recession in 2025 could be as high as 49 percent. Economists at JPMorgan now believe that the chances of recession are 60 percent. “The increased likelihood of a global recession and the likelihood of an American recession is up. It’s gone up. We have to deal with that. When you think about the consensus position of US economists, that shifted dramatically,” Mackintosh added. “In the fall of last year, a majority of US business economists thought that there would be no recession this year. Indeed, most consensus positions viewed the US economy as the strongest advanced economy in the world, and that could only get better. Unfortunately,after ‘Liberation Day’,they got worse.” The US Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7 percent. This comes as the president has pushed for the central bank to cut interest rates,which Fed Chair Jerome Powell has refused to do.Last week, Trump said that Powell’s exit can’t come soon enough and asserted that if he asked Powell to leave the role, he would. Powell has continually said that he would serve out the remainder of his term, which ends in May 2026. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, pushed back on Trump’s increased rhetorical attacks on Powell, saying “central bank independence remains a cornerstone”, to a group of reporters.",

    "title": "Trump’s campaign to turn dissent into a deportable offence harms democracy",
    "article_text": "On April 11, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student and lawful United States permanent resident, can be deported. Not for committing a crime. Not for violating immigration rules. But for his political speech – specifically for helping organise a peaceful Gaza solidarity encampment at his university. The government’s case against Khalil is hinged on Section 237(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a Cold War-era provision that permits the deportation of any noncitizen whose presence is deemed a potential threat to US foreign policy. The evidence the government submitted against him was a two-page memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asserting – without proof – that Khalil’s “beliefs and associations” could “adversely affect U.S. foreign policy interests”. Ironically, the document itself admitted that Khalil’s actions were “otherwise lawful”. And yet, it was enough. The mere invocation of “foreign policy” or “national security” now operates like a legal incantation, overriding First Amendment protections, due process and even common sense. Khalil’s case is not an outlier. It is the leading edge of a broader strategy to silence dissent in the US – particularly dissent critical of Israeli policies or sympathetic to Palestinian rights – using various legal tools. This use and abuse of the US legal system sets a dangerous precedent that in the long run will harm American democracy. Dozens of international students and scholars – many from Muslim-majority countries or racialised communities – have also been subjected to surveillance, detention and deportation, often without any allegations of criminal wrongdoing. Among them is Badar Khan Suri, a visiting academic at Georgetown University and Indian citizen who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at his home in Virginia and later transferred to Texas. He remains in detention, facing removal based on his family ties.The fatherof his American wife used to work as an adviser to the Gaza government. Another example is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish Fulbright scholar and doctoral student at Tufts University who was detained after co-authoring a newspaper opinion piece related to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement. A US immigration judge has since denied her release, labelling her a “flight risk and a danger to the community”. Another recent case is that of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green card holder and Columbia student protest leader who was arrested by ICE agents when he went for his US citizenship interview. He now faces deportation to the occupied West Bank, which he said would be “a death sentence”, given that he has lost family and friends to Israeli military violence. Then there’s Momodou Taal, a British-Gambian PhD candidate at Cornell University who filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration, arguing that executive orders targeting pro-Palestinian activists violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Despite suing preemptively and being legally represented, Taal’s efforts were ultimately undermined by jurisdictional manoeuvring and executive pressure. His emergency injunction was denied by a federal judge on March 27, and days later, he self-deported, saying he no longer trusted the courts to protect him even with a favourable ruling. There is also Yunseo Chung, a South Korean-born Columbia student and US permanent resident who narrowly avoided deportation thanks to a preemptive federal court injunction. Alireza Doroudi, an Iranian engineering PhD student at the University of Alabama, was quietly detained with no explanation. Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian student at Columbia, fled to Canada after ICE agents visited her apartment. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) later released footage of her departure, labelling her a “terrorist sympathiser”. In this campaign of political persecution, the Trump administration has largely relied on immigration courts, which are not part of the independent federal judiciary under Article III of the US Constitution. They are administrative tribunals housed within the executive branch, specifically, the Department of Justice. Their judges are appointed by the attorney general, lack tenure and are subject to political oversight. The procedural protections available in Article III courts – such as full evidentiary hearings, impartial review and constitutional due process – are substantially weakened in immigration courts. While federal courts may scrutinise whether an arrest or deportation violates constitutional protections – like the First Amendment or equal protection – immigration judges are often empowered to rule based on vague assertions of “foreign policy concerns” or “national security interests” with little to no requirement for concrete evidence. This dual-track legal system allows the government to bypass the constitution while maintaining the appearance of legality. There have been numerouscallsto reform this system from legal scholars, human rights organisations and even former immigration judges. Proposals have included moving immigration courts out of the Department of Justice and into anindependentArticle I court structure to ensure judicial impartiality. However, these reforms have consistently failed, largely due to congressional inaction as well as political resistance from successive administrations that have benefitted from the system’s malleability. The executive branch has long viewed immigration courts as a tool of policy enforcement rather than neutral adjudication. While this crackdown has so far focused on noncitizens with legal status, it could soon extend to naturalised Americans. US law allows the revocation of citizenship in cases of fraud, membership in terrorist organisations and other crimes. In his first term, Trump created a dedicated “Denaturalization Section” within the Department of Justice to pursue citizenship revocations. About 700,000 immigrant files were investigated with the aim of bringing 1,600 cases to court. Trump has now signalled that he intends to pick up his denaturalisation drive where he left off. If he deploys this legal tool against critical voices, this would mean that even citizenship may no longer offer protection if one’s political views fall out of favour with the government. As the Department of Justice, DHS and ICE have worked together on the campaign against dissent, they have received public support from nonprofit organisations. Groups likeBetarand Canary Mission have taken public credit for identifying international students involved in pro-Palestinian activism and urging their deportation. Betar claims to have compiled a list of foreigners it labelled as “jihadis” and submitted it to the Trump administration. Canary Mission, meanwhile, launched a project called “Uncovering Foreign Nationals”, which publishes the names and photos of international students it accuses of anti-Semitism or anti-Israel activism – effectively creating a blacklist. While there is no official confirmation that DHS or ICE have acted directly on these materials, the close timing between these campaigns and government enforcement has raised serious concerns that these politically motivated private groups are shaping federal immigration enforcement without transparency or accountability. The US portrays itself as a beacon of liberty, a nation governed by the rule of law, where freedom of speech is sacred. But Khalil’s case – and the others like it – paint a starkly different picture. If your residency, citizenship, education or even physical freedom can be revoked for peacefully expressing political views, then speech is no longer a right. It is a conditional privilege. This is more than a legal overreach. It is a moral crisis for American democracy. When free speech becomes contingent on political loyalty and when private blacklists shape federal enforcement, the foundational values of liberty, pluralism and equality before the law are being dismantled. What American democracy urgently needs is congressional action to establish judicial independence in immigration courts, stronger First Amendment protections for noncitizens and full transparency around the government’s reliance on private ideological actors. Anything less risks enshrining a two-tiered system of rights and, ultimately, a country where dissent itself is deportable. This is not just a test of immigration policy. It is a test of democracy – and of the very soul of the nation itself. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "title": "Putin discusses US-Iran nuclear talks with leader of Oman in Moscow",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed Iran’s nuclear programme with the visiting leader of Oman, Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, the Kremlin has said, as the diplomatic shuttling around the edges of Iran-US nuclear talks continues apace. Oman has been mediating between Iran and the United States as US President Donald Trump seeks an agreement that would curb Iran’s nuclear programme, which Washington believes is aimed at developing a nuclear weapon – something that Iran denies. “This topic was touched on … in the context of mediation efforts by Oman,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters during a briefing at the Kremlin on Tuesday. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov also said both sides “discussed the progress of negotiations between Iranian and American representatives”, according to remarks carried by Interfax. “We will see what the result will be. We maintain close contact with our Iranian colleagues. Where we can, we help,” Ushakov was quoted as saying. Trump has threatened to bomb Iran unless a deal is reached. Iran has said there can be no deal under threat of bombardment. Russia signed a strategic partnership treaty with Iran in January and is also trying to improve relations with the Trump administration. Moscow has a role in nuclear talks with Iran as a signatory to a previous landmark 2015 nuclear deal that Trump abandoned during his first term as US president in 2018 – a move that prompted Iran to breach its terms a year later. Russia has warned that any US military action against Iran would be illegal. In televised comments, Putin was shown telling the sultan that Russian energy companies were interested in developing relations with Oman. Meanwhile, Putin announced plans to stage a summit with the Arab League group of states later this year as Moscow searches for new partners as it continues its three-year offensive on Ukraine. Slapped with sweeping Western sanctions after sending troops into Ukraine, Russia has turned towards Asian, African and Arab countries for political and economic ties. “We plan to hold a summit between Russia and Arab countries this year,” Putin told the Omani leader. “Many of our friends in the Arab world support this idea,” he added, inviting Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said to the summit, without specifying the date and location. The visit comes days after Putin hosted Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Moscow for talks on Syria and the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip. Doha is a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas. The Gulf states are gaining ever-growing diplomatic influence as mediators in negotiations to resolve the world’s most pressing crises, which have claimed thousands of lives, such as the conflict in Ukraine and Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza. A third round of negotiations between Tehran and Washington is scheduled to take place in Oman on Saturday. Ahead of the visit, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is set to visit China on April 23 at the invitation of Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday. The two sides will discuss bilateral relations and international and regional hot-spot issues of common concern, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press conference. The visit is believed to have great significance for deepening political mutual trust between the two countries, Guo told reporters. Araghchi previously visited China, which was a signatory to the since-abandoned 2015 agreement brokered by world powers that both reined in Tehran’s nuclear programme and provided it with substantial financial relief, in December. During a trip to Moscow last week, Araghchi told state TV that Tehran always closely consults with its friends, Russia and China, over nuclear issues.",

    "title": "Not just Trump: Which world leaders did Pope Francis clash with?",
    "article_text": "Astributespour in from around the world for Pope Francis, whodied aged 88on Monday, the pontiff is being remembered by many for embracing communities and challenges that the Roman Catholic Church had carefully avoided previously. However, many of those issues — among them the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and immigration — also put Francis on a collision course with several world leaders. The pope’s funeral is on Saturday in St Peter’s Square, and many world leaders – including those he locked horns with during his papacy – have said they will attend it. So which world leaders did the pope disagree with and what were the issues that drove those differences? Francis battled with the United States president over the issue of migration for nearly a decade. During his first presidential campaign in 2016, Donald Trump promised to build a “big, beautiful wall” along the US border with Mexico. In February 2016 during a trip to Mexico,Francis lamented Trump’s pledge: “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian.” Trump hit back in a statement posted on his Facebook account, saying: “No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. “I am proud to be a Christian and as president I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.” Trump added a hypothetical scenario involving the ISIL (ISIS) armed group: “If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS’s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been president because this would not have happened,” Trump wrote. Trump ran unsuccessfully for re-election in 2020 and won in a third run in 2024 on thecampaign promiseof carrying out “the largest deportation in American history”. Referring to Trump’s plan for mass deportations, Francis said a day before Trump’s inauguration in January: “If it is true, it will be a disgrace because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill for the imbalance. It won’t do. This is not the way to solve things.” In February, the Vatican released a letter to US bishops from the pope about the deportations, which Trump had begun after taking office on January 20. While acknowledging a country’s right to safeguard itself and keep its communities safe, he remarked: “The act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness.” After the pontiff’s death, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” Trump also said that he would attend the pope’s funeral with first lady Melania Trump. Francis left hishometown, Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires,in 2013 after he was elected pope. The pontiff made more than 45 international trips during his papacy, but Argentina was not among the countries he visited. Before becoming the pope, he was archbishop and then cardinal in Buenos Aires. In the years that followed, he had tense relations with multiple Argentinian leaders. Mauricio Macri, who was the centre-right president of Argentina from 2015 to 2019, never publicly clashed with the pope, but Francis was widely believed to be a critic of Macri’s austerity programmes and their impact on the poor in Argentina. When Macri visited the pope at the Vatican in February 2016, the photos of their meeting showed an unusually stern Francis, strengthening speculation of differences between them. Neither of them quashed those suggestions. In June 2016, Macri made a donation of 16,666,000 pesos (about $15,200 at current exchange rates) to the Scholas Occurentes educational foundation backed by Francis. However, Francis wrote to the Argentinian branch of Scholas Occurentes, asking it to return the donation. If tensions between Francis and Macri were more subtle, current far-right PresidentJavier Mileihas been open in his disdain for the pope. While Milei was campaigning for the presidency in 2023, he described the pope as “the representation of evil on Earth”. However, Milei’s tone towards the pontiff softened after he came to office in December 2023. In February 2024, the two met at the Vatican. Milei has said he will attend the pope’s funeral. Milei wrote on X on Monday: “Despite differences that seem minor today, having been able to know him in his goodness and wisdom was a true honour for me.” During his papacy, Francis advocated for the protection of theAmazon rainforest, most of which is in Brazil. Deforestation and wildfires have ravaged the rainforest in recent years, and as Brazil’s president from 2019 to 2023, Jair Bolsonaro implemented policies seen by critics as exacerbating the struggle to save it. In 2019, the pope urged Amazonian bishops to take bold action to take care of the rainforest. “If everything continues as it was, if we spend our days content that ‘this is the way things have always been done,’ then the gift vanishes, smothered by the ashes of fear and concern for defending the status quo,” he said. In 2020, the pope published a text on the exploitation of Indigenous people in the Amazon and the damage caused to the forest due to mining and deforestation. “Pope Francis said yesterday the Amazon is his, the world’s, everyone’s,”Bolsonarosaid in response to the text. “Well, the pope may be Argentinian, but God is Brazilian.” Current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he will attend the pope’s funeral with first lady Janja Lula da Silva. “With his simplicity, his courage and empathy, Francis brought the topic of climate change to the Vatican,” Lula said after the pope’s death. The pope repeatedlydenounced Israel’s war on Gaza, where more than 51,000 Palestinians have been confirmed killed since October 7, 2023. But his sharpest criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war came in November when the Italian daily La Stampa published excerpts from a new book of his. “We should investigate carefully to assess whether this fits into the technical definition [of genocide] formulated by international jurists and organisations,” the pope said. Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli described the pope’s comment as a “trivialisation of the term ‘genocide’ – a trivialisation that comes dangerously close to Holocaust denial”. In December, the pope also called Israel’s bombardment of Gaza cruel. An Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson responded to the pope’s sentiments, saying it was “particularly disappointing as they are disconnected from the true and factual context of Israel’s fight against jihadist terrorism – a multifront war that was forced upon it starting on October 7. “Enough with the double standards and the singling out of the Jewish state and its people.” Netanyahu had hosted the pope in 2014, and according to the Israeli government’s website, Francis in November 2023 met with representatives of Israeli captives taken by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups to Gaza on October 7, 2023. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his condolences. “I send my deepest condolences to the Christian world and especially the Christian communities in Israel – the Holy Land – on the loss of their great spiritual father. … I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered.” Russian PresidentVladimir Putinmet Francis three times with their last meeting taking place in 2021. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the pope never explicitly criticised Putin publicly, he spoke out against the war. In May 2022, the pope chastised Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, for supporting the war. “Brother, we are not state clerics. We cannot use the language of politics but that of Jesus,” the pontiff said, describing a conversation with Kirill to the Italian daily Corriere Della Sera. The pope said he had warned Kirill against becoming “Putin’s altar boy”. Putin expressed his “deepest condolences” over the pope’s passing in a letter to Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, camerlengo of the Roman Catholic Church. “Throughout the years of his pontificate, he actively promoted the development of dialogue between the Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches, as well as constructive cooperation between Russia and the Holy See,” Putin wrote. Francis alsoupset Ukraine’s leadersafter he said during a February 2024 interview that Kyiv should have “the courage of the white flag” to negotiate an end to the war. “Our flag is a yellow and blue one. This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail. We shall never raise any other flags,” Ukraine’s then-foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba wrote in a response on X. In October after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the pope said: “I appeal for the Ukrainians not to be left to freeze to death. Stop the air strikes against the civilian population, always the most affected. Stop the killing of innocent people.” In an X post on Monday, Zelenskyy wrote about the pope: “He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. We grieve together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support.” Zelenskyy said he will attend the pope’s funeral. The pope also criticised his own institution. In 2022, the popeapologisedfor the “cultural genocide” of Canada’s Indigenous population during a visit to the country. From the 1800s to the late 1990s, the Canadian federal government took at least 150,000 children belonging to First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities to residential schools to erase their cultures and languages. Most of these schools were run by the Catholic Church. “I am sorry. I ask forgiveness, in particular, for the ways in which many members of the church and of religious communities co-operated, not least through their indifference, in projects of cultural destruction and forced assimilation promoted by the governments of that time, which culminated in the system of residential schools,” Francis said. However, his refusal to call what the church did “cultural genocide” drew criticism from some First Nations leaders. In November 2017, the pope visited Myanmar and did not explicitly acknowledge theRohingya community, for which he drew criticism. A month later, during a December visit to Bangladesh, the pope acknowledged the persecuted community, saying: “The presence of God today is also called Rohingya.” In August 2017, thousands of members of the Muslim-majority Rohingya community were forced to flee Myanmar during a military crackdown. As of 2024, nearly one million Rohingya are in Bangladesh, according to United Nations figures. Myanmar does not acknowledge the Rohingya as an ethnic group and denies the group citizenship.",

    "title": "Israeli attacks kill 32 in Gaza, destroy bulldozers for recovering the dead",
    "article_text": "Israeli forces havekilled at least 32 Palestiniansin Gaza since dawn, including 11 people who burned to death inside their home in Khan Younis, and carried out air strikes that destroyed equipment used to retrieve the dead from under rubble. Seven members of a family were also killed on Tuesday by an air raid on the home where they were sheltering in western Gaza City. Three civilians, including two girls, were killed when Israeli warplanes targeted a group of people in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Later, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the Israeli military shelled the ICU at Al-Durra Children’s Hospital in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City at around midnight. An Israeli air strike also targeted solar panels at the facility, the ministry said in a post on Telegram. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, warned that more than two million people – mostly women and children – were being collectively punished. “Gaza has become a land of desperation,” he said on X. Nearly 3,000 trucks of UNRWA supplies and humanitarian aid remained stuck outside Gaza, unable to enter while food and medicine inside the strip are quickly running out. “Hunger is spreading,” Lazzarini warned. “Humanitarian aid is being used as a bargaining chip – a weapon of war.” The UN’s special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, warned that withholding humanitarian aid constitutes a war crime. “This action would further aggravate conditions of life calculated to destroy the Palestinian population of Gaza.” Hamas slammed Israel’s ongoing blockade, which began on March 2. “The Gaza Strip is facing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe,” the group said in a statement, citing severe shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine. It added that the siege as well as daily attacks on shelters, hospitals and residential areas amount to a “premeditated crime” by the Israeli leadership. Hamas also blamed the situation on a “political, moral, and humanitarian failure” on the part of the international community and called on the UN and other institutions to pressure Israel to lift the blockade on aid. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said: “The situation is unfolding rapidly here on the ground. What we are seeing is truly extraordinary in terms of very huge momentum of air strikes and artillery bombardments that have been seen over the course of the past 24 hours.” “What we understand is that the Israeli military has launched huge and heavy waves of air strikes with the latest targeting a group of Palestinians – three were confirmed killed in the strike, including two girls under the age of 14,” he added. “It has been quite obvious that these attacks are focused on eradicating entire families (as in Khan Younis attack) – we’re talking about four generations being wiped out – and also a more systematic escalation has been taking place on targeting heavy machinery that has been allowed to enter Gaza during the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal,” Abu Azzoum said. Gaza’s Civil Defence said Israel also targeted bulldozers used in humanitarian operations, including rubble removal and the recovery of bodies. Nine bulldozers brought into Gaza from Egypt during a six-week ceasefire that Israel ended on March 18 were destroyed in Israeli attacks on the Jabalia al-Nazlh municipality garage in northern Gaza, according to Civil Defence official Mohammed el-Mougher. “An agreement had previously been reached with the Egyptian-Qatari committee regarding the location of the bulldozers’ shelters,” he said, noting that their coordinates had been shared with Israel. “The targeting of municipal headquarters by Israeli occupation aircraft and the bombing of heavy equipment designated for rescue and rubble removal, including bulldozers and other machinery, is a criminal continuation of the war of extermination,” the group added in a statement. The Israeli army claimed heavy equipment destroyed in overnight attacks on Gaza was used “for terror purposes”. Thirty rights groups including Oxfam, Medical Aid for Palestinians and ActionAid issued a statement saying Israel has intensified its violence in Gaza and the occupied West Bank despite the UN General Assembly having demanded in September an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory within 12 months. World leaders must act urgently to “uphold their legal and moral responsibilities”, the statement said.",

    "title": "Gunmen kill at least 26 in Indian-administered Kashmir: Police",
    "article_text": "Armed men opened fire on a group of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least 26 people, according to Indian police, in one of the deadliest attacks there in recent times. Police said multiple tourists received gunshot wounds in the “terror attack” on Tuesday while they were visiting Baisaran meadow, some 5km (3 miles) from the disputed region’s resort town of Pahalgam. “This attack is much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years,” Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, wrote on social media. Indian police told The Associated Press (AP) news agency that at least 26 people were killed and that no group had yet claimed responsibility for the attack.  Police, however, blamed it on armed groups fighting against Indian rule. Security forces launched a hunt for the attackers while the wounded were rushed to hospitals. Two senior police officers also told AP that at least four gunmen fired at dozens of tourists from close range. The officers said at least three dozen others were injured, many in serious condition. Most of the tourists killed were Indian, the officers said to AP, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy. A tour guide in Pahalgam told the AFP news agency he approached the scene after hearing gunfire and helped transport some of the wounded away on horseback. Waheed, who gave only one name, said he saw several men lying dead on the ground. Another witness told AFP that the attackers were “clearly sparing women”. Divashi Shorba, an Indian tourist, told Al Jazeera: “I’m travelling from Kolkata, and we are just 10 kilometres [about 6 miles] away from Pahalgam. It’s been four hours since we were stopped, and no one has any clear information.” “Some authorities say we’ll be allowed through in an hour, others mention an official meeting, while some claim there’s an ongoing operation. Everyone is saying something different, but no one has any real answers,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on an official visit to Saudi Arabia, decried the “heinous act”, pledging that the attackers “will be brought to justice”. I strongly condemn the terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir. Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured recover at the earliest. All possible assistance is being provided to those affected. Those behind this heinous act will be brought… — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)April 22, 2025 United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday pledged his support for India.“Deeply disturbing news out of Kashmir,” he said on social media. “The United States stands strong with India against Terrorism.” The Indian government later said that Trump called Modi to offer his condolences. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemned” the attack, his spokesperson said. He added that Guterres “stresses attacks against civilians are unacceptable under any circumstances”. India’s Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah headed to Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, where he said he would review the situation. “We will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences,” Shah wrote in a post on the X social media platform. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a key separatist leader in Kashmir, condemned what he described as a “cowardly attack on tourists” in a post on X. “Such violence is unacceptable and against the ethos of Kashmir, which welcomes visitors with love and warmth. [I] condemn it strongly.” Kashmir has been under an intensifiedmilitary crackdownsince itssemi-autonomous statuswas revoked by the Indian government about six years ago. The attack followsviolenceearlier this month between security forces and suspected rebels, which resulted in six deaths, including four officers. Attacks targeting tourists in Kashmir have been rare in recent years, the last one dating back to June, when fighters attacked a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims, plunging it into a deep gorge and killing at least nine people. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Many in Muslim-majority, Indian-administered Kashmir support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory with Pakistan or creating an independent country. India insists the Kashmir uprising is Pakistan-sponsored. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. The Indian government, led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), revoked Kashmir’s special status in 2019, splitting the state into two federally administered territories – Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. The same year, areportby the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights accused India of human rights violations in Kashmir and called for a commission of inquiry into the allegations.",

Google no longer plans to deprecate cookies through its Privacy Sandbox. byEmma Roth Google’s plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome is officially over. Inan update on Tuesday, Google Privacy Sandbox VP Anthony Chavez says the company has decided “to maintain our current approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome.” For years, critics have argued that Google’s Privacy Sandboxcould harm advertisersand violateprivacy laws, while the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) told users to opt out of the program, saying it “is still tracking your internet use for Google’s behavioral advertising.” Last week,a US judge found that Google“willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts” in the advertising technology industry, and the competition regulator in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has been investigating its evolving series of proposals to address concerns that they might give Google an unfair advantage. Google’sPrivacy Sandbox initiative was announced in 2020with plans to block third-party cookies in Chrome by default, similar to Firefox and Safari. It has made several changes to the initiative over the years, such asproposals like its Topics APIto assign interests to users based on their web activity and other tools it said could target ads while still offering some privacy. But followingyearsofdelaysandscrutiny, Google said last year that itwould let users choose whether to opt into a cookie-less Chrome. Now, it appears the initiative has come almost completely to an end. “As we’ve engaged with the ecosystem, including publishers, developers, regulators, and the ads industry, it remains clear that there are divergent perspectives on making changes that could impact the availability of third-party cookies,” Chavez writes, adding that Google “will not be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies.” The Movement for an Open Web (MOW), whichfiled a complaintwith the CMA about the initiative in 2020, said Google’s latest update is an “admission” that the Privacy Sandbox is over. “Google’s intention was to remove open and interoperable communications standards to bring digital advertising traffic under their sole control and, with this announcement, that aim is now over,” MOW co-founder James Rosewell said in an emailed statement toThe Verge. “They’ve recognised that the regulatory obstacles to their monopolistic project are insurmountable and have given up.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "Tesla’s revenue and profits tank amid political chaos",
    "article_text": "Slumping sales, mounting protests, and a brand crisis has thrown Tesla’s once enviable finances into chaos. Slumping sales, mounting protests, and a brand crisis has thrown Tesla’s once enviable finances into chaos. byAndrew J. Hawkins Tesla released its first quarter financial earnings today, offering another peek into the crisis currently enveloping Elon Musk’s company. Tesla said it earned $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue. That’s below Wall Street expectations of $21.1 billion and represents a 9.4 percent decrease year over year compared to $21.3 billion in revenue in Q1 2024. The company’s profits also slid dramatically, logging a 71 decrease in net income for the first quarter. And Tesla’s automotive revenue — the money is earns from car sales — slid 20 percent year over year, from $17.4 billion in Q1 2024 to $13.9 billion in this most recent quarter. The sale of $595 million in regulatory credits once again buoyed Tesla’s finances — without which the company would have had to report a year over year loss. In a letter to shareholders, Tesla acknowledged that tariffs, as well as “changing political sentiment,” will continue to complicate efforts to grow out of its current rut. “Uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers,” Tesla said. “This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.” Tesla was expected to be largely insulated from tariffs, thanks to its domestic supply chain. But the company says that its energy business, which includes solar panels and home battery products, will be hurt by the Trump administration’s trade war. “While the current tariff landscape will have a relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive, we are taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long-term and focus on maintaining its health,” the company wrote. In January, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow in 2025, but didn’t specify by how much. Now the company is rethinking that guidance and will update it after next quarter: It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services. While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment. We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update. It wasn’t all bad news: Tesla’s gross margins, 16.3 percent in the first quarter, came in above analysts’ expectations of 15.82%, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, Reuters reports. The earnings comes on the heels ofTesla’s worst quarterly sales report in three years. The company said it delivered a total of 336,681 vehicles, a 12.9 percent decline compared to Q1 2024. (For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.) After years of exponential growth, the sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash. Tesla now serves as a sobering example of what happens when a company is left on autopilot (orAutopilot, as it were) while its high-profile CEO gets distracted byquestionable side projects. The sudden reversal in Tesla’s fortune has left many investors and supporters with whiplash Tesla’s current troubles can be traced back toMusk’s position with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a specious effort to cut “waste and fraud” in the government that appears mostly aimed at eliminating humanitarian aid programs, cancelling critical scientific research, and terrorizing federal workers. He has alsoamplified racist and antisemitic theories on social media,attacked trans people(including his own daughter), andmade a fascist saluteduring Trump’s inauguration. Tesla’s shares are down over 37 percent year-to-date, as investors beg Musk to put aside his political activities and refocus his attention on his primary company. Meanwhile, Musk’s antics have spawned a nationwide protest movement called Tesla Takedown, aimed at boycotting the company and driving down its stock price. And it appears to be successful inpersuading many progressive Tesla ownersto sell their vehicles, despite steep drops in used car values. There have also been an unrelated spate of violent attacks on Tesla stores and vehicles around the world,including several cases of arson and vandalism. President Donald Trump has said suspects caught defacing Tesla vehicles would be charged with “domestic terrorism.” Musk is pinning his hopes onAI, robotics, and self-driving cars, which he argues will propel Tesla to new financial heights. He claims the company will launch an “unsupervised” robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, in June. But his past promises about autonomous driving have failed to come true. And experts have questioned Tesla’sapproach to the technology, pointing to dozens of fatal crashes that have occurred involving the company’s partially automated features. But the company’s on-again, off-again pursuit of a lower cost EV is what best exemplifies Tesla’s off-the-rails moment. For years, Musk has been promising an affordable electric vehicle, likely priced at $25,000, as a way to broaden the appeal of plug-in vehicles. But instead the company spent precious resources on the polarizing, unpopular Cybertruck. And now recent reports suggest that Tesla’s efforts to build a more affordable Model Y — its most popular model — is significantly delayed. The company reaffirmed its plans for new affordable models in the first half of 2025, noting in the shareholder letter that the changeover to the new assembly line for the refreshed Model Y also included prep for new vehicles later this year. “Given economic uncertainty resulting from changing trade policy, more affordable options are as critical as ever,” the company wrote. Musk and his executive team are expected to address all these issues and more in a call with investors at 5:30 pm ET. Tesla also said it would host a “live company update” including a question and answer session, in another sign that the company sees this moment as particularly fraught.You can listen here.

    "article_text": "﻿Maybe it could share a platform with a next-generation NSX. ﻿Maybe it could share a platform with a next-generation NSX. byUmar Shakir Nissan’s next-generation GT-R is expected to launch by the end of the decade, and it’s not going to be a pure EV. The new R36 GT-R that will succeed the aging R35 will have a plug-in hybrid powertrain and launch in three to five years, according to Nissan’s chief planning officer, Ponz Pandikuthira, speaking toThe Drive. Although it sounds like Nissan is already developing the GT-R in-house, Pandikuthiraalso hints toThe Drivethat the company may work with Honda to share a platform with a new Acura NSX. Pandikuthira has dropped a lot of theoreticals about the GT-R. He teases that it could house the 2025 Nissan Armada’s twin-turbo V6 engine, but also drive 70 miles or so on battery only for around-town errands. Pandikuthira also toldThe Drivethat Nissan had built GT-R EV prototypes but believes an electric version “would complete one lap at the Nürburgring” before needing a recharge, echoing the same concern he had in a 2024 interview withMotor Authority. At the time, Pandikuthira said they had not yet decided what powertrain they would use. Other EVs like the Tesla Model S Plaid haverun at least three lapson the Nürburgring on a single charge. Additionally, Pandikuthira mentioned that Nissan’sin-development solid-state battery technologyprobably wouldn’t work for the R36 GT-R. “It might be alright for other electric cars that you could do that are the cruising around need to be seen at a country club, but the ultimate raw performance GT-R as an electric car, that’s really quite a ways away,” Pandikuthira toldThe Drive. As noted byJalopnik, it would be tough to hit a deadline for the GT-R by 2030, considering a possible collaboration with Honda could take a while. It raises questions whether Pandikuthira’s comments on the GT-R are aspirational, or if there’s something much further along that has yet to be shared.

    "article_text": "But the Motion Picture Academy says the more human creativity, the better. But the Motion Picture Academy says the more human creativity, the better. byWes Davis The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences acknowledged the existence of generative AI yesterday innew rule changesfor its annual Oscars awards ceremony. Rather than dictate its use or require disclosures, the Academy simply says using AI doesn’t, on its own, hurt a movie’s chances — but that how it’s used could. Here’s what the Academy says in a passage added to itsfilm eligibility guidelines: With regard to Generative Artificial Intelligence and other digital tools used in the making of the film, the tools neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination. The Academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award. AsThe New York Timesnotes,the organization almost went further by requiring filmmakers to disclose whether they used AI in creating a movie. The mention of AI is a first for the Academy’s rules, as theTimeswrites, and a significant one givenlengthy actor and writer Hollywood strikesthat started in 2023 and were, in part, prompted by the rise of the technology and its perceived threat to creative workers in the industry. The Academy didn’t just address AI with the new rule changes. Another new rule states that members are only eligible to participate in the final round of voting if they’ve watched all of the films being considered for a given category. But as theTimesnotes, it’s an honor-system requirement, as voters self-certify that they did so, and don’t have to prove it beyond that.

The tariffs essentially make the products “unmarketable” in the US, theWall Street Journalreports. The tariffs essentially make the products “unmarketable” The move comes after long-running Commerce Departmentinvestigationsinto whether Chinese companies were funneling products through Southeast Asia to avoid tariffs and lower prices. It also heightens Donald Trump’s trade war with China after roiling global markets withdrastic tariffproposals this month. The president called a90-day pauseon tariffs, excluding China. US solar companies have been split on what to do about cheap solar cells from Southeast Asia. Domestic manufacturerspetitionedthe Commerce Department to investigate, while renewable energy project developers are worried about the tariffs raising costs for construction and the manufacturing of panels in the US using imported cells. Cambodia refused to comply with the investigation, and got hit with the highest tariffs at 3,521 percent.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 7:57 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Lori Vallow Daybellwas convicted Tuesday of conspiracy to commit murder inthe 2019 killing of her estranged husband in Arizona. The jury returned the verdict after starting deliberations on Monday. Charles Vallow, who was Vallow Daybell's fourth husband, was fatally shot by Vallow Daybell's brother, Alex Cox, in July 2019. Cox claimed self-defense at the time and was not charged. Cox died of natural causes months later. Cox's account was later called into question and Vallow Daybell was charged in Vallow's death following other murders, including of her children, 16-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow. Vallow Daybell is alreadyserving life sentences in Idahofor those murders and conspiring to murder her then-boyfriendChad Daybell'swife, Tammy. She now faces another life sentence in the Arizona case. Jurors deliberated for a total of three hours over two days. During the trial, which began in Phoenix on March 31, prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell and Cox had planned to kill Vallow so she could collect money from his life insurance policy and marry Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world. \"What we see is a very planned out, premeditated murder,\" prosecutor Treena Kay told the jury in her closing argument. Vallow Daybell represented herself at the trial despite not being a lawyer. She didn't call any witnesses or put on any evidence in her defense, but said in her opening and closing statements that Vallow's death wasn't a crime. \"This was a tragedy,\" she said. \"Don't let them turn my family tragedy into a crime.\" Adam Cox, another brother of Vallow Daybell, testified on behalf of the prosecution, telling jurors that he had no doubt his siblings were behind Vallow's death. He testified that before Vallow's death, his sister had told people her husband was no longer living and that a zombie was living inside his body. Before he died, Vallow told police he had concerns about his wife, whom he said believed she was preparing for the end of days. He also alleged that she threatened to kill him. He filed for divorce in February 2019. This trial was not Vallow Daybell's last. She is scheduled to go on trial again in early June on a charge of conspiring to murderBrandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of her niece, Melani Pawlowski. Prosecutors say Cox carried out the attempted shooting. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charge. She will be sentenced in Vallow's death after her second trial. Chad Daybell was also convicted in the murders of Tylee, JJ and Tammy, and wassentenced to death. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "More prosecutors resign in wake of dismissal of NYC Mayor Eric Adams' case",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 7:49 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Three more federal prosecutors who had been involved inthe now-dismissed corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adamsresigned on Tuesday, saying they felt pressured into admitting wrongdoing or regret as a condition for being reinstated to their jobs. \"We will not confess wrongdoing when there was none,\" Celia Cohen, Andrew Rohrbach and Derek Wikstrom wrote in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. The three assistant U.S. attorneys had been placed on leave aftera number of prosecutors in New York and Washington refused to follow orders to end the case against Adams, a Democrat. Cohen, Rohrbach and Wikstrom say it had become clear that one of the \"preconditions\" Blanche placed on them returning to the job was to \"express regret and admit some wrongdoing by the Office in connection with the refusal to move to dismiss the case.\" The new leaders of the Justice Department, they wrote, had \"decided that obedience supersedes all else, requiring us to abdicate our legal and ethical obligations in favor of directions from Washington. That is wrong.\" The letter was published by several news outlets. Its authenticity was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person who received the letter. \"There is no greater privilege than to work for an institution whose mandate is to do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"We will not abandon this principle to keep our jobs. We resign.\" The letter came the same day that Jay Clayton, former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, was sworn in as the New York office's new interim top prosecutor. Clayton said in a statement he \"would like to thank President Trump and Attorney General Bondi for this remarkable opportunity.\" Mr. Trump also nominated Clayton to lead the office on a permanent basis, but he has not yet been confirmed by the Senate. Adams was indicted last year, accused of taking illegal campaign contributions and travel perks from a Turkish official and others seeking to buy influence when he previously served as Brooklyn borough president. In February, after Mr. Trump took office, the Justice Department ordered then-acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, to drop the charges against Adams — not due to the merits of the case, but rather so the mayor could assist in the Trump administration's immigration agenda. Emil Bove, then the acting deputy attorney general, suggested that Adams was being prosecuted because he had criticized former President Joe Biden's immigration policies. Sassoon opted to resign instead, accusing the department of a \"quid pro quo\" andsaying she was\"baffled\" by the department's decisions. She also argued \"dismissing the case will amplify, rather than abate, concerns about weaponization of the Department,\" and revealed prosecutors had considered bringing other charges against Adams for allegedly making false statements and destroying evidence. Several other career prosecutors resigned after Sassoon. The Adams case was eventually dismissedin April, though Judge Dale E. Hodropped the chargeswith prejudice, meaning the government cannot refile them. In dismissing the case, Ho noted that the record showed the prosecutors who worked on the case had followed all guidelines. \"There is no evidence — zero — that they had any improper motives,\" Ho wrote in his ruling. The Justice Department didn't immediately have any comment. ___ Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report from Washington. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Abdalla says Khalil was denied temporary release from a detention center in Louisiana to attend the birth. In a statement Monday, she said she \"welcomed our son into the world earlier today without Mahmoud by my side.\" \"Despite our request for ICE to allow Mahmoud to attend the birth, they denied his temporary release to meet our son. This was a purposeful decision by ICE to make me, Mahmoud, and our son suffer,\" her statement continued. CBS News obtained a copy of the message denying his release, in which the top ICE official in New Orleans wrote in part, \"After consideration of the submitted information and a review of your client's case, your request for furlough is denied.\" Khalil, a legal permanent resident, wastaken into custody on March 8 at his Columbia-owned apartmentin New York City. The 30-year-old was a vocal member oflast year's campus protests over the war in Gaza. His lawyers said he was transferred from an ICE field office in Manhattanto New Jerseyandthen Louisiana, where he remains. He is not charged with any crime. \"My husband was taken away from me in the middle of the night. It was one of the most terrifying times of my life. I don't think I've ever experienced anything scarier than that,\" Abdalla said in a March interview with\"CBS Sunday Morning.\" Earlier this month, a judge in Louisiana ruled the federal government's effort to deport Khalilcould move forwardafter Secretary of State Marco Rubioalleged in court documentshis presence threatens \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\" Trump officials have also accused Khalil of omitting information about his work history on his green card application. The judge gave Khalil's lawyers until April 23 to file applications for relief to stop his deportation to Syria, where he was born, or Algeria, where he is a citizen, according to court documents. His defense responded, calling the hearing a \"charade of due process\" and vowing to appeal. \"Mahmoud remains unjustly detained in an ICE detention center over 1,000 miles away from his firstborn child. My son and I should not be navigating his first days on earth without Mahmoud. ICE and the Trump administration have stolen these precious moments from our family in an attempt to silence Mahmoud's support for Palestinian freedom,\" Abdalla said in Monday's statement. \"I will continue to fight every day for Mahmoud to come home to us.

    "title": "Trump says he has \"no intention of firing\" Fed chief Jerome Powell",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 7:17 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbiedthe central bank chiefto lower interest rates at a faster clip. When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" — though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation. \"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\" Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year. Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026. It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According tofederal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board — which includes the chair — can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administrationhas argued it has the legal rightto fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue thatcould have broad consequences. The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassetttold reporters last week. For his part, Powellsaid last yearhe will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job. Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, afterlowering ratesfrom a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And whilethe inflation rate is now well belowits 2022 peak, itremains abovethe Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark. Powellhas cited\"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powellwarnedthat Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank. Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedlylashed out at Powellon social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\" The showdown — and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell — have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocksslumped Mondayamid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday. In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve,warned that a loss of independencewould \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\" Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The presidentsharply criticized Powellwhen the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, beforecalling the central bankerhis \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 7:10 PM EDT/ KCAL News In a Tuesday news conference, California Rep. Robert Garcia detailed his visit to El Salvador with other Democratic lawmakers to demand the return ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, the 29-year-old Maryland man who was imprisoned in the country following his removal from the United States. Garcia was joined on the trip Monday by Democratic Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon. The congressman said the group decided to travel to El Salvador after they were denied an official congressional trip by House Republicans. Garcia said that when the group arrived in El Salvador, they met with U.S. Embassy officials, the ambassador, Abrego Garcia's family, attorney and human rights advocates. The delegation demanded to see Abrego Garcia but were denied, Garcia said. Abrego Garcia was initially held in El Salvador's notorious Terrorist Confinement Center mega-prison, or CECOT, thoughhe was later transferredto another facility, according to Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who met with Abrego Garcia last week. Garcia said Tuesday that he believed the Trump administration was defying a recentSupreme Court rulingrequiring the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return after he was mistakenly deported in March. \"What I think is really important in this moment that people understand is that this is a new line that [President] Donald Trump is crossing that is about due process, our Constitution and our democracy,\" Garcia said. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from custody that year, a court granted him withholding of removal, a legal status barring deportation to his home country. In March, Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities and deported to El Salvador, igniting a legal battle demanding his return. A federal official later called his removal an \"administrative error\" in court papers. Last week,El Salvador's presidentNayib Bukele visited the White House, where he said he would not return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has said that deciding to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. would be \"up to El Salvador.\" Garcia referred to the Trump administration's decision not to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. as a\"constitutional crisis.\" On Tuesday, he also accused the Trump administration of trying to instill fear in immigrant communities,citing a recent incident in Los Angelesin which Homeland Security agents were denied entry to two South Los Angeles public schools, according to Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho. \"We are concerned that the Trump administration could essentially snatch people, kidnap people off our streets in the United States and send them to a prison in El Salvador with no due process,\" Garcia said. Garcia said he will continue to demand Abrego Garcia's release until he is free, noting that other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus plan on traveling to El Salvador. Garcia will return if necessary, he said. Chelsea Hylton is a web producer for CBS Los Angeles. She covers local breaking news across the Southern California region.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 7:05 PM EDT/ CBS News A town hall hosted by Rep. Byron Donalds turned chaotic Tuesday, with audience members repeatedly interrupting the Florida Republican, leading authorities to remove two people — the latest raucous town hall dominated by protests against President Trump's administration. Donalds, a three-term congressman running in next year'sFlorida gubernatorial race, was asked a litany of often-testy questions, several of which focused on billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Audience members booed or cheered — and, in some cases, angrily left early — throughout the almost two-hour event at Estero High School in southwest Florida. Donalds occasionally verbally sparred with the protesters. Two people appeared to be escorted out by the local sheriff's department after yelling pro-Palestinian sentiments while Donalds answered a question about the Israel-Hamas war. During one incident, Donalds said he would have a protester removed if she kept interrupting. \"Let's have a disagreement. But when you're going to stand and yell and disrespect everybody in this room because you think you're being heard, and let's be clear, you're not,\" he said. Two back-to-back ejections after the crowd goes back and forth with@ByronDonaldson the Israel-Hamas war.The first two removed shouted “free Palestine” on their way out.pic.twitter.com/SAiXRssOx0 Donalds told reporters after the event he plans on holding more town halls, but he said the interruptions \"got out of hand,\" calling some of them \"rude\" and \"disrespectful\" to other attendees. \"I could kind of tell from the first question or two what kind of night it was going to be. But you know, that's alright. It's part of the business,\" Donalds told reporters. The interruptions began quickly. Minutes into the event, a staff member read a pre-submitted question about whether Donalds supports congressional oversight of DOGE. Donalds defended Musk's cost-cutting efforts and said lawmakers are \"letting DOGE complete its work,\" leading some audience members to groan and boo — though others appeared to cheer Donalds on. Donalds was also heckled during questions about immigration, gun control measures,DOGE's work in the Social Security Administration, tariffs and diversity programs. He broadly defended Trump administration policies, drawing boos in many cases. The lawmaker pushed back on protesters in some cases, asking them questions about Biden- and Obama-era programs and arguing critics were not being \"intellectually honest.\" At other points, he encouraged people to \"relax\" and stop heckling: \"You can yell or you can hear,\" he said during an exchange about the Social Security Administration. \"Is anybody finding this informative?\" Donalds asked the crowd at one point, drawing a mixture of cheers and jeers. \"60-40? That'll work.\" Donalds isseekingto replace term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A staunch Trump ally, the congressmanearned the president's endorsementin February, before Donalds formally launched his gubernatorial campaign. Monday's event was the latest congressional town hall to get chaotic. Members of both parties have faced adversarial crowds in recent weeks, with protesters often pushing back against Mr. Trump and Musk. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greenewas repeatedly interruptedby protests at a meeting in the Georgia Republican's home district last Tuesday, with police arresting three demonstrators — two of whom were tased at the scene. That same evening, a town hall hosted by Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, was alsoderailed by angry constituents. Some lawmakers have shied away from hosting in-person events, in some cases shifting to virtual meetings with voters instead. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican,suggested last monthGOP lawmakers should reconsider in-person town halls, saying members of his caucus should communicate with their constituents but \"there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\" Donalds said last month he plans to continue holding town halls, brushing off plans to protest the events in an interview with Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle.\" \"Quite frankly, I don't care what they do,\" Donaldssaid. \"I would tell any Democrat that wants to come out there and astroturf my town hall, bring it, because we're going to talk the truth. We're going to talk about what's really going on. I'm not afraid of you.\" Taurean Small is a congressional reporter for CBS News. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 6:56 PM EDT/ CBS Colorado A federal judge in Denver has granted a temporary restraining order barring theremoval of migrantsfrom the district of Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act. Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued during a hearing on Monday that two men from Venezuela were in imminent danger of being deported to a prison in El Salvador. Further, the lawyers for the migrants said that 11 men from Colorado have already been sent to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT — among the hundreds of migrants sent to the supermax prison by the Trump administration. \"We are thankful that the Court put a stop to the Trump administration's unlawful attempt to disappear Colorado residents to a Salvadoran mega-prison,\" said Tim Macdonald, ACLU of Colorado Legal Director. \"Due process is fundamental to the rule of law in this country, and the government has shown a rampant disregard for this essential civil right. The Trump administration's desire to evade due process is a threat to all of us. We will continue to fight to permanently stop the government from disappearing people to foreign prisons without due process and in violation of the law. Not one more person should face this nightmare scenario.\" CBS News Colorado has reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment. The terms of the Colorado restraining order expire on May 6. In a ruling on April 7, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered that \"AEA detainees must receive notice... that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in proper venue before such removal occurs.\" The high court's order did not indicate the terms of \"reasonable\" notice, so it was debated in court on Monday. In her order, Judge Charlotte Sweeney wrote that individuals subject to deportation under the AEA must receive 21 days' notice, be informed of the right to judicial review, and consult with an attorney. Such notice must also be written in a language the individual understands. In March, President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials allege are part of the Venezuelan gangTren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to aprison in El Salvador. The last time the Act was invoked was during World War II, when Japanese Americans were interned at Camp Amache in Colorado. Anna Alejo is CBS News Colorado's Executive Producer of Community Impact.

    "title": "Deported man's attorneys say DOJ isn't providing answers ordered by judge",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 6:44 PM EDT/ CBS News Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, aMaryland manmistakenly deported to aprison in El Salvador, say the government has failed to provide appropriate responses to a judge's order for expedited discovery and to her questions about facilitating his return to the U.S. In aletteraddressed to U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis, Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a hearing to be scheduled Wednesday \"to address the government's failure to comply\" with Xinis' order for expedited discovery in the case. Xinis on Tuesdayissued a scathing order denying the Justice Department's objection to some of the discovery in the case, accusing the department of \"continued mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's Order,\" to return Abrego Garcia and writing the \"defendants' objection reflects a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.\" Xinis also denied a Justice Deparmtnet claim that it does not need to commit to answering questions brought by Abrego Garcia's lawyers and can instead claim privilege over the answers. \"For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders. Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege,\" Xinis wrote. \"Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now. If Defendants want to preserve their privilege claims, they must support them with the required detail. Otherwise, they will lose the protections they failed to properly invoke.\" Xinis ordered a speedy fact-finding process after the Trump administration refused to comply with three different court orders, including an order from the Supreme Court, to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. so he can receive due process regarding the Trump administration's claim that he is an MS-13 gang member. Last weekin court, a Justice Department attorney said that the Trump administration would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return only if he arrived at a port of entry and continued to dodge questions from Xinis about what, if anything, the Trump administration is doing to return the man. Xinis said that \"every day Mr. Abrego Garcia is detained in CECOT is another date of irreparable harm\" and gave both sides two weeks to complete expedited discovery in the case, including sworn depositions from Trump administration officials with first-hand knowledge of the efforts to return him. Depositions are set to be completed on Wednesday. But attorneys for Abrego Garcia say all of the discovery produced by the Justice Department has been \"nothing of substance,\" and \"consists entirely of public filings from the dockets, copies of Plaintiffs' own discovery requests and correspondence, and two nonsubstantive cover emails transmitting declarations filed in this case.\" Other questions for which Abrego Garcia's attorneys have sought answers have been \"similarly non-responsive,\" they wrote. The plaintiff's lawyers said that the government \"artificially\" narrowed Xinis' order for discovery \"to avoid complying with its obligations.\" \"The Government refuses to respond to interrogatories it claims are 'based on the false premise that the United States can or has been ordered to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador,'\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys wrote, adding that the Justice Department has not provided any information about Abrego Garcia's detention before April 2, although he has been detained in El Salvador since March 15. They also argued that the government has asserted privilege \"including deliberative process privilege, state secret privilege, and 'governmental privilege' without any foundation for doing so.\" Justice Department attorneys countered that they have \"put forward a good-faith effort to provide appropriate responses\" to Abrego Garcia's attorneys and added that they plan to file specific privilege claims over information pertaining to Abrego Garcia soon. The government also said the administration is \"in discussions\" with the Salvadoran government to return Abrego Garcia, but \"any requirement of a more detailed response by the Defendants would be wholly inappropriate and an invasion of diplomatic discussions.\" One detail of Abrego Garcia's detention in El Salvador may prompt Xinis to seek more information about what the Trump administration knew — and when — about his transfer from CECOT, the country's notorious supermax prison, to another detention center. Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, whomet with Abrego Garcialast week, said he was moved from CECOT on April 9 to another lower-security detention facility in El Salvador. But in court-mandated, daily status updates ordered by Xinis about Abrego Garcia's condition and what the administration is doing to return him, four different officials — from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the State Department, and Homeland Security — each stated that Abrego Garcia was being detained at CECOT after that date. On Monday, the Trump administration confirmed that Abrego Garcia had been moved to a facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, and reported based on conversations with the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador that he is \"in good conditions and in an excellent state of health.\" Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice.

    "title": "Tesla's earnings fall far short as investors ask Elon Musk to ditch DOGE",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 22, 2025 / 6:35 PM EDT/ CBS News Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker'sfirst-quarter resultsshowing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionairewas focusedon leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts. Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration'sDepartment of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla. \"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\" That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump'selectoral victoryon optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line. But Musk's activities with DOGE — including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data — havealienated some consumersand sparked protestsacross the globe, causing the stock price to deflate. Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that heplans to scale backhis time spent on DOGE, beginning next month. \"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said. But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said. Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\" The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result inhigher pricesfor many vehicles, including Teslas. Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call. The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\" Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note. \"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded. Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts. Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading. Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025fell nearly 13%as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations. In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead. But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout. Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said. In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.

    "title": "Musk says time commitment to DOGE will 'drop significantly' as focus returns to Tesla",
    "article_text": "Tech billionaire Elon Musk said Tuesday that he will begin dedicating more time to Tesla and less to his work with the Trump administration starting next month, providing a relief to Tesla investors fed up with his political work and signaling a possible shift in power at the White House. Musk's comments came on Tesla's call with investors following the company reporting a sizable drop in first-quarter profit and revenue. The company warned that the political environment along with the Trump administration's tariff plans were challenges for its business. \"Starting probably next month, May, my time obligation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said, referring to his Department of Government Efficiency. \"I think I'll continue to spend a day or two per week on government matters for as long as the president would like me to do so, and for as long as it is useful, but starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla, now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done,\" he said. Musk, the CEO of Tesla, has faced a swell of opposition for his work with President Donald Trump, which has made Tesla agrowing target for protestsand evenvandalism. Musk has acknowledged that his move into politics hashit the company's stock price. Tesla — which is increasingly trying to diversify into high-tech products like robots —saidprofits fell 71%to $409 million, compared with $1.39 billion during the same quarter one year ago. Shares of Tesla were up about 4% in after-hours trading, though the company has lost 50% of its value from its mid-December peak. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk's announcement. Musk reiterated on the call that he intends to pivot Tesla from its established electric car business into two new products: robotaxis and humanoid robots, two ideas thatinvestors have been skeptical about. Musk said that Tesla was still on track to begin selling robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, in June, putting Tesla into head-to-head competition with Google spinoff Waymo, which launched robotaxi rides therein March via the Uber app. Tesla, in its written earnings report, said that \"uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets\" associated with \"rapidly evolving trade policy,\" along with \"changing political sentiment,\" could have \"a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term.\" It also said updates to its best-selling Model Y that affected its availability on the market contributed to the shortfall. \"We remain committed to expanding our business model to include delivering autonomous robots across multiple form factors and use cases — powered by our real-world AI expertise — to our customers and for use in our factories, as we navigate these headwinds,\" it said. It said it was not prepared to provide guidance for performance the rest of the year — a decision other companies are also making — because of broad trends that include the impact from tariffs. Tesla has boasted that is\"the most American-made\" car, but it still faces tariff exposure due to imported parts. It said it would \"revisit\" guidance for 2025 in three months. \"It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,\" Tesla said in the outlook section of its report. Musk, on the conference call, said he pressed Trump to reverse course on his tariff policy but was not successful. \"I'm one of many advisers to the president. I'm not the president, but I've made my opinion clear to the president,\" he said. \"I'm an advocate of predictable tariff structures.\" Musk hasfaced pressure from many sides, including from investors who would like him to pay more attention to the company and from his job in the Trump administration, where he has volunteered to slash government programs. Musk has kept his CEO roles at Tesla and SpaceX even while he has spent much of his time with President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, the group charged with reducing federal spending. A CNBC All-America Economic survey released earlier Tuesday underscoredthe depth ofthenegative sentimenttoward Tesla and Musk: 47% of the public had negative views of the company versus 27% positive, and half had negative views of Musk, compared with 36% who saw him positively. \"Tesla has become a political symbol around the world,\" Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said in an interview on CNBC after the earnings report was released. Ives said the political controversy has hurt Tesla not only by reducing demand for vehicles but also because Tesla has become a targetfor retaliatory tariffsby other nations, such as China. The earnings report did not explicitly mention the repeated vandalism against Tesla vehicles orthe peaceful protestsat its showrooms, instead citing the \"changing political sentiment\" as a headwind for demand. A key question for Tesla, Musk and the Trump administration has been how long Musk will remain in his White House position. His job as a “special government employee” is time-limited by lawto 130 daysduring any period of 365 consecutive days, which could put his legally mandated endpoint as early as late May. Musk told Fox News this month that he believed“most” of his workwould be done by the deadline.",

    "title": "From shaming Hillary Clinton to sharing strikes: Pete Hegseth's shift on handling sensitive info",
    "article_text": "In 2016, a Fox News host expressed outrage that Hillary Clinton had sent government emails over a private server while serving as secretary of state. This host said her behavior damaged the nation’s credibility. He said it warranted being fired \"on the spot.\" And he said someone who did “even 1/1000th” of what Clinton had done would be jailed. “The fact that she wouldn’t be held accountable for this, I think, blows the mind of anyone who’s held our nation’s secrets dear,” he said on Fox News at the time, adding that those with top-secret clearances \"know that even one hiccup causes a problem.” That Fox News host, Pete Hegseth, is now the defense secretary, and he faces his own controversy over mishandling sensitive information after he texted to a group chat — which includeda journalist from The Atlantic— details of a planned strike in Yemen before it was carried out. National security adviser Mike Waltz hastaken responsibilityfor creating the group and the accidental leak. The conversation happened on a smartphone app called Signal,which uses end-to-end encryptionbut is not a government service. Using it to discuss sensitive military matters is not standard protocol. Hegseth did this again in a second instance,sharing similar intelligence detailson a separate Signal chat on his personal phone with 13 people, including his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer, according to two people familiar with the matter. The New York Timesfirst reportedon the second Signal conversation Sunday. Hegseth’s attitude over his own handling of sensitive information? A giant shrug. It's a markedly different response from 2016, when he vehemently argued that the blame for the email server and not being careful enough with sensitive government information landed squarely on Clinton. At that time, Hegseth said on Fox News, “How damaging is it to your ability to recruit or build allies with others when they are worried that our leaders may be exposing them because of their gross negligence or their recklessness in handling information?” In his own situation,Hegseth has insisted that in both Signal conversations, he wasn't sharing \"war plans.\" \"What was shared over Signal, then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified,\" Hegseth told Fox News on Tuesday. At the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, Hegseth stood before cameras to contend he was the victim of a “smear” by unnamed sources. He bemoaned media coverage of what he called the “Russia hoax” and wondered why journalists still hadn’t returned Pulitzer Prizes for covering Russia’s influence on that election. All the while, Hegseth sidestepped questions about reports detailing his disclosure of sensitive defense planning to those outside the government. Instead, he has blamed the media. He has blamed government “leakers.” He has blamed disgruntled employees. \"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and a bunch of hit pieces come out from the same media that peddled the Russia hoax. Won't give back their Pulitzers. They got Pulitzers for a bunch of lies,\" Hegseth said, referencing reporting onRussian interferencein the 2016 election. A bipartisan Senate report in 2020 revealed how the Trump campaign embraced Russia’s intelligence operation in 2016 designed to hurt Clinton and help Trump. \"And as they peddle those lies, no one ever calls them on it,\" Hegseth continued Monday. \"See, this is what the media does. They take anonymous sources from disgruntled employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations. Not going to work with me!\" Jesse Lehrich, who served as Clinton’s foreign policy spokesperson on the 2016 campaign, argued that there was no comparison between the sensitivity of the information that Hegseth shared and that of Clinton’s emails. “She wasn’t saying, ‘Hey Chelsea, hope you had a good day. By the way, here’s our war plans,’” Lehrich said, referencing Clinton's daughter. “The entire [Republican] party’s yearslong insistence was that this was a national security scandal of the highest order. Obviously, they are flexible with their analysis depending on who’s at fault.” At the time of Clinton’s 2016 campaign for president, Lehrich recalled protracted, daily battles over what he described as the most innocuous of details, including whether the wording of a response from Clinton or an aide differed slightly from one instance to the next. \"From before she announced her candidacy, through the final days of the campaign, it was a never-ending, dominant story that was constantly leading the front page of the papers and the nightly news,\" he said. Clintonwrote in a New York Times op-eddays afterThe Atlantic storybroke in March to comment on the Hegseth controversy. “It’s not the hypocrisy that bothers me,” she wrote. “It’s the stupidity.” A Defense Department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. White House officials have contended that classified information was not shared in the conversations. “No matter how many times the legacy media tries to resurrect the same nonstory, they can’t change the fact that no classified information was shared,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said Sunday. \"Recently-fired ‘leakers’ are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President’s agenda, but the administration will continue to hold them accountable.” Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning journalism watchdog group Media Matters for America, said Hegseth is insulated from having to take questions head on — at least when it comes to the external narrative that’s playing to the Republican base. “All these incidents really only matter in the context of accountability and action, especially in this administration, if there’s a narrative around it … and the truth is, there’s not any sign that this matters, at least in the right-wing space,” he said. “I don’t think it’s that they don’t care or that they don’t see it,\" Carusone continued, referring to the administration. \"It’s that they’ve inoculated themselves against it.” He said the right is in a moment when it dominates the narrative, on social media, podcasts and cable TV news. Largely across those platforms, he said, conservatives aren't focusing on the Hegseth Signal chat story or are defending him as a target of the left's ire because he has vowed to carry out Trump's initiatives and reform the Pentagon. Still, Hegseth isn't out of the woods. ARepublican senator and Hegseth supporterhas called for the Pentagon inspector general to investigate Hegseth's communications. On Monday, the first Republican lawmaker called for Hegseth's resignation. That followed    criticism from Pentagon spokesperson John Ullyot, who left his post last week andpublished an op-edin Politico Magazine on Sunday. \"It’s been a month of total chaos at the Pentagon,\" Ullyot wrote. \"From leaks of sensitive operational plans to mass firings, the dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president — who deserves better from his senior leadership.\" \"President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account,\" he went on. \"Given that, it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.\"",

    "title": "Key piece of Trump administration plan to expand migrant detention space appears to have fallen through",
    "article_text": "A key piece of the Trump administration’s plan torapidly expand immigration detention capacityby tens of thousands of beds appears to have fallen through, according to two sources and a government contracting document reviewed by NBC News. Facing a shortage of immigration detention space, President Donald Trump first announced he would add 30,000 beds for immigrants at Guantánamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. When that plan fellthrough over cost and logistical issues, the plan shifted to Fort Bliss, a military base in Texas, to build a sprawling tent city for immigrants to be held before deportation. A $3.8 billion contract was awarded to Deployed Resources, a contractor that has previously provided toilets and tents for concertgoers, victims of natural disasters and, more recently, migrants who were briefly detained and processed by Border Patrol. But last week, new language appeared on the Deployed Resources contract posted to a public records database that says it was terminated. The document says it was terminated \"for convenience\" and cites Trump’s executive order about “radical transparency\" and \"wasteful spending,” but it is unclear whether cost savings played into the decision. Representatives for Deployed Resources did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A senior official with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, confirmed that the contract was terminated but said a \"revised procurement action for Fort Bliss is active and ongoing.\" \"While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements,\" the official added. The White House and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lack of space to hold immigrants before they are deported has been a bottleneck forTrump’s efforts to break records on deportations. And the difficulty inquickly building detention spacethat meets safety requirements mandated by long-standing federal court settlements may spell problems for overall deportation efforts. The tent city at Fort Bliss would have been Deployed Resources' first contract for an ICE detention facility, which can sometimes hold migrants for months before they are deported. Unlike Border Patrol processing facilities, which can hold immigrants for a maximum of three days, holding migrants at Fort Bliss would mean the tent city there would need to meet ICE standards. ICE detention centers must provide individual beds, showers, medical care and other services to migrants. The canceled contract is another obstacle for the Trump administration’s efforts to increase detention to alleviate strains on the system. One hundred-forty-one facilitiesnow hold 47,928 detainees, far above the 41,500 approved by Congress, which means ICE is not funded by Congress for every bed it uses and could face a budget shortfall by the end of the fiscal year. The sources familiar with ICE detention settings said that brick-and-mortar ICE detention centers take longer to build than tent facilities but that they are better equipped to detain immigrants for long periods. The sources said maintaining tents, or what are referred to as \"soft-sided facilities,\" are also more challenging because of the risks they present for migrants and detention officers. Federal court settlements require ICE to hold migrants in conditions that are nonpunitive and to give them access to basic necessities like running water and air conditioning, which are more difficult to provide in tents. And such facilities are less secure than buildings, which increases pressures on detention officers.",

    "title": "Angry girlfriend or victim of a cover-up? Karen Read murder retrial opens with dueling accounts",
    "article_text": "Opening statements in theretrial of Karen Readpainted starkly different portraits of the defendant Tuesday, with the prosecution alleging she fatally struck her boyfriend with her SUV as their relationship unraveled and her lawyers arguing she was the victim of law enforcement misconduct and a cover-up. The theories largely echoed those put forward in Read’swidely publicized first trial on charges of second-degree murderand other alleged crimes in the Jan. 29, 2022, death of Boston Police Officer John O’Keefe. That nine-week trialended with a hung jury last summer. But there were notable differences in some of the details prosecutors and defense lawyers presented Tuesday. Read has repeatedly pressed her case publicly, speaking to reporters outside the courtroom in recent weeks and giving lengthy interviews fordocumentariesand amagazine story. The lead prosecutor, special counsel Hank Brennan, said he intends to rely on Read’s own words in what he called her “campaign to make public statements.” “Her statements will confirm what you know from the science and the data,” Brennan told the jury. “You’re going to hear from her own lips — and many of her statements — her admissions to extraordinary intoxication ... her admission to being angry at John that night.” In a clip that Brennan played for the jury, Read, 45,discussed O’Keefe’s death with “Dateline.”In the interview, Read said she “could have tagged him in the knee and incapacitated him. He didn’t look mortally wounded as far as I could see. But could I have done something that knocked him out?” Prosecutors used the clip to reinforce the theory they have alleged about O’Keefe’s death: Fueled by anger and intoxication, Read backed her Lexus SUV into him after the couple had an argument. According to prosecutors, she left him for dead outside the Boston-area home of Brian Albert, then a police sergeant who was having a gathering that O’Keefe was on his way to. Read and her lawyers have said she dropped O’Keefe off at Albert’s home around midnight and watched him go inside. According to the defense's account, when Read awoke hours later, she panicked after having discovered that O’Keefe never came home. She found him unresponsive outside Albert’s home around 6 a.m. the next day, she and her lawyers say. Defense attorney Alan Jackson countered that the clip Brennan presented to the jury was shown without context. In Jackson’s telling, the \"Dateline\" interview was presented as if Read were discussing what was going through her mind when she dropped O'Keefe off at midnight, which he argued was not the case. “She’s talking about 6 a.m. when she found him,” Jackson said, adding that similar statements she made to others were not confessions but the words of a woman “desperately trying to piece together what happened on this tragic night.” How the defense was able to addressformer Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctoralso marked a notable shift. Proctor led the investigation into O’Keefe’s death, andhe was fired after allegations of misconductraised during the first trial prompted an internal state police investigation. A state panel concluded that he violated agency rules when he sent derogatory texts about Read and shared confidential investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel. Calling Proctor a “malignancy” that spread throughout the investigation into O’Keefe’s death and Read's prosecution, Jackson said there was no part of the case that Proctor had not touched. “He’s been disgraced by his own agency,” Jackson said. “Not by us. By the Massachusetts State Police — investigated, suspended and fired.” Jackson accused Proctor of conducting a biased and \"corrupted\" investigation that shielded people he had undisclosed ties with — including Albert — from being scrutinized as possible suspects in O'Keefe's death. (Albert testified during the first trial that O'Keefe never entered his home the night of his death, though he would have been \"welcomed with open arms\" if he had.) Brennan did not mention Proctor in his opening statement, and Proctor has not publicly commented on his termination. His family said the state panel’s decision “unfairly exploits and scapegoats one of their own, a trooper with a 12-year unblemished record.” During the first trial, Proctor acknowledged that his comments about Read “dehumanized” her but said his conduct did not compromise the integrity of the investigation.",

    "title": "'Doomsday mom' Lori Vallow Daybell is convicted in fourth husband's death",
    "article_text": "\"Doomsday mom\"Lori Vallow Daybellwas convicted Tuesday in Arizona of conspiring to kill her fourth husband, Charles Vallow. A Maricopa County Superior Court jury found Vallow Daybell guilty of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the July 2019 fatal shooting. Charles Vallow's brother, Gerry Vallow, said afterward that the verdict brought him some solace. \"It was a relief, a long journey, and I’m just glad it’s over with,\" he said. \"Today’s a good day. We won.\" Sister Kay Woodcock, also speaking outside the Phoenix courthouse, said: \"We gotcha. She’ll be rotting in prison where she deserves to be.\" Vallow Daybell, who represented herself at trial, told jurors that her brother, Alex Cox, shot Charles Vallow in self-defense following a family argument. Cox died later that year from a pulmonary embolism and was never charged. According to Vallow Daybell, her husband got into an argument with her daughter, Tylee Ryan, and threatened the teen with a bat. Charles Vallow was at his estranged wife's home in Chandler, Arizona, to take their son, Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, to school. Vallow Daybell, 51, wasconvicted in Idaho in 2023 of killing her two children and her husband's first wife, Tammy Daybell. She's already servinglife in prisonwithout the possibility of parole. In astatement, the Tammy Douglas Daybell foundation expressed a sense of \"relief and closure\" following Tuesday's verdict. \"While no verdict can bring back those we have lost, this decision is a crucial step in honoring the memory of Charles, JJ, Tylee, and Tammy,\" the foundation said. Prosecutors in the Arizona case dismissed Vallow Daybell's self-defense claim, arguing that she had several reasons for wanting her husband dead, including her desire to start a life with another man. \"Lori Vallow wanted to be Lori Daybell, wife of Chad Daybell. And in July of 2019, Lori Vallow wanted to keep the same lifestyle that she had with Charles. And she could get all of this if Charles was dead,\" prosecutor Treena Kay said in her opening statements. Kay continued: \"She could marry Chad Daybell and become Lori Daybell. She would get a million-dollar life insurance policy from Charles Vallow. She would get Social Security for herself and their son, JJ, as the child of a dead spouse. And all of this would be true if Charles Vallow was dead.\" The prosecutor added that Vallow Daybell labeled people who disagreed with her as \"dark\" or \"possessed by evil spirits\" and used religion to justify Charles Vallow's death. Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell, adoomsday author, married in November 2019. In her closing argument on Monday, Vallow Daybell said prosecutors tried to \"retrofit a crime that doesn’t exist.\" \"Under Arizona law, I had the right to self-defense. Tylee had the right to self-defense. Alex had the right to self-defense. This event was not planned or expected. It was shocking,\" she said. \"This event was not a crime. It was a tragedy. Don’t let them turn my family tragedy into a crime.\" During Vallow Daybell's trial, the jury heard from a medical examiner whotestified that Charles Vallow could have been lying on a firm surfacelike a floor when he was shot. The fatal shot went through his heart, medical examiner Derek Bumgarner said. Adam Cox told the court that he had\"no doubt\" his sister conspired with their brother to kill Charles Vallow. He testified that before the shooting, Vallow Daybell had been making odd religious comments and that he and Charles Vallow wanted to hold an intervention to address it. Other testimony included that of Chandler Police Officer Cassandra Ynclan, who told the court that Vallow Daybell \"seemed very kind of ordinary and kind of nonchalant\" on the day of her husband's death. The state rested its case last week. Vallow Daybell rested without presenting any evidence or calling any witnesses. Juror Victoria Lewis told NBCaffiliate KPNXofPhoenixthat lies from the defense were revealed as the trial went on, and that Vallow Daybell appeared unserious  in her role has her own counsel — factors that weighed on Lewis' decision. \"Many days she just was like smiling and laughing and didn’t seem to take anything very seriously,\" Lewis said outside the courthouse. Sentencing in criminal cases usually takes place about 30 days from the date of a verdict.KPNX reportedthat sentencing will be delayed until after a separate case against Vallow Daybell is completed. In that case, Vallow Daybellis charged withconspiring to kill Brandon Boudreaux, her niece’s estranged husband, and the judge noted that could complicate the calendar. He ordered a status update for mid-May. Vallow Daybell faces the possibility of life behind bars following Tuesday's verdict.",

    "title": "Judge questions deportation case of Harvard scientist accused of smuggling frog embryos",
    "article_text": "An immigration judge has found the U.S. government’s initial deportation case againstKseniia Petrova, a Russian-born Harvard scientist held in ICE detention, to be legally deficient, her attorney said, raising questions about whether the case can move forward. The preliminary immigration hearing, held in Jena, Louisiana, included three trial attorneys and a deputy chief counsel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Petrova’s attorney Greg Romanovsky described their presence as unusual for an early-stage proceeding. “In my 25 years of practice, I’ve never seen anything like it,” he said. The judge determined that the Notice to Appear — the official document initiating deportation proceedings — did not meet legal standards, Romanovsky said. ICE has been given one week to file additional documentation to supportits charge that Petrova is deportable. A follow-up hearing has been scheduled for July 22 to determine whether the case can proceed. If the judge rules that the deportability charge is valid, a final hearing on Petrova’s asylum application will be scheduled. Until then, a resolution in the case is likely to be months away, Romanovsky said. Petrova, 30, remains in ICE custody at Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, where she has been held for about two months. She was a leading scientist at Harvard’s renowned Kirschner Lab until she was arrested at a Boston airport in mid-February. She is fighting possible deportation to Russia, where she said she fears persecution and jail time over her protests against the war in Ukraine. Her lawyer is now focused on securing her release, arguing that she should not remain in detention while her case remains in procedural uncertainty. The push for her release centers on a separate federal case Petrova’s attorney has filed in U.S. District Court in Vermont, where she is suing the Department of Homeland Security over what she alleges was an unlawful visa cancellation and her subsequent detention. A hearing in that case is scheduled for May 14 in Burlington, Vermont. “She shouldn’t have to wait for the outcome of a prolonged legal process while sitting in detention in Louisiana,” Romanovsky said. The outcome of the Vermont federal hearing could significantly affect Petrova’s detention status ahead of the July immigration court hearing in Louisiana. The Department of Homeland Security saidin a statement Xthat Petrova was “lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” “A subsequent K9 inspection uncovered undeclared petri dishes, containers of unknown substances, and loose vials of embryonic frog cells, all without proper permits,” DHS said in the post. “Messages found on her phone revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.” Petrova described the incident differently. “They asked if I have any biological samples in my luggage. I said yes,”she previously told NBC News from detention in Louisiana. She described confusion over the customs procedures and a lengthy interrogation by Customs and Border Protection officers. “Nobody knew what was happening to me. I didn’t have any contact, not to my lawyer, not to Leon, not to anybody,” she said, referring to Dr. Leon Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard’s Department of Systems Biology and her manager and mentor. “And the next day, they didn’t say what would happen. I was waiting in a cell.”",

    "title": "At least 26 tourists killed by gunmen at a resort in Kashmir, Indian police say",
    "article_text": "SRINAGAR, India  — Gunmen shot and killed at least 26 tourists on Tuesday at a resort in Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said in what appeared to be a major shift in a regional conflict in which tourists have largely been spared. Police said it was a “terror attack” and blamed militants fighting against Indian rule. “This attack is much larger than anything we’ve seen directed at civilians in recent years,” Omar Abdullah, the region’s top elected official, wrote on social media. Two senior police officers said at least four gunmen, whom they described as militants, fired at dozens of tourists from close range. The officers said at least three dozen people were wounded, many of them reported to be in serious condition. Most of the killed tourists were Indian, the officers said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy. Officials collected at least 24 bodies in Baisaran meadow, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the disputed region’s resort town of Pahalgam. Two others died while being taken for medical treatment. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Police and soldiers were searching for the attackers. “We will come down heavily on the perpetrators with the harshest consequences,” India’s home minister, Amit Shah, wrote on social media. He arrived in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-controlled Kashmir, and convened a meeting with top security officials. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was cutting short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returning to New Delhi early Wednesday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a key resistance politician and Kashmir’s top religious cleric, condemned what he described as a “cowardly attack on tourists,” writing on social media that “such violence is unacceptable and against the ethos of Kashmir which welcomes visitors with love and warmth.” The gunfire coincided with the visit to India of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who called it a “devastating terrorist attack.” He added on social media: “Over the past few days, we have been overcome with the beauty of this country and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn this horrific attack.” U.S. President Donald Trump on social media noted “deeply disturbing news out of Kashmir. The United States stands strong with India against terrorism.” Other global leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, condemned the attack. “The United States stands with India,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X. Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir but both claim the territory in its entirety. Kashmir has seen a spate of targeted killings of Hindus, including immigrant workers from Indian states, after New Delhi ended the region’s semi-autonomy in 2019 and drastically curbed dissent, civil liberties and media freedoms. Tensions have been simmering as India has intensified its counterinsurgency operations. But despite tourists flocking to Kashmir in huge numbers for its Himalayan foothills and exquisitely decorated houseboats, they have not been targeted. The region has drawn millions of visitors who enjoy a strange peace kept by ubiquitous security checkpoints, armored vehicles and patrolling soldiers. New Delhi has vigorously pushed tourism and claimed it as a sign of normalcy returning. The meadow in Pahalgam is a popular destination, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and dotted with pine forests. It is visited by hundreds of tourists every day. Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, while condemning the attack, said Modi’s government should take accountability instead of making “hollow claims on the situation being normal” in the region. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. In March 2000, at least 35 civilians were shot and killed in a southern village in Kashmir while then-U.S. President Bill Clinton was visiting India. It was the region’s deadliest attack in the past couple of decades. Violence has ebbed in recent times in the Kashmir Valley, the heart of anti-India rebellion. Fighting between government forces and rebels has largely shifted to remote areas of Jammu region, including Rajouri, Poonch and Kathua, where Indian troops have faced deadly attacks.",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, California Gov. Gavin Newsom sits down for an interview with Jonathan Allen to discuss his views on how to rebuild the Democratic Party and the recent backlash he’s received from some progressives. Plus, Steve Kornacki shifts his election focus from the U.S. to the Vatican as cardinals prepare to pick the next pope. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about the latest moves from the Trump administration, what comes next on Capitol Hill or anything else happening in Washington? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. SAN ANSELMO, Calif. — Gov. Gavin Newsom, widely viewed as a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, had tough words for his own party in an exclusive interview with NBC News in this Marin County suburb north of San Francisco. Democrats have been too focused on the personality of candidates at the top of the ticket, rather than building a platform that is bigger than the nominee and addresses how it will fight for what voters want, he said. “We just have to move beyond the guy or gal on the white horse that’s going to come save the day — it’s exhausting,” the second-term chief executive of the nation’s most-populous state said. “This party needs to rebuild itself from the bottom up, not top down. We are as dumb as we want to be.” Responding to progressive backlash:In his nascent quest to help revitalize the Democratic Party, Newsom has been criticized by some progressives for hosting a pair of high-profile allies of President Donald Trump — Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk — on his new podcast, “This is Gavin Newsom.” (The writer of this article sat for an interview on the podcast this week.) In his talk with Kirk, Newsom further infuriated some allies in the LGBTQ community and on the left by announcing that he opposes trans athletes competing in women’s and girls’ sports. Newsom said he has been surprised by the ferocity of the backlash against his interviews with MAGA figures, but he appears to be committed to learning from Trump’s victories in two of the last three presidential elections. He was particularly struck by Trump’s advantage with young men, which he attributed to the attention the president paid to them — which was demonstrated in part by his appearing on podcasts and YouTube shows popular with that cohort. “He had no policy to back up for young men, how to take care of these kids,” Newsom said. “But he at least expressed that — I see you, you matter, I care.” Read more from the interview → The electorate will be small, the process will play out entirely in secret, and, other than the name of the winner, the results of the voting will never be publicly known. In the coming weeks, Pope Francis’ successor will be chosen by members of the Catholic Church’s College of Cardinals, senior clerical leaders from around the world. There are currently 252 of them, but only those under 80 years old are eligible to take part, leaving a total of 135 “cardinal electors” who will comprise the electorate. Eighty percent of the cardinal electors were appointed by Francis during his 12-year tenure, which was marked by a concerted effort to decentralize power away from Rome. As a result, just under 40% of the cardinal electors will come from Europe, a significant drop from the last papal election in 2013. And far more countries (72) will be represented this time around than then (48). Without polling, endorsements or even any campaigning, how can you handicap a race like this? For insight, I talked with Fr. Patrick Mary Briscoe, the editor of Our Sunday Visitor, a Catholic magazine. (This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.) Kornacki: Pope Francis appointed 80% of the cardinals who are eligible to vote. How much does that shape the process? Briscoe:I think it’s fair to say that Pope Francis has completely reshaped the College of Cardinals, and he’s done so for two reasons. First, because he’s appointed cardinals from what he called the margins or the peripheries. It represents intentional decentralization of the church government, looking to far-flung places to — very intentionally, by his own description — to make a mess, to shake up how things work in Rome. The significance that that will bring to this body can’t be underestimated. The second point is that people on the whole misunderstand what it means that Pope Francis would appoint someone to be a cardinal. It doesn’t mean necessarily that that man is in complete ideological conformity with the pope. Pope Francis is famous for working with people with whom he had substantial disagreement. I think it would be a mistake if you look at the reshaping of the College of Cardinals and interpret it as every member thinking with the mind of Francis. Kornacki: Does that decentralization of power make a surprise outcome more likely? Briscoe:I genuinely think it does, because given the fact that these cardinals are from the far corners of the world, it means that they don’t know each other the same way they would if they were from neighboring countries or if they’re involved daily in the governance of the church, which was often the case. A lot of cardinals based in Rome who handle the day to day running of the church are very familiar with each other. Once you break that body up and expand it into a number of voices who are principally occupied with governing their local churches across the world, you’re going to get a different approach and a different look at what the church needs. Kornacki: Is there a general conservative-liberal fault line when it comes to the direction of the church? Briscoe:I think so, and that’s certainly going to be one of the talking points. One place is with respect to the liturgy. Many Catholics, many bishops even, have been frustrated by Pope Francis’ instruction to restrict the Latin Mass. That is a neuralgic point in the life of the church, and that will certainly be a question: What is the next pope’s approach to traditionalism? Whether or not they’ll want to go in the direction Pope Francis has gone on, that remains to be seen. Another place would be with regard to the discipline of the sacraments. Pope Francis raised a question about the admission of divorced and remarried persons to Holy Communion. I think questions like that are going to be raised and debated. That’s a very live question in the life of the church. Kornacki: How does age factor in? Francis was 76 when he was chosen. Briscoe:I do think age will factor in. I do think, however, that most of the cardinals will be looking for someone who has a demonstrated resume of experience. When Pope Francis appointed bishops, he named lots of pastors — men who have pragmatic experience leading churches. I think it’s reasonable to say there’s a lot of the same spirit in the cardinals he’s appointed. So it’s likely the case that they’ll look for someone who has that kind of experience. Kornacki: Does an American have a chance? Briscoe:I don’t think so, no. The reason for that, I think, is that the United States of America plays too large a role on the global stage and already contributes a great deal to the way the Catholic Church is run. The church in the United States makes a contribution both financially and also culturally. I think that that influence is felt strongly in the church, and while many are grateful for it, they also don’t want that presence to have the power of the papacy.

    "title": "DEI rollbacks hit campus support systems for students of color",
    "article_text": "Campus mentors. Move-in events. Scholarships. Diversity offices that made them feel welcome on predominantly white campuses. As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, students of color say they are starting to lose all of these things and more. The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration’s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools said early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that helped open the door to higher education. “It feels like we’re going back. I don’t know how else to describe it,” said Breeana-Iris Rosario, a junior at the University of Michigan, which is closing its DEI office and scrapping a campus-wide inclusion plan. “It’s like our voices aren’t being heard.” The retreat from DEI has been building for years, driven by Republican-led states that have ordered public colleges to close DEI offices and eliminate programs. But it has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding. Trump’s administration escalated the battle when it suggested in a letter to Harvard University that the school should lose its nonprofit status for defying federal orders, including a demand to eliminate DEI “to the satisfaction of the federal government.” At Michigan, students have been told the casualties include the LEAD Scholars program, a financial aid award for Black, Latino and Native American students, along with orientation events for new Latino, Arab and Asian American students. The university said Tuesday it has not decided whether to eliminate or restructure the orientation programs. Coming from a low-income part of Detroit, Rosario said winning the LEAD scholarship cemented her decision to attend Michigan. She later met some of her best friends at a move-in event for Latino students called Alma. Losing those programs, she fears, could reinforce a sense of isolation among Hispanic students, who make up 6% of the school’s undergraduates. “It would be hard to find my community if I didn’t have access to these resources,” she said. A February memo from the Education Department directed schools and colleges to eliminate race from any decision-making around hiring, admissions, housing, financial aid and student life. It warned violators could lose access to federal money. Dozens of universities have since come under investigation, all while the Trump administration freezes billions of dollars at Harvard and other colleges accused of defying orders on campus antisemitism and transgender athletes. Michigan was among the first to make major DEI rollbacks, and others have followed to avoid federal scrutiny. Others have rebranded DEI offices and scrubbed the term from websites, and others still are standing firm in support of DEI. At Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, officials cited the federal orders when they moved to close the campus DEI office last month. “It is clear we must be in compliance with them to receive the federal funding that is critical to our present and future,” said Eric Kaler, Case’s president, in a campus message. Kaler said the office will be replaced by an Office for Campus Enrichment and Engagement, though it’s unclear what that will entail. The private university receives about $250 million a year in federal research funding, 16% of its total revenue, according to university data. Justen Pippens said the DEI office was like a second home on campus. The junior called it a “stress-free zone” where he could get personal and academic guidance. He grew so close with one staff member that he came to know her as Auntie. He said it’s unclear whether those employees will have jobs at the new office. Case also is halting its Envision Weekend, an orientation event for underrepresented students. Pippens said it’s a setback for him and other Black students, who make up just 6% of undergraduates at Case. “Now,” he said, “we no longer have our central support systems on campus.” In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated when the University of Virginia’s governing board voted to end DEI programs in March. “DEI is done at the University of Virginia,” Youngkin said in a statement, calling it a shift toward “merit-based opportunity.” Tyler English, a senior at UVA, said students have been told scholarships and graduate programs focused on minority students are being scaled back or eliminated. Among other changes, a student group called Men of Color, Honor and Ambition is replacing the word “color” with “character,” he said. “For a portion of us, we now question whether our identities and voices are truly valued in this space,” said English, a member of the campus’ Black Student Alliance. University spokesperson Brian Coy wouldn’t provide details on DEI rollbacks and said he couldn’t confirm changes to scholarships. The government’s anti-DEI campaign is being challenged in court by opponents who say it offers little clarity on exactly which practices are outlawed, leaving schools to weed out anything that could be construed as DEI. As a result of the vague directives, “those who are advocating against this work are getting a higher return on their investment than they should,” said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. Yet opponents are pressing the White House to go further. Christopher Rufo, a conservative strategist who has fought DEI, said the government should root out DEI using tools that forced desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement. “DEI is a violation of the Civil Rights Act,” Rufo said on X. “Any publicly funded institution that continues to practice DEI should face a federal investigation, consent decree, termination of funds, and loss of nonprofit status. If that doesn’t work, send in the 101st Airborne.” In Michigan, the rollbacks are targeting programs that aimed to preserve racial diversity after the state banned affirmative action in 2006, including the LEAD program. University of Michigan officials declined to discuss changes, but a campus message from President Santa Ono said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students. Rosario and other LEAD scholarship winners received an email saying there would be “no adverse financial impact” to their financial aid, with no further explanation. Rosario doesn’t entirely blame the university for the cuts, but she wonders why Michigan moved quickly to make changes while some colleges held firm. The first in her family to attend college, she fears what it means for the next generation of students. “They’ve taken away our sense of community,” she said. “It just makes it that much harder for people of color to feel comfortable pursuing higher education.”",

    "article_text": "Hall of FamefootballplayerShannon Sharpedemanded Tuesday that a 10-minute \"sex tape\" of himself be publicly disclosed, insisting he's the target of a \"shakedown\" by a woman accusing him of rape in a civil lawsuit. Sharpe made the unusual request on Instagram two days after a woman who says she was in an \"exclusive relationship\" with Sharpe accused him of sexual abuseina Nevada lawsuit. Sharpe, a TV analyst and podcaster, lashed out at both the Jane Doe accuser and her attorney,Tony Buzbee, who also represented several female massage therapists whoaccused quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual assault. (Watson has strongly denied the allegations.) \"I believe he's going to release a 30-second clip of a sex tape that tries to make me look guilty and play into every stereotype you could possibly imagine,\" Sharpe said. \"That video should actually be 10 minutes or so. Hey, Tony, instead of releasing your edit, put the whole video out. I don't have it, or I would myself.\" Sharpe and his lawyer have named the woman who filed this lawsuit. NBC News does not name sexual assault accusers unless they voluntarily identify themselves in public. The suit seeks more than $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages. \"The encounter in question took place during the day at her invitation, and now that appears to be a deliberate setup coordinated by\" the plaintiff, Sharpe said. He insists he did nothing wrong. Sharpe pointed out that Buzbee once withdrew alawsuit against Jay-Z. \"This is a shakedown,\" Sharpe said. \"I'm going to be open, transparent and defend myself, because this isn't right. This is all being orchestrated by Tony Buzbee, who has targeted Jay-Z.\" The accuser said Sharpe was prone to angry outbursts and shared an audio recording Tuesday of an argument they had on the phone. In the recording, the accuser tells Sharpe: \"Don't manipulate me.\" He responds, \"If you say that one more time, I'm going to f---ing choke the s--- out of you when I see you.\" An attorney for Sharpe, Lanny Davis, insisted it's clear that Sharpe wasn't being literal. \"I don't have a confirmation from Mr. Sharpe himself or his attorneys about the authenticity of the tape, but we have no reason to dispute this is what Mr. Sharpe said,\" Davis said. \"I do know that it was in the middle of an argument of this particular conversation and that he said it in the heat of the moment and did not mean the words explicitly.” Buzbee said his client will go forward with the lawsuit despite Sharpe's pushback. \"Doxxing and trying to humiliate or discredit Jane Doe won’t deter her from pursuing justice in court,\" he said.",

    "title": "The New York Times didn't libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, jury finds",
    "article_text": "NEW YORK — The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ina 2017 editorial that contained an errorshe claimed had damaged her reputation, a jury concluded Tuesday. The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict. A judge and a different jury had reached the same conclusion about Palin’s defamation claims in 2022, but her lawsuit was revived by an appeals court. Palin was subdued as she left the courthouse and made her way to a waiting car, telling reporters: “I get to go home to a beautiful family of five kids and grandkids and a beautiful property and get on with life. And that’s nice.” Later, she posted on the social platform X that she planned to “keep asking the press to quit making things up.” Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokesperson, said in a statement that the verdict “reaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes.” Palin, who earned a journalism degree in college, sued the Times for unspecified damages in 2017, about a decade after she burst onto the national stage as the Republican vice presidential nominee. Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington. In the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin’s political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs. The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published, saying it had “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting” and that it had “incorrectly described” the map. During the trial, former Times editorial page editor James Bennet tearfully apologized to Palin, saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper. Palin testified Monday that death threats against her increased and her spirits fell after the editorial was published. In his closing argument Tuesday, Palin’s attorney, Kenneth Turkel, had urged the jury to find the Times liable for defamation on the grounds that Bennet either knew what he was publishing was wrong or acted with “reckless disregard” for the truth. He asked the jury to award Palin compensatory damages for the harm done to her reputation and private mental anguish, adding that they should “find a number and let her get some closure to this thing.” “To this day, there’s been no accountability,” he said. “That’s why we’re here.” He told jurors not to be deceived by Palin’s “bouncy” persona on the witness stand. “She doesn’t cry a lot,” Turkel said. “It may have been to them an honest mistake. For her, it was a life changer.” Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney for the Times, told jurors in her closing that there was not “one shred of evidence showing anything other than an honest mistake.” Ellsworth said Bennet and the Times “corrected the record loudly, clearly and quickly” once the error was discovered. The lawyer pointed out that several Times editors testified consistently about the effort to correct the error and the importance they placed on accuracy while Palin’s claims were “supported by nothing other than her say so.” “To Gov. Palin, this is just another opportunity to take on fake news. To James Bennet, the truth matters,” Ellsworth said. In February 2022, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected Palin’s claims in a ruling issued while a jury deliberated. The judge then let jurors deliver their verdict, which also went against Palin. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan restored the case last year. The appeals court said Rakoff’s dismissal ruling improperly intruded on the jury’s work. It also cited flaws in the trial, saying there was erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction and a mistaken response to a question from the jury. Turkel said as he left the courthouse that the legal team will evaluate whether to appeal again. Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida constitutional law professor, told The Associated Press that the verdict Tuesday “was certainly not a sure thing” amid widespread distrust of news media. And, Lidsky added, Palin put the newspaper’s mistake in the public eye. “Even if Sarah Palin didn’t win a jury verdict, she did, by bringing suit, achieve some likely goals,” Lidsky said.",

    "title": "Inside the $1 billion berry startup backed by Ray Dalio's family office",
    "article_text": "Berry unicorn startup Fruitist has surpassed $400 million in annual sales, thanks to the success of its long-lasting jumbo blueberries. The company, which was founded in 2012, announced on Tuesday that it is changing its name from Agrovision to Fruitist. It previously only used the name for branding its consumer products, which also include raspberries, blackberries and blueberries. As sales of its berries grow, Fruitist has raised more than $600 million in venture capital, according to Pitchbook data. Notable backers include the family office of Bridgewater Associates founderRay Dalio. Fruitist is reportedly considering going public as soon as this year, even as global trade conflicts hit stocks and raise fears about a global economic slowdown. The company has tried to set itself apart in a crowded space in part by positioning its berries as “snackable.” The snacking category has been one of the fastest growing in the food industry in recent years. While many consumers still enjoy potato chips and pretzels, many big food companies have expanded their portfolios in recent years to include healthier options. The adoption of GLP-1 drugs and the “Make America Healthy Again” agenda pushed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have made healthier snacking options even more attractive to both consumers and investors. Today, Fruitist’s berries can be found in more than 12,500 North American retailers, includingCostco,WalmartandWhole Foods. Sales of its jumbo blueberries alone have tripled in the last 12 months, fueling the company’s growth. Co-founder and CEO Steve Magami told CNBC that Fruitist was created to solve the problem of “berry roulette.” That’s what he calls the uneven quality of grocery store berries, which he blames on the business model of legacy produce players. “You have a bunch of small growers that send their product to a packer, and the packer sends the product to a distributor or an importer, and then that player is either selling to the retailers or they are sending the product to another distributor to then sell to retailers,” Magami said. “You have this disjointed value chain that stifles quality.” To sell more berries of higher consistent quality, the company grows its fruit in microclimates, with its own farms in Oregon, Morocco, Egypt and Mexico. It also uses machine learning models to predict the best time to pick the fruit. Fruitist invested heavily in infrastructure, like on-site cold storage to keep the berries fresh before they ship. The company’s vertically integrated supply chain means that its berries should last longer than the competition. “I’ve intentionally let them sit in my refrigerator for three weeks, and they’re still great after three weeks,” Magami said. Larger berries, like the company’s non-genetically modified jumbo blueberries that are two to three times the size of a regular blueberry, also have a longer shelf life. Looking ahead, Fruitist is planning to expand into cherries. The company is growing them now on its Chilean farms and plans to start shipping them next season, which means they could land in grocery stores by early 2026. Magami said the company has invested more than $600 million to farm berries year-round and build a global footprint that spans North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. To date, Fruitist has spent little of the funding it has raised on marketing, although that’s set to change. In February, Major League Soccer team D.C. United announced a multiyear deal with the company, including an exclusive sleeve patch partnership. One push for public recognition could come in the form of an initial public offering. In January,Bloomberg reportedthat the company was weighing going public as soon as June. Magami declined to comment on the report to CNBC. If Fruitist decides to go public, it will enter a public market that has yielded mixed results for new stocks in recent years. Produce giantDolereturned to the public marketsin 2021. Shares of the company have risen 14% over the last year, outpacing the S&P 500′s gains of 2% over the same period. Dole, which reported annual revenue of $2.2 billion last year, has a market value of $1.3 billion. However, market turmoil caused by the White House’s trade wars have led a number of companies, like Klarna and StubHub, to delay their plans to go public. But investors are interested in consumer companies with strong growth; shares of Chinese tea chainChagee climbed 15%in the company’s public market debut on Thursday. Trade tensions present other challenges for a global produce company. PresidentDonald Trumphas temporarily lowered new tariff rates on imports from most countries to just 10% until early July, but it’s unclear what could happen after that deadline. India, where Fruitist owns nearly 50 acres to grow blueberries, is facing a 26% duty, for example. Still, Magami said the company is anticipating “minimal impact” from the duties, noting that it has been investing in U.S. production for years. “We’re optimistic about how this will play out,” he said. “We don’t import to compete with the domestic supply, we import to actually provide 52 weeks.” Luckily for Fruitist, the tariff rates are set to rise when domestic berries are in season.",

    "article_text": "By Washington Desk / NPR staff Trump said he does not intend to fire Powell after he has attacked the Federal Reserve Chair for not lowering interest rates.Andrew Harnik/Getty Images North Americahide caption President Trump said Tuesday he had \"no intention\" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, ending days of speculation about the independence of the central bank that had roiled the financial markets. \"I have no intention of firing him,\" Trump said from the Oval Office, though he maintained, \"this is a perfect time to lower interest rates.\" Since last week, Trump has used his social media platform to criticize Powell for, in his view, not lowering interest rates quickly enough — andat one point musedPowell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" The attacks had roiled markets at a time when investors were already on edge about the economic impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Fed has been cautious about lowering rates, in part because of the impact of the tariffs, which would make imported goods more expensive. However, Trump has framed tariffs against U.S. trading partners as a win for the country — and good for American workers and the domestic manufacturing sector. \"We are taking in a lot of money from tariffs,\" Trump said in his remarks Tuesday. President Trump and Powell have had a difficult relationship even though Trump nominated the current Fed chair for that post during his first term in the White House. Trump has frequently criticized the central bank for not keeping interest rates lower, and also expressed a wish to have a say on monetary policy. However, the Fed is designed to operate independently of that kind of political pressure so that it can make the unpopular decisions necessary to fight inflation. Powell has tried to avoid antagonizing the president, but he's also been adamant that he intends to serve out the remainder of his term, which runs through May of next year. Powell insists the president does not have the authority to fire him, except for \"cause,\" meaning some kind of bad behavior. Current Supreme Court precedent supports that view. But the White House has signaled a willingness totest that standard,firing board members of other independent agencies, raising concerns that Trump would try to fire Powell.

    "title": "Judge blocks Trump administration plans to dismantle Voice of America",
    "article_text": "Emily Feng The Voice of America building, June 15, 2020, in Washington.Andrew Harnik/APhide caption A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America, the government funded broadcaster, at least temporarily. It's a dramatic turn in a series of legal cases revolving around the limits of executive power and the strength of the Constitution's protection of free speech. Judge Royce C. Lamberth on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to return Voice of America employees and contractors to their status before a March 14 executive order suspended their work. The order also covers the federally funded nonprofit news outlets Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. It is a preliminary injunction that takes effect while the case plays out in court. Lamberth wrote that the administration's decision to dismantle the agency was\"arbitrary and capricious.\" \"Not only is there an absence of 'reasoned analysis' from the defendants; there is an absence of any analysis whatsoever,\" he wrote. He also said the Trump administration was \"likely in direct violation of numerous federal laws.\" The Trump administration's legal team had argued that it was not violating VOA journalists' First Amendment rights because it has stopped all journalism rather than singling out any individual for their viewpoint. Lamberth said he found that argument \"troubling.\" A request for comment from the Trump administration was not immediately returned. Unions, journalist organizations and democracy advocates hailed the decision. Patsy Widakuswara, the VOA's White House Bureau Chief, and lead plaintiff in the case, said she was grateful for the ruling, but noted that the government was likely to appeal. \"This is not just about our jobs and journalistic freedom — it's for our own national security,\" she said. \"Because every day that VOA is not broadcasting, is a day we cede the global information space and allow adversaries to fill it with disinformation and anti-American propaganda.\" Radio Free Asia President and CEO Bay Fang also struck a cautionary tone and called on the Trump administration to release its funding. \"While we want to resume our operations as they were before, for that to happen we need to receive timely disbursement of our funding on a consistent basis,\" Fang said in a statement. \"Until then RFA unfortunately remains in the same position as last month when we began to furlough our journalists and staff.\" More than a thousand employees and contractors from Voice of America (VOA) and the Office for Cuba Broadcasting were suspended from work on March 15, following a late-night order from the White House to dismantle the federal agency which funds them, U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The White Housecited the moveas part of a broader effort to cut government waste on \"frivolous expenditures that fail to align with American values or address the needs of the American people.\" Since that executive order, VOA offices in Washington have been padlocked shut, its employees put on paid leave but cut off from their work emails, and contractors terminated. It was the first time broadcasts from the 83-year old institution werehalted since it wasfoundedduring World War II to combat propaganda from the Nazi regime. Employees of VOA sued the Trump administration and its advisor Kari Lake, who effectively oversees USAGM. In a court hearing Thursday, the government argued President Trump had not shut down VOA but instead had only temporarily \"paused\" its operations, allowing it to sidestep normal administrative procedures while considering what to do with parent agency USAGM. \"That's a little hard to swallow,\" Judge Lamberth said in response, adding it was a waste of \"1,300 employees while the president tries to make up his mind.\" The targeted networks deliver information to countries around the world that lack a robust or free press. The networks are intended to promote American democratic values by broadcasting news that models independent journalism, incorporates political debate and dissent even inside the U.S. Lawyers representing the media organizations argued the attempt to close the broadcasters was not about reducing federal bloat but was, in fact, a \"censorious\" initiative. Other government-funded international broadcasters are fightingtheir own legal battlesagainst the Trump administration and Lake. The preliminary injunction Lamberth issued on Tuesday does not cover Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Open Technology Fund. The judge cited their current funding status in his memo. Yet in late March, he temporarily barred the Trump administration from shuttering RFE/RL. The news outlet says it received its congressionally-allocated funds through the first half of March after LamberthruledUSAGM could not unilaterallyterminateits grant. However, RFE/RL has still had tofurloughstaff andis askingthe court to force USAGM to pay out the money it needs for the rest of the fiscal year. (Unlike Voice of America, which is owned by the government, RFE/RL is a nonprofit wholly dependent on federal grants.) Lamberth refused to do so on Tuesday, saying it would be premature because RFE/RL and USAGM are negotiating the terms of the grant. He noted, however, that if those talks break down or the Trump administration indefinitely withholds funds that Congress has appropriated, bringing the news outlet to the brink of collapse, he would have good cause to act.

    "title": "Supreme Court leans toward parents who object to LGBTQ books in public schools",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme CourtKayla Bartkowski/Getty Imageshide caption The conservative Supreme Court majority seemed more than ready Tuesday to tell public school districts thatthey must allow parentsto pull their kids out of certain classes because the course material conflicts with the parents' religious views. At the center of the case is the school system in Montgomery County, Md., the most religiously diverse county in the U.S., with 160,000 students of almost all faiths. Beginning a few years ago, the county, which includes a substantial number of gay and lesbian parents, adopted a curriculum for elementary school students. It was aimed at promoting respect for LGBTQ+ parents and their children by including story books with gay and lesbian characters. Some parents, however, objected and asked to opt their children out of elementary school classes where the books were included in the curriculum. The schools initially tried an opt-out plan, but found it was a logistical nightmare. The religious parents then sued the school board. They asserted that by exposing their children to ideas that conflict with the parents' faith, and thus forcing them to withdraw their children from public school, the board was violating the Constitution's guarantee to the free exercise of religion. The school board won in the lower courts but at the Supreme Court Tuesday, the board got little love from the court's six conservative justices. Leading the charge for the religious parents was lawyer Eric Baxter, who got a grilling from the court's three liberal justices. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to one of the books that is objectionable to some parents, a book calledUncle Bobby's Weddingabout a girl who goes to her uncle's same-sex wedding. Sotomayor pressed Baxter on his argument. \"So what you're saying is that the exposure of children to the fact that two people of the same sex are getting married is coercion?\" she asked. Baxter's answer was essentially: Yes. That prompted conservative Justice Samuel Alito to observe that the book has a clear moral message \"that a lot of people who hold on to traditional religious beliefs don't agree with.\" Liberal justice Elena Kagan followed up, asking what rule the court should adopt. Is it your position, Kagan asked, that any time a student confronts something their parents disagree with, they can opt out of a class? Baxter repeatedly declined to say where he would draw the line, prompting Kagan to ask whether \"this is a rule that applies as well to a 16-year-old in biology… [if] the parents say, 'I don't want my child to be there for the classes on evolution or on other biological matters which conflict with my religion?'\" Sotomayor said that she has a whole list of items that conflict with some people's religious views, including \"biographical material about women who have been recognized for achievements outside of their home… divorce, interfaith marriage, or immodest dress.\" Indeed, that kind of a rule, interjected Kagan, would allow \"opt-outs for everyone.\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Baxter on his failure to draw any line. At what point, she asked, is the school district imposing a burden on religious parents? Is it the mere exposure to ideas or something more? And Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether parents should be free to opt their kids out of a class if a gay teacher keeps his wedding photo on his desk. Representing the school board, lawyer Alan Schoenfeld fielded relentless questioning from the court's conservatives. Justices Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch were the most vociferous. Justice Kavanaugh noted that he had been raised in Montgomery County, and though he didn't go to public schools, he pressed lawyer Schoenfeld as to why opt-outs are not feasible. Schoenfeld said that elementary school classrooms are not like a health and sexuality classes, where state law allows a student to opt out from the whole class. In contrast, in grade school, students operate very differently, he said. They can pull books from the shelves, and read them to each other, or ask the teacher about the book. \"It's mayhem,\" said Schoenfeld in a moment of candor. \"And the ability of teachers to manage the line between what is curriculum content coming directly from the teacher and coming indirectly from the sort of socialization in the classroom, I think, is very hard to draw.\" Justice Alito was not satisfied, repeatedly asking Schoenfeld what his answer is to the concerns of the religious parents. \"Basically,\" said Alito, \"your answer is: 'It's just too bad.'\" \"My answer,\" replied Schoenfeld, \"is that… the school board here is democratically elected. The entire process of adopting this curriculum is open and transparent.\" A decision in the case is expected by summer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Inside Harvard's lawsuit against the Trump administration",
    "article_text": "Elissa Nadworny People cross Harvard Yard at Harvard University on April 17, in Cambridge, Mass.Sophie Park/Getty Imageshide caption In an escalation of the back-and-forth between Harvard University and the Trump administration, the school hasfiled a lawsuitagainst the federal government. In it, Harvard argues the government's actions, including freezing more than $2.2 billion in federal funding, violate the First Amendment and don't follow legal procedures. \"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" reads aletter by Alan M. Garber, Harvard's president, announcing the lawsuit. He goes on to detail the type of research the government has \"put in jeopardy,\" including efforts studying child cancer survivors, predicting the spread of infectious disease outbreaks and easing the pain of wounded soldiers. \"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus,\" the lawsuit reads. The Trump administration accuses Harvard of failing to protect Jewish students. After Harvard refused to comply with a list of demands from the administration, the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitismannouncedit was freezing funds. \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end,\" Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\" But Harvard's lawsuit questions how freezing research funds will further the administration's goal of eliminating antisemitism on campus. On Tuesday, nearly 200 higher education leadersreleased a joint statementspeaking out \"against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.\" The letter was organized by the American Association of Colleges and Universities and signed by presidents and administrators at colleges across the U.S., including at large public research universities and small private colleges. Dr. Donald Ingber leads scientific and engineering teams at a Harvard University lab, building small devices that replicate the functions and responses of living organs. Hetold NPR's Ailsa Changhis team uses those devices to \"study how the human lung, intestine, bone marrow and lymph node respond to radiation,\" and also \"to identify drugs that can mitigate the effects of radiation.\" But last week, Ingber's lab at Harvard, the Wyss Institute, received a stop work order on three federal contracts it was working on, worth more than $20 million. \"The experiments have to stop,\" Ingber said. \"We basically have to bring it to a halt unless we can find other funding. We're in the damage assessment phase.\" Ingber's research could be helpful for people undergoing cancer treatments and even astronauts who encounter radiation during space travel. \"You're never going to get to Mars … unless you figure out how to protect astronauts against radiation toxicity,\" Ingber said. \"But it also would be there to protect against nuclear reactor disasters… We're at a time where the government wants to build nuclear plants all over the country.\" His focus now is on salvaging research and data that, in some cases, took months to collect. He's also looking for alternative funding so he doesn't have to fire his staff, \"all young people who are passionate, working day and night,\" he said. The order to stop work in Ingber's lab came on the same day the Trump administrationfroze more than $2.2 billionmulti-year grants and contracts after the university rejected demands that it change hiring, admissions and other policies in response to allegations of antisemitism. \"I honestly don't understand why they targeted us,\" said Ingber, \"because this work is totally unrelated to anything that you can imagine related to wokeness or antisemitism.\" The Wyss Institute is part of Harvard, but it's also a separate nonprofit organization, with all of its direct costs and indirect costs going 100% to research and technology development, according to Ingber. That confusion over the connection between antisemitism and the research being shut down is one element in the university's legal case against the federal government. \"The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,\" Harvard's complaint says. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts and aims to block the Trump administration from withholding federal funding \"as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard.\" The suit also makes the argument that the government is violating the First Amendment, which they argue, \"does not permit the Government to 'interfere with private actors' speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.' \" In addition, the suit claims the government did not follow procedures, established by Congress, for \"revoking federal funding based on discrimination concerns.\" Since the funding freeze early last week, President Trump has also threatened to revoke the university's tax-exempt status, a move that would be rare,though not unprecedented.

    "title": "Hegseth is in hot water again over sharing attack plans. But this time it may be worse",
    "article_text": "By Quil Lawrence , Tom Bowman Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and his wife, Jennifer, attend the White House Easter Egg Roll on April 21.Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imageshide caption Embattled Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pushed back Tuesday on thelatest revelations that he shared military attack planson his private phone with his wife, brother and personal lawyer. \"If you remember… I said no one is texting war plans,\" Hegseth said onFox and Friends. \"What was shared over Signal then [during the first leak,which surfaced last month] and now was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination [and] other things.\" But the details he shared, two hours before airstrikes hit in Yemen, almost certainly were classified, according to retired Marine Lt. Col. Mick Wagoner, who was a military lawyer for 17 years and deployed to four war zones. \"A launch of an attack there is just no-way, no-how, that an American military operation starting off is going to not be classified for Lord's sake,\" he said. And Hegseth's defense also tacitly confirms that he shared those details with people, like his wife, he knew were not authorized to have the information. According to a U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly, after CENTCOM commander General Erik Kurilla sent Hegseth details over secure communications about impending military operations on March 15th, Hegseth shared that information, verbatim, with two separate chat groups on Signal. One was made up oftop Trump administration officials— and inadvertently included journalist Jeffrey Goldberg. But the other chat group included people with no clear reason for receiving the sensitive information. \"The last time he was wrongly using an insecure communications device, and he mistakenly thought he was speaking only to security clearance holders,\" said Kevin Carroll, who served 30 years in the Army, then in the CIA and then the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration. Security breaches like what happened in the Signal group chat are called \"spillage\" by the military, but this is more, says Carroll. \"Here he's knowingly using an insecure communication device and he's knowingly giving classified information to people who are not security clearance holders so it's really more than a spill,\" Carroll said. \"It really gets more to the sort of willfulness that is typically prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\" Even the man President Trump picked as his top military official, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, seemed to struggle with Hegseth's use of the first Signal group at his confirmation hearing. \"We all can agree that we need to always protect the element of surprise,\" Caine said when asked repeatedly about leaking attack plans in advance. When asked directly what he would have done if he found himself on an unclassified platform where tactical information was being discussed, he said, \"I would weigh in and stop it if I was a part of it, but in this case I wasn't.\" Military officers who have sent battlefield assessments that were several years old have lost their jobs for passing the information over an unsecured channel, Carroll, the Army lawyer who served in the first Trump administration, said. He defended ajunior Marine Corps officerin court who sent urgent, potentially lifesaving information to fellow officers in Afghanistan from a nonclassified email server and was relieved of duty. Carroll says, for troops, seeing leadership share attack plans in advance on Signal but so far suffer no consequences is toxic to morale. But that double standard is so common, he adds, that there's a phrase for it in the military: \"different spanks for different ranks.\" Carroll points out examples from both political parties where senior officials' mishandling of classified information went mostly unpunished:Hillary Clinton,Sandy Berger,President Joe Biden;Richard Armitage, former Vice PresidentMike Pence, and of courseTrump. But several current and former military prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed there is no precedent for a secretary of defense willfully divulging operational plans against a hostile military force in real time. The repercussions for Hegseth remain unclear. Democrats and at least one Republican lawmaker have called for his resignation in the wake of the news. NPR haspreviously reportedthat the White House has begun the process of looking for a new leader at the Pentagon to replace Pete Hegseth, though Trump has said publicly that he stands by his secretary of defense, and the White House has strenuously denied those reports. Both Trump and Hegseth have blamed \"disgruntled former staff\" for revealing the existence of the second Signal chat group. They appear to be referring to four senior advisers who left the Pentagon abruptly last week. Former Defense Department spokesperson John Ullyot resigned and then published anopinion piececalling the past month at the Pentagon a \"full-blown meltdown\" of infighting. Three other Pentagon advisers — Colin Carroll, Dan Caldwell, and Darin Selnick — were escorted out of the Pentagon and accused of leaking information to the press. They put out ajoint statementon X saying they have not even been told what they're accused of leaking. Caldwell and Selnik are longtime associates of Hegseth's who worked with him at Concerned Veterans for America, a right-leaning policy group. In response to charges that the three men leaked information to the media, Selnick told NPR, \"We are discussing next steps.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Michele Kelemen Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaks at the State Department in Washington, April 1 2025.Jacquelyn Martin/APhide caption Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he is streamlining what he's calling a'bloated'bureaucracy. He's cutting about 700 positions and 132 offices at the State Department. In an Substack post explaining some of his changes, Rubio takes aim at the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, writing that it \"became a platform for left-wing activists to wage vendettas against 'anti-woke' leaders in nations such as Poland, Hungary and Brazil, and to transform their hatred of Israel into concrete policies such as arms embargoes.\" He is putting that office, required by Congress, under the control of the Coordinator for Foreign Assistance and abolished the Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Human Rights and Democracy, which used to oversee several offices now being closed. One example is the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, set up after the Bush administration's war in Iraq. The Department is planning to cut about 15 percent of its personnel, though State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce says \"no one is going to be walking out of the building\" today. Reduction in Forces (RIF) notices will go out later, according to State Department officials briefed on the plan. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, Senator Jeanne Shaheen says reforms must be done with care.She warnsthat when \"America retreats – as it has under President Trump – China and Russia fill the void.\" The Trump administration has notified Congress about the reorganization plan. Democratic lawmakers have been clamoring for a briefing by Rubio, following the dismantlement of the US Agency for International Development. The remnants of USAID will be folded into the State Department, with more oversight from regional bureaus, according to Rubio's aides. The plan does not address the State Department's overseas footprint, though some proposals seen by NPR have suggested there could be cuts of two dozen consulates and embassies.

    "title": "Jury finds 'The New York Times' did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin leaves Manhattan federal court on Tuesday in New York. A jury has concludedThe New York Timesdid not libel Palin in a 2017 editorial that contained an error that she says damaged her reputation.Larry Neumeister/APhide caption NEW YORK —The New York Timesdid not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in a 2017 editorial that contained an error she claimed had damaged her reputation, a jury concluded Tuesday. The jury deliberated a little over two hours before reaching its verdict. A judge and a different jury had reached the same conclusion about Palin's defamation claims in 2022, but her lawsuit was revived by an appeals court. Palin was subdued as she left the courthouse and made her way to a waiting car, telling reporters: \"I get to go home to a beautiful family of five kids and grandkids and a beautiful property and get on with life. And that's nice.\" Later, she posted on the social platform X that she planned to \"keep asking the press to quit making things up.\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, aTimesspokesperson, said in a statement that the verdict \"reaffirms an important tenet of American law: publishers are not liable for honest mistakes.\" Palin, who earned a journalism degree in college, sued theTimesfor unspecified damages in 2017, about a decade after she burst onto the national stage as the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington. In the editorial, theTimeswrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin's political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs. TheTimescorrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published, saying it had \"incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting\" and that it had \"incorrectly described\" the map. During the trial, formerTimeseditorial page editor James Bennet tearfully apologized to Palin, saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper. Palin testified Monday that death threats against her increased and her spirits fell after the editorial was published. In his closing argument Tuesday, Palin's attorney, Kenneth Turkel, had urged the jury to find theTimesliable for defamation on the grounds that Bennet either knew what he was publishing was wrong or acted with \"reckless disregard\" for the truth. He asked the jury to award Palin compensatory damages for the harm done to her reputation and private mental anguish, adding that they should \"find a number and let her get some closure to this thing.\" \"To this day, there been no accountability,\" he said. \"That's why we're here.\" He told jurors not to be deceived by Palin's \"bouncy\" persona on the witness stand. \"She doesn't cry a lot,\" Turkel said. \"It may have been to them an honest mistake. For her, it was a life changer.\" Felicia Ellsworth, an attorney for theTimes, told jurors in her closing that there was not \"one shred of evidence showing anything other than an honest mistake.\" Ellsworth said Bennet and theTimes\"corrected the record loudly, clearly and quickly\" once the error was discovered. The lawyer pointed out that severalTimeseditors testified consistently about the effort to correct the error and the importance they placed on accuracy while Palin's claims were \"supported by nothing other than her say so.\" \"To Gov. Palin, this is just another opportunity to take on fake news. To James Bennet, the truth matters,\" Ellsworth said. In February 2022, Judge Jed S. Rakoff rejected Palin's claims in a ruling issued while a jury deliberated. The judge then let jurors deliver their verdict, which also went against Palin. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan restored the case last year. The appeals court said Rakoff's dismissal ruling improperly intruded on the jury's work. It also cited flaws in the trial, saying there was erroneous exclusion of evidence, an inaccurate jury instruction and a mistaken response to a question from the jury. Turkel said as he left the courthouse that the legal team will evaluate whether to appeal again. Lyrissa Lidsky, a University of Florida constitutional law professor, told The Associated Press that the verdict Tuesday \"was certainly not a sure thing\" amid widespread distrust of news media. And, Lidsky added, Palin put the newspaper's mistake in the public eye. \"Even if Sarah Palin didn't win a jury verdict, she did, by bringing suit, achieve some likely goals,\" Lidsky said.

    "title": "Universities (finally) band together, fight “unprecedented government overreach”",
    "article_text": "New statement is weak—but a start. Last Friday, in anop-ed piece on the Trump administration's war on American universities, we called for academia to 1) band together and 2) resist coercive control over hiring and teaching, though we noted that the 3) \"temperamental caution of university administrators\" means that they might \"have trouble finding a clear voice to speak with when they come under thundering public attacks from a government they are more used to thinking of as a funding source.\" It only took billions of dollars in vindictive cuts to make it happen, but higher education has finally 1) banded together to 2) resist coercive control over its core functions. More than 230 leaders, mostly college and university presidents, have so farsigned an American Association of Colleges and Universities statementthat makes athundering callgentle bleat fortotal resistance\"constructive engagement\" with the people currently trying to cripple, shutter, and/or dominate them. Clearly, 3) temperamental caution remains the watchword. Still, progress! (Even Columbia University, which has already capitulated to Trump administration pressure, signed on.) The statement largely consists of painful pablum about how universities \"provide human resources to meet the fast-changing demands of our dynamic workforce,\" etc, etc. As a public service, I will save you some time (and nausea) by excerpting the bits that matter: We speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education... We must reject the coercive use of public research funding... American institutions of higher learning have in common the essential freedom to determine, on academic grounds, whom to admit and what is taught, how, and by whom... In their pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation. This is fine, as far as it goes. But what are all these institutions going todoabout the funding cuts, attempts to revoke their nonprofit status, threats not to hire their graduates, and student speech-based deportations? They are going to ask the Trump administration for \"constructive engagement that improves our institutions and serves our republic.\" This sounds lovely, if naive, and I hope it works out well for every one of them as they seek good-faith dialogue with a vice president who has called universities the \"enemy\" and an administration that demanded Harvardsubmit to the vetting of every department for unspecified \"viewpoint diversity.\" As a first step to finding common ground and speaking with a common voice, the statement is a start. But statements, like all words, can be cheap. We'll see what steps schools actually take—and how much they can speak and act in concert—as Trump's pressure campaign continues to ratchet.

    "title": "Drunk man walks into climate change, burns the bottoms of his feet off",
    "article_text": "Climate change is a danger to health in a wide variety of ways. Climate tipping points pose grave risks to human health—and, unsurprisingly, approaching them while tipsy only makes the fallout more blistering, according toa case study in the New England Journal of Medicine. In this week's issue, NEJM spotlights the effects of the climate crisis on clinical health with a series of case studies. One is the searing story of an inebriated gentleman who regrettably took a one-minute walk while barefoot during theunprecedented 2021 Northwest heat dome. The man walked across asphalt during the extreme weather, in which air temperatures reached as high as 42° C (108° F). That's about 21° C (38° F) above historical averages for the area. Asphalt can absorb95 percent of solar radiationand easily reach 40° F to 60° F above air temperatures on hot days. It's unclear how hot the asphalt was when the man walked across it, but it was clearly hot enough to melt some flesh. The 56-year-old man arrived at a burn center with red oozing burns on the soles of both his feet and the heel of his left foot. The heel of his right foot was blistered, but not oozing (graphic imagehere). The toes on his right foot were also burned to various degrees. He was in severe pain. The burns were classified as second-degree, meaning they affected both the outer and middle layers of skin.The most severe level of burnis third-degree, which affects deep layers of skin, sometimes called full-thickness burns. In the burn unit, doctors gave the man a pain reliever, cleaned the burns, treated them with a topical antibiotic, and gave them an antimicrobial foam dressing. At a follow-up appointment, the wounds appeared to be healing without complications. While the man recovered from the injury, the author of the case study—Jeremy Hess, an expert in emergency medicine and global environmental health at the University of Washington—warned that the risk of such injuries will only grow as climate change continues. \"Extreme heat events increase the risk of contact burns from hot surfaces in the environment,\" he wrote. \"Young children, older adults, unhoused persons, and persons with substance use disorder are at elevated risk for these types of burns.\" Last year, The New York Times reported thatburn centers in the southwest have already begun seeing larger numbers of burnsfrom contact with sidewalks and asphalt during heat waves. In some cases, the burns can turn fatal if people lose consciousness on hot surfaces—for instance, from overdoses, heat stroke, intoxication, or other health conditions. \"Your body just literally sits there and cooks,\" Clifford Sheckter, surgeon and a burn prevention researcher at Stanford University, told the Times last year. \"When somebody finally finds you, you’re already in multisystem organ failure.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "OpenAI wants to buy Chrome and make it an “AI-first” experience",
    "article_text": "OpenAI would love to own Chrome, and it's allegedly not alone. The remedy phase of Google's antitrust trial is underway, with the government angling to realign Google's business after the company wasruled a search monopolist. The Department of Justice is seeking a plethora of penalties, but perhaps none as severe asforcing Google to sell Chrome. But who would buy it? An OpenAI executive says his employer would be interested. Among the DOJ's witnesses on the second day of the trial was Nick Turley, head of product for ChatGPT at OpenAI. He wasn't there to talk about Chrome exclusively—the government's proposed remedies also include forcing Google to share its search index with competitors. OpenAI is in bed with Microsoft, but Bing's search data wasn't cutting it, Turley suggested (without naming Microsoft). \"We believe having multiple partners, and in particular Google's API, would enable us to provide a better product to users,\" OpenAI told Google in an email revealed at trial. However, Google turned OpenAI down because it believed the deal would harm its lead in search. The companies have no ongoing partnership today, but Turley noted that forcing Google to license its search data would restore competition. And then there's Chrome. While Judge Amit Mehta has expressed some skepticism about the DOJ's proposal to divest Chrome, the government claims the browser is core to Google's anticompetitive conduct. Further, the DOJ team believes that selling Chrome would level the online playing field, but it has not been clear who would buy the browser. According to Turley, OpenAI would throw its proverbial hat in the ring if Google had to sell. When asked if OpenAI would want Chrome, he was unequivocal. \"Yes, we would, as would many other parties,\"Turley said. OpenAI has reportedly considered building its own Chromium-based browser to compete with Chrome. Several months ago, the company hired former Google developers Ben Goodger and Darin Fisher, both of whom worked to bring Chrome to market. Credit:\n\n          \n          Getty Images It's not hard to see why OpenAI might want a browser, particularly Chrome with its 4 billion users and 67 percent market share. Chrome would instantly give OpenAI a massive install base of users who have been incentivized to use Google services. If OpenAI were running the show, you can bet ChatGPT would be integrated throughout the experience—Turley said as much, predicting an \"AI-first\" experience. The user data flowing to the owner of Chrome could also be invaluable in trainingagentic AI modelsthat can operate browsers on the user's behalf. Interestingly, there's so much discussion about who should buy Chrome, but relatively little about spinning off Chrome into an independent company. Google has contended that Chrome can't survive on its own. However, the existence of Google's multibillion-dollar search placement deals, which the DOJ wants to end, suggests otherwise. Regardless, if Google has to sell, and OpenAI has the cash, we might get the proposed \"AI-first\" browsing experience.

    "title": "Google won’t ditch third-party cookies in Chrome after all",
    "article_text": "Google drops plans for a one-click prompt to disable tracking cookies. Google has made an unusual announcement about browser cookies, but it may not come as much of a surprise given recent events. After years spent tinkering with the Privacy Sandbox, Google has essentially called it quits. According to Anthony Chavez, VP of the company'sPrivacy Sandbox initiative, Google won't be rolling out a planned feature to help users disable third-party cookies. Instead, cookie support will remain in place as is, possibly forever. Beginning in 2019, Google embarked on an effort under the Privacy Sandbox banner aimed at developing a new way to target ads that could preserve a modicum of user privacy. This approach included doing away with third-party cookies, small snippets of code that advertisers use to follow users around the web. Google struggled to find a solution that pleased everyone. Its initial proposal for FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) waswidely deridedas hardly any better than cookies. Google thenmoved on to the Topics API, but the company's plans to kill cookies have been delayed repeatedly since 2022. Until today, Google was still planning to roll out a dialog in Chrome that would prompt users to turn off third-party cookies in favor of Google's updated solution.According to Chavez, Google has been heartened to see the advertising industry taking privacy more seriously. As a result, Google won't be pushing that cookie dialog to users. You can still choose to disable third-party cookies in Chrome, though. While Google's sandbox project is looking more directionless today, it is not completely ending the initiative. The team still plans to deploy promised improvements in Chrome's Incognito Mode, which has been re-architected topreserve user privacyafternumerous complaints. Incognito Mode blocks all third-party cookies, and later this year, it will gain IP protection, which masks a user's IP address to protect against cross-site tracking. Chavez admits that this change will mean Google's Privacy Sandbox APIs will have a \"different role to play\" in the market. That's a kind way to put it. Google will continue developing these tools and will work with industry partners to find a path forward in the coming months. The company still hopes to see adoption of the Privacy Sandbox increase, but the industry is unlikely to give up on cookies voluntarily. While Google focuses on how ad privacy has improved since it began working on the Privacy Sandbox, the changes in Google's legal exposure are probably more relevant. Since launching the program, Google has lost three antitrust cases, two of which are relevant here: the search casecurrently in the remedy phaseand the newly decidedad tech case. As the government begins arguing that Chrome gives Google too much power, it would be a bad look to force a realignment of the advertising industry using the dominance of Chrome. In some ways, this is a loss—tracking cookies are undeniably terrible, and Google's proposed alternative is better for privacy, at least on paper. However, universal adoption of the Privacy Sandbox could also give Google more power than it already has, and the supposed privacy advantages may never have fully materialized as Google continues to seek higher revenue.

    "title": "Taxes and fees not included: T-Mobile’s latest price lock is nearly meaningless",
    "article_text": "T-Mobile makes 5-year price guarantee after refusing to honor lifetime price lock. T-Mobile is making another long-term price guarantee, but wireless users will rightfully be skeptical since T-Mobile refused to honor a previously offered lifetime price lock and continues to fight a lawsuit filed by customers who were harmed by that broken promise. Moreover, the new plans that come with a price guarantee will have extra fees that can be raised at any time. T-Mobile todayannouncednew plans with more hotspot data and a five-year price guarantee, saying that \"T-Mobile and Metro customers can rest assured that the price of their talk, text and data stays the same for five whole years, from the time they sign up.\" The promise applies to the T-Mobile \"Experience More\" and \"Experience Beyond\" plans that will be offered starting tomorrow. The plans cost $85 or $100 for a single line after the autopay discount, which requires a debit card or bank account. The price-lock promise also applies tofour new Metro by T-Mobile plansthat launch on Thursday. T-Mobile's announcement came three weeks after Verizonannounceda three-year price lock. If the promise sounds familiar, it's because T-Mobile made lifetime price guarantees in 2015 and 2017. \"Now, T-Mobile One customers keep their price until THEY decide to change it. T-Mobile will never change the price you pay for your T-Mobile One plan,\" T-Mobilesaid in January 2017. When a similar promise was made in 2015, then-CEO John Legeresaidthat \"the Un-contract is our promise to individuals, families and businesses of all sizes, that—while your price may go down—it won't go up.\" T-Mobile raised prices on the supposedly price-locked plansabout a year ago, triggering aflood of complaintsto the Federal Communications Commission anda class action lawsuit. There were also complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces laws against false advertising. But so far, T-Mobile hasn't faced any punishment. Besides the five-year price guarantee, there's at least one more notable pricing detail. T-Mobile's previous plans had \"taxes and fees included,\" meaning the advertised price was inclusive of taxes and fees. With the new Experience plans, taxes and fees will be in addition to the advertised price. This will make the plans cost more initially than customers might expect, and it gives T-Mobile wiggle room to raise prices during the five years of the price guarantee since it could increase any fees that are tacked onto the new plans. The fine print in today's press release describes taxes and fees as \"exclusions\" to the price guarantee. \"Fees\" can refer to virtually anything that a carrier chooses to add to a bill and isn't limited to the carrier's actual costs from taxes or government mandates. For example, T-Mobile has a \"Regulatory Programs and Telco Recovery Fee,\" which it acknowledges \"is not a government tax or imposed by the government; rather, the fee is collected and retained by T-Mobile to help recover certain costs we have already incurred and continue to incur.\" This can include the cost of complying with legal obligations, \"charges imposed on us by other carriers for delivery of calls,\" and the cost of leasing network facilities that are needed to provide service, T-Mobile says. In other words, T-Mobile charges a separate fee to cover the normal expenses incurred by any provider of telecommunications services. The promise is thus that the base price of a service plan won't change, but T-Mobile gives itself wide discretion to add or increase fees on customers' monthly bills. \"Guarantee means that we won't change the price of talk, text, and 5G smartphone data on our network for at least 5 years while you are on an Experience plan,\" T-Mobile said today. T-Mobile'sterms and conditionshaven't been updated, but the terms address price promises in general, saying that price locks do not include \"add-on features, taxes, surcharges, fees, or charges for extra Features or Devices.\" T-Mobile Consumer Group President Jon Freier, who has been with T-Mobile for about two decades, seemed to recognize in aninterview with Fiercethat customers are likely to be wary of new promises. \"One of the things that we've heard from customers is that the more definition that we can put in terms of timing around the guarantee, the more believable and useful that guarantee is,\" he said. \"So we chose to roll out with five years.\" Freier asserted that \"we are absolutely signing up for the guarantee for the next five years.\" Freier even mentioned the 2015 guarantee in avideoannouncement today, saying that T-Mobile is now \"evolving this promise and expanding it across our portfolio.\" There is a better chance that T-Mobile will keep the latest promise, since it is limited in scope and lasts only five years, while the lifetime price lock was supposed to last for as long as customers chose to keep their plans. The lifetime price lock did last for more than five years, after all. But T-Mobile has shown that when it breaks a promise, it is willing to accept the public backlash and fight users in court. A class action lawsuit over the nullified lifetime price lock isstill pendingin US District Court for the District of New Jersey. T-Mobile is trying to force plaintiffs into arbitration, and the sides are proceeding with discovery on the matter of whether the named plaintiffs \"executed valid opt-outs of Defendant's arbitration agreement.\" Ajoint status updatein March said that T-Mobile refused to produce all the documents that plaintiffs requested, arguing that the \"burden of collecting these documents far outweighs their potential relevance to the allowed scope of discovery.\" T-Mobile tried to give itself a way out when it introduced the 2017 lifetime price lock. Although a press release issued then made the promise sound absolute, a separate FAQ essentially nullified the promise by saying that T-Mobile was only promising to pay a customer's final bill \"if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave.\" Customers who tried to hold T-Mobile to the lifetime price promise were not mollified by that carveout, given that it was published on an entirely separate page and not part of the price-lock announcement. While customers may find it difficult to fully trust T-Mobile's new guarantee, they can at least take a look at the carveouts to get a sense of how solid the new pledge is. We already noted the taxes and fees caveat, which seems to be the biggest thing to watch out for. This category on its own makes it easy for T-Mobile to raise your bill without technically breaking its promise not to raise the price of \"talk, text and data.\" The new plans are not yet live onT-Mobile's website, so it's possible a more detailed breakdown of caveats could be revealed tomorrow when the plans are available. Thewebsitefor T-Mobile's separate Metro brand has a slightly more detailed description than the one in the press release. While details could differ between the main T-Mobile brand and Metro, the Metro page says: 5-year guarantee means we won't change the price of talk, text, and 5G smartphone data on our network for at least 5 years while you are on an eligible plan. Guarantee also applies to price for data on wearable/tablet/mobile Internet lines added to your plan. Your guarantee starts when you activate or switch to an eligible plan and doesn't restart if you add a line or change plans after that. Per-use charges, plan add-ons, third-party services, and network management practices aren't included. As you might expect, wireless users commenting on theT-Mobile subredditwere not impressed by the price promise. \"Price guarantee is worthless based on T-Mobile's previous actions. They might as well save the ink/electrons,\" one user wrote. Many users remarked on the removal of \"taxes and fees included,\" and the specific end date for the price lock that applies only to the base price. \"This is them saying we are sorry we screwed consumers,\" one person wrote. \"Now we will be more transparent aboutwhen in the futurewe will increase your rates.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Harvard sues to block government funding cuts",
    "article_text": "Suit claims the funding freeze violates First Amendment, Title VI procedures. On Monday, Harvard Universityfiled a lawsuitthat it hopes will end the federal government's hold on over $2 billion of research funds destined for the university's faculty. The suit claims that the government's demands for input on Harvard's hiring and admissions violate the university's First Amendment rights, and that the funding freeze hasn't followed the procedures laid out in federal law. Earlier in April, the government sent a letter to Harvard demanding various changes, from altering university governance to enforcing a completely undefined \"viewpoint diversity\" on hiring and admissions. Failing to agree, the government suggested, would place the financial relationship between the government and Harvard at risk. Harvard responded with a strongly worded refusal and, by the end of the day, saw the government put over $2 billion in research funding on hold. Harvard was not told how long the hold would last or what exactly was needed to lift it. The lawsuit seeks to reverse the hold. Harvard argues that there are two reasons the court should restore the flow of research money. The first reason is based on First Amendment grounds. Harvard's suit claims that \"the Government wielded the threat of withholding federal funds in an attempt to coerce Harvard to conform with the government’s preferred mix of viewpoints and ideologies.\" Which appears to be less of an accusation than a summary of the government's letter to Harvard. The suit goes on to establish, via quotes from earlier legal decisions, that courts have considered academic freedom to fall within the remit of the First Amendment. It claims that \"Restrictions on Harvard’s ability to manage its own internal leadership likewise violate the First Amendment because leadership decisions shape how the University speaks and acts.\" The suit also claims that the funding hold, made in retaliation for Harvard's letter announcing its refusal to accept these conditions, punishes Harvard for exercising free speech. Separately, the lawsuit focuses on Title VI, part of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits the government from funding organizations that engage in racial discrimination. It's Harvard's alleged tolerance for antisemitism that would enable the government to put a hold on these funds. But the suit spells out the requirements for cutting funding—hearings, a 30-day waiting period, notification of Congress—that the law requires before funding can be cut. And, quite obviously, the government has done none of them. Harvard also alleges that the government's decision to hold research funds is arbitrary and capricious: \"The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen.\" Finally, the court is asked to consider an issue that's central to a lot of the questions regarding Trump Administration actions: Can the executive branch stop the flow of money that was allocated by Congress? \"Defendants do not have any inherent authority to terminate or freeze appropriated federal funding,\" the suit claims. The suit seeks various remedies. It wants the government's actions declared illegal, the freeze order vacated, and prohibitions put in place that will prevent the government from accomplishing the freeze through some other means. Harvard would also like any further reactions to allegations of antisemitism to follow the procedures mandated by Title VI and to have the government cover its attorney's fees. It also wants the ruling expedited, given the potential for damage to university-hosted research. The suit was filed in the District of Massachusetts, which is the same venue that has been usedfor other suitsseeking to restrain the Trump administration's attack on federally funded research. So far, those have resulted in rapid responses and injunctions that have put damaging funding cuts on hold. So, there's a good chance we'll see something similar here.

    "title": "Man buys racetrack, ends up launching the Netflix of grassroots motorsports",
    "article_text": "FRDM+ is profitable, has its own smart TV apps. Subscriptions start at $20/month. In 2019, Garrett Mitchell was already an Internet success. His YouTube channel,Cleetus McFarland, hadover a million followers. If you perused the channel at that time, you would’ve found a range of grassroots motorsports videos with the type of vehicular shenanigans that earn truckloads of views. Some of those older videos include \"BLEW BY A COP AT 120+mph! OOPS!,\" \"THERE'S A T-REX ON THE TRACK!,\" and \"Manual Transmission With Paddle Shifters!?!.\" Those videos made Mitchell, aka Cleetus McFarland, a known personality among automotive enthusiasts. But the YouTuber wanted more financial independence beyond the Google platform and firms willing to sponsor his channel. “… after my YouTube was growing and some of my antics [were] getting videos de-monetized, I realized I needed a playground,” Mitchell told Ars Technica in an email. Mitchell found a road toward new monetization opportunities through the DeSoto Super Speedway. The Bradenton, Florida, track hadchanged ownership multiple timessince opening in the 1970s. The oval-shaped racetrack is three-eighths of a mile long with 12-degree banking angles. By 2018, the track hadclosed its doorsand was going unused. DeSoto happened to be next to Mitchell’s favorite drag strip, giving the YouTuber the idea of turning it into a stadium where people could watchburnoutsand other “massive, rowdy” ticketed events. Mitchell added: So I sold everything I could, borrowed some money from my business manager, and went all in for [$]2.2 million. But like the rest of the world, Mitchell hit the brakes on his 2020 plans during COVID-19 lockdowns. Soon after his purchase, Mitchell couldn't use the track, renamedFreedom Factory, for large gatherings, forcing him to reconsider his plans. “We had no other option but to entertain the people somehow. And with no other racing goin’ on anywhere, we bet big on making something happen. And it worked,\" Mitchell said. That “something” was apay-per-view (PPV) eventhosted from the Freedom Factory in April 2020. The event led to others and, eventually, Mitchell running his own subscription video on demand (SVOD) service,FRDM+, which originally launched as Cleetervision in 2022. Today, a FRDM+ subscription costs $20 per month or $120 per year. A subscription provides access to an impressive library of automotive videos. Some are archived from Mitchell’s YouTube channel. Other, exclusive videos feature content such as interviews with motorsports influencers and members of Mitchell’s staff and crew, and outrageous motorsports stunts. You can watch videos from other influencers on FRDM+, and the business can also white-label its platform into other influencers’ websites, too. Before Mitchell could host his first PPV event, he had to prepare the speedway. Explaining the ordeal to Ars, he wrote: We cleaned that place up best we could, but let’s be real, it was rough. Lights were out, weeds poppin’ up through the asphalt, the whole deal. Pulling off the first PPV event at the Freedom Factory speedway was a \"race against time,\" Jonny Mill, who built FRDM+’s tech stack and serves as company president, told Ars. \"Florida implemented a statewide shutdown on the very day of our event,” he said. Mitchell also struggled to get the right workers and equipment needed for the PPV. Flights weren’t available due to the pandemic, forcing Mill to produce the event from California using a cell phone group chat and “last-minute local crew,” per Mitchell. The ENG camera person was much shorter than Mitchell \"and had to climb on whatever she could just to keep me in frame,” he recalled. Mitchell said Freedom Factory's first PPV event had 75,000 concurrent viewers, which caused his website and those of the event sponsors to crash. “Our initial bandwidth provider laughed at our viewership projections, and, of course, we surpassed them in the first week of pre-sales,\" Mill said. \"They did apologize before asking for a much larger check.\" Other early obstacles included determining how to embed the livestream platform into Mitchell’s e-commerce site. The biggest challenge there was “juggling two separate logins, one for merch shopping and another for livestream PPV, all within the same site,” Mill explained. “Now, our focus is on seamlessly guiding the YouTube audience over to FRDM+ for premium live events,\" he added. Live events are still the heart of FRDM+. The service had 21 livestreamed events scheduled throughout 2025, and more are expected to come. Today, bandwidth isn’t a problem for FRDM+, and navigating the streaming service doesn’t feel much different from something like Netflix. There are different “channels” (grouped together by related content or ongoing series) on top and new releases and upcoming content highlighted below. There are horizontal scrolling rows, and many titles have content summaries and/or trailers. The platform also has a support section with instructions for canceling subscriptions. Like with other SVOD services, subscribers can watch FRDM+ via a web browser or through a smart TV app. FRDM+ currently has apps forApple TV,Fire OS, andRoku OS. Mitchell said the team’s constantly working on more connected TV apps, as well as adding features, “more interactivity,” and customers.To keep the wheels spinning, FRDM+ leverages a diverse range of technologies, Mill explained: At the core of our infrastructure, AWS bandwidth servers handle the heavy lifting, while Accedo powers the connected TV apps, bridging the gap between our tech stack and the audience. Brightcove serves as our primary video player partner, with additional backup systems in place to maintain reliability. For a service like this, with live events, redundancy is critical, Mill said. “At the Freedom Factory, we even beam air fiber from a house five miles away to ensure a reliable second Internet. We also have a hidden page on [the Cleetus McFarland website] to launch a backup stream if the primary one fails,” he said. Today, FRDM+’s biggest challenge isn’t a technical one. Instead, it's around managing the business's different parts using a small team. FRDM+ has 35 full-time employees across its Shop, Race Track, Events, and Merch divisions and is “entirely self-funded,” per Mill. The company also relies on contractors for productions, but its core livestream team has six full-time employees. Mitchell told Ars that FRDM+ is profitable, but he couldn't get into specifics. He said the service has \"strong year-over-year growth and a solid financial foundation that allows us to continue reinvesting in our team and services,\" like a \"robust technology stack, larger events, venue rentals, and even giving away helicopters and Lamborghinis as the prizes for our races.\" “Having been at Discovery during the launch of MotorTrend OnDemand, I’ve witnessed the power of substantial budgets firsthand,\" Mill said. \"Yet, [FRDM+ has] achieved greater success organically than [Discovery] did with their eight-figure marketing investment. This autonomy and efficiency are a testament to the strength of our approach.” Any profitability for a 3-year-old streaming service is commendable. Due to wildly differing audiences, markets, costs, and scales, comparing FRDM+’s financials to the likes of Netflix and other mainstream streaming services is like comparing apples to oranges. But it’s interesting to consider that FRDM+ has achieved profitability faster than some of those services, like Peacock, which also launched in 2020, andApple TV+, which debuted in 2019. FRDM+ doesn’t share subscription numbers publicly, but Mitchell told Ars that the subscription service has a 93 percent retention. Mill attributed that number to a loyal, engaged community driven by direct communication with Mitchell. Mill also suggested to Ars that FRDM+ has successfully converted over 5 percent of Mitchell's YouTube audience. Five percent of Cleetus McFarland’s current YouTube base would be 212,500 people.

    "title": "12-year-old Doom 2 challenge map finally beaten after six-hour, 23K-demon grind",
    "article_text": "Streamer Coincident gets a dream run on the Okuplok's nightmarish \"slaughter map.\" Over 12 years ago, a reclusive DoomWorld forum member going by the handle Okuplokreleased what he called \"a slaughter map\" forDoom 2. Packed to the gills with 23,211 enemies (often in extremely claustrophobic corridors), the levelquickly gained a reputationinthe classicDoomplayer communityas beingone of the hardest ever constructed. That reputation didn't stopclassic FPS streamer Coincident, who has been grinding away at the \"Okuplok slaughter map\" in some form or another for years. And over the weekend, Coincident became the first player to defeat every enemy and complete the map in a single segment duringa livestreamed marathon runthat clocked in at just over six hours. To be clear, this isn't the first time the Okuplok slaughter map has been completed in any form. In 2023, Coincident managed to take it down in a single segment runon the much easier \"I'm too young to die\" difficulty, which halves the damage taken and doubles the ammo provided. At the time, Coincident estimated that an Ultra Violence run on the same level would be \"eight times more difficult,\" thanks in large part to randomized damage that could end a run after a single mistake. Tool-assisted speedrunshave shown that an Ultra Violence run of the Okuplok slaughter map was technically possible in under two hours with mechanically perfect input. But at that difficulty, humans had only been able to force their way through the slaughter level in multi-segment runs, exploiting save states to preserve their best performances and break up the nerve-wracking tedium. Coincident himself completed one such Ultra Violence runin just two segments last year, an achievement that still took 56 total attempts and what he said was \"countless hours of practice.\" In the run-up to his single-segment completion, Coincident put togethera seriesofstrategy videosthathighlightthedifficultyof completing even the relatively easy opening sections of this brutal level. There, he outlines the \"scientific approach\" he takes to movement through each section of the map, making use of rare points of partial cover and using constant movement to prioritize survival and ammo management above all else. In the descriptions for those videos, though, Coincident acknowledged some of the reasons that Okuplok's level has been \"deemed impossible to beat in one segment\" on Ultra Violence difficulty. Even if you have a perfect strategy mapped out for each segment, \"some of the later fights are a pure RNG grind,\" he wrote. \"Losing multiple 5-hour-long [Ultra Violence] runs over and over again that late into the map would drive me insane.\" The slaughter level's \"wildly varying levels of difficulty between each fight\" are \"extremely frustrating as a challenge, especially when you die to a difficult fight, after having cleared several easy (and borderline boring) fights for 3 hours,\" Coincident continued in another video description. \"Some consider that the only reason why no one has single-segmented Okuplok on UV yet is because no one even wants to try. I wouldn't be surprised.\" Nonetheless, over the weekend, Coincident proved he was willing to try what he once considered an \"impossible\" task. His grueling, six-hour-long marathon isn't actually that fun to watch at many points. The occasional moments of intense, close-quarters combat are punctuated by long segments where Coincident circle-strafes endlessly around large hordes, waiting for enemies to hurt each other with incidental damage so he can conserve ammunition. He also kills manykited enemiesone by one in corridors or through small gaps to keep things as safe as possible. Even if you're not willing to sit through six hours of that kind of meticulous gameplay, it can be thrilling to jump around the stream and revel in the portions where Coincident shows off some extremely precise, near-perfect dodging through arenas filled with projectiles and floors littered with pixelated corpses. The drama gets especially intense near the end, when Coincident's breathing becomes noticeably heavy before finishing the run with a flashy rocket to the face just as he hits the exit panel. \"Yes! Fuck yes!\" Coincident exclaims after the run is finally over. \"Okuplok is done! Done, done, done, done, done! ... Oh my god, what a ride, this was quite the ride... It's done, I don't have to run this again! It's over!\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "You can play the Unreal-powered The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster today",
    "article_text": "\"Surprise\" dropped today, the game overhauls leveling and graphics. The worst-kept secret in the gaming industry in 2025 is no longer a secret: Bethesda Game Studios' 2006 RPGThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivionhas been remastered, and that remaster has already been released on all supported platforms today. Alivestreamfeaturing developer sound bites and gameplay footage ran on Twitch and YouTube today, making it official after years of leaks. Oblivionwas the immediate precursor toThe Elder Scrolls V: Skryim, which became one of the most popular games of all time—butOblivionwas pretty popular in its time, too, and it was the first game in the franchise that would end up feeling at all modern by today's standards. (I personally will always loveThe Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, though.) LikeSkyrim, it straddles the line between story-based fantasy RPG and systems-based, emergent gameplay playground. It's less structured and accessible thanSkyrim, but it offers far more robust character customization. It's infamously janky, but largely in an endearing way for fans of the franchise. (Players who prefer a polished, curated experience should surely look elsewhere.) The port was not handled directly by the original developer, Bethesda Game Studios. Rather, people within BGS worked closely with an outside developer, Virtuos. Virtuos is a sprawling, multi-studio organization with a deep history as a support studio. It contributed to a whole range of games, likeCyberpunk 2077,Hogwarts Legacy,The Outer Worlds, and more. It also was involved in some previous well-received remaster efforts and ports, includingAssassin's Creed: The Ezio CollectionandFinal Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. Based on the footage in Bethesda's reveal video today, it appears thatOblivion Remasteredwas largely developed by Virtuos Paris. It's important to note that this is a remaster, not a remake. This project uses Unreal Engine, but only for the presentation aspects like graphics and audio. Bethesda's proprietary Creation Engine is still there handling the gameplay logic and systems. That said, Virtuos has also made changes on that front. Most notably, today's announcement revealed that the remaster will have a completely overhauled leveling system, which is described as combining elements fromOblivionandSkyrim. That will be welcome news for many players. In many ways,Oblivionfeels like a modern game, but its leveling system—which incentivizes players to delay leveling up to grind certain skills—was controversial even when it launched. It's not completely clear what the new one will look like, but this is likely a case where most fans will consider any change a good one. Other aspects of the game that are a bit odd and anachronistic are still in place, though, like the persuasion system for conversations with NPCs. Oblivion's appeal is largely about its jazzy gameplay systems, so the team likely didn't want to compromise that too much. Lockpicking is the same as before, too. On the presentation side, Virtuos has added a much more robust lighting system than before, and the game looks hyper-detailed. NPC faces and talking animations have been overhauled for the better, but there are still some wacky-looking people. (Would we really have it any other way?) All told, the stream made it look like we're getting a promising new coat of paint on a game that made an enormous impact when it first arrived in 2006 but which was overshadowed bySkyrima few years later. The Elder Scrolls VIis still in development, andSkyrimwas much closer in time to Oblivion than it is to today. So apart fromThe Elder Scrolls Online, fans of the franchise have been experiencing a historic drought. A remaster certainly isn't the same as a new game, but if Bethesda and Virtuos pulled it off, this release is sure to be popular. The game is available onPC (Steam), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S for $50 today. It’s also on Game Pass. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google Messages can now blur unwanted nudes, remind people not to send them",
    "article_text": "Google's Sensitive Content Warnings can keep Messages rated PG. Googleannounced last yearthat it would deploy safety tools in Google Messages to help users avoid unwanted nudes by automatically blurring the content. Now, that feature is finally beginning to roll out. Spicy image-blurring may be enabled by default on some devices, but others will need to turn it on manually. If you don't see the option yet, don't fret. Sensitive Content Warnings will arrive on most of the world's Android phones soon enough. If you're an adult using an unrestricted phone, Sensitive Content Warnings will be disabled by default. For teenagers using unsupervised phones, the feature is enabled but can be disabled in the Messages settings. On supervised kids' phones, the feature is enabled and cannot be disabled on-device. Only the Family Link administrator can do that. For everyone else, the settings are available in the Messages app settings under Protection and Safety. To make the feature sufficiently private, all the detection happens on the device. As a result, there was some consternation among Android users when the necessary components began rolling out over the last few months. For people who carefully control the software installed on their mobile devices, the sudden appearance of a package called SafetyCore was an affront to the sanctity of their phones. While you can remove the app (it's listed under \"Android System SafetyCore\"), it doesn't take up much space and won't be active unless you enable Sensitive Content Warnings. Now, at least, SafetyCore is doing something, according to9to5Google. SafetyCore allows your phone to do basic AI image classification so it can identify images that may contain nudity. If your phone spots such an image arriving in your inbox, it will apply a blur filter and present a \"speed bump\" that lets you decide if you want to see said image. You can also choose to block the number that sent it.Sensitive Content Warnings also remind users who are sending nudes thatthey may want to rethink that.Like the incoming image speed bump, you can dismiss this one and continue sending unimpeded. It's a lot like Apple's identically namedSensitive Content Warning. Sensitive Content Warnings are coming to all Android devices with Google apps running version 9 or higher, but it's starting with those in the Google Messages beta. Unlike many features, this one is even available to the oft-forgotten Android Go lineup. However, your phone needs to have at least 2GB of RAM, which virtually every working Android phone should have. Content blurring and speed bumps will only appear in the Google Messages app, so you may need to switch to that app on certain phones. If you don't want to wait for the wide rollout, you can join the Messages beta in the Play Store to hurry the process along.

    "title": "FTC sues Uber over difficulty of canceling subscriptions, “false” claims",
    "article_text": "It's the latest legal move against Big Tech by the Trump administration. The US Federal Trade Commission has sued ride-hailing app Uber, saying it made “false or misleading” claims about its subscription service, in the latest sign that Donald Trump’s administration is embracing an aggressive stance against Big Tech groups. The regulator alleged the company’s Uber One service failed to deliver promised savings and proved difficult to “cancel anytime” as promised, according to a complaint filed in a California court on Monday. “Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” said FTC chair Andrew Ferguson. “Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.” The FTC’s action adds to a series of lawsuits brought by successive US administrations against large technology companies. The case signals that the Trump administration will continue to clamp down on these groups despite recent overtures made by tech executives. Uber denied the FTC’s claims and said its sign-up and cancellation processes were “clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law.”Uber and its chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi each donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration earlier this year. Apple CEO Tim Cook as well as Amazon, Meta and Google were among a large number of American companies and executives that also made contributions.All four companies face antitrust legal challenges from the FTC and the Department of Justice, some of which have gone to trial. Several tech executives attended the president’s inauguration ceremony, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg have held meetings with the president at the White House in recent months. Efforts to gain favour with the White House have not led to a softer stance on antitrust actions under Ferguson, who Trump named to lead the FTC and who has accused Big Tech of censorship. He has signalled that he will sustain the crackdown on the industry unleashed by his predecessor Lina Khan. “The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people,” Ferguson added, referring to US vice-president JD Vance. Lawyers for the FTC in court filings said Uber falsely claimed users would save roughly $25 a month through the $9.99 service, but did not account for the cost of the subscription in its calculations. They added that Uber made it difficult to cancel the service, requiring users to take at least a “dozen different actions and navigate a maze of at least seven screens, if they guess the right paths to use.” Uber said: “Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.” The FTC under former president Joe Biden’s administration brought a lawsuit against Amazon over its Prime subscription service. That case is due to be heard later this year in Seattle. The FTC sued Uber during Trump’s first term over claims the ride-hailing app mishandled personal data and “exaggerated earnings” for prospective drivers. Uber settled both lawsuits and paid a $20 million settlement to provide refunds to affected drivers. © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.

    "title": "2025 Chevrolet Blazer EV SS first drive: A big ride and handling upgrade",
    "article_text": "It's not a track car, but we drove it on a track. CHARLOTTE, North Carolina — Before letting us loose on the freshly laid tarmac of Ten Tenths Motor Club, Chevrolet was at pains to tell us that the new Blazer SS \"is not a track car.\" Sure, there's a \"competitive mode\" to the suite of electronic settings and the fastest 0–60 mph time of any SS-badged Chevy to date. The upgrades have been focused on making the Blazer EV \"stop, go, and turn\" better, and you don't need to be driving hard to appreciate the benefits. The Blazer EV had a rocky start. When we first drove it at the end of 2023,it felt a little unfinished, and a few days later unreliable softwarestranded another journalistand led toa nationwide stop-saleon the then-new EV. By last March, the software was fixed and the Blazer EVwas back on sale, now cheaper than before. While other Blazer EVs are available with front- or rear-wheel powertrains or with a smaller battery pack, the SS only comes with all-wheel drive and the larger 102 kWh battery pack. Nominal power output is 515 hp (384 kW) and 450 lb-ft (610 Nm), which jumps to 615 hp (458 kW) and 650 lb-ft (880 Nm) if you engage the \"Wide Open Watts\" mode. The battery chemistry is the same as lesser Blazers, but the SS makes good use of new silicon carbide inverters in the rear drive unit that minimize energy losses and segmented magnets in the motors that reduce heat buildup. There are bigger brakes, better tires, and the suspension benefits from stiffer anti-roll bars and springs, a faster steering ratio, and new monotube dampers that (together with the springs) do a far better job of controlling the Blazer's ride than the bits fitted to the Blazer EV RS I last drove. Oftentimes, the performance variant of an EV suffers from reduced range as a consequence of the added power and bigger wheels. But the Blazer EV SS still manages an EPA range estimate of 303 miles (488 km), significantly better than the less powerful AWD option (which uses the smaller 85 kWh battery pack). DC fast-charging maxes out at 190 kW—I'd love to give you a 10–80 percent fast-charge time, but Chevy only quotes \"78 miles in 10 minutes\" when it comes to charging stats. AC charging tops out at 11.5 kW, and the Blazer EV SS is capable of vehicle-to-home charging, although that requires compatible charging hardware from GM Energy. And while Tesla's Supercharger stations now show up in the onboard Google Maps navigation system—including their status—you'll still need to use an adapter to charge at one, because the car's charge port remains CCS1. The Blazer EV was one of the first of Chevy's CarPlayless infotainment systems. We thought that dropping the phone casting interface was a mistakewhen we reviewed the car last year, and it remains a bugbear among readers, if feedback in the comments is anything to go by. But the infotainment in the Blazer EV SS has a few new tricks (that will roll out to other Blazers in time). In addition to better route planning that can even factor in which roads allow you to activate Super Cruise, while the car is parked, you can now stream video from platforms like Peacock, Max, and Amazon Prime, which should come in handy during charging stops. On track, I heeded Chevy's warnings and drove the Blazer EV SS about as fast as I felt comfortable, up to but not past the tires' available grip. You have to listen for it, rather than feel it through the numb steering—the tires begin to \"sing\" as they start to lose grip, which is a good signal to lift off the throttle some. Despite its curb weight of 5,730 lbs (2,600 kg), the SUV coped well with the elevation and camber changes at Ten Tenths, although you remain conscious of that mass when it's time to slow for the corners. But the main thing that keeps your speeds sane is the unsupportive seats, which lack any extra side bolstering compared to the standard Blazer. Chevy quotes a 0–60 mph time of 3.4 seconds—the slight downhill gradient to the section of test track we used to test launch control might have helped contribute to our 3.3-second time. The company wasn't joking about this being the fastest-accelerating SS-badged Chevrolet yet. While no one should take a Blazer EV SS to a track day, it handled the whole affair much more composure than theDodge Charger EVmanaged on a much less rigorous circuit. The entire drive was also free of the bugs and gremlins that have become an all-too-common part of driving new EVs. There are several levels of lift-off regen braking available, from almost none to 0.3 G in the highest setting, which I find most appropriate for city driving or a twisty road. The people responsible for calibrating the control inputs deserve some praise here, because the throttle mapping is wonderfully intuitive and feels extremely natural to drive in one-pedal mode. Despite such prodigious power and torque levels, even in the more aggressive Sport or Z modes, the initial throttle tip-in is unlikely to smash your passengers' heads back into their seats unless that's what you're trying to do, something that powerful electric SUVs from other automakers can't always claim. At $60,600, the Blazer EV SS has entered what is now quite a competitive segment. The most obvious rival is the Ford Mustang Mach-E, either inMach-E GTorMach-E Rallyform; both are cheaper than the Blazer EV, but neither has its range. There's also theKia EV6 GT, but that struggles to make it much more than 200 miles on a charge, and it's not really any more fun than the normal EV6. For all-out electric fun, my money would still be on theHyundai Ioniq 5 N, which is a few thousand dollars more but remains the best thing I drove last year.

There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light—a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. I'll bet you don't spend a ton of time thinking about Deimos, the smaller of the two Martian moons, which is named after the Ancient Greek god that personified dread. And who could blame you? Of the two Martian moons, Phobos gets more attention, including as a possible waystation for human missions to Mars. Phobos is larger than Deimos, with a radius of 11 km, and closer to the Martian surface, a little more than 9,000 km away. By contrast, Deimos is tiny, with a radius of 6 km, and quite a bit further out, more than 23,000 km from the surface. It is so small that, on the surface of Mars, Deimos would only appear about as bright in the night sky as Venus does from Earth. But who doesn't love a good underdog story? Scientists have dreamed up all kinds of uses for Deimos, includingusing its sands for aerobraking large missions to Mars, returning samples from the tiny moon. So maybe Deimos will eventually get its day. Recently, we got one of our best views yet of the tiny moon when a European mission named Hera, en route to the asteroid Didymos, flew through the Martian system for a gravity assist. During this transit, the spacecraft came within just 300 km of Deimos. And its Asteroid Framing Camera captured this lovely image, which was, admittedly, artificially colored. Anyway, it's a rare glimpse at one of the smallest known moons in the Solar System, and I think it's spectacular.

    "title": "A Chinese-born crypto tycoon—of all people—changed the way I think of space",
    "article_text": "\"Are we the first generation of digital nomad in space?\" For a quarter-century, dating back to my time as a budding space enthusiast, I've watched with a keen eye each time people have ventured into space. That's 162 human spaceflight missions since the beginning of 2000, ranging from Space Shuttle flights to Russian Soyuz missions, Chinese astronauts' first forays into orbit, and commercial expeditions on SpaceX's Dragon capsule. Yes, I'm also counting privately funded suborbital hops launched by Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. Last week, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin captured headlines—though not purely positive—with the launch of six women, including pop star Katy Perry, to an altitude of 66 miles (106 kilometers). The capsule returned to the ground 10 minutes and 21 seconds later. It was the first all-female flight to space since Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963. Many commentators criticized the flight as atone-deaf stuntor a rich person's flex. I won't make any judgments, except to say two of the passengers aboard Blue Origin's capsule—Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen—have compelling stories worth telling. Here's another story worth sharing.Earlier this month, an international crew of four private astronauts took their own journey into space aboard a Dragon spacecraft owned and operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Like Blue Origin's all-female flight, this mission was largely bankrolled by a billionaire. Actually, it was a couple of billionaires. Musk used his fortune to fund a large portion of the Dragon spacecraft's development costs alongside a multibillion-dollar contribution from US taxpayers. Chun Wang, a Chinese-born cryptocurrency billionaire, paid SpaceX an undisclosed sum to fly one of SpaceX's ships into orbit with three of his friends. So far, this seems like another story about a rich guy going to space. This is indeed a major part of the story, but there's more to it. Chun, now a citizen of Malta, named the mission Fram2 after the Norwegian exploration shipFramused for polar expeditions at the turn of the 20th century. Following in the footsteps ofFram,which means \"forward\" in Norwegian, Chun asked SpaceX if he could launch into an orbit over Earth's poles to gain a perspective on our planet no human eyes had seen before. Joining Chun on the three-and-a-half-day Fram2 mission were Jannicke Mikkelsen, a Norwegian filmmaker and cinematographer who took the role of vehicle commander. Rabea Rogge, a robotics researcher from Germany, took the pilot's seat and assisted Mikkelsen in monitoring the spacecraft's condition in flight. Wang and Eric Philips, an Australian polar explorer and guide, flew as \"mission specialists\" on the mission. Chun's X account reads like a travelogue, with details of each jet-setting jaunt around the world. His propensity for sharing travel experiences extended into space, and I'm grateful for it. Usually, astronauts might share their reflections from space by writing posts on social media, or occasionally sharing pictures and video vignettes from the International Space Station (ISS). This, in itself, is a remarkable change from the way astronauts communicated with the public from space just 15 years ago. Most of these social media posts involve astronauts showcasing an experiment they're working on or executing a high-flying tutorial in physics. Often, these videos include acrobatic backflips or show the novelty of eating and drinking in microgravity. Some astronauts, likeDon Pettit, who recently came home from the ISS, have a knack for gorgeous orbital photography. Chun's videos offer something different. They provide an unfiltered look into how four people live inside a spacecraft with an internal volume comparable to an SUV, and the awe of seeing something beautiful for the first time. His shares have an intimacy, authenticity, and most importantly, an immediacy I've never seen before in a video from space. One of the videosChun recorded and posted to X shows the Fram2 crew members inside Dragon the day after their launch. The astronauts seem to be enjoying themselves. Their LunchBot meal kits float nearby, and the capsule's makeshift trash bin contains Huggies baby wipes and empty water bottles, giving the environment a vibe akin to a camping trip, except for the constant hum of air fans. Later, Chunshared a video of the crew opening the hatchleading to Dragon's cupola window, a plexiglass extension with panoramic views. Mikkelsen and Chun try to make sense of what they're seeing. \"Oh, Novaya Zemlya, do you see it?\" Mikkelsen asks. \"Yeah. Yeah. It's right here,\" Chun replies. \"Oh, damn. Oh, it is,\" Mikkelsen says. Chun then drops a bit of Cold War trivia. \"Thelargest atomic bombwas tested here,\" he says. \"And all this ice. Further north, the Arctic Ocean. The North Pole.\" Flight Day 3pic.twitter.com/vLlbAKIOvl — Chun (@satofishi)April 3, 2025 On the third day of the mission, the Dragon spacecraft soared over Florida, heading south to north on its pole-to-pole loop around the Earth.\"I can see our launch pad from here,\" Mikkelsen says, pointing out NASA's Kennedy Space Center several hundred miles away. Flying over our launch site.pic.twitter.com/eHatUsOJ20 — Chun (@satofishi)April 3, 2025 Finally, Chun capped his voyage into space with a 30-second clip from his seat inside Dragon as the spacecraft fires thrusters for a deorbit burn. The capsule's small rocket jets pulsed repeatedly to slow Dragon's velocity enough to drop out of orbit and head for reentry and splashdown off the coast of California. It wasn't only Chun's proclivity for posting to social media that made this possible. It was also SpaceX's own Starlink Internet network, which the Dragon spacecraft connected to with a \"Plug and Plaser\" terminal mounted in the capsule's trunk. This device allowed Dragon and its crew to transmit and receive Internet signals through a laser link with Starlink satellites orbiting nearby. Astronauts have shared videos similar to those from Fram2 in the past, but almost always after they are back on Earth, and often edited and packaged into a longer video. What's unique about Chun's videos is that he was able to immediately post his clips, some of which are quite long, to social media via the Starlink Internet network. \"With a Starlink laser terminal in the trunk, we can theoretically achieve speeds up to 100 or more gigabits per second,\" said Jon Edwards, SpaceX's vice president for Falcon launch vehicles, before the Fram2 mission's launch. \"For Fram2, we're expecting around 1 gigabit per second.\" Compare this with the connectivity available to astronauts on the International Space Station, where crews have access to the Internet with uplink speeds of about 4 to 6 megabits per second and 500 kilobits to 1 megabit per second of downlink, according to Sandra Jones, a NASA spokesperson. The space station communications system provides about 1 megabit per second of additional throughput for email, an Internet telephone, and video conferencing. There's another layer of capacity for transmitting scientific and telemetry data between the space station and Mission Control. So, Starlink's laser connection with the Dragon spacecraft offers roughly 200 to 2,000 times the throughput of the Internet connection available on the ISS. The space station sends and receives communication signals, including the Internet, through NASA's fleet of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites. The laser link is also cheaper to use. NASA's TDRS relay stations are dedicated to providing communication support for the ISS and numerous other science missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope, while Dragon plugs into the commercial Starlink network serving millions of other users. SpaceX tested the Plug and Plaser device for the first time in space last year on the Polaris Dawn mission, which was most notable for the first fully commercial spacewalk in history. The results of the test were \"phenomenal,\" said Kevin Coggins, NASA's deputy associate administrator for Space Communications and Navigation. \"They have pushed a lot of data through in these tests to demonstrate their ability to do data rates just as high as TDRS, if not higher,\" Coggins said in a recent presentation to a committee of the National Academies. Edwards said SpaceX wants to make the laser communication capability available for future Dragon missions and commercial space stations that may replace the ISS. Meanwhile, NASA is phasing out the government-owned TDRS network. Coggins said NASA's relay satellites in geosynchronous orbit will remain active through theremaining life of the International Space Station, and then will be retired. \"Many of these spacecraft are far beyond their intended service life,\" Coggins said. \"In fact, we’ve retired one recently. We’re getting ready to retire another one. In this period of time, we’re going to retire TDRSs pretty often, and we’re going to get down to just a couple left that will last us into the 2030s. \"We have to preserve capacity as the constellation gets smaller, and we have to manage risks,\" Coggins said. \"So, we made a decision on November 8, 2024, that no new users could come to TDRS. We took it out of the service catalog.\" NASA's future satellites in Earth orbit will send their data to the ground through a commercial network like Starlink. The agency has agreements worth more than $278 million with five companies—SpaceX, Amazon, Viasat, SES, and Telesat—to demonstrate how they can replace and improve on the services currently provided by TDRS (pronounced\"tee-dress\"). These companies are already operating or will soon deploy satellites that could provide radio or laser optical communication links with future space stations, science probes, and climate and weather monitoring satellites. \"We're not paying anyone to put up a constellation,\" Coggins said. After these five companies complete their demonstration phase, NASA will become a subscriber to some or all of their networks. \"Now, instead of a 30-year-old [TDRS] constellation and trying to replenish something that we had before, we've got all these new capabilities, all these new things that weren't possible before, especially optical,\" Coggins said. \"That's going to mean so much with the volume and quality of data that you're going to be able to bring down.\" Chun and his crewmates didn't use the Starlink connection to send down any prize-winning discoveries about the Universe, or data for a comprehensive global mapping survey. Instead, the Fram2 crew used the connection for video calls and text messages with their families through tablets and smartphones linked to a Wi-Fi router inside the Dragon spacecraft. \"Are we the first generation of digital nomad in space?\" Chun asked his followers inone X post. \"It was not 100 percent available, but when it was, it was really fast,\" Chun wrote of the Internet connection in an email to Ars. He told us he used aniPhone 16 Pro Maxfor his 4K videos. From some 200 miles (300 kilometers) up, the phone's 48-megapixel camera, with a simulated optical zoom, brought out the finer textures of ice sheets, clouds, water, and land formations. While the flight was fully automated, SpaceX trained the Fram2 crew how to live and work inside the Dragon spacecraft and take over manual control if necessary. None of Fram2 crew members had a background in spaceflight or in any part of the space industry before they started preparing for their mission. Notably, it was the first human spaceflight mission to low-Earth orbit without a trained airplane pilot onboard. Their nearly four days in orbit was largely a sightseeing expedition. Alongside Chun, Mikkelsen put her filmmaking expertise to use by shooting video from Dragon's cupola. Before the flight, Mikkelsen said she wanted to create an immersive 3D account of her time in space. In some of Wang's videos, Mikkelsen is seen working with a V-RAPTOR 8K VV camera fromRed Digital Cinema, a device that sells for approximately $25,000, according to the manufacturer's website. The crew spent some of their time performing experiments, including the first X-ray of a human in space. Scientists gathered some useful data on the effects of radiation on humans in space because Fram2 flew in a polar orbit, where the astronauts were exposed to higher doses of ionizing radiation than a person might see on the International Space Station. After they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the mission, the Fram2 astronauts disembarked from the Dragon capsule without the assistance of SpaceX ground teams, which typically offer a helping hand for balance as crews readjust to gravity. This demonstrated how people might exit their spaceships on the Moon or Mars, where no one will be there to greet them. Going into the flight, Chun wanted to see Antarctica and Svalbard, the Norwegian archipelago where he lives north of the Arctic Circle. In more than 400 human spaceflight missions from 1961 until this year, nobody ever flew in an orbit directly over the poles. Sophisticated satellites routinely fly over the polar regions to take high-resolution imagery and measure things like sea ice. The Fram2 astronauts' observations of the Arctic and Antarctic may not match what satellites can see, but their experience has some lasting catchet, standing alone among all who have flown to space before. \"People often refer to Earth as a blue marble planet, but from our point of view, it's more of a frozen planet,\" Chun told Ars.

    "title": "Elon Sounds Extremely Depressed After Tesla Profits Plunge 71%",
    "article_text": "Tesla reported lower than expected earnings on Tuesday, with first-quarter profits dropping 71% on much lower sales of electric vehicles. The news isn’t altogether surprising, given the fact that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the public face of the company and continues to help President Donald Trump destroy the U.S. federal government while peddling far-right extremism on his social media platform X. Musk tried to put a slightly rosier spin on the state of his EV company in anearnings callTuesday, but he still sounded very depressed. The billionaire’s tone was subdued as he emphasized the autonomous taxi rides that he would be launching in Texas this June wouldn’t be the Cybercab vehicles many people on social media had expected. The company will only be operating Tesla Model Ys to pick up passengers, deflating news for some who had hoped Musk might deliver something unique. Tesla reported $19.3 billion in revenue in the first quarter, down 9% compared with the same period a year earlier. The company produced 362,000 vehicles and delivered over 336,000. Deliveries of Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y were down 12%. While the company doesn’t break out official figures for the Cybertruck, the product bucket that includes that truck was down 24%, perhaps because it’s the vehicle most associated with Musk’s brand of fascism. The Cybertruck started deliveries in late 2023, after Musk had begun expressing racist andantisemitic ideas. Consumers likely assume anyone with a Cybertruck is fully on board with Musk’s agenda, while owners of Model 3 and Model Y vehicles are given a bit more leeway since the cars predate the billionaire oligarch unmasking himself as an overt villain. Tesla reported adjusted earnings-per-share of 27 cents, far lower than expectations from analysts of 41 cents. The only bright spot in the company’s numbers were the $595 million in revenue brought in from carbon credits, the money paid by car companies making traditional gas-powered vehicles to offset the pollution they generate. Without those carbon credits, Tesla would’ve posted an operating loss for the quarter. As theWall Street Journalnotes, Tesla is facing a future of high tariffs if President Trump’s ridiculously high taxes on imported goods remain. The cars that Tesla sells in the U.S. are manufactured in California and Texas, but many of the parts are imported from other countries and hit with 25% tariffs. Musk has been outspoken against tariffs and stressed on Tuesday’s earnings call that he was “one of many advisors to the president, I’m not the president.” Musk often tries to distract from bad news with splashy announcements. As one example, Reuters reported back in April 2024 that Tesla was planning to pivot away from producing a cheaper, long-anticipated $25,000 vehicle. After that report came out, Muskrushed outan announcement that he would produce a robotaxi, an event that wasdelayedfrom that summer to the fall of 2024. The actual unveiling was underwhelming to say the least, with some highly deceptivemagic tricks, and Musk continues to promise big things about his Cybercab while we all wait. Musk insisted Tuesday that there will be fully autonomous taxi rides in Austin, Texas, by June, they just won’t be Cybercabs. “The Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June in Austin will be Model Ys, so that is currently on track to be able to do paid rides, fully autonomously in June, and then to be in many other cities in the U.S. by the end of this year,”Â Musk saidon the call. Many people had previously taken his announcement about the Austin launch as a sign that he would be deploying the Cybercabs he announced back inOctober 2024. But it will take years and possibly decades for the Cybercab to become a reality at scale, if they ever do, according to most autonomous driving experts. Musk received a question from an analyst on the earnings call about details involving the kind of remote control that may be needed to operate his robotaxi service, but he seemed extremely reluctant to explain. “It’s only a couple months away. So you can just see for yourself in a couple months in Austin,” Musk said. The earnings call on Tuesday was perhaps notable for having far less hype than usual. Yes, Musk tried to promise that his Optimus robots would be operating in Tesla factories by the end of 2025. And he made some other vague futuristic promises about full self-driving in the coming years. But Musk’s tone was noticeably downbeat and he didn’t have the same carnival-style salesmanship that often accompanies any public facing announcement for Tesla. Tesla dealerships and showrooms have been the site of mass protests across the country since Musk launched DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. There have also been cases of vandalism and arson, with some people facing federal terrorism charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. Musk insisted on the earnings call that protest against him are “very organized” and “paid for,” repeating suggestions he’s made previously about shadowy financiers who are supposedly funding demonstrations. Musk also said the “real reason” there are protests against him is that people who are receiving fraudulent money from government agencies that are now getting cut. Musk has never provided any evidence for this assertion. Notably, Musk said he would be stepping back from DOGE after May but didn’t go into any detail about what that would mean. Even though he said he would be easing up on his involvement, the billionaire said that he would remain in the government through President Trump’s entire term, which is only supposed to last four years. Trump has said repeatedly he’d like to stay in office beyond that, which would be flatly unconstitutional. In his relatively short time in government, Musk has helped destroyed vital services and unlawfully abolished the United States Agency for International Development. DOGE has been credited with laying off over 280,000 people at 27 different government agencies, according toCBS News, and Musk has been particularly heartless to those people, insisting they should get “real jobs.” Musk and DOGE don’t actually have the legal authority to do almost any of this so-called cost-cutting, since Congress alone has the sole authority to create agencies, allocate funds, and take those funds away when it decides to do so. But that hasn’t stopped Musk, who seems to believe he canunilaterally cutanything he wants. Incredibly, DOGE is reportedly not even doing much to cut actual spending by the U.S. government, according to theNew York Times. How could that be? Well, the vast majority of federal spending is on things like the U.S. military, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. And while there has been some proposals to cut programs at the Pentagon, that’s money which will reportedly be spent on Trump’s pet projects like the Golden Dome missile defense program. Cuts to programs like Social Security have been relatively modest so far but they’re already causing longer wait times for seniors trying to get help over the phone. And there’s no telling what they’ll cut next after the congressional Republicans try to take their ax to Medicaid with their latest budget bill. Musk, along with Trump, has helped what the billionaire oligarch has repeatedly called arevolution. But it’s such an anti-human attack on anything good in America, that it’s no wonder consumers have decided maybe buying a Tesla isn’t for them.

    "article_text": "If the upcoming movies based onLego,Matchbox, and other childhood toys weren’t enough for you, next up is… a Toys ‘R’ Us movie? Yes, really. PerVariety, the toy store chain is coming to the silver screen, courtesy of Story Kitchen, the studio behind several recentgame adaptations. The apparent idea here is to make something in the vein ofÂNight at the MuseumÂandÂBig,Âand other recent toy-related hits likeÂBarbie. At the moment, the film is in early development, but producers Dmitri M. Johnson & Mike Goldberg are already talking with filmmakers about the project. Johnson and Goldberg, who co-founded Story Kitchen, called Toys ‘R’ Us “a cultural touchstone that continues impacting the child in all of us today. As â80s kids who considered the store one of the most magical places on Earth, weâre honored to partner to create a film that will capture the spirit of adventure, creativity and nostalgia it represents.” “This project is an exciting opportunity to bring the magic of our brand to the big screen,” added Toys ‘R’ Us Studios president Kim Miller Olko. “The movie will be a journey as boundless as play itself, evoking the electric sense of wonder that is the essence of Toys ‘R’ Us. This story will capture the imagination, adventure and joy that has made Toys ‘R’ Us a destination for kids of all ages.â Toys ‘R’ Us was founded in 1948 and for generations of kids was one of the coolest places ever. Those stores were big and felt like they hadeverything,and it didn’t hurt they had Geoffrey the Giraffe as a mascot and a catchy TV jingle. Over the years, online stores and mass merchants grew in popularity, and private equity loans put the company in significant debt. Itwent defunctin 2018, only to berevived in 2021âmainly as a subsection of Macy’s, but there are some standalone stores in New Jersey and Minnesota’s Mall of America.

    "article_text": "Warner Bros. and Ryan Coogler have much to celebrate with the success of thefilmmaker’s hit vampire movie. AfterSinners‘ opening weekend,the Hollywood Reportershared that it raked in $48 million domestically, which bodes well for original filmmaking and the studios still game to support it. Sinnerswas a gamble thatWarner Bros. movie heads Pam Abdy and Michael De Luca are seeing pay off. Speaking to THR, De Luca said, “We kind of knew we had the goods just in terms of having watched the directorâs cut. But to have the audience validate thatâ thatâs really whatâs giving us the most joy today. Weâre also happy that as an original swing, itâs worked out and we hope it inspires the other studios to take more original swings because thatâs how you get new franchises and keep the industry refreshed.” Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav called the producing team to congratulate the duoâ”He was very proud of the group and very happy with the result,â De Luca saidâputting to bed recent rumors that Abdy and De Luca were on their way out at the studio. Also not going anywhere, at least once he’s finishedBlack Panther 3for Marvel, is Coogler. “Thatâs the long-term play â¦ and I just spoke to him this morning,” De Luca said. “He will absolutely be back [to make more movies at Warner Bros.].â As for Coogler, he penned a heartfelt thank-you to everyone who took the time out to see the film. The letter was shared by Proximity Media on X and it thanks fans for buying tickets, carving the time out to see it in any of the formats available, and taking part in the discourse the film inspires. “I had the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry but it was always a film that we wanted to make for audiences, in theaters,” Coogler wrote. “We always had our minds on you, the audience, and felt a deep responsibility to entertain you, and move you in the way only cinema can.” “I believe in cinema. I believe in the theatrical experience. I believe it is a necessary pillar of society. Itâs why me and so many of my colleagues have dedicated our lives to the craft. We donât get to do what we do if you donât show up. The global theatrical audience has allowed me to dream, find a career, and build a more sustainable life for me and my family. And the only way that I know how to thank you for that, is by continuing to mine my personal human experience and my relationships for more stories to bring to you in cinematic language. To see your response to the film has re-invigorated me and many others who believe in this art form.” Thank YOU!pic.twitter.com/e9X0RUIIdI — PROXIMITY MEDIA (@proximitymedia)April 22, 2025 Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Everything We Know About the PlayStation 6 and Its Rumored Handheld Version",
    "article_text": "It took the two biggest names in console gaming nearly a decade, but Sony and Microsoft finally seem to be learningthe lesson Nintendo taught themages ago. Handhelds are in season, and it seems Sony imagines its next big release will be a full-on portablePlayStation 5(no,not that one). The real question is what it might be called, and if it will be released alongside a whole new console generation, namely the PlayStation 6. We have our doubts Sony will suggest a necessarily lower-power handheld console will be a sequel to the PlayStation 5 andâespeciallyâthemore-powerful PS5 Pro. It may indicate Sony is anticipating a dual-release, with one console focused on performance and the other on portability. Either way, the little flecks of info falling out the grinding rumor mill suggest this upcoming console could be the side-grade weâve been hoping for. A mobile PlayStation that can access your complete library of digital titles in a device you can slip into your backpack. Late last year, reports from Bloomberg claimedSony was hard at work on a handheldgaming device. There are still no details beyond the promise that it could be capable of playing PlayStation 5 games. That’s enough to get the thoughts racing, even though thereâs still no hint of when we could see this handheld in action, or whether it will sit alongside a PlayStation 6. While Microsoft has not announced any official Xbox handheld, the company is reportedlyworking with Asus to create oneslated for this year. Hell, Asus’ Republic of Gamers brand and Xbox have even added fuel to the rumor fires withcheeky teaser videos. Sony has been much more reserved. The company released the PlayStation 5 Pro late last year, which sported afair number of hardware updatesbeyond the much-toutedenhancements to the GPU. As for the PS6, known leaker KeplerL2 on the NeoGAF forumsclaimedthe âPS6 design is completeâ and further hinted the console could be running on next-gen AMD hardware. Some PlayStation diehards are betting on a 2027 release date. Sony normally works on a 6 to 7-year console cycle, with the PlayStation 5 debuting in 2020. I don’t see Sony waiting too long to release a proper handheld, not when the competition is so fierce. Still, there’s little left to a release date but pure speculation. Reutersreportedlast year that Sony is sticking with AMD for the PlayStation 6 chip. It suggests that the console may be compatible in some way with PS5 games. Depending on the when it launches, the new CPU in a PlayStation 6 could be running on the modern Zen 5 architecture or, according to the few leaks we have, on the supposed inevitable Zen 6, plus the chipmakerâs next-gen graphics architecture. The current version of the PS5 and PS5 Pro are running on modified Zen 2 architecture, but without more specifics we can only guesstimate the PS6’s performance. Sony sticking with AMD for the PS6 (and any handheld version) is practically a given. Lead PlayStation designer Mark Cerny said the companyplanned to introduce Fidelity FX Super Resolution, or FSR 4, to the PlayStation in the future. AMDâs updated upscaling technology takes a frame rendered at a lower resolution and uses AI algorithms to upscale it to a higher resolution, while keeping the framerate of the original rendering. FSR 4 introduced a whole host of new capabilities that increase the clarity and detail of upscaled images, and itâs already a winner on the latest AMD graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT. Upscaling would be even more of a boon on a handheld, especially when trying to produce console-like, consistent performance that most PlayStation gamers expect. Leaker KeplerL2 alsohintedthat the next console would have âshader binary compatibility.â That just means games would âjust workâ on this new handheld. Otherwise, the leakerclaimedit will have a 3nm chip running at 15W TDP, or thermal design power. Essentially, that means the chip will be running at relatively low wattages, equivalent to the max of what aSteam Deckcan produce. AMD is already the main enabler of handheld gaming PCs, like the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally X. The chipmaker has also announced its AMD Ryzen Z2 Go and Ryzen Z2 Extreme for this yearâs slate of handheld CPUs. The Z2 Extreme is meant to power top-end devices like the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go 2. Until we know more about the PlayStation 6’s performance, it’s hard to speculate about pricing. A portable PlayStation would need to be more powerful than a $450 Switch 2. Nintendoâsupcoming handheldis equivalent in performance to somewhere between a PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro. The Switch 2 ismaking use of Nvidia’s DLSSupscaler to help achieve 4K resolution in some games. If Sony makes use of upscaling through AMD, it may already have all the pieces in place to offer us a handheld and far sooner than 2027. The way gaming is going, as consoles become more and more portable, perhaps we may not even need a traditional PlayStation 6 at all.

    "title": "Folk Frights Meet Family Trauma in Fréwaka",
    "article_text": "Filmmaker Aislinn Clarke, who became the first Northern Irish woman to direct a horror film withThe Devil’s Doorway, reaches another milestone withFrÃ©waka, a dread-infusedfolk-horrornarrativethat’s one of the first Irish-language horror films. Memorablefound-footage horrorfilms are increasingly rare, but 2018’sThe Devil’s Doorwayremains a standout. It’s a 1960s-set tale of camera-toting priests investigating a miracle at a Magdalene laundryâbut instead uncovering something much darker than even the cruel conditions weathered by the unwed pregnant women forced to dwell there. WhileFrÃ©wakais set in the present day, it draws on similar themes of religion being twisted to serve a sinister purpose, as well as the ways trauma can become a multi-generational affliction. It’s also inspired by Irish folklore, an oft-used source forIrish horrorfilmmakers, but it pivots away from offering yet another variation on thechangelingmyth. Trickster fairiesâknown for their baby-swapping anticsâdo play a big role inFrÃ©waka, but writer-director Clark is more interested in what her film’s title, which loosely translates to “roots,” represents to its characters. After a pair of opening scenes that introduce seemingly unconnected tragedies, we meet Shoo (Clare Monnelly). She has a lot to look forward to, especially her upcoming marriage to Mila (Aleksandra Bystrzhitskaya), who’s pregnant with their first child. But the past is clinging to her rather stubbornly. Her estranged mother has just died by suicide, leaving behind an apartment stuffed with Jesus portraits and plenty of bad memories, neither of which Shoo relishes sorting through. When the home health care agency she works for pings with a temporary new posting, looking after a stroke victim, Shoo is relieved. She and Mila could use the money, but it’s also an outstanding way to avoid dealing with her own problems. Leaving Mila to handle clean-up detailâand wonder why Shoo doesn’t feel an ounce of sentimentality about her late mother’s belongingsâShoo heads to a remote village, where her Irish-language skills mean she gets to bust shit-talkers who mistakenly assume she can’t understand them. The job may have whisked Shoo away from certain unpleasantries, but as fans of folk horror will immediately recognize, even picturesque small towns can hide creepy secrets. Following instructions that include taking “a short cut by the fairy tree,” Shoo finds her way to Peig (BrÃ­d NÃ­ Neachtain), who’s immediately hostile, refusing to even open the door to let her in. Shoo assumes at first that this is just an elderly patient who resents an outsider barging in, and there’s certainly some of that at work here. But the more time she spends with Peig, the more she starts to wonder if there’s something to the old woman’s warnings about the mysterious “they” and “them” who lurk in the shadows intending to cause her harm. Is it just paranoia and superstition, or are the strange things Shoo herself is experiencing (whispered voices and other odd noises, to start) actually tied into some kind of supernatural threat? AsFrÃ©wakawinds its way toward the truth about Peig’s fears, it foregrounds Shoo’s own struggles with mental health and the very obvious fact that her mother’s deathâand the lingering bad blood between themâis bothering her more than she’s letting on. “She was your mother,” an increasingly impatient Mila tells her in one of their rare phone calls, owing to both Shoo’s reluctance to talk and the village’s spotty cell service. “You have to face it, whatever it is.” When Peig sees Shoo trying to dump a box of personal mementos Mila thought she might want to keep, the older woman has her own advice: “Getting rid of it won’t get rid of it.” This is something Peig herself has learned first-hand over her long and unhappy life. IfFrÃ©waka‘s last-act reveals aren’t exactly surprising (including a brief mid-credits scene), the road to get there is suitably eerie, though viewers who’re hoping to have every little detail explained will have to be okay with mood winning out over expositionâand will maybe want to read up on Irish folklore to fill in some of the blanks. Both Monnelly and NÃ­ Neachtain infuse a certain spark into characters that might otherwise feel overly miserable, and Clark’s direction brings a gradual emotional intimacy to their initially prickly relationship. She also layers plenty of tension into the setting, making Peig’s ramshackle house feel like a barely guarded fortress against the unknown. FrÃ©wakastarts streaming April 25 on Shudder.

When everything in the world of streaming is a constant escalation ofÂmoreandÂbigger, what if you just want something … uncomplicated? One compact device, one cord, one simple remote, and access to enough content to keep you amply entertained without overwhelming you â is that too much to ask? It’s definitely not, and the best way to get there is theRoku Express, which you can get for just $20 while it’s on sale for 33% off at Amazon. If someone you know isn’t the most tech-savvy person around (or if that’s you â no shame in that game!), the Roku Express is the ideal plug-and-play streaming device to bring you great HD content. See at Amazon We’re not knocking the serious multitaskers of the streaming world. Actually we’re big fans of being able to answer your video doorbell, turn on your central air, ask Siri how to cook a turkey, and control your surround-sound system, all while binging the new season ofÂHacks, all with one device and one very intricate remote. But not everybody is a fan of that kind of technological overload, and the Roku Express is for those people. The Roku Express is a modest little 1.1-ounce box that connects to your TV with an HDMI cable, and also gets its power from the TV so there’s no power adapter needed. It brings you the content you want in HD, and the included remote is only used for the Roku Express. It is compatible with voice assistants and Apple AirPlay, but those are really just features of convenience much more than complications.

    "title": "As Elon Tries to Avoid the Spotlight, Climate Activists Brazenly Vandalize Tesla Dealership",
    "article_text": "The one thing Elon Musk really can’t have right now as he serves as the absentee CEO of Tesla is more negative attentionânot only can his ego not handle it, as a recentreport from the Washington Postsuggested, but his car company’s reputation really cannot suffer any more hits. So it’s hard to imagine he’s thrilled about Extinction Rebellion, the occasionally controversial environmental movement, spray painting the windows of Tesla dealerships with anti-Musk messaging at a time when his tarnished image is already seemingly costing the company money. FreedomNews.TV documented protesterswith the non-violent protest group hitting up a Tesla showroom in Manhattan on Tuesday, using spray paint to leave messages in opposition to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Demonstrators sprayed “Fuck DOGE” and “We do not consent” among other generally anti-Musk positions on the building as part of an Earth Day demonstration. It’s a pretty daring campaign given the Trump administration’s stated goal tocrack down on those who vandalize Tesla dealershipsand threats to hit the worst offenders with terrorism charges. BREAKING: Climate Activists TAG windows of Tesla Showroom in Manhattan on#EarthDay Extinction Rebellion tagged \"F Off DOGE\" and \"WE DO NOT CONSENT\" among other writings on the windows.pic.twitter.com/XMHBYnBxwY — Oliya Scootercaster ð´ (@ScooterCasterNY)April 22, 2025 It also happens to come on the same day that Tesla is expected to report its first quarter earnings for 2025, in what some investors see as a potential make-or-break moment for the company. Tesla’s stock price has taken a hit over the course of this year as Musk’s role in government has drawn the ire of protesters andhurt the electric vehicle company’s brand. Certainly, the litany of demonstrations outside of Tesla dealerships hasnot been great for overall morale or the bottom line. Dealerships and showrooms have been thetarget of organized protestsand seemingly less organized attacks that have included shooting out windows and setting vehicles on fire. Tesla drivers, embarrassed by the car’s association with Musk and in some cases afraid of getting heckled, have eitherditched their carsor tried to cover their shame bycovering up the branding. Theoretically, and certainly in Musk’s version of reality, environmental activists would support Tesla, seeing as it’s arguably the most noteworthy electric vehicle. But the thing is, when you throw your full weight behind an administration that straight updoes not believe climate change is a real thing, intends todrill for more oilandburn more coal, and generally justrevel in doing things that harm the planet, you kinda lose your credibility with that crowd.

    "title": "Heather Graham to Star in What Sure Sounds Like a Remake of 1982’s The Entity",
    "article_text": "Deadlinereports Heather Graham is attached to star inEntity Within, a new movie based on the infamousDoris Bither haunting of 1974at Alliance Media Partners (the same the studio that brought you the 2023 Graham horror vehicle,Suitable Flesh). Intended to be sold off at the Cannes Market, this new take on the subject co-stars Mimi Rogers (Ginger Snaps,The Rapture,The X-Files,Full Body Massage, etc.), Morgan Peter Brown (Absentia), and Kevin Keppy (Smile), andÂ hails from director Nick Simon(The Girl in The Photographs)andSaw IVwriter Thomas Fenton. In the words of AMP’s Anthony Bruckner, “Weâre thrilled to be working with Heather Graham again and partnering with Nick Simon to bringEntity Withinto Cannes. This is a high-concept, emotionally resonant horror film that weâre excited to share with international buyers.â For those unfamiliar with the story, Bither claimed she was, on more than one occasion, sexually assaulted by an invisible and vocally misogynistic spirit, attracting the attention of parapsychologists as well asAudrey Roseauthor Frank De Felitta. Felitta recounted the case in his 1978 novel,The Entity, which was later adapted for the screen by Sidney J. Furie in a 1982 film of the same name starring Barbara Hershey. If you haven’t seen it, it’s amazing (Martin Scorsese evenhailed it among the scariest films of all time,Â  which is quite the coup for Furie, whose other credits includeSuperman IV: Quest for Peace).Â Boasting an Oscar-worthy lead performance from Hershey and a highly memorablepercussion-heavy soundtrackby Charles Bernstein (Quentin Tarantino even lifted it for a scene inInglorious Basterds),The Entityis likely the most disturbing movie about a ghostly haunting ever madeâcertainly the most disturbing to be released by a major studio. It’s likely for this reason 20th Century Fox decided not to release its plannedtie-in video game for the Atari 2600Â in which players were to use a pair of paddles to push its ghostly rapist skyward to a higher plane of existence. In part to its grim subject matter, the movie also does that great thingThe X-Filesoften did where it suggests a logical,non-paranormalsolution for its events if you so choose to accept them (SVUfans can probably guess what that is). As is often the case with these things, the out makes the idea this poor woman actuallyisbeing terrorized by a higher-dimensional monstereven morefrightening. Go figure. It’s worth noting, however, that even though this new project is based on the same source material, Deadline’s article fails to mention the existence of the 1982 film at all,so we can safely assume this project isn’t officially based on Furie’s novel. As producer Missy Valdez states in the article, âThis film is based on a true story and that truth is chilling. It is an honor and a challenge to bring Dorisâs raw and terrifying experiences to the screen with care and dignity … this is an elevated horror film that blends emotional depth with real-life terror, and we believe it will deeply resonate with both genre fans and new audiences alike.â Still, the story “so shocking, so threatening, it will frighten you beyond all imagination” (per one ofThe Entity‘s original taglines) is certainly ripe for a new examination.

    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has claimed he wants to “Make America Healthy Again,” but pretty much everything he’s done since taking over as head of the Department of Health and Human Services seems destined to make Americans sicker and less healthy. Reutersreports that,under Kennedy, the Food and Drug Administration has announced it will suspend a quality control program that tests milk and other dairy products. The outlet cites emails from the FDA’s Division of Dairy Safety to report that the shuttered program, which involves proficiency testing for grade âAâ raw milk and other dairy products, will no longer operate. Proficiency testing ensures that America’s network of food safety labs operates consistently with federal standards. Milk products have (historically) needed to comply with federal requirements to beconsidered Grade âA.” The suspension of the program comes as workforce cuts batter the agency’s food safety and nutrition division, Reuters notes. The FDA’s Moffett Center Proficiency Testing Laboratory, which is responsible for overseeing the testing in question, “is no longer able to provide laboratory support for proficiency testing and data analysis,” an email viewed by the news outlet reads. The cuts come as other critical food testing is also being suspended. Last week,it was reportedthat the FDA was gutting its food safety testing operations. The agency said it would end virtually all routine food safety inspections, which are designed to ensure that the food that Americans eat is free from harmful pesticides and other contaminants. Gizmodo reached out to the FDA for more information and will update this story if it responds. The HHS, which is the parent agency of the FDA, has been hit by massive layoffs in recent months, thanks to the Trump administration’s mandate to shrink the federal government and thus make it “more efficient.” Kennedy has seemed more than willing to oblige.

During a radio interview this past Sunday, RFK Jr. argued that autism was worse than the pandemic because \"COVID killed old people.\" The FDA also refused to publicize an outbreak of E. coli, according to a new report. There have already been a dozen cruise ship outbreaks in U.S. waters in 2025. Trump said autism was caused by \"a shot\" or something \"artificial\" that people are consuming. In a TV interview that aired on Wednesday, RFK Jr. first said he wasn't familiar with the cutsâthen blamed them on DEI.

    "title": "Scientists Made Chewing Gum That Combats Herpes and the Flu",
    "article_text": "Here’s something to chew on: antiviral gum. Scientists have developed chewing gum that can safely trap the influenza virus and the viruses that cause herpes, at least in the lab. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Dental Medicine developed the gum, made from bean powder. In various experiments, a protein found in the gum substantially neutered two flu strains and the herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). The gum could prove to be a potent and easy-to-use tool for preventing the spread of these infections, the researchers say. The Penn researchers have been working on antiviral gum for some time now. Several years ago, theydevelopedgum from plant-based material that could effectively trap SARS-CoV-2âthe cause of covid-19âin people’s saliva. Their latest creation relies on a similar approach but uses a different plant that’s native to sub-Saharan Africa and commonly eaten in tropical areas:Lablab purpureus, also known as the lablab bean. Past research hasshownthat the lablab bean naturally carries a protein that can bind to a wide variety of viruses. This protein is called Flt3 Receptor Interacting Lectin, or FRIL for short. The researchers incubated samples of influenza, along with HSV-1 and HSV-2, with FRIL, finding that it could neutralize the viruses with sufficiently high doses. They also used a mechanical mouth to chew the gum and measure if enough FRIL would be released during chewing to reach these levels. They found that a two-gram gum tablet containing 40 milligrams of bean powder was sufficient to reduce the viral load of these viruses by over 95%. “These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission,” the scientistswrotein their paper detailing the work, published in the journal Molecular Theory. The team’s research is still in the early stages, but they created their gum according to FDA specifications for drug productsâan important step for anything intended to prevent infections. They also found that the gum could remain stable and safe to chew for at least two years. Antiviral medications are currently available for both flu and herpes, along with a seasonal flu vaccine, but all have their limitations. Today’s flu vaccines can prevent severe infections, for instance, but aren’t very reliable at preventing transmission to others once someone is infected. Antiviral medications for herpes can lower the risk of transmission to others, but many people often don’t even know they have herpes, due to a lack of symptoms. And herpes can spread through saliva even without causing illness (this can include spreading to someone’s genitals via oral sex). There are also currently no vaccines for either type of herpes virus. So the researchers are hopeful that chewing gum can be a novel and effective delivery system for preventing the transmission of viruses like flu and HSV-1/2 that spread through saliva. They’re also planning to test whether bird feed laced with FRIL can prevent bird flu from spreading among poultry. âControlling transmission of viruses continues to be a major global challenge. A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission,â said lead researcher Henry Daniell in astatementfrom the university. Personally speaking, I wouldn’t mind grabbing a stick of gum during the winter to keep my loved ones safe from getting my flu infectionâthough hopefully, it wouldn’t have to taste like bean. chewing gumherpesInfluenza Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Researchers tested ten different chewing gum brands, and found no difference between synthetic and natural gum. The annual spring meeting is a critical part of updating the yearly flu shot to match the strains most likely to be circulating in the U.S. come wintertime. Flu activity is high to very high in 43 states as of early February. Flu season is right around the corner, and there's no better time than now to keep yourself from getting sick for the holidays. The researchers hope their discovery could result in treatments that make flu and allergy seasons less miserable. Mexico and WHO health officials have reported the first known human case and death tied to H5N2 avian influenza. No further cases have been detected yet.

    "title": "Uber’s Glorified Bus Service Launches Rides in Atlanta",
    "article_text": "Uber is a convenient service, but sometimes it can be somewhat expensive. What if instead,the companyofferedshuttlesthat carry multiple people at once, and analyzed their travel patterns to create ideal routes for pickup and drop-off stops? That would make the rides potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly, because more people are cramming into one vehicle, and a shared ride could be more affordable than a standard Uber. Well, you are in luck. Uber says that starting in May, it isexpanding its Uber Shuttle serviceto Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and will offer numerous routes picking people up from downtown and midtown, with daily service scheduled for every 30 minutes from 6 AM to 10 PM. The company already offers Uber Shuttle to and from New York’s LaGuardia and JFK airports. Rides can be requested through the app, with the option to book up to five seats at once. Tickets will start at $10 one-way in Atlanta, but eventually could max out at $18.50. We are being a little facetiousâof course, Uber Shuttle is a glorified bus. Some cities have incredibly poor or slow public transit infrastructure, however. In NYC, taking an Uber Shuttle from Manhattan to JFK can be cheaper than taking public transit, and somewhat more convenient if not a little slower, depending on traffic. Anyone who has traversed from Manhattan to JFK on public transit knows the pain of having to exit the subway and wait in that long ticketing line to transfer to the AirTrain. Another nice benefit of Uber Shuttle is if you travel during a time that is not busy, you might get an entire bus to yourself for a fraction of the cost of a regular Uber. Still, if you have ethical reservations about gig services, you might want to suffer through it and take the train. Despite what companies like Uber say, many of their drivers complain of working grueling hours and seeing wages fall over time, doing it often out of desperation to make some quick money. Areportfrom last year found that Uber drivers “saw their earnings for 2024 fall 3.4% on average to $513 a week” while working 0.8% more hours. On the customer side, prices have been pushed higher across the board so Uber, DoorDash, and the like can turn a profit, making deliveries exorbitant on food that arrives soggy, cold, and unsatisfying. Bastian Lehmann, the founder of Postmates, recentlypostedon X that food delivery “is a joke now,” adding, “Iâd be surprised if drivers are making more today than they did when we launched Postmates. DoorDash is the absolute bottom, but Uberâs not far behind.” Last year,Bloombergreported that Uber and Lyft underwent a scheme in NYC tosystematically lock drivers out of the appduring slow periods so it could avoid paying them a minimum wage under newly enacted laws there. Sometimes, hailing an Uber when you are tired late at night, or just trying to get to the airport, is hard to resist, no matter how much people feel ethically uneasy about it. As a part-time gig worker…it's brutal out there. Simple food delivery, forget it, you're lucky to get fifty cents a mile in my market. I dropped Uber Eats and Doordash from my toolbelt a long while back. Even pay on shopping and catering is in the dregs, though. — Mike (@TxdoHawk)April 14, 2025 Uber drivers in Los Angeles only get 31% of the customer fare!pic.twitter.com/Lczi9xahuc — Whole Mars Catalog (@WholeMarsBlog)April 21, 2025 ridesharingtransitUber Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Fans ofWickedwill soon be able to enjoy a new audiobook edition of Gregory Maguire’sWicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the Westwith a very special narrator. RB Media announced today that Oscar-nominatedWickedstar Cynthia Erivo will lend her vocal talents to theupcoming audiobook due out July 1, 2025. In the official announcementWickedfranchisestar Erivo shared, âIâm incredibly excited to narrateWicked, especially after having had the privilege of portraying Elphaba on screen. I feel deeply connected to Elphaba. We have been on quite the journey together, and now Iâm eager to begin an adventure with her whilst exploring the full world ofWickedand its myriad of other characters in the audiobook.” “Iâm looking forward to bringing this incredible story to life in a new way for listeners, and I hope it resonates as deeply with them as I know it will with me.â Erivo has been a shining and relatable champion for Elphaba, so it’s neat to see this come to fruition as we get closer to the release ofWicked: For Good. Troy Juliar, Chief Content Officer for RBmedia shared, “Three decades after its debut,Wickedremains one of the most clever revisionist novels of our time,â he said, referencing the book’s powerful perspective shift from the events of L. Frank Baum’sThe Wizard of Oz. Maguire’s book depicts the Wicked Witch of the West as a misunderstood empowered rebel whose legacy spawned Stephen Schwartz’s hit Broadway musical and Jon M. Chu’s blockbuster cinematic adaptation. He continued, âIn that spirit, weâre revising and updating the narration of the audiobook to feature the novelâs most gifted interpreter. Cynthiaâs work behind the mic, and her exploration of identity and belonging, will resonate with all who encounter it and bring these themes to life in a way that inspires and captivates a new generation.â Wicked‘s new audiobook featuring Erivo’s narration is currentlyavailable for pre-orderÂ from RB Media for release later this summer.

    "title": "Trump Hits Southeast Asian Solar Panels With Tariffs as High as 3,521%",
    "article_text": "Under President Trump’s tariff-happy administration, no industry is being spared. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce finalized hefty tariffs on solar panel cells imported from Southeast Asia in a supposed effort to stop China from cheating.Â In apress release, the department stated that the tariffs would target Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The exact percentage varies depending on the country. For example, Malaysian products from Jinko Solar will see tariffs of 41.56 percent, and Trina Solar in Thailand will see 375.19 percent. Cambodia, however, will face duties at a whopping 3,521 percent because it didn’t cooperate with U.S. investigations. This decision is an update to a case brought last year by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which accused China of “dumping” inventory. In short, the groupclaimedthat Chinese companies with factories in Southeast Asia were receiving subsidies from China to ship solar panels below their production cost. “The Commerce Department is holding China accountable for its transnational subsidies through other countries that harm American industry,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said. âThe Commerce Department continues to enforce our trade laws fully so that we can rebuild U.S. manufacturing and restore American competitiveness. We must ensure a level playing field for American businesses and workers.â Last year, U.S. trade officialsannounced preliminary tariffs, but these finalized percentages are much higher. In apress release, Tim Brightbill, a lawyer for the Alliance, labeled the new tariffs a “decisive victory” against Chinese manufacturers that are “cheating the system”. He added, “Enforcing our trade laws isnât just a legal matterâitâs essential to rebuilding our industrial base, securing our energy independence, and protecting American jobs.â Over the last decade, solar deployments in the U.S. have seen anaverage growth of 28%. So, it’s not surprising that the industry has been a repeated topic of interest. Funny enough, the previous Trump administrationhit imported solar panels with a 30 percent tariffin 2018, whichbasically nobody liked. The following year,Â the Solar Energy Industries Associationreportedthat tariffs cost over 62,000 jobs in the U.S. At the time, SEIA president Abigail Ross Hopper said, âThis stark data should be the predicate for removing harmful tariffs and allowing solar to fairly compete and continue creating jobs for Americans.â In June, the International Trade Commission will vote to determine if these tariffs actually go into effect. If so, the solar industry may be at risk again. solar industryTariffs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "title": "Apple Intelligence No Longer ‘Available Now’ After False Advertising Inquiry",
    "article_text": "One of Apple’s big selling points for the iPhone 16 was that it would be the first to get Apple Intelligence, the company’s suite of AI features for doing things like summarizing texts and generating custom emoji. But some of the bigger promises, like a revamped Siri, have yet to come to fruition. As a result, Apple has removed the description “available now” from the landing page for Apple Intelligence on the company’s website following a recommendation from a truth-in-advertising organization. The National Advertising Division, which is part of BBB National Programs,led an inquiryinto Apple’s advertising promises around Apple Intelligence. It found that while some of the features marketed by the company have been made available to some users, the blanket statement that all of the Apple Intelligence offerings are “available now” was not accurate Basically, the issue in NAD’s mind is that Apple’s marketing misled people as to what features were actually available. While the iPhone 16 lineup launched with functionality like Priority Notifications, Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration, the Apple Intelligence page included other features that were not immediately available. Apple did offer little disclosures about thatâfootnotes and small print that suggested those features would be coming in future updatesâbut NAD said those distinctions were “neither sufficiently clear and conspicuous nor close to the triggering claims.” Ultimately, the NAD recommended that Apple either ditch or change the claim that all features are “Available Now,” and Apple followed that recommendation. Anarchived versionof the company’s landing page for Apple Intelligence shows the “Available Now” text, which has since been pulled down and no longer appears on the site. In a statement, a spokesperson for Apple said, âWhile we disagree with the NADâs findings related to features that are available to users now, we appreciate the opportunity to work with them and will follow their recommendations.â It’s notable that Apple decided to kill the “Available Now” framing rather than pull down the promised features that are not yet available, presumably reasoning that those features are enough to get people to buy and wait. But thus far, Apple Intelligence has been more of a hassle than a functional sales hook. The features that are availablehaven’t been able to excite or convert customers. In fact, features likeAI summaries of texts and news stories have been so badthat many have turned them off. Meanwhile, the big promise of an AI-infused Siri hashit snag after snagand appears to bedelayed until potentially 2026. That whole situation has gotten so bad that it has led tochanges at the executive levelas the company scrambles to try to get back on track. Apple might want to thank NAD for recommending cutting down on the Apple Intelligence advertising. Seems like the company might be better off burying those features rather than putting them front and center.

    "article_text": "While fans wait to hear whether or not Prime Video’sThe Wheel of Timewill return for a fourth seasonâsomething showrunnerRafe Judkinsalsohas his fingers crossedaboutâthere’s an adjacent nugget of news from Robert Jordan’s fantasy realm. An open-world RPG video game is in development from iwot Studios, which has owned the rights to Jordan’s 14-part book series since 2004, with the ability to create film, TV, video games, and comics based on the material. Varietyreminds us that iwot Studios is behindAge of Legends, aWheel of Timeorigin-story feature film that was announced back in 2023 with Kari Skogland(The Falcon and the Winter Solder)tapped to direct. iwot also produces the Prime Video series, which just wrapped up its third season on the streamer. The company also has an animated film in the works. So branching out into video games feels like a logical next step. The trade reports that theWheel of Timegame will be an AAA open-world RPG “developed wholly in house by the team at the newly launched iwot games, which will be led by Warner Bros. Games vet Craig Alexander.” It’s expected to take three years before its arrival on both PC and consoles. Alexander’s previous credits includeThe Lord of the Rings Online,Dungeons & Dragons Online, andGame of Thrones-themed mobile game, so he has a handle on sprawling fantasy settings. “Adapting such a legendary mythology into an open-world RPG is a rare and ambitious challenge,” he told the trade. “Iâm thrilled to lead the effort and build a world-class team capable of honoring this beloved world.â iwot Studios CEO Rick Selvage’s explained that while theWheel of Timegame aims to build on the success of the TV show, its content won’t be limited to what we’ve seen across its three seasons so far. “Itâs an open-world game, and itâll be everything with theWheel of Time.Everything that is covered in the books, as well as all the backstory elements of it,” he told Variety. “Itâs not going to be limited to one area or another or a particular age … it will cover the entire world.” What do you think aboutThe Wheel of Timebecoming a game?

    "article_text": "Besides a massive camera bump, this year’s iPhone 17 Pro will reportedly come in a sky blue,according to MajinBu,a prolific leaker who has previously shared accurate information on Apple products prior to their official announcement. Apple tends to play it safe when it comes to color options for its top-of-the-line iPhone Pro and Pro Max. Your choices are typically more mature—sorry,professional—colors like black, white, gray, orsome shade of gold. Only normie iPhone users want fun and vibrant colors (like the teal iPhone 16!) apparently. It’s not that I hate sky blue—the hue might resemble thesky blue M4 MacBook Air—or blue. Blue is actually my favorite color. But if the rumor ends up correct, I just have one thought: blueagain? Apple’s already done blue iPhone Pros, including ones that are sky blue-ish like the“sierra blue” iPhone 13 Proin 2021. Before that, there was adarker “pacific blue” iPhone 12 Proreleased in 2020. Last year, theiPhone 15 Procame in “blue titanium.” That’s already three shades of blue! Sure, Apple has tried non-blue colors like the“alpine green” iPhone 13 Proand“deep purple” iPhone 14 Pro, but those colors were so muted, they literally don’t shine through when you throw a case on. Would it kill Apple to give the iPhone Pro series at least one version with some vibrancy? Gizmodo staff seem to agree. Consumer tech reporter Kyle Barr wants abanana yellow(like the iPhone 14/14 Plus) and Gizmodo alum and current contributing writer Alex Cranz wants Apple to bring back the alpine green. I’m demanding Apple go brighter. Somebody find Apple’s“courage”and toss it in Tim Cook’s direction. Give us a new shade of the coral and lime green last seen on the iPhone 5C. Or how about a red? Apple’s red iPhones have been done in partnership with PRODUCT(RED), but thelast one was the iPhone 14 and 14 Plusin 2022. Apple no longer sells any the last-standing PRODUCT(RED) iPhone SE after it released theiPhone 16eearlier this year.

    "article_text": "Are you caught up withThe Last of Us?Episode twowasa doozy, bidding farewell to a major character whose absence will have an incredible impact on the rest of season twoâand the upcomingthird seasontoo. It also means that Bella Ramsey’s Ellie will become the show’s main focus, something the actor talked about in a new interview withthe Hollywood Reporter. “I would never consider myself a leader,” Ramsey told the trade. “But thereâs something that happens when Iâm given responsibility where I really like the feeling and I take the responsibility very seriously. Iâm very happy to lead a set and have a lot of influence over the tone and dynamic, especially given thereâs preconceived ideas about a young person whoâs No. 1 on the call sheet.” Ramsey, who’s 21, had a scene-stealing role onGame of Thronesbefore being cast inThe Last of Us, but the HBO video game adaptation is their most high-profile outing to date. That the show is based on a hit video game added an extra layer of pressure. Season two picks up five years after season one, and Ellie has aged from a vulnerable young teen to an ass-kicking young woman. For Ramsey, that meant recalibrating their performance a bit. “I got quite fixated on the way that Ellie looks in the game and her physical stature and, to be specific, the muscle definition in her arms. And I didnât look like that,” Ramsey said. “My body type isnât that. I talked about this a lot with [co-showrunner Craig Mazin], and he never put that expectation on me. He wanted me to look strong and feel strong, and that was in how I carried myself, my posture and the confidence you have. It was a challenge for me to let myself off the hook for not looking computer-generated.” Speaking to THR, Mazin explained that Ellie’s emotional growth matters more than insisting Ramsey become more muscular. “Iâm not interested in the physical aspect, Iâm interested in the emotional maturity and the change in personality,” he said. “Iâve watched Bella grow and start to find her own two feet. â¦ And I feel that in Ellie completely.” New episodes ofThe Last of Usarrive Sundays on HBO and Max.

    "article_text": "Schools across the United States often cannot afford basics like pencils or stationary paper, and the new education secretary has sought to fulfill President Trump’s promise of getting the federal government out of education (except to pull funding from universities over exercising free speech rights). AI is a different story, however: A newdraft executive orderwould prioritize the technology in classrooms by diverting federals towards cultivating “AI literacy” skills amongst students and teachers. Titled “Advancing artificial intelligence education for American youth,â the order states that AI is âdriving innovation across industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the way we live and work.” It goes on to say, “To ensure the United States remains a global leader in this technological revolution, we must provide our Nationâs youth with opportunities to cultivate the skills and understanding necessary to use and create the next generation of AI technology.â In drafting the new order, the Trump administration may be directly responding to China, whose education ministry announced in recent weeks its own plans tooverhaul classrooms by integrating AIapplications into textbooks and teaching curriculum. The two countries are competing fiercely to maintain a lead in the artificial intelligence space in hopes that doing so will protect their global influence. China has been trying to unseat the United States as the leading global hegemon. The new executive order would establish a White House task force on AI education, including members from the technology sector like Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Trump’s advisor on crypto and AI, David Sacks. Here is more from theWashington Postabout the U.S. executive order, which is still a draft and could change, or never be issued: The draft order would instruct federal agencies to seek public-private partnerships with industry, academia and nonprofit groups in efforts to teach students âfoundational AI literacy and critical thinking skills.â The task force should look for existing federal funding such as grants that could be used forAI programs, and agencies should prioritize spending on AI education, according to the draft order. Itwould also instruct the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to prioritize federal grant funding for training teachers on how to use AI, including for administrative tasks and teacher training and evaluation. All educators should undergo professional development to integrate AI into all subject areas, the draft order says. It is kind of ironic that ‘AI’ and ‘critical thinking’ would be found in the same sentence, as they are conflicting and contradictory concepts. Astudyby Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University released earlier in the yearfoundthat “those who most trusted the accuracy of AI assistants thought less critically about those toolsâ conclusions.” It is not surprising that, in the developer community, experts have warned that new programmersdo not know how to codebut are rather simply accepting answers that coding bots give them, potentially losing out on fundamental knowledge necessary to debug problems or formulate better solutions. On platforms like X, users have taken to relying on chatbots toprovide counterarguments in debateswithout reviewing the factual accuracy of what they are sharing. There is not necessarily an issue if research and steps are taken to make the tools a true benefit to studentsâAI can help search through large reams of data quickly, for instance, or translate old works into English. And some companies have tried to create AI tutors that create personalized learning tracks for each student. But it is reasonable to be skeptical that notoriously tech-illiterate schools will implement AI correctly when most people still do not understand how AI models truly work, or become tricked by the idea that they are “thinking” because of their anthropomorphic design. Teachers struggle enough with just keeping pupils’ attention, with many schools seeking to ban access to smartphones during the day to get a lid on the issue. Nothing is more emblematic of the disconnect than Education Secretary McMahon recently finding herself the subject of ridicule after sheconfusedthe term artificial intelligence with “A1,” the steak sauce.

    "article_text": "It's a good day for everyone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fan-made remakes of popular games are a risky thing. You never know when you're going to sink years of your life into a passion project, only to eat a cease and desist letter from an expensive lawyer representing a faceless corporate overlord that forces you to eitherchange it uporshut it down entirely. That seemed like a real risk for Skyblivion, the ambitious, long-running effort to recreate Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, especially after it became clear that Bethesda was working on its own official Oblivion remaster. Happily, in this case the outcome was very different: Instead of forcing an end to Skyblivion to protect its commercial interests, Bethesda sent a key for Oblivion Remastered to everyone working on it. \"Huge thanks to our friends @bethesdastudios.com for their continued support of Skyblivion!\" the mod team wrote onX. \"As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, @bethesda.net!\" And, to assuage any concerns that this is all a fake-out, the team said in a follow-upmessagethat \"Bethesda made it clear that they have no intention of shutting down our project.\" Of course, it could be adouble-secret fake-out: Give the Skyblivion team a truckload of Oblivion Remastered keys, and then just wait for everything to grind to a halt while they blow a year or two playing it. I would 100% fall for that. The Skyblivion team recently expressed \"all love and no hate\" for Oblivion Remastered, despite its potential to steal their thunder, saying their mod \"always was a passion project and still is until the end,\" and it's great to see Bethesda reply in kind. It's probably over-optimistic but it'd be nice to see more of this sort of thing in the future. Speaking of things that are nice, the first day of release is going exceedingly well for Oblivion Remastered: Less than 12 hours after launch it's surpassed 150,000 concurrent players on Steam along—more thandouble the peak of Skyrim Special Edition—the user reviews are good,mods work, and players aren't even mad about thenew horse armor.

    "title": "Burden of Command is the World War 2 visual novel I didn't know I needed",
    "article_text": "I just want Lt. Colonel-senpai to notice me. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As much as I'd call myself a strategy enthusiast, it's always been difficult for me to get into the really crunchy, grognardy, rivet-counting wargames like Gary Grigsby'sWar in the EastorCombat Mission. Of all of the recent Paradox grand strategy games,Hearts of Iron 4is the one I have the fewest hours in. That ultimately comes down to the fact that I am, at heart, a roleplay dork. I care more about whether two characters are going to kiss than what caliber cannon is fitted on my medium tank. So from the first time I sawBurden of Command—a new take on World War 2 tactics that bills itself as a \"leadership RPG\"—I was immediately intrigued. And after stumbling through its somewhat cumbersome tutorial, I found that it was just what I'd been waiting for. \"RPG\" might be a bit off the mark. The way I would actually describe Burden of Command is as atactical World War 2 visual novel, which is just as offbeat and interesting as it sounds. Taking on the role of an American lieutenant in 1942 and commanding a platoon through basic training and eventually the first wave of Yanks to land in North Africa, there are two main modes of play woven together. You have tactical, grid-based combat with line of sight, cover, and suppression that could be mistaken for one of those grognard games I mentioned. But you also have text-based interstitials featuring colorized period photography, and occasionally even taped interviews with real WW2 veterans. These include many small and large decisions that can affect how you develop as an officer and the fate of your men. Your officer has a few personality traits that exist almost entirely just for flavor: Your reputation for any of the above might be commented on by other characters and earn you nicknames like \"chatterbox.\" More impactful are the approaches your character adopts, which can each give mechanical bonuses in battle and unlock options in certain narrative decisions. You can be an officer who leads by the book, focusing on Discipline, for example. Or you can face every challenge with a sort of heroic bravado, specializing in Zeal. I started out with a core value of Compassionate, hoping to prioritize saving as many lives as I could. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But I quickly pivoted to the Clever approach, as I found that was actually the way to save the most lives at the end of the day. Concern and an open heart aren't enough. You have to be crafty and effective. The US Rifle Company you'll be commanding is led by a captain and composed of four platoons that each have a lieutenant in charge, and these five officers are the only ones who have visible combat stats. There are also a handful of named sergeants and privates, however, whose under-the-hood personalities can be shaped by your decisions in ways that can affect how they behave in the future. These characters, notably, can die—not just on the battlefield, but as the result of narrative decisions. I lost one of my sergeants in a tragic training accident before we even shipped out, seemingly to teach me a lesson about how vulnerable any named soldier is. Squads in combat are a bit more abstract, though. They don't actually have a set number of guys in them that can be killed. That goes for both you and the enemy. Rather, each has a morale score that can be lowered temporarily by battlefield conditions like suppressing fire, or for the rest of the mission in the form of \"casualties.\" These can be replaced between missions, assuming your higher-ups can be convinced that you need reinforcement. This ties into one of the most interesting ways Burden of Command sets itself apart as a tactical game. Generally, a squad cannot be killed just by shooting at it. To remove an enemy from the map entirely, you have to assault their position and force a surrender. This requires you to first lay down suppressing fire on them, which both prevents them from shooting at your assault squads as they approach and increases the chances the assault will be successful. So the tempo of a battle very much follows a move-and-fire doctrine, where you have to scout out an enemy position, suppress it, then ideally flank it and go in for the assault. Your own squads, likewise, might take a lot of casualties and end up pinned down. But they won't generally be completely wiped out. You'll simply run out the turns allowed to you to finish the mission and have to accept a more dire narrative result. Each map also has two different objectives for \"Mission\" and \"Men.\" Mission is how quickly and effectively you completed the tasks the brass gave you, which earns you Prestige to use in leveling up your officers. Men is a measure of how well you treated your soldiers on the mission, primarily by minimizing casualties. This earns you Loyalty, which is used to level up your squads. Getting high marks in both, I found, is usually easier than focusing on one or the other, since securing objectives in a timely and effective manner naturally lends itself to not taking a bunch of unnecessary losses, and vice-versa. But occasionally you will be forced to prioritize. This all adds up to a war story that seems to be extremely branching and adaptable. I'm not sure exactlyhowadaptable yet, because I've only seen one path and the single auto-save and inability to restart a mission means you can't just go back and try a different choice. But based on the minute things I have seen Burden of Command react to, I'm very interested in finding out just how much the scenario might diverge if I called my shots very differently. It really is that rare breed: a wargame for roleplayers. And while it may have me agonizing over every decision I make, that's exactly how I like it.

    "title": "Where to find the Skeleton Key in Oblivion so you can stop breaking all your lockpicks",
    "article_text": "If you're sick of stacking up on lockpicks, go on a quest to get the best pick of them all. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lockpicking in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion can be a hassle since it's so different from the lockpicking minigame in later Bethesda RPGs. There's one item that can make your life a whole lot easier: the Skeleton Key. If you're fed up with breaking lockpicks all the time, the Skeleton Key is what you need. This guide is valid for both Oblivion and Oblivion Remastered. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis actually pretty impressive, it doesn't change the original quests. The Skeleton Key is an unbreakable lockpick that also boosts your Security skill by a whopping 40 points. Not only does it make lockpicking a whole lot easier, but it negates the need for lockpicking altogether since you can just brute force every lock by spamming the auto-attempt button over and over again. The Skeleton Key never breaks, so you get to roll the dice an unlimited number of times until the auto-attempt eventually succeeds. Like most of the coolest gear you can find in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the Skeleton Key is a Daedric Artifact. It's locked behind a special Daedric questline, but thankfully, the recommended level for this one isn't very high. The quest to get the Skeleton Key in Oblivion is called Nocturnal. You can start the quest by visiting the Nocturnal Shrine north of Leyawiin after reaching level 10. You'll find Leyawiin in the southern part of Cyrodiil near the coast. Once you arrive at the shrine, you'll need to recover the stolen Eye of Nocturnal. Your search for the Eye of Nocturnal sends you into the city of Leyawiin, the home of the suspected thieves. Two Argonian suspects are your primary targets: Weebam-Na and Bejeen. Start your investigation at Weebam-Na's house in the center of the town and ask either of the two Argonians about the Eye of Nocturnal. As you'd expect, they both deny any involvement in the theft of the artifact. After speaking to them, sneak off to a shadowy corner of the house to eavesdrop on the pair without being noticed. If your Stealth skill isn't high enough to avoid detection, you may need to drink an invisibility potion or cast a spell to hide more efficiently. When the Argonians think you're gone, they'll speak openly about the Eye of Nocturnal. It turns out that the artifact is at Tidewater Cave southeast of Leyawiin. Leave the town and head there to continue your search. Tidewater Cave is a fairly straightforward dungeon. It's filled with trolls and low-level enemies, so it's not that big of a threat even if you've only just hit level 10. To reach the Eye of Nocturnal, keep making left turns in Tidewater Cave. You'll end up in a deeply flooded tunnel with a chest underwater. The Eye of Nocturnal is sitting right next to that submerged chest and is bright and glowing, so you can't miss it. At this point, you can continue to search Tidewater Cave or head back to the Nocturnal Shrine to deliver the artifact. Once you return the artifact to the Nocturnal Shrine, you'll get the Skeleton Key as a reward. It will never break no matter how many locks you pick, and you'll have a permanent Fortify Security buff that adds 40 points to your Security skill as long as it's in your inventory. Enjoy your stress free lockpicking! If you'd rather skip the quest, you can add the Skeleton Key to your inventory with the help ofOblivion console commands: Enjoy your Skeleton Key! Since the Skeleton Key never breaks, there's no need to add more than one to your inventory. You still can if you want, though. All you need to do is change the number at the end of the console command. The Skeleton Key can be taken away from you in rare scenarios (like getting arrested), so this console command can come in handy if you need to recover your thieving cheat code.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered doesn't officially support mods, but the mods are rolling in anyway",
    "article_text": "The modding community is still hammering out the details but the short version is, yeah, they work. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There was a big question hanging over the launch ofOblivion Remastered: Will mods work? The news fromBethesda supportwas not good: \"Mods are not supported for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.\" But it looks like \"not supported\" doesn't mean much to a community that's been taking apart Bethesda games for decades at this point, because mods are already popping up on NexusMods, and yeah, they work. Bethesda itself hinted at the moddability of Oblivion Remastered even as it denied support: After warning that mods are not supported, it added, \"If you are experiencing gameplay issues while playing with mods, it's recommended you first try uninstalling your mods, then verify your games files on Steam, or the Xbox App.\" That's a pretty clear indication that the gamewillrun with mods installed. Over on Reddit, modders are already tearing into the new code. One redditor wrote that Oblivion Remastered game files can beopened in the old Construction Kit, and while it's not clear (in that thread, at least) just what can be done with it—or even how exactly it's working—the speculation is that the way the game piggybacks Unreal Engine 5 graphics onto the original game logic opens the door to, well,something. \"The first thing I did was see if the game was still using .esm files,\" redditorosunightfallwrote. \"It is. Therefore, modding is only a matter of time. Those of us who speculated that Creation Kit was still used for content creation and UE mainly for runtime engine were correct.\" There may be limitations to what can be done with that setup. \"From the sounds of it, this still stymies modding, since the high fidelity assets are swapped in by UE5 at runtime, while the old 2000s era assets are still in the base files,\"TorKHUwrote in reply. \"So, that'll be a problem that needs fixing if we want to make any mods that add content.\" That may be, and it'll likely be a while before the ins and outs of modding Oblivion Remastered are fully exploring. For now, though, the bottom line is that less than six hours after Oblivion Remastered went live, an updatedUnreal script extenderis up on NexusMods, and themods are flowing. It's fairly basic stuff so far, likeClassic Oblivion Color Grading,Skip Intro Screens,Ultimate Engine Tweaks, and alongsword that does 10,000 damage, but as I mentioned it's also been like six hours. At least one old Oblivion mod, thePlayer Random Conversation System, has already been updated for the Remastered edition, and anew subredditdedicated to Oblivion Remastered mods is also live and doing a brisk business. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And yes, for the record, I tested an Oblivion Remastered mod to ensure it works—which is to say, PC Gamer's Chris Livingston installed Player Random Conversation System to ensure it works, and then he told me it does. Why he chose to talk to this creepy looking guy I do not know, but the mod installed and ticked over without a hitch, and that's what matters. It's a positive sign that many more mods for the original game will likely follow in short order. For anyone curious on behalf of a friend, Oblivion Remastered nude mods aren't yet out there, but in what I take as probably the truest sign of confidence in the viability of the mod scene, bets are already being placed. And rest assured:the gooners are on it. The truth is that, dire words from Bethesda support aside, it only makes sense. Bethesda may not want to deal with the headache of officially supporting Oblivion Remastered mods, but mods, from theusefulto thebananas, are an essential part of the Elder Scrolls experience, and core to their longevity. Locking players out of them would be a tremendous misstep, but leaving them to work things out on their own?

    "title": "How to get lockpicks in Oblivion and master its very tricky lockpicking minigame",
    "article_text": "The quickest places to stock up on lockpicks and how to stop wasting them all too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thievery is a big part of every Elder Scrolls game and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is no exception. A thief needs lockpicks, though, and Oblivion's tricky lockpicking mechanics mean that you're going to need a lot of them if you want to get your sticky fingers on the possessions of Cyrodiil's citizens. This guide is valid for both Oblivion and Oblivion Remastered. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis actually pretty impressive, it didn't change the lockpicking minigame or Shady Sam's location. Thankfully, lockpicks are plentiful throughout the province. Once you know where to look, you'll practically never run out of lockpicks. Even if you're short on coin, there are ways to get picks without spending any money. Here's what you need to know if you want to stock up on lockpicks for your less-than-legal Elder Scrolls activities. You can get lockpicks in two ways: buying and looting. If you want to buy lockpicks, then there are several vendors that specifically cater to shady clientele—more on those folks below. They'll be more than happy to sell you a few lockpicks if you have gold. Normal vendors won't have lockpicks in their inventories, however, so you need to visit the right people. If you don't want to buy lockpicks, you can usually loot them from bandits and goblins while traveling between settlements. Dungeons and caves in particular are great sources of lockpicks which you'll usually find in chests at the end of a dungeon crawl or on the bodies of bandits you've killed. The chests in bandit hideouts tend to have a few, too. If you need lockpicks, there's only one man who can help you early in the game.Shady Sam is a merchant outside of the Imperial City walls who deals in shady supplies including lockpicks.You can find him along the northwestern edge of the city walls between the Talos Plaza District and Elven Gardens District gates. Shady Sam carries 30 lockpicks at a time and his stock refreshes daily if you buy them all, making him the best place to get lockpicks early in Oblivion. If you want to gain access to more lockpick vendors in Oblivion, you need to join either the Thieves' Guild or the Dark Brotherhood. The former is the better choice since there's not as high of an entry cost—no murder hazing ritual—and the guild's fences have huge supplies of lockpicks for sale. Dark Brotherhood merchants don't carry as many, but they still have enough for aspiring thieves to buy. You can quickly join the Thieves Guild by getting thrown in jail for a nonviolent crime like theft or pickpocketing or read wanted posters throughout the Imperial City and then ask beggars for more information about the guild.Or you could join the Dark Brotherhood by killing an innocent NPC and awaiting a visit from a representative of the Dark Brotherhood. Oblivion's lockpicking minigame is very different from the one Bethesda started using in Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty straightforward though. To open a lock, you have to use the lockpick to set every tumbler at the top of the lock. You move the lockpick by moving your mouse upward to nudge the tumblers and then clicking when the tumbler reaches the top of its slot.The tumblers move at varying speeds and the timing is tricky, so it takes some getting used to. If you mess up, your lockpick will break and some of the already set tumblers will reset to their original positions. Sometimes the tumblers will move upward more slowly when you nudge them with the lockpick. That's the best time to try and set them in place. If you try to click when they're moving too fast, you run the risk of breaking your lockpick. You should also listen closely while lockpicking. Tumblers move more slowly when they're easiest to set and they'll also make a slightly different noise when you nudge them. It's a tricky system that definitely takes some getting used to, but you can easily pick locks that are way above your skill level if you really get good at it. Improving your Security skill will make things a lot easier, but you can still pick even the hardest locks if you get the timing down.

    "article_text": "Thanks, I guess. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's only a matter of time before somebody mods a game to be more horny. Whether it's a remaster, remake, or new release, every game's Nexus Mods page will eventually ensure that, if you're the type of individual who can't spend a moment without seeing something lewd, your condition won't become critical. What ramifications this will have for society is still up in the air, but the fact remains: If it's playable, it'll get gooner mods. In the case of Oblivion Remastered, it only took three hours. As last week's leaks had led us to believe,Oblivion Remastered launchedas soon as it was announced—shortly before, in fact, because its Steam page went up just after its reveal stream went live. And thanks to Slack messages sent by my colleagues, we can pinpoint precisely when, at approximately 11:18 am EDT, Oblivion Remastered was available to the public and the time-to-pervert-mod clock began to tick. That countdown ended at 2:27 pm EDT, when Nexus Mod user Bub200 secured a place in history by uploading theAhegao Short Swordmod. As gooner mods go, it's fairly tame. Bub200 just slapped some hentai panels onto a short sword texture and called it a day. I'm squinting at the screenshot now and as far as I can tell, there's nary a breast to be seen. Compared to what you'll find in a casual scroll through Skyrim's trending mods, it's practically Puritan—a description I never thought I'd apply to an ahegao face, but here we are. (You can google it yourself if you need to. Just don't do it at work.) In the comments on Nexus Mods, the very first response was a resounding \"thanks I hate it\" from user KelpyJesus. Elsewhere, user Duen says \"we will watch your career with great interest.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The most effusive praise was offered by one Thebrokenbucket, who declared the ahegao short sword \"the first that will define a true modding renaissance,\" and urging Bub200 to \"please goon harder to get more modding publicity towards Oblivion\" and thus \"become a catalyst for the divine.\" I'm sure Thebrokenbucket won't have to wait long before they can once more fill Cyrodiil with animate pornography. I've got simpler tastes, myself: I'm just waiting for someone to put Goku in there.

    "title": "How to cure vampirism in Oblivion or become a vampire on purpose for the nighttime buffs",
    "article_text": "Quickly rid yourself of Porphyric Hemophilia or cure yourself of full-blown vampirism. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cyrodiil is a dangerous place in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and disease can be just as much of a threat as bandits or Daedra. Most diseases are just minor afflictions that sap your stats or cause small debuffs, but the Porphyric Hemophilia is a condition that can ruin your day, literally, because it turns you into a vampire. This guide is valid for both Oblivion and Oblivion Remastered. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis actually pretty impressive, it doesn't change the original quests. If you don't rid yourself of Porphyric Hemophilia quickly enough, you'll be stuck looking for the cure for vampirism. Being a vampire in Oblivion sounds cool on paper (and it does come with some unique benefits), but vampirism is a prison you won't want to wind up in by accident. If you want to rid yourself of vampirism, then there's a quest that can cure you. The vampire cure is irreversible, though, so you can't become a vampire again after you complete it. To cure vampirism in Oblivion, you need to travel to the Arcane University in the Imperial City and accept the \"Vampire Cure\" quest from Raminus Polus. Once you've become a vampire, the \"Cure Vampirism\" dialogue option will appear when talking to healers and other relevant NPCs. They'll all point you to Raminus Polus, kicking off the quest. Polus doesn't know much, it turns out, so he sends you to see Janus Hassildor of Skingrad. Hassildor's wife is sick (with vampirism, shocker) and there's a Cure Vampirism potion in it for you if you agree to help him heal her. You have to visit a witch called Melisande at Drakelowe to procure the potion. Melisande asks you to collect five empty Grand Soul Gems to begin the potion brewing process. Filled soul gems don't count, so you'll need to hunt down the rarer empty ones. You can buy Grand Soul Gems from the Mystic Emporium in the Imperial City Market District. Mages Guild halls in all major settlements have Soul Gems for sale as well. The Mages Guild hall in Chorrol has a bunch of them locked in display cases, so you can \"borrow\" as many as you need as long as you can pick the locks.The Skeleton Keycomes in handy here if you've got it. Also, some three empty Grand Soul Gems spawn in nearby dungeons after accepting Melisande's quest. You can find them in Crayfish Cave south of Cheydinhal, the Nornal ruins southwest of Cheydinhal, and the Squandered Mine south of Cheydinhal. If you'd really rather not deal with all that dungeon crawling, then you can also just use theOblivion console command\"player.additem 000382DF 5\" to add five empty gems directly to your inventory. After you deliver the Soul Gems to Melisande, she asks you to gather a long list of other ingredients for the potion. The Bloodgrass, Garlic, and Nightshade are easy enough to find, but the Blood of an Argonian and Ashes of a Powerful Vampire are understandably tricky to come by. You can use the Enchanted Dagger Melisande gives you to collect the Blood of an Argonian, but you have to find a willing donor first. There are Argonian challengers in the third round of the arena if you haven't done that questline yet, and Argonians sometimes show up in random bandit groups. Veyond Cave is filled with hostile Argonian bandits, too, and that's the best bet for most players. It's just a short walk north of Bravil. As for the Ashes of a Powerful Vampire, you have totrack down the vampire Hindaril in Redwater Slough. When you kill him, he'll drop Ashes of Hindaril instead of the usual Vampire Dust. Once you deliver everything to Melisande, wait 24 hours and the potions will be ready. You'll get a normal Cure Vampirism potion that you can drink to cure yourself, and you'll also get a \"Vampirism Cure Potion\" that is specifically for Hassildor's wife. To complete the quest, just return the second potion to Hassildor for a reward. Porphyric Hemophilia is a disease in Oblivion that turns you into a vampire if you aren't cured in time. Any time a vampire attacks you, they have a chance to infect you with Porphyric Hemophilia, beginning your eventual transformation. You'll usually find vampires in caves hidden away from the general public but there are a few potential encounters with vampires during the opening hours of Oblivion after exiting the Imperial Prison Sewer. The disease progresses slowly at first, so it may take several hours for you to realize that you've been turned and need to seek out that vampire cure. If you want to become a vampire in Oblivion, all you have to do is find an existing vampire and let them hit you a few times. All melee attacks from a vampire have a chance to inflict the Porphyric Hemophilia disease, so it's pretty easy to start your vampiric transformation if you want to go down that path. Porphyric Hemophilia transforms you into a vampire once you sleep after three in-game days. There are also a few quests that reward you with vampirism in Oblivion. Completing all of the Dark Brotherhood quests offered by Vicente Valtieri, for example, unlocks a new minor quest called Darkness Eternal that involves Valtieri turning you into a vampire. Just speak to him after completing his final Dark Brotherhood quest \"The Assassinated Man\" and select the conversation topic \"Dark Gift.\" Then, sleep in a bed so Valtieri can do his thing and infect you with Porphyric Hemophilia. The Mehrunes' Razor DLC quest included in Game of the Year Edition of Oblivion also has an easy way to become a vampire. At the end of the quest \"Uncovering Mehrunes' Razor,\" consume the Beating Heart from Msirae Faythung. This will infect you with both Porphyric Hemophilia and Cannibal's Prion. If you wait three in-game days for the vampiric transformation to complete, you can use the Cure Disease spell—or certain potions and foods—to rid yourself of cannibalistic tendencies while retaining your vampiric form. Don't try to cure yourself before becoming a vampire, though, since Porphyric Hemophilia can be removed like other diseases. Becoming a vampire drastically changes the game, and there are several pros and cons to vampirism in Oblivion. Once you become a vampire, you will gain a new active effect in your journal called \"Vampirism.\" This effect measures the severity of your condition. It increases over time, but you can reduce it by feeding on NPCs and drinking their blood. No matter how often you feed, you cannot reduce the vampirism effect below 25. Every 24 in-game hours spent without feeding will increase the vampirism meter by 25. The higher your vampire meter increases, the more intense the buffs and debuffs associated with the condition become. You won't be attacked on sight like in other Elder Scrolls games though, no matter how vamped-up you get. You can still go about your daily life as a vampire in Cyrodiil as long as you can put up with the other downsides. The most debilitating effect of vampirism in Oblivion is sun damage. Being outside during the day will continually reduce your HP when your vampirism value is 50 or higher. So going just one day without feeding makes you vulnerable to sun damage. Damage increases as the sun's light gets harsher (peaking around midday), and fast travel and waiting are completely disabled when you're exposed to sunlight. All vampires also have a weakness to fire that worsens as your condition grows from 25 to 100. Your character's appearance also changes as you go longer without feeding. Your character will visibly age, their eyes will become red, and their skin will look sickly. Some NPCs may even refuse to speak to you if your vampirism has progressed too far. You need to feed regularly to counteract these debuffs. Feeding reduces your vampirism condition back to 25, but there are a bunch of buffs for players who are able to manage the weaknesses of carrying around a higher vamp score. As your vampirism condition progresses from 25 to 100, you'll get buffs to attributes, gain new abilities, and more. These are the attributes and skills that will improve as you avoid feeding. You will gain +5 points to each of these attributes and skills each day that you go without feeding, capped +20 after four consecutive days without drinking any blood. Your resistance to normal weapons also increases by 5% each day with a maximum resistance of 20%. All vampires have a natural immunity to disease and paralysis. Plus, they get these abilities as their condition progresses. Time Without Feeding Ability Effect 0-24 Hours Hunter's Sight Night Eye for 30 seconds on self Detect Life within 100 feet for 30 seconds on self Costs 5 Magicka 24-48 Hours Vampire's Seduction Charm 50 points for 20 seconds on touch Can be used once per day 48-72 Hours Reign of Terror Silence within 20 feet for 60 seconds Demoralize enemies up to level six for 60 seconds on touch Can be used once per day 72+ Hours Embrace of Shadows Night Eye for 90 seconds on self Invisibility for 180 seconds on self Can be used once per day Remember that feeding on NPCs will reduce your vampire meter down to the base level of 25 and remove most of these buffs. Being a vampire is a balancing act, so starve yourself of blood strategically. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "How to join the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion",
    "article_text": "Here are the steps you need to take to join the mysterious assassin's guild. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Note:This guide works for both The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Oblivion Remastered. In Oblivion, no guild is as secretive or as deadly as the Dark Brotherhood. This ancient assassin's guild isn't like the other factions in Oblivion in that you can't just walk up to their front door and ask to join—it's pretty hard to even find their front door in the first place. If you've been talking to some of Oblivion's citizens, you've probably heard a few of the rumors about the Dark Brotherhood, but there's only one way to find this shadowy society if you want to join the ranks of assassins: you have to encourage them to find you. Here are the steps to follow to join the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion: The first step is actually pretty simple:kill someone. But you can't kill just anyone. The assassins of the Dark Brotherhood aren't interested if you kill some fort bandit or hedge wizard or other hostile person who is trying to kill you right back. You need tocommit murder by killing an innocent. We have some specific suggestions further down the page about who to kill, but you should avoid killing people who give quests or run shops or are otherwise important to your day-to-day business. There are also lots of \"essential\" NPCs who can't be killed: you can spot them by a crown icon appearing when you try to talk to them. If you've done it properly you'll see a message on your screen once your victim is dead: \"Your killing has been observed by forces unknown…\" That means the Dark Brotherhood is now aware of you. Your next step is togo to sleep. Find a bed at an inn or somewhere safe and choose to sleep. You'll see a message saying \"The air grows chill and a shadow approaches…\" You'll then wake up to meet Lucien Lachance, a Dark Brotherhood member, who will explain what you'll need to do to join the Dark Brotherhood. Surprise: he wants you to kill someone else. Lucien will instruct you tokill a man named Rufioin the Inn of Ill Omen, north of Bravil. You can speak to the Inn's owner, Manheim, or look in the basement where you'll find Rufio. Attack Rufio or talk to him first: either way he won't try to leave the basement. The easiest thing to do is sleep right there in Rufio's bed. Lucien will return and tell you to go to Cheydinhal and look for the abandoned house near the eastern wall, enter its basement (it'll take a lockpick), and look for the basement door (it's marked with a skull and red handprint, very inconspicuous). When asked a question at that door, answer with \"Sanguine, my Brother.\" That's it! You're now in the Dark Brotherhood and your first real contract awaits. Good luck, killer. Part of the grisly fun of joining the Dark Brotherhood is deciding who will be your first kill to get the assassin's guild's attention, but if you can't choose for yourself, here are a few suggestions. NPC Location Notes Alga Honmund's House, Bruma, south of the Fighter's Guild She's a good one to pick because will respawn later if killed Dralora Athram Ulen Athram's House, Imperial City, Talos Plaza District She isn't tied to any quests Glarthir Glarthir's House, Skingrad After completing the quest \"Paranoia\" he can be killed without acquiring a bounty Captain Renault Tutorial Captain Renault dies in the tutorial during the ambush, so you can kill her before the enemies do Roxanne Brigette Skooma Den, Bravil She can be killed in front of the other skooma addicts and they won't report it Adventurer Random caves You might randomly meet one in a cave, though it's not a sure thing The Adoring Fan The Arena, Imperial City The Adoring Fan. The upside (or downside) is he'll respawn in a few days Lazare Milvan Lazare Milvan's House, Skingrad, across from All Things Alchemical He's just kind of a snooty jerk Fallout 4 cheats: Nuclear codesNew Vegas console commands: Stacked deckSkyrim Anniversary Edition: What it includesSkyrim console commands: Tune your TamrielSkyrim Special Edition mods: More for the Nords Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Here's what you can expect from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, from full price to features list. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Oblivion Remaster is real, it's here, and it's actually a lot bigger—file size and ambition-wise—than we were expecting. This isn't just a conversion to a 16:9 aspect ratio and a \"remastered version\" upgrade listing on Oblivion's store page. This thing is a whole $50 game, 115GB download, with a visual and interface overhaul that I'm surprised Bethesda didn't try to bill as a full \"remake\" instead. Here's everything else you'll want to know about Oblivion Remastered, from its price, features, visual upgrades, new content, and more. Oblivion Remastered launched on April 22, 2025. Bethesda announced the launch during its reveal stream on the same day which was supposed to be one of those \"and it's out now!\" surprises. It would have been, if not for themonths of leaksleading up to the reveal. Oblivion Remastered is availableon Steamfor $50/£50 and throughGame Pass. It's $60/£60 for the deluxe edition with exclusive armor, weapons, and horse armor. Yes, Bethesda really is selling horse armor again. Oblivion Remastered includes: The visual update in Oblivion Remastered is actually pretty big. As well it should be, for that 115GB file size. During the reveal, Bethesda and Virtuous explained how Unreal Engine 5 is powering a lot of the beautiful lighting and other visual updates. Here are some of the visual updates in the remaster: During the reveal, Bethesda and remaster developers Virtuous explained that \"We think of the Oblivion game engine as the brain and Unreal 5 as the body. The brain drives all the world logic and gameplay and the body brings to life the experience that players have loved for almost 20 years.\" What that seems to mean, practically, is that Virtuous spent time modernizing certain old Oblivion features but left others largely unchanged to fit with the spirit of the game. So far as we can tell, it really is Oblivion under the hood in there. Here's what's changed (and not) in the remaster: Feature Remastered Unchanged Levelling Now inspired by Oblivion and Skyrim levelling systems Level skills by using related actions (bunny hopping for Acrobatics confirmed) Third-person camera Updated with reticle and functionality Lockpicking New visuals Same old difficult minigame Persuasion New visuals Same weird minigame NPC dialogue New voice recordings for different races That old awkward conversation timing stays Sprinting You can sprint, wow! Oblivion Remastered does have a command console that you can open with ~ and many of the oldOblivion console commandsseem to work. Mods are a slightly different story. Given how much of Oblivion seems to be intact beneath the visual changes, modding Oblivion Remastered may still be pretty powerful. Your old Oblivion mods won't work out of the box though and modders will have to at least make some adjustments to get them working again. We'll see just how big of an adjustment that winds up being. The fullOblivion system specscall for a pretty hefty 125GB of storage space on your drive, though the download itself is 115GB on Steam. Here are the recommended specs: Yeah, it's the same old clunker under there—rejoice! Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Bethesda is selling the 19-year-old RPG glow-up for $50, which I consider on the cusp of reasonable.Yesterday, I said I'd be on boardif the price was closer to $30 than $70, so of course Bethesda chose the exact middle point. I was ready to hold out for a sale, but then I learned there already is one:Fanaticalis selling the Steam version of Oblivion Remastered at a decent 17% discount, which brings the tag down to a palatable $41.50. If it's your first time buying through Fanatical, rest assured it's one of the legit PC game vendors.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered sails past 120,000 concurrent players on Steam just a few hours after launch",
    "article_text": "The people have spoken, When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, it's a hit: Just a couple hours after it went live,Oblivion Remasteredis grinding its way up Steam's most played list, and has now surpassed more than 120,000 concurrent players on the platform. We knew there was a lot of excitement for Oblivion Remastered, which hungry Elder Scrolls fans have been clamoring for since its existence was first leaked in 2023. But whether that would translate into sales was another question entirely, especially given the game's$50 price tag—$60 if you want thenew horse armor—and its presence on Game Pass. By all appearances the remastered edition is a major rework but even so, it's a 19-year-old RPG at its core, one an awful lot of us have already played to death. Consider the question answered. At this moment more than 120,000 people are playing Oblivion Remastered on Steam alone, good enough for 9th place on Steam's most-played list and within spitting distance of—gasp!—the great Baldur's Gate 3. Given how it's been going—the concurrent player count was a little over 102,000 when I started writing this—that number will also certainly have gone up by the time you read this. That also crushes the all-time peak concurrent player count of Skyrim Special Edition, previously the \"newest\" Elder Scrolls game, whichSteamDBsays topped out at 69,906 concurrent players on Steam back in 2016. It pains me to admit it, but a lot of the people currently immersing themselves in Uriel Septim's shenanigans are very likely doing so for the first time: People who weren't even born when Oblivion originally arrived in 2006 are now entering college, and for them the remaster represents an opportunity to see what all the fuss is about without having to deal with the headaches of running old games on new hardware, and graphics and gameplay systems that are, to put it politely, dated. Bethesda alluded to that new audience in a message posted toBluesky. \"We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil,\" the studio wrote. \"But there are also many who have never played it. \"We can't thank you enough for all the support you have given us and our games over the years. Our hope with this remaster is that no matter who you are, when you step out of the Imperial sewer—you feel like you're experiencing it for the first time.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I'm not a huge fan of Oblivion myself—it's good, just notthatgood—but even I have to admit that its \"step out moment,\" to useTodd Howard's term, is one of the best of any Bethesda game: The sensation of emerging into a wide-open fantasy world, with nothing ahead but freedom and adventure, is genuinely peak Elder Scrolls. Bear in mind that this big number only applies to Steam: It does not account for players on consoles—Oblivion Remastered is also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5—or those who pick it up on the Windows Store, and it's also available on Game Pass. It's also relatively early in the day for gamers in North America, many of whom won't be able to dive in until they're home from work or school. I stand by my prediction that the thrill willfade fairly quickly—it is a 19-year-old videogame, after all, and not the best of the series—but right now I also predict that number is going to keep going up for a good while yet. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's much less game in Tape 2, but a strong narrative conclusion is worth seeing. It won't take long, either. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Note: This review contains spoilers for both Tape 1 and Tape 2 of Lost Records. When I sat down to play Lost Records: Bloom & Rage’s Tape 2, I was surprised just how much anticipation I felt. Overtwo months since the release of its first part, Bloom, the quartet of punk girls finding themselves through riot grrrl had sunk into my heart. How could they not when I saw so much of myself—who I was, who I wanted to be—in them. What is it?A choices-filled narrative adventure through '90s girlhood nostalgia Release date:Part 1 February 18, 2025; Part 2 April 15, 2025 Price:$40 / £36 Multiplayer:No Developer:Don't Nod Montréal Publisher:Don't Nod Reviewed On:RTX 3060 Ti, Intel i7-10700F, 32GB DDR4 Steam Deck:Verified Link:Official site Tape 1 ended in a messy but emotional climax that revealed Kat, the weird girl of the group who makes zines and feels like the small town is killing her, is indeed dying. Leukemia. Much in the mold of Stand By Me, it was obvious this would be everyone's last summer together, though with supernatural elements and many questions left unanswered, a part of me hoped that we could amend this past, record over the tape, or rewind to some point that would change things. Tape 2, Rage, instead leaves mostly dead space. I want to draw out the wordplay. It’s mimetic how Tape 2 arrives after delays that belie some development problems. Bugs give it away, and so does the short length. Tape 2 is not a whole second part, but a third act. It feels like its flame is burning up too bright, too soon. And so is Kat’s, right? There’s some probably unintentional meaning there, and it affects me, though I’m left wanting to see all that could have been if both Don't Nod Montreal and Kat had more time. Tape 2 adds very little new to engage with. As in Bloom, I pick up intricately modeled objects around the levels, examine them, and find clues to the story and puzzles. I also use Swann’s camcorder to record these memories and edit together videos. There are gestures towards some iteration that could’ve been (in one scene Nora misremembers a story and time is rewound like a tape) but there is ultimately very little play in Tape 2. At least half of the four hours must have been spent in cutscenes, which did still offer me dialogue choices that continued to shape my relationships to each girl, but were edited together with more noticeable gaps and continuity errors. It starts to look like an unintentional '90s homage to Xenogears and itsinfamously curtailed disc 2that was all visual novel instead of JRPG. While there's little for me to actually do, Tape 2 does reach its narrative and thematic conclusion. It still feels too fast, but this is almost appropriate given Kat's dwindling vitality. And while I have not yet read closely the many branches that the ending accommodates to consider how much can change in response to the player, I can see how the ending is shaped around the relationships I chose to prioritize. I don’t think there’s any bad ending, but some emphasize the bigger themes the game is interested in. And those are worth talking about. It shows gay bashing and intimate partner violence as much a part of a nostalgia for the '90s that remains unspoken, but not unremembered It is not just Kat who must die. In the finale each girl is beaten, chased, harassed, and torn from girlhood, the impetus for their coming-of-age being the death of their innocence to the violence in the world. This grows from the discordant undertones of nostalgia heard in Tape 1. It shows gay bashing and intimate partner violence as much a part of a nostalgia for the '90s that remains unspoken, but not unremembered. Lost Records makes its protagonists feel as viscerally strong as the movement—empowered by riot grrrl and feminism and makeup and each other—and as weak as the children they are—powerless to remain together once Swann’s family moves away at the end of the summer. There is another axis. Not powerless, but consigned to be abused. Ultimately, what the quartet rebels against with their songs, their hair, their makeup, their clothes, their friendship, and their intimacy is the violence of men. In the present day Nora recalls how we snuck into Kat’s house, broke her out to watch the meteor shower. She offers me a cigarette outside the bar but I decline. I pick up her lighter, turn it over. When she was 16, Nora sang about how small the man was who called her a dyke. She had probably seenFire Walk With Me when it came out a few years earlier, far too young to understand but woman enough to know what Lynch saw beneath Americana. Now 27 years later she has scratched the title, Laura Palmer’s fate, onto another disposable body. And this is why Lost Records’ nostalgia in Tape 1 has been resonant to so many queer and trans womenplaying it this year, why these memories are different from the conservative kind snaking through games culture today. It’s all ephemeral. We don’t hold onto it. Don’t repeat those violences. We realize something like no other has been missing since we were young. Something that can’t be replaced. And it's why Tape 2's fire is as much a form of nostalgia as the trinkets and movie rentals. They say boys will be boys: Log on todox a streamer,harass a dev, rage against a world that let the ashes fly. They never forgot the violence of the ‘90s. They just miss the flame.

    "title": "It's happening again: Oblivion Remastered is selling new horse armor like it's 2006",
    "article_text": "The old horse armor is included in the $50 version, but if you want the new horse armor, that's extra. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remasteredis out now, and it costs $50 ($67 CAD in my country!) for the standard edition of the game—a hefty price tag for an update of a 20-year-old RPG. But if you want to give Bethesda even more of your money, there's also a deluxe edition available for $10 more—and you better believe it's got horse armor. Horse armor, in case you missed the fun back in 2006, was a post-launch add-on for the original Oblivion: For a couple bucks, you could buy your pretend horse some pretend armor that nobody would ever see unless they came over to your house and watched you play the game. The whole thing was ridiculous and widely (and rightly) mocked, but—and here's the rub—people bought it. For all the well-deserved ridicule it took,horse armor won. Cosmetic microtransactions are now so commonplace we barely bat an eye at them. So here we are in the year 2025, and yup, we're doing it all over again. The OG horse armor is included in the standard edition of Oblivion Remastered, but for 10 bucks more you can get two new horse armor sets, the Armor of Order and Armor of Cataclysm. That's not all of it: The deluxe edition also includes new weapons and player armor, along with a digital art book and soundtrack, and the soundtrack is probably worth the extra money on its own—it's a good one, and sells for $10 all by itself onSteam. So if you're going to pony up $50 for the game anyway, what's an extra tenner? There's some faux-upset about the new horse armor onRedditandSteam, but for the most part people are laughing it off and having fun with it—quite a reflection of just how much the landscape has changed over the past 20 years. I'm not even really mad about it myself. I refused to buy the original horse armor back in the day as a matter of principle (although I eventually ended up with it as part of the Knights of the Nine expansion) but now, well, this is the path we've chosen and I tip my hat to Bethesda for having the stones to rub everyone's face in it. Nicely played. Lest there be any doubt, the presence of horse armor (or the fact that Oblivion is thethird or maybe fourth-bestgame in The Elder Scrolls series) is not keeping fans from throwing their money at it: Oblivion Remasteredshot to the top of the Steam best-sellers listalmost immediately after it launched. Horse armor really did win.

    "title": "An 'immersive' MrBeast Experience saw disappointed fans left in the lurch for 3 days, fobbed-off with cheap merch, and waiting in hotel rooms for days to receive 'a box of chocolates'",
    "article_text": "\"We got a box of Feastables on day one and on day two we got the merch bag… that was the entire experience.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. An \"immersive\" and \"unforgettable\" MrBeast Experience in Las Vegas that cost attendees $1,000 for a three-day ticket ended in acrimony and disappointment for fans. The event was such a failure that MrBeast himself has subsequently apologised, and promised full refunds. This event is one of the latest commercial spinoffs for the MrBeast empire, promising fans a three-night stay over April 13 to 15 at Resorts World Las Vegas, during which they'd receive the following: an exclusive MrBeast \"mystery bag\" of limited-edition merch, on-site activations and immersive experiences, \"exclusive menu items… themed beverages\", and one participant would receive a voucher redeemable for $10,000 in cash. Well, that was the plan. Instead, fans arrived at Resorts World and were told to wait in their hotel rooms for their mystery bags, with some staying in their rooms for days. Necessary context here is that many of MrBeast's most popular videos set isolation or endurance challenges, so it makes sense some attendees would interpret the wait for the mystery bag as a coded challenge. \"I was told to wait in my room for two days for a package to come, so I legit spent two days in my room for a package to come, and it was a box of chocolates,\" Theresa Metta told 8NewsNow (via the BBC). \"It should have been like mini-games, meet and greets, photo ops, special drinks, and things,\" added Metta. \"Unfortunately, we didn't get any of that.\" The mystery bags also included MrBeast t-shirts and gear in random sizes, which are available for $9 online, leading some to speculate they were being fobbed-off with unsold stock. \"Nothing happened for the first two days,\" said attendeeMythLabb on Reddit. \"The welcome gift was a box of chocolate bars and the mystery bag was four shirts in random sizes (ours were two XXS, one M, one L), a pair of XXL shorts, and a hat. Nobody at Resorts World had a clue what else was going on. It feels like the employees were only told about the mystery bag, but nobody at the restaurants knew about the 'activations' or any schedule of events (which there weren’t any).\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We went to it and paid $999 for three nights at Resorts World,\"adds PiedPiperCOO. \"We got a box of Feastables on day one and at 2:30pm on day two we got the merch bag with three random sized t-shirts, shorts, and a hat. That was the entire experience.\" This seems to track with most peoples' experience: they got a bag of random tat, but none of the event's other promises were fulfilled. A video posted by the holiday channel Random Recess shows Resort World CEO Alex Dixon attempting to placate fans on the final day (with the aid of free donuts). The event has now been scrubbed from the hotel's website. MrBeast has yet to issue an official statement, but has responded to several complaints on X: \"This definitely isn’t the experience we hoped they’d deliver,\"said MrBeast. \"My team’s already on it—I’d love to personally make it up to you and anyone else by inviting everybody affected to tour my actual studio!\" The YouTuber later added that \"everyone will get their money back and we called the people who purchased the experience and are flying them down to my studio [...] I’ll make sure they’re happy.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "Take my money Todd. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the worst-kept secrets in videogames finally broke cover today, with Bethesda both revealing and shadow-droppingthe remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. The game comes with a $50 price tag (and is also available on Game Pass), which some weren't expecting, but despite that has instantly shot to the top ofSteam's best-seller list. I won't be able to dive in myself till this evening, but the reveal makes this look a little bit more like a remake than a remaster, if we're splitting hairs. The big question among fans will be whether this shiny and polished new version of the game retains the absurdity of the 2006 original which, with the best will in the world, was constantly a funny experience even when it didn't mean to be. The remaster was co-developed by Bethesda and Virtuos, and as well as the standard edition comes in a deluxe edition featuring an artbook, soundtrack, and various cosmetics including, yes,extra-special deluxehorse armour. As for how it runs, Bethesda's Tom Mustaine says Oblivion Remastered is aiming to be \"more friendly to gamers with modern hardware. This is Oblivion in its most complete form.\" Virtuos executive producer Alex Murphy adds \"we've leveraged nearly every major feature from Unreal Engine 5.\" Though this does mean that, where the original was 4.6 GB in size, the remaster isa fairly whopping 125 GB. None of which is going to put off the Cyrodiil sickos. Oblivion is one of those games that creates lingering memories, not necessarily through the main quests but in all the highways and byways of its weird world, and the unexpected surprises squirreled-away in the most unlikely places—as well as stony faced NPCschatting away while they burn in lava.

    "title": "Here are the Oblivion Remastered system specs: 'More friendly to gamers with modern hardware' and Steam Deck Verified",
    "article_text": "There's Lumen software and hardware ray tracing, so no RTX actually required. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Of course I just hit the download button as soon as the livestream had finished and they said \"The Oblivion remaster will be available... today.\" But if you want a quick heads-up as to the hardware you're going to need in your rig to be able to play the TES classic here are the deets: Minimum Recommended OS Window 10 64-bit Windows 10 64-bit Processor AMD Ryzen 5 2600X, Intel Core i7 6800K AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Intel Core i5 10600K Memory 16 GB RAM 32 GB RAM Graphics AMD Radeon RX 5700 or Nvidia GeForce 1070 Ti AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT or Nvidia RTX 2080 DirectX Version 12 Version 12 Storage 125 GB available space 125 GB available space Tom Mustaine, external projects and studio director at Bethesda, noted that it was making Oblivion Remastered \"more friendly to gamers with modern hardware. This is Oblivion in its most complete form.\" Basically, less potato-faced and hard on the 2025 eyeballs. I mean, in my mind's eye Oblivion remains pin sharp, and beautiful, but that's because I haven't played it for a good many years now. And from looking at the side-by-sides from the recent livestream you can see the extra detail and lighting effects the switch to Unreal Engine 5 has given it. But, thankfully for your GPU, no RTX minimums here, as the game doesn't appear to have any RTX ray tracing baked into it, just a pretty \"advanced real-time lighting system\" that's built out of UE5's Lumen system. If your rig doesn't support hardware Lumn ray tracing you can fall back to the software version for the lighting system instead. \"We've leveraged nearly every major feature from Unreal Engine 5,\" says Alex Murphy, executive producer at Virtuos, the remaster's developer. Given the fact that the studio has created new character models and \"stunning landscapes that use millions of polygons in each asset\" you can understand why the file size is so damned big. But oof,125 GB?! Those are some detailed models and high-res textures right there. I guess that's one of the reasons you're also going to need to have 16 GB of RAM in your system, too. Though that's where gaming is absolutely going, it does seem pretty high for the memory requirements to be set at 16 GB, with 32 GB the recommendation.

    "title": "Hot damn: The Oblivion Remaster is 125 GB, 2600% heavier than the original game from 2006",
    "article_text": "UE5 is throwing its weight around. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, they did it. They really did it. A brisk 19 years after the original game's release, Bethesda went back and slathered a thick layer of Unreal Engine 5 over The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion's beating Gamebryo heart.It's out now, it's $50 (£50), and you even get the horse armour thrown in (except, um, the special deluxe edition horse armour). Don't say Todd Howard never did anything for you. But oh, what's this? Cyrodiil certainly has expanded since I slotted it into my Xbox 360 disc drive back in 2006. Where the original game asks only a svelte 4.6 GB of drive space per its system reqs on Steam, the remaster wants, uh, more. Quite a bit more: it wants 125 GB. Fair's fair, though: that's only an economical 115 GB download thanks to Steam's compression. That's a size increase of about 2600%, if you're a relativity fan. At 125 GB, it slots in neatly at seventh place in our list of thebiggest games by install size, shunting Red Dead Redemption 2 down to eighth place (though, full transparency, it's been a little while since we last updated that list—the Oblivion Remaster probably isn'tactuallythe seventh largest game ever made). But damn, it's a meaty one. I can't be too mad, though. I have to admit: a bit of weirdness with some character faces aside (my beautiful Betto Plotius, what have they done to you?), the remaster does look gorgeous. Bethesda and Virtuos say—in terms I can understand—that they've got UE5 handling the graphics and good old Gamebryo handling the core logic. That's a whole lot of game to put in one place. It's no surprise it's put on a few pounds in the transformation. That's what really excites me, I have to say. Keeping Gamebryo intact should mean all that beautiful Bethesda jank, the stuff Howard grimaces and calls \"charm\" in the reveal vid, ought to still be there in its full glory. Stilted conversations? You bet. Amiable idiots wandering into deathtraps in single-file? Absolutely. Some guy ascending corporeally to heaven because the physics engine forgot how gravity works for a sec? If it's not in there, I quit. Beautiful but still weird? That's just what I want from an Oblivion remaster, so I'm eager to get my hands on all 125 GB of this one. Now all I need to know is what's gonna become of all my mods, and I can meander through Cyrodiil a happy man. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "\"Tony reprogrammed him back to his original purpose.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The first thought that comes to mind when I think ofUltronis: Toaster that got access to the internet and immediately formed a hatred of all humanity—valid. This hatred is the most defining feature of Ultron's character, which is why some players are a little confused as to whyMarvel Rivalsmay assign him the role of Strategist. Ultron wasannounced alongside Emma Frostat the start of Marvel Rivals Season 2. While Frost was added straight away, Ultron won't likely turn up until the mid-season break. Despite no concrete information being released yet for Ultron, the general sentiment is that he will be a Strategist, mostly due to leaked information from back in December. Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles So far, there's mostly just cute, cuddly, and caring heroes for Strategists, the healing role in Marvel Rivals, with the slight exception of Loki. But otherwise, the role is full of heroes like my beloved Jeff the Land Shark, Luna Snow, and Invisible Woman, all characters who I think would go out of their way to help someone in need, unlike Ultron. For those of you who haven't watched Age of Ultron or read any of his comics, you may not know that despite being designed as a peacekeeper, he turned against his directive and instead tried to commit an extinction-level genocide against humanity. This was after gaining access to the internet and realising that the greatest threat to peace is humanity, so I can't imagine he'd be first in line to heal an annoying Spider-Man who just won't sit still. Although one player thinksthey've figured outhow Marvel Rivals will justify this change of character: \"To people who complained about Ultron being a Strategist because he would not help anyone in the lore, Tony reprogrammed him back to his original purpose.\" Alongside this is a screenshot of Tony seemingly rebooting an out-of-service Ultron. There are a couple of other theories circulating, including the possibility that Ultron develops a separate personality, or that he teams up with Marvel heroes to defeat Doom simply because he dislikes him and doesn't want him to rule the multiverse. But Ultron wouldn't make for a bad Strategist just because he dislikes humans and doesn't think they deserve to be saved: In the end, it's all about the abilities he brings to the fight. And I'm sure there'll be a good reason for his involvement in the lore of Marvel Rivals. So far, the devs have stayed pretty close to the heroes' source material, so I trust them not to take unexplained character U-turns. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This may all still just be speculation, but I'm really holding out hope that Ultron will be the ninth Strategist in Marvel Rivals, because I want to play as someone slightly more menacing than Jeff the Land Shark.

    "title": "Thank Todd: The Oblivion remaster is here and you can play it right now",
    "article_text": "I've heard others say the same. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Did you clap your hands? Say your prayers? Remember to drink your Ovaltine? You must have done, because Bethesda's only gone and shadowdropped the Oblivion remaster the exact same day it officially revealed the dang thing, just as prophecy foretold. Good news: you probably can. PC Gamer's hardware team has already had a pick-through of theOblivion remaster's system requirements, and things are looking pleasantly un-demanding despite all the pretty-fication. Not that the reveal was a surprise, mind you. The existence of an Oblivion remaster has been the worst-kept secret in videogames ever since a court document splashed the goss across the front pagesback in September 2023. Of course, that document—a leaked Microsoft presentation—had the game down as releasing in fiscal year 2022, which is, hang on, let me work it out,beforethe likes of you and me got our mitts on it, so it was anyone's guess as to whether it had been cancelled or not, or whether it ever really existed at all. That is, until rumours and supposed leaks began to circulate in the last few months that the game was due an imminent announcement and release. Rumours and leaks that kept repeating themselves with increasing volume and frequency, driving poor, benighted Oblivion fans to the brink ofSilksong-style madnessin their zeal for just a crumb of actual, solid info. But wily Todd Howard kept his powder dry. Until today. We didn't just get a crumb of info, we got a whole loaf: the Oblivion remaster is here and it costs$50 (£50), and it's out on Game Pass too. The look we got at it during its reveal sure makes me curious to get a go at the full thing. It's all shiny and uprezzed, yes, and honestly looks more like the kind of thing you'd ordinarily call a 'remake' rather than a 'remaster,' but I'm mostly eager to know if the polish-up has left Oblivion's absurd, beating heart intact. Bethesda and Virtuos promise it has, but I need to find out for myself. Because say what you like about it (and as a Morrowind stalwart, I will), but Oblivion is the funniest game Bethesda ever released. Possibly one of the funniest games of all time. The precise combination of Bethesda's ambitions with the limits of the technology of 2006 made for a game that was constantly, brilliantly weird—funny enough that itsunmatched comic timingis still enough to go viral nearly two decades after it first came out. If two people don't have a banal conversation while one of them slowly burns to death in lava in this thing, I'm calling the whole remaster a failure. I'll find out soon enough. Relatively soon enough; I might be waiting a bit for all125 GB of this beast(2600% bigger than the original) to slouch down my bandwidth and set up shop on an acre or two of my SSD.

    "title": "Get your game online-ready in hours with Planetary Processing",
    "article_text": "Multiplayer game development has just gotten easier than ever thanks to this online game development tool. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Game development is a process that's as beautiful as it is painstaking. For every moment of inspired design, thoughtfully crafted level, or clever solution to a programming puzzle that once seemed unsolvable, there's bug fixing, data entry, and other less glamorous—but equally essential—parts of the craft. And if you're taking your game online—whether it's a small-scale project with multiplayer co-op or a full-on MMO—then the challenge increases further still, as you need to get into the trenches with server management, multiplayer networking, and all that other stuff that takes you away from more fun and creative parts of development. That's where Planetary Processing comes in, a tool that provides the infrastructure for you to be able to host online games while keeping your workloads low. There's no need for writing up dreary netcode, because whether you're working with Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, or many others, the tool has plugins that let you integrate multiplayer functionality without jumping through all the hoops. Just install whichever ready-made plugin you need, and you're good to start getting your game online-ready. The game logic is handled server-side, so as a developer you just write some Lua scripts, and let the tool take care of the online technicalities such as synchronising game state and player connection handling. Within just a few hours of focused fiddling in the accessible interface, you could well have a multiplayer prototype for your game up and running! Planetary Processing has become super-scalable too. Addressing feedback that the tool was too heavily oriented around MMOs, the devs released the 'Dimensions' update a few months ago. This makes it easier for developers to create instances within their game worlds (such as dungeons and special encounters), as well as online games that rely on private sessions rather than just larger scale games built around public sessions and big servers (which, of course, PP can do too). The devs understand that development isn't cheap, especially if you're an indie just starting out. That's why the basic tier of Planetary Processing is free. This will get you full access to the tool's SDKs and online dashboard, which gives you an easy way to monitor and update your games in real-time. You'll be limited to 10 players and 10 dimensions per game, but for plenty of people that will be enough while still developing their game. You'll also get to benefit from the currently beta version of its new physics engine, which ensures entities in your online worlds collide and interact in a realistic way. Level up to the premium tier however, and you'll get unlimited server sizes and world sizes, multi-user access, and chunkloader entities that keep the game world loaded with no players around (important for those persistent online worlds). You'll get access to the in-progress HTTP API feature, which will let you perform various operations such as managing player accounts, and stopping and starting game instances using standard HTTP methods. All this comes out much cheaper than self-hosting, and you can even usePP's pricing calculatorto work out your monthly costs based on different server loads for your game. So if you're ready to take your game online with the path of least resistance, head over tothe official Planetary Processing siteto see which version suits your project. You can also keep up with the latest updates viaInstagram,X,andLinkedIn, andjoin the community on Discordwhere you can speak with fellow game devs, exchange ideas, and get help with using the tool. Finally, on the topic of help, head over to thePlanetary Processing YouTube channelfor tutorials, interviews, and more. The gateway to take your game online is here, all that's left for you to do is step through it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Thrustmaster T598 direct drive racing wheel review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While the feedback from the T598's wheelbase and the quality of the pedal set is very good for the price, a toy-like wheel rim spoils the experience significantly. You could upgrade it to get the best of both worlds, but then you're well into the competitive mid-range sim setup market—which rather defeats the point, if you ask me. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. When it comes to ultimate sim racing immersion, the tippity-top of racing wheel tech is widely considered to be direct drive. Attaching a wheel directly to a powerful electric motor results in instantaneous and highly-detailed feedback, the sort you'd receive if you really were at the helm of a fearsome, fire-breathing speed machine. Trouble is, they're expensive. Thrustmaster, however, has been a name in the racing wheel space for some time, and is known for delivering belt and hybrid-drive offerings for very reasonable money. Now it's released the Thrustmaster T598, a direct drive racing wheel bundle with a few tricks up its sleeve—the first being the price. For$499/£450, you get a direct drive wheelbase, a wheel rim, and an all-metal pedal set, which is downright astonishing for the cash. On paper, at least. Granted, it's not exactly money you might find down the back of the couch, but I was similarly astonished when I reviewed theMoza R5 bundle, which was then available for a very similar MSRP.Its price has varied since, but it's still our top recommendation for thebest budget direct drive racing wheel. An overbuilt, premium-feeling bit of kit, the little Moza has been my go-to sim racing companion ever since I first got my hands on it, so I was anxious to see what Thrustmaster was bringing to the party for similar cash. Force feedback:Direct-driveTorque:5 Nm (up to 10 Nm overshoot)Buttons:23, including paddle shiftersShifters:MagneticMounting:Desk clamps, sim rig-compatible attachment holesPedals:Included, accelerator and brake pedal with load cellPedal type:MagneticPrice:$499/£450 Which brings me to the second trick in the T598's repertoire. While the Moza delivers a maximum of 5 Nm of torque to your fingertips, the T598 makes use of a direct axial drive motor to deliver what it describes as 5 Nm of torque with an overshoot capability of +100%. In essence, it's able to boost the torque up to 10 Nm for brief moments—like simulating the sort of snap oversteer that attempts to wrench the wheel from your grip when you mess up a corner. Axial flux direct drive motors have their magnets aligned in parallel with the axis of the wheel, as opposed to the radial flux motors used in other direct drive wheels, which have magnets mounted in parallel with the wheel shaft. Thrustmaster says that an axial flux motor is able to deliver more responsive feedback than traditional, radial flux motors, and eliminates \"cogging.\" This is a phenomenon whereby the magnets aligned with the internal stator in a regular radial flux motor can cause a jerky, uneven sensation in the wheel movement, particularly at low speeds. It's not something I've found particularly bothersome in direct drive wheels I've used to date, but hey, getting rid of it entirely sounds like a good thing to me. There are some downsides to this tech, however, and the main one is size. The T598's wheelbase unit is a seriously chonky affair, and makes for a desk-dominating addition to a regular setup. It's an unwieldy object, and one that I wouldn't be too keen to keep in place for any longer than I needed to as a result. Included are two plastic desk clamps that slot into a screw-in lower metal frame, and I spent some time puzzling over the fitting instructions. Essentially, they're connected to the wheelbase primarily by the clamping force created when mounting them to the desk. There's a plastic tab that slots into a corresponding hole in the base to let you know you've oriented them correctly, but it's not a confidence-inspiring thing to do when dealing with a unit of this size and weight. Once secured the mounts feel fairly robust, although I question the use of plastic-on-plastic in the construction. A plastic screw grinding in a plastic socket doesn't feel like the strongest or most high-quality mounting solution Thrustmaster could have come up with, and the fact the clamps don't secure to the base independently raises an eyebrow. Still, money has to be saved somewhere, I suppose. Where it really shouldn't have been saved, however, is the wheel rim itself. While the rubber grips initially feel good, the wheel rim is hollow plastic—and significant sections of the outer diameter are left gripless, which reveals the tinny-feeling material underneath. The paddles are also plastic, with a slightly worrying amount of flex in the material, and the various buttons are of the thin and rattly variety. The T598's Raceline Pedal set is much better. It's an all-metal-construction, two pedal affair, with three adjustment notches and spare springs for tension and pedal feel. While the brake pedal lacks a piston-like load cell solution, a polyurethane stopping ring is included (along with a firmer spring) that performs a decent impression of one, giving a solid amount of resistance to the travel and an obvious end point for brake-stamping moments. A pet peeve of mine is an unsatisfying brake pedal, but the solid construction and adjustments on offer here makes the Thrustmaster's offering better than many other cheap units. There's no flex in the bottom plate, and a set of saw-toothed add-on grips gamely suggest that the pedals won't go backwards if you use them on a carpeted floor. This doesn't really work out in practice, as I still find them travelling away from me in heated moments. I'd still suggest you wedge something behind the pedals if you're not attaching them to a sim rig, but it's a nice attempt to solve a universal problem, regardless. So, to racing. The pedals attach to the T598 wheelbase with an included proprietary cable, the wheelbase connects to a PC with an included (and may I say, very high-quality) USB Type-A cable, and off to the virtual track we go. The whole kit and caboodle is controlled by My Thrustmaster Panel, which immediately recognises the wheel and updates the firmware automatically. Thanks, MTP. However, navigating to the main settings tab reveals a \"coming soon\" page. You can still check the inputs are working and the wheel is aligned correctly in a separate menu, but the placeholder page encourages you to use the onboard wheel settings menu to adjust the force feedback gain using the included display and wheel buttons. Which is not a particularly intuitive process. Fiddly menus, thin plastic controls, and a tiny little screen with abbreviated menu titles combine to create a frustrating adjustment experience, although for what it's worth the wheel itself works fine with the default options out of the box. Whacking the feedback gain up to 100% and jumping into Assetto Corsa Evo, I have to say the axial drive motor on offer here really is capable of delivering a lot of detail. Kerbs rumble, track surfaces are communicated through your fingertips, and the difference between a good set of tires and a bad set is night and day. All as it should be. And as for the 5 Nm's worth of overshoot? I'm notentirelysure I can feel it in action. The T598 is certainly capable of throwing you about, but I can't honestly say it feels any more powerful than the Moza, which is a bit of a disappointment given just how much extra desk space is taken up by the Thrustmaster's huge electric motor. I can't really recommend the T598 bundle without also recommending you swap out the wheel, which increases the price significantly That being said, when it comes to feel I'd say it's equivalent. By which I mean, pretty fantastic. It does an excellent job of conveying what the front tires are doing at all times, along with that spooky, direct drive-enhanced sensation that your rear wheels are ever-present behind you, even though they exist purely in the virtual ether. The whole experience is spoiled, however, by that cheap-feeling wheel rim. Keeping my hands in the ten and two o'clock positions means I'm in rubber grip territory, which feels decent. Move a hand up into the middle or bottom of the wheel and suddenly I find myself in hollow plastic land, complete with screw holes on the back of the rim I can feel with my fingertips. Worse than that, there's a seam running around the inside of the rim which ranges in feel from distracting, to downright palm-chafing. Two pieces of plastic meet right in the spot where your thumb and forefinger rest, which left me with sore hands and visible marks after a few hours' use. ✅You want detailed feedback:The T598 is capable of delivering plenty of giggle-inducing grunt, but it doesn't skimp on the small details. Be prepared to get intimate with every kerb.✅You want a good pedal set:The all-metal-construction pedals are a highlight, and much better than the price suggests. ❌You're not planning on upgrading the wheel rim in future:I'd swap the included rim out for something nicer at the earliest opportunity. It really doesn't feel like the same quality as other parts of the bundle.❌You want something desk-friendly:The direct axial motor might deliver plenty of detailed feedback, but it's also a large and unwieldy beast—and the all-plastic desk clamps don't inspire confidence. Those plastic shifter paddles aren't wonderful, either. Serviceable, sure, but I can't help but feel you should get more for your money than this, even if it is a \"budget\" product. The wheel rim just isn't satisfying to use, and lets the entire experience down. If you're buying a direct drive setup, you're spending a significant amount of cash on a motor system that delivers the maximum amount of immersion. Experiencing that immersion through a cheap-feeling wheel rim is a bit like eating a steak with plastic cutlery—the base experience is roughly the same, but you know it'd be so much better with a higher-quality set of, err, utensils. Of course, Thrustmaster will sell you different wheel rims to fit on the direct axial drive base, ranging from Ferrari-tie-in F1 style models to more traditional fare. But the point is, you're paying for a sim racing-ready direct drive bundle, and with this wheel attached to it, I don't think it is. Which leaves this review in an awkward position. While the base and the pedals are fantastic for the cash, I can't really recommend the T598 bundle without also recommending you swap out the wheel, which increases the price significantly. Whereas budget offerings from Moza and Fantatec feel like the whole package, wheel and all, straight out of the box. Alright, you'll probably want to spend a little extra cash on a proper brake load cell kit, as budget direct drive wheel bundles still leave them out of the package, for reasons that remain unclear. That's it, though. Job done, a-sim-racing you shall go. Which, now I've finished writing this review, I'm going to be doing this weekend. But with the Moza, and a wheel that feels worthy of a fully-fledged racing machine. While the feedback from the T598's wheelbase and the quality of the pedal set is very good for the price, a toy-like wheel rim spoils the experience significantly. You could upgrade it to get the best of both worlds, but then you're well into the competitive mid-range sim setup market—which rather defeats the point, if you ask me.

    "title": "Corsair Frame 4000D review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Corsair Frame 4000D is a feature-filled chassis with a decent price tag. It's absolutely built for those with an iCUE obsession and it looks superb with fans a-blaze in RGB hues. However, there is room for improvement and I'd like to see Corsair roll out lots of customisation options to really make this case sing. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. My first move with the Corsair Frame 4000D was to pull it apart, panel by panel, until I was left with nothing more than a basic frame. All of a sudden the name makes sense—you can remove and replace pieces of the Frame 4000D to match your mood and, with most removed, it offers unfettered access to its insides. Insides filled with clever features, many designed for Corsair's own ecosystem. A fairly standard size and shape, this mid-tower case is a little stubbier than the Phanteks G400A I have sat alongside it. It measures 48.6 x 49 x 23.9 cm (19.1 x 19.2 x 9.4-inches) and I've double checked those measurements and they do include the furthest reaches of the thumbscrews on the rear of the case. It comes in black or white, and with or without fans, and there's a small price increase depending on which fans you opt for, if any. Here's what you should expect to pay: Size:Mid-towerMotherboard support:E-ATX (305mm x 277mm), ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITXDimensions:48.6 x 49 x 23.9 cm (19.1 x 19.2 x 9.4-inches)Weight:10.03 kgMaximum GPU length:430 mmRadiator support:Up to 360 mm (top, front + side)Fan support:Up to 2x 200 mm (front), 2x 140 mm/3x 120 mm (top, side)Fans included:No (reviewed), but options availableStorage bays:2 3.5-inch/4 2.5-inchFront panel: 1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x 3.5 mmPrice:$95/£80(without fans) That's not a bad deal for some case fans. If you were to buy them separately a set of three RS120 would cost you $40 and the RS120 ARGB $55. Though the Frame 4000D does still leave me wanting for a rear exhaust fan and there's the aforementioned Phanteks G400A, which comes with four 140 mm RGB fans for$130. That's also a pretty good deal. Anyways, my sample was the black version sans fans, but Corsair provided some LX120 and LX120-R, so I've stuck those in. You do get a pretty gorgeous chassis with the Frame 4000D. Constructed from thin sheet metal, Corsair has managed to give the 4000D an air of quality about it. There's a pull tab to remove the top panel and a hint of yellow on the captive thumbscrews across the rear for a teeny amount of flair. There's also a consistent patterning to the front, side, rear, and top panels. Heck, even the IO panels match. As does the rear of the RM850x PSU I've installed in this machine—a nice touch if you stick within the Corsair ecosystem, which as you'll soon read, I think Corsair would very much like you to do. There is a lot of flex to the top vent and PSU shroud cover, which doesn't quite contain the mess of cables within, and while the power button stands out, I don't quite feel it matches the overall aesthetic. Overall, however, I'd be happy to sit this case on my desk and look at it for most of the day. The Frame 4000D's main brag is that it offers high levels of customisation. Take the PSU shroud, for example. You can swap out the plastic card within the shroud to change its appearance, between translucent or black, or if you're a creative type, insert another card of your own design. You could also simply remove the card, or the entire PSU shroud, entirely. That comes in handy during the build for connecting PSU cables—unless you have a Corsair RMx Shift PSU, which this case is designed to fit. Or take the cooling. There's room for up to 10 120 mm fans inside this rather compact case, lining the front, top, and side. To use that side mounting position to the right of the motherboard, you'll need to switch out the fitted cable cover with the extra mount included in the box. This is what I ended up doing to fit the Corsair iCUE Link Titan 360 RX LCD to the side of the motherboard, making good use of some reverse-orientation fans I have to hand and allowing me to stuff three 120 mm units in the front of the case for maximum cooling potential. The mount comes away easily with a single screw and it's replaced just as easily, too. Though I did run into some difficulties with cable routing from removing the cable shroud. I guess that's to be expected, but using both side and front mounting points left me with no other option but to take up a lot of room to the right of my motherboard that would have usually been left spare for chunky motherboard and USB cables. It was a tight squeeze for the individually housed cables on the new Corsair RM850x I've installed in this machine, and a PSU with a less flexible motherboard cable might be an even tighter squeeze. If you had a wider radiator or E-ATX motherboard installed,fuggetaboutit. Stick with the cable shroud pre-installed in the case and you score a built-in GPU support. This little arm moves up or down to fit a range of GPU shrouds, though that's the only axis of movement. They're not hard to find these days but you would need a relatively large GPU of at least 315 mm in length to reach the little arm. That rules out the Founders Edition 50-series cards. It's easy to install cooling fans in the front and top of the case, as these both use a new system from Corsair called 'InfiniRail' for support for a wide gamut of fan sizes and radiators—one of the Frame 4000D's clever features. This allows you to move the metal rails onto which fans can be mounted, between 120/140 mm up top and 120/140/200 mm in the front. While a little unnecessary compared to a more traditional set-up, it does work well and saves on unsightly rails or mounts slightly covering larger fans. I only wish the front fan mounts offered a little more flexibility in how far these rails can move side to side—as it stands, the front fans leave some compatibility issues with the side fan mount and require small plastic clips if using 120 mm fans, which feels like it adds extra steps to, and slightly defeats the purpose of, this simplified rail system. This Frame 4000D supports motherboards with rearwards connections, ie Back-connect or BTF. Also, take a closer look at the motherboard tray and you'll realise that, too, is removable. Why? Well, that's a good question, as right now there's not much to be done with it. However, some of the Frame 4000D's customisation options are still on the way. One of the promises of the Frame 4000D is that it will be hugely upgradeable. On its website, Corsair writes that the case \"evolves with your needs, offering near limitless options for upgrade and changes.\" While that might be true one day, there are no options for upgrades available right now, which does make judging its upgradeability much more difficult. I asked Corsair about this and I'm told accessories are on the way—presumably motherboard trays and new front panels are part of that incoming wave, as the latter is shown on the website—but nothing to see here for now. This case is filled with ways to tie down cables. Small hooks, cutouts, and cable ties are aplenty. There's a series of handy velcro straps down the rear of the case to keep your CPU power cable tidy, which I most appreciate of the lot. Though I will say that only works if your PSU has a reasonably long CPU power cable—many don't. You can see these velcro ties from outside the case and that's because they work both ways. Using a little cut-out at the bottom of the case between the power supply and outer edge, you can feed a cable out and around the rear of the case, perhaps to install some RGB lighting controlled by, one would presume, iCUE, though actually you could use any system of your choosing. Before you say, 'who even does that?', I once dremelled a Corsair Air 540 to cut a hole for RGB light strips—I was young, I've matured since. There's no denying that this is a case built for Corsair's software and hardware ecosystem, iCUE Link. The word 'LINK' is plastered all over the case, from plastic caps to two removable trays, one behind the motherboard and the other in front of the PSU, made to fit iCUE Link System Hubs. I've used a System Hub for my build, to hook up the liquid cooler and various fans throughout the chassis. This saw me feeding heaps of thick cables around the case, to daisy-chain components together, and in place of the traditional PWM and RGB cables that usually terminate at the motherboard. As such, I don't feel iCUE's system is particularly better at keeping cable mess down, as the old-school cables are thin and easy to hide, but if you must have all that RGB… If you don't want to opt for Corsair's ecosystem, you could still benefit from the four 2.5-inch SSD mounting points or two 3.5-inch HDD mounting points across both trays. One easily overlooked feature that I'm a bit of a sucker for is the tool-free PSU mounting. Just slot your power supply into the cavernous shroud and tighten twin thumbscrews to lock it into place. As mentioned earlier, there's also been care to make sure there's room for a Corsair RMx Shift PSU in this case, which has the connectors sticking out sideways for easier access—one more friendly nudge from Corsair to go buy yourself some other Corsair products. I do have some nitpicks with the Frame 4000D. For starters, I don't love the mass of unsightly cables from the front panel collected together beneath the PC case. Though, to be fair, who is peeping under your chassis? Then there's the InfiniRail system, which could be a little more flexible to let you mount fans in the front of the caseandkeep some clearance for cables with a side-mounted radiator. Similarly, the lack of easily accessible cable routing around the motherboard, bar a large cutout atop the PSU and the very top of the motherboard tray, makes some cable runs a bit of a hassle. A little more room around the side and bottom of an ATX motherboard would go a long way. Though it is technically supported, an E-ATX motherboard may struggle for ample room. I also measured a fairly substantial drop-off in airflow with the magnetic dust filter on the front of the case. I measured 2 m/s airflow with neither dust filter or front panel attached to the case, and that didn't change much with the front panel reattached. However, add the dust filter in and it dropped to 1.5 m/s, which is a reasonably high drop just above the Phanteks G400A (0.1-0.4 m/s) and much higher than theHavn HS 420(0.1 m/s). That said, with the amount of fans that can be fitted in the 4000D, it's hardly gasping for air. And, as I mentioned at the start of this review, only three fans are provided with the more expensive versions of this chassis, leaving a space in the rear you'll need to fill. Presumably with a fan to match the other three. ✅ You are going to use iCUE Link extensively:This case makes the most sense within the Corsair ecosystem. Go all in on Corsair's fans, controllers, and lighting and you can use every inch of this case. ❌ You want easy cable management:With an ATX motherboard and using the included side radiator mount, I was left wishing for more generous cable routing options. Lastly, there's a lot of flex to the top panel—significantly more than the MSI Pano 100R PZ, Corsair iCUE 4000T, Havn HS 420, and Phanteks G400A I have in my office to test against. And yes, I have too many PC cases, what of it? You could also easily bend the panel covering the PSU cables, and sure, maybe the thinness of the metal savessomeweight, but at 10 kg this case is not much lighter than some competing cases (G400A is 10.5 kg). Altogether, the Corsair Frame 4000D gets a whole lot right but has me wanting a few tweaks to really nail the formula. If you're not pushing it to its limits, you wouldn't be putting a foot wrong building your next PC inside it, and that's doubly true if you're going to go all in on iCUE. I just wish Corsair had something to show for its promised customisation right now, as I can't really judge this case on the ecosystem of parts promised alongside it, as none of it is here yet. Whether you're a Corsair iCUE fan or not, the Frame 4000D is a good choice among a sea of options for its$95/£80price tag. Saying that, Corsair fans are set to get the most out of it, and for first time builders, I'd recommend more convenient cases such as theBe Quiet! Shadow FX 800and Phanteks G400A with four pre-installed fans and more room to manoeuvre. The Corsair Frame 4000D is a feature-filled chassis with a decent price tag. It's absolutely built for those with an iCUE obsession and it looks superb with fans a-blaze in RGB hues. However, there is room for improvement and I'd like to see Corsair roll out lots of customisation options to really make this case sing. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "article_text": "Sega has taken a look at the Sonic movies' box office earnings and decided that, yes, it would like to make several hundred million dollars please. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, it's finally happening. The most beautiful star in Hollywood is set to head up a videogame adaptation: Michael Bay is directing an OutRun film for some reason (viaDeadline). That's the 1986 Sega arcade game and subsequent series about driving Ferraris at great speeds down visually confounding roads in order to impress your girlfriend. Also, Sydney Sweeney will produce it but apparently not star in it, thank you very much. It's no surprise, really. This is the golden age of videogame adaptations. Fallout was great, everyone's raving about The Last of Us, the Sonic movies have madeenough moneyto bend light around Jim Carrey, andA Minecraft Moviecontinues to print cash despite thedeleterious effectit's apparently had on the morals of world youth. So no wonder Sega is plumbing its archives for another trademark to turn into a Hollywood money-hose. And hey, honestly? I could imagine an OutRun movie actually being good, if it leant fully into the weirdo 'driving fantasy' vibes of the games and produced something like a speedier, 90-minute version of theWicked Game scene from Wild At Heart. But I'm not optimistic this Bay-fronted feature will do that, and fully expect some kind of less-good Fast and Furious from the whole thing. Besides Bay and Sweeney, the only other name currently attached to the thing (aside from a smattering of Sega execs) is scriptwriter Jayson Rothwell, whoseIMDb filmographydoes not fill me with confidence. Maybe I'm being too cynical, and if Rothwell and/or Bay and/or Sweeney are truly burning up with bold ideas for an OutRun film, I encourage them to ignore my mithering entirely. But the vibes around this thing, even at this early stage, don't scream box office gold to me.

    "article_text": "Everyone's happy! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In arecent Q&A video, the developers ofREPOshared some information on what to expect from the next update for the game. That's alongside information about modding, details on new multiplayer features, new customisation for your robot, and information on the upcoming level. Matchmaking is one of the most significant additions to the game, which will make playing with other people even easier. If you can't quite convince your friends to join you in collecting valuables, you'll now be able to join servers and games to save you from playing on your own. According to the Q&A video, you'll be able to join servers depending on your region, which you can also lock with a password if you're the host. Rest assured, you'll also be able to kick any unwanted players as well. More importantly, expressions are being added, which will be a huge step up from the standard boggly-eyed appearance of REPO's beloved robots. You'll be able to express anger, sadness, being unimpressed, being happy, and an expression I can't quite name but it makes your pupils really small. I'm sure that will come in handy. As the member of the team who always smashes the most expensive things, I imagine I'll be pretty familiar with the angry expression at the end of a level. A few new hints about the next level, the museum, were also dropped. You can expect to do a lot of platforming while you're here, as the environment is \"very spacious\", and from what we've seen this means a lot of valuables are stashed higher up then we are used to. Which means parkouring around a map to get to them. Or, if you're anything like me that means buying a feather or zero gravity drone and forcing it to do most of the work for me. Additional details about new valuable gimmicks and further information about what to expect from the story were touched on, but nothing was explored in detail. Even with that lack of information, there's a lot to look forward to with REPO's first big update. A second Q&A with Semiwork is taking place on April 25, though, which may have a little more information for us.

    "title": "A new Frostpunk game is coming 'as early as 2027' after Frostpunk 2 spearheaded the 'highest sales in the company's history'",
    "article_text": "\"We sold 592,000 copies of the game.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2024 was a good year for 11 Bit Studios. With a generated revenue of PLN 140.54 million (£28.21 million), an 168.9% increase year on year, \"marking the highest sales in the company's history\". Mostly thanks to the release ofFrostpunk 2, according to aninvestor report. So it's no wonder that the biggest takeaway from all of this is that there needs to be more Frostpunk games. \"The sharp increase in 11 Bit Studios’ revenue in 2024 was primarily driven by new game releases during the period, led by Frostpunk 2,\" the report says. \"By the end of December, we sold 592,000 copies of the game, generating revenue of PLN 69.73 million (£14 million),\" Przemysław Marszał, president of the management board of the company, adds. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together But it has to be said that all this success isn't solely down to Frostpunk 2. Legacy games like Frostpunk and This War of Mine apparently also performed well. Together, they accounted for PLN 35.75 million (£7.18 million) in revenue, a 13.7% increase from 2023. But Frostpunk was probably helped along by Frostpunk 2 hype. With this success in mind, the studio confirmed that it will be carrying on support for Frostpunk 2 with upcoming DLCs and a couple of new features, as well as teasing the next Frostpunk game: \"We intend to diversify both the scale of our projects and their development timelines. This also means capitalising on near-term, financially attractive opportunities. This underlies our decision to initiate production on the next project set in the Frostpunk universe, which we plan to launch as early as 2027.\" However, despite the success of Frostpunk 2 and the exciting prospect of yet another game in the pipeline, 11 Bit Studios still failed to meet expectations. The sales growth did not translate into a corresponding increase in margins as the company recorded an operating loss of PLN 2.84 million (£570,000). \"2024 was a year marked by hard work, significant challenges, and tough business decisions,\" Marszal says. \"It was also a year of achievements that we are proud of. We experienced failures as well, which we are confident we have learned from. We are entering a new year that we firmly believe will bring notable improvements in both our operational and financial performance.\" It's undoubtedly a tough market out there, but even still, the news of a next Frostpunk game is very exciting. I loved my time in Frostpunk 2,even if all my citizens ended up hating me. So I can't wait to do it all again and see what trials and tribulations 11 Bit Studios has waiting for me in a few years.

    "article_text": "Looks like there's no easy way out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Outlast Trialsis rolling out its third season today, adding yet another layer of torture to the Murkoff facility. For any Reagents with a therapy level of 99, you'll be able to enter \"Project: Relapse\" in exchange for reverting your level back to zero. So basically, you're back to square one and won't be escaping the facility any time soon. As is the way with each new season in The Outlast Trials, a new story trial is being added set in the \"suburbs\" which is an entirely new environment too. Details on what exactly this trial will hold is for us to find out, but we do know a new enemy is being unleashed: The Jaeger. From what we know about her, she seems like an absolute beast already, even compared to the villains of the trials. The Jaeger won't be locked to the new story trial either, and there's a chance she'll spawn in any map and any trial, which makes dealing with her even more unpredictable. Should you be in a trial when she does spawn, she will lock on one member of your party and hunt them down with intent to kill. You won't be able to predict who this is ahead of time, either. Only when you're in the middle of a game. Unlike other enemies, you won't be able to use bottles or bricks to stun the Jaeger, and even if you're hiding there's a higher chance of her finding you. To add to this, you also won't be able to use your Rig abilities on her. You just have to keep moving, but luckily she moves quite slowly. I struggle as it is to evade a lot of the enemies already in The Outlast Trials, so the Jaeger feels a bit overpowered at the moment. But as long as I'm not the party member being hunted I'm sure I won't feel so scared. The ability to make your own trials is also being added, which is what I would argue is the most exciting part. Mostly because it puts me in control of everything, which is a feeling I think everyone wants in a co-op horror like this. Using the \"Trial Maker\" you will be able to build your own trial based on existing maps, while also selecting which goals you want your Reagents to meet, like collecting propaganda posters or finding rats. Two things I'd rather do than get anywhere near the newest trial and enemy. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "I'm going to ban everyone. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. EveryOverwatchplayer has that one hero that they can't stand. The hero that boils their blood and fills them with a kind of rage that is unmatched in every other avenue of their life. For me, it's Mercy, but every player has their own arch-nemesis in this game, and now we can all do something about it. Overwatch 2 Season 16 is introducing hero bans, finally. At the beginning of every competitive match, players will vote to remove up to four heroes from play (two per team, but no more than two per role). 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together This will give players an extra level of customisation to \"tweak team compositions and add an extra layer of mind games before the real fighting begins,\" according to aBlizzard blog post. \"It’s a system built for strategic thinkers and team players, which rewards coordination and understanding of hero synergies.\" I, alongside most Overwatch players, have been begging for bans since 2018, the same season when Brigitte was introduced and I played D.Va, but that's just a coincidence. Then last year, I pleaded my case for hero bans yet againafter a particularly brutal balance patchthat saw me getting rolled by the evil hamster in a mechanical ball. Hero bans have been teased here and there over the years.Jeff Kaplan discussed adding them back in 2020in the form of an \"Experimental Card\", where Blizzard would choose which hero got banned via a hero pool system that would change each week. But it wasn't seriously talked about until February this year, as it waspresented alongside a whole host of radical changes. With a roster as big as Overwatch 2's, there'll always be one or two heroes who are just too big for their boots. Maybe they're super strong in the current meta, or perhaps they triple in strength on a certain map. There are a lot of variables to juggle, and hero bans allow you to make things a bit more manageable. \"Hero Bans don’t just level the playing field, they shape it,\" the blog post says. \"Are you tired of seeing the same heroes dominate every match? Want to throw a wrench in the enemy’s go-to strat? Coordinate with your team and swing the vote to remove a high-impact pick, block that one counter that’s keeping your best in check, lock out a problematic flanker, or protect your support duo. Whoever you choose, Hero Bans give your squad more power to play your way.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Players have been fantasising over who they're going to ban, and it seems like the most popular pick for bans is none other than Doomfist. \"Doom mains either roll the entire lobby or are recovering from a lobotomy,\"JaSaw0 says. \"If Doom is on the other team he’s an annoying unkillable pain in the ass,\" otherplayer adds. \"If he’s on my team, He’s one of those moronic Doom Mains that thinks 'Nah I’d win I’m that guy' and refuse to swap even when the entire enemy team is counter picking and dumpstering him the entire time. I’m tired of brain-dead Dooms trying to play rock against paper and then blaming their team because we can’t somehow magically keep him alive.\" A good Doom is pretty annoying to play against, but as I main Ana, it's not a massive issue to me. I just periodically sleep and nade the guy until they switch or throw the game in anger. But without an Ana to counter him, I can see how a Doom could make everyone's life a misery, jumping around the place, punching people into walls or off the map. But there's a dark side to hero bans: someone banning your main. I'm actually a little worried to see that there's some chatter around tanks wanting to ban Ana. Yes, getting slept and naded every time you round a corner is pretty aggravating, but I don't want the joy of toying with a Hog taken away from me. But even still, I'll gladly take that L if it means players can ban overpowered and annoying heroes. These bans have been made \"to keep things fresh, fair, and fun for everyone,\" and I think it will do just that, or at least make things a little more bearable for hard countered heroes like D.Va or Hog.

    "title": "AI becoming increasingly central to China's education reform with plans to bring AI into classes soon",
    "article_text": "Using AI to these ends will help \"cultivate the basic abilities of teachers and students.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If there's one thing we should have learned by now, it's that technology is a tool. It can be used for both good, bad, and everyweird state of morality humans can dream up inbetween. The same is true for AI, though often it's used as an entity in itself, rather than as tools in most cases. Still in the right situations, such as doing complex computations, sorting through lots of data, and precise controls, the right AI can be great. It seems the next logical step in machine learning is to see how it can be used to help human learning, and China is about to put it to the test. According toReuters, China is set to start rolling out AI in efforts to improve its teaching and textbooks across all levels of school education. This is a part of a larger plan by the country to help bolster the education system as well as looking for new paths of innovation. China is hoping to reach what it calls a \"strong-education nation\" by 2035 China's education ministry believes using AI to these ends will help \"cultivate the basic abilities of teachers and students,\" as well as help shape the \"core competitiveness of innovative talents.\" An example is helping to develop basic skills for students starting with things like communication and cooperation to more complex tasks independent thinking and problem solving. AI in schools might sound horrifying, but if we go back to thinking of AI as a tool it could be pretty great. EvenAmerica is consideringit, though they keep calling it \"A one\" for some reason. As long as we use AI for the tasks it was made for, in these instances AI could help make learning more individualised. With AI's ability to wade through large piles of data and find working patterns and pathways forward, it could lead to a much more limber education system that's ready to shift to the accommodation of its students. When AI is used poorly is often tied to creative tasks, or when there's not enough oversight. With mostAI's in the wild being language modelsthey're mostly designed to pick themost likely word in a sentence, rather than provide valuable information, and they're known to be wrong. Confidently wrong. This could also be fine and a useful tool but people trust these results, and that's where we end up with a lot of confusing garbled information. So if we are going to use AI in schools it needs to be bespoke and transparent. A purpose built AI trained by educators that is constantly open to scrutiny and adjustment could be a wonderful addition to schools. I just don't know if I necessarily trust China or the United States of America to deliver such an AI any time soon.

    "title": "Gather around children, let me spin you the tale of NLRB whistleblower vs Musk's DOGE. It has government espionage, a billionaire megalomaniac, Russian hackers, coverup conspiracies, and even blackmail by drone",
    "article_text": "Whistleblower claims to have seen Russian login attempts with correct credentials commenced minutes after DOGE accounts were used. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Turns out the United States' new Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE sure lives up to it's namesake. According to a whistleblower report, it barely took a few minutes after DOGE workers had accounts created in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for the system to receive login attempts from Russia featuring the correct user credentials. Now that's efficient. ArsTechnicahas the initial report on what appears to be a pretty damning account of the Elon Musk-helmed DOGE's activities against national security interests. The report has been filed by NLRB employee and DevSecOps architect, Daniel Berulis, who noticed multiple redflags around DOGE's behaviour. This included the blatant dismissal of usual procedure leading to the creation of accounts with far greater security access than what was needed for the proposed function for DOGE employees. Berulis has also reported receiving threats to his home which included drone footage of Berulis at his home address. \"Mr. Berulis is coming forward today because of his concern that recent activity by members of the Department of Government Efficiency ('DOGE') have resulted in a significant cybersecurity breach that likely has and continues to expose our government to foreign intelligence and our nation's adversaries,\" said a letter from the group Whistleblower Aid to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence leaders and the US Office of Special Counsel. The letter from Berulis and Whistleblower Aid as well as Berulis' sworn declaration, and other supporting information are all available forpublic perusal. \"This declaration details DOGE activity within NLRB, the exfiltration of data from NLRB systems, and—concerningly—near real-time access by users in Russia,\" Whistleblower Aid Chief Legal Counsel Andrew Bakaj explains. \"Notably, within minutes of DOGE personnel creating user accounts in NLRB systems, on multiple occasions someone or something within Russia attempted to login using all of the valid credentials (e.g. Usernames/Passwords). This, combined with verifiable data being systematically exfiltrated to unknown servers within the continental United States—and perhaps abroad—merits investigation.\" \"Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created accounts that were used in the other DOGE-related activities, and it appeared they had the correct username and password due to the authentication flow only stopping them due to our no-out-of-country logins policy activating,\" Berulis writes in his declaration. \"There were more than 20 such attempts, and what is particularly concerning is that many of these login attempts occurred within 15 minutes of the accounts being created by DOGE engineers.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But it was more than just dodgy login attempts, on March 7 Berulis writes he \"started tracking what appeared to be sensitive data leaving the secured location.\" The data amounted to around 10 GBs, but thanks to the odd security demands DOGE had for its accounts, he couldn't track what the data actually was. Bakaj also penned a letter to senators as well as the Office of Special Counsel requesting \"that both law enforcement agencies and Congress initiate an immediate investigation into the cybersecurity breach and data exfiltration at NLRB and any other agencies where DOGE has accessed internal systems.\" Bakaj's statement said he was told to drop the investigation and cease reporting concerns as the NLRB denied any breach. \"Tim Bearese, the NLRB's acting press secretary, denied that the agency granted DOGE access to its systems and said DOGE had not requested access to the agency's systems,\" according to NPR. \"Bearese said the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but 'determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.'\" Furthermore it appears Berulis actions have put him in the firing line for desperate blackmail attempts. On April 7 these incidents were reported to the police, with Bakaj explaining someone \"taped a threatening note to Mr. Berulis' home door with photographs—taken via a drone—of him walking in his neighborhood.\" He continues, stating: \"The threatening note made clear reference to this very disclosure he was preparing for you, as the proper oversight authority. While we do not know specifically who did this, we can only speculate that it involved someone with the ability to access NLRB systems.\" So far what we have developing here is a story full of twists and turns. I can't wait to see what happens next time we get an update from this government espionage tale featuring a billionaire megalomaniac, Russian hackers, whistleblower campaigns, coverup conspiracies, and even blackmail by drone. I can't believe they left us on a cliffhanger like this.

    "title": "Teeny tiny, almost wearable brain-computer interface gets 'closer to the source of the signals' by fitting between hair follicles and only lasts between six and 12 hours",
    "article_text": "Walk, run, wave your arms about, all while scrolling online. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Brain Computer Interfaces, or BCIs are futuristic devices that do exactly what it says on the tin; Allow a brain to interface directly with a computer. While this may sound like pure science fiction, it's actually even better, it's sciencefact. BCIs are being used all the time to help aid people in all sorts of ways. One BCI might be used to help aparalyzed user navigate their phoneand talk toloved ones by monitoring brave waves, another may help an amputee use their prosthetic limb, while others might just monitor brain waves for research purposes. Now one team atGeorgia Techhas managed to further the use of BCIs by developing new tiny interfaces that can be inserted between hair follicles. While BCIs are already well and truly out there and established, they could still be better. One of the biggest hurdles BCIs face is finding the balance between being a robust piece of tech that can effectively monitor and translate brain signals, with being something fairly inobtrusive a user can wear. This becomes especially important as tasks become more intense. A test requiring a user to move around while still having some sort of brain reading probe will need something much lighter than those restricted to hospital beds. That's where devices like this tiny new BCI come in. Rather than having to wear a large headset or go through some intrusive surgery, these BCIs are designed to be minimally invasive while still giving an excellent connection. This method uses the latest micronoodling technology to painlessly place the tech just under the skin between hair follicles. Each sensor, plus accompanying flexible cables, fits in a package under one millimetre in size, allowing for this minimally invasive technique. \"I started this research because my main goal is to develop new sensor technology to support healthcare and I had previous experience with brain-computer interfaces and flexible scalp electronics,\" says Hong Yeo, who is also a faculty member in Georgia Tech's Institute for People and Technology. \"I knew we needed better BCI sensor technology and discovered that if we can slightly penetrate the skin and avoid hair by miniaturizing the sensor, we can dramatically increase the signal quality by getting closer to the source of the signals and reduce unwanted noise.\" So far studies of the device appear promising. In tests the connection to the device lasted for up to 12 hours. During this time users were able to walk, run, and generally participate in every day activities all while still being able to use the BCIs. Even during activity the BCIs were able to determine what the users eyes were focussing on, allowing them to use an AR interface to control their phones all without lifting a finger. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This could help usher BCIs beyond just the niche health applications and into the general tech world. As I write this I'm sitting on a plane and using my brain to check my phone, or change the music I'm listening to, sounds mighty appealing over digging through my seat pocket to find it. With BCIs like this one we could see a truly hands free future coming to phones, general computing, and even gaming. I can't wait to stare off into the feed like a character from Murderbot, and doomscroll on the corporation rim.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Take a look at our hint for today'sWordleany time you'd like to give your game a bit of a boost. Use it before your opening word if you want to make sure you get your guessing off to an incredible start, or keep it to one side, just in case you get stuck. Not enough? No problem. The April 22 (1403) answer is only a click away. I had all the clues I needed, and my previous guess had helpfully ruled out a lot of potential answers, so I had no real reason to be surprised when my third row turned green. It still felt like something of a shock though—that easy, really? My first proper attempt just worked? Just like that? Nice. This term is wheeled out when someone claims to be interested in drama, theatre, and galleries stuffed with paintings, but in a pretentious, pompous way. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Here, for you. The answer to the April 22 (1403) Wordle isARTSY. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "How excited are we to replay a shinier version of Oblivion 19 years later?",
    "article_text": "Oblivion is a safe pick for the remaster treatment, sandwiched between the more flavorful Morrowind and more popular Skyrim. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After nearlytwo years of waitingand aleakthat blew the surprise, Bethesda has finally made it official: Oblivion Remastered is real, and will be formally unveiled on April 22. There's an awful lot of excitement for this one, but I think the hoopla is leading us to overlook one important but awkward question. Andy is PC Gamer's foremost Daggerfall defender. His RPG tastes were forged in the '80s and '90s with dungeon crawlers likeDaggorathandEye of the Beholder 2, but there's still room in his heart for newer RPGs, as he discovered when Elden Ringtook over his life. Are we hyped up because Oblivion is a really great RPG, or are we really just that desperate for something—anything—in the way of a new Elder Scrolls game? Personally,I have no excitement for the Oblivion remaster. Zero. I liked Oblivion quite a lot when it was new: I bought the collector's edition on launch day and poured an awful lot of hours into it, and yeah, it was good. It was also painfully safe. More than any other game in The Elder Scrolls series, Oblivion is generic open world fantasy pap for the masses, the game that carried Bethesda into the big time and whose driving philosophy was thus one of caution: Don't alienate, don't offend, don't be too goddamnweird. Compared to the bizarre magnificence of its predecessor, Morrowind, and the monstrous sprawl of the game before that one, Daggerfall, Oblivion comes off like Peter Jackson's The Elder Scrolls: A big-budget, mass-market rendition of something that had previously been so daring and ambitious. That style-over-substance approach is aptly summed up by the game's two stars, Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean, who bookended Oblivion by showing up to die at the beginning of the game, and showing up to die at the end—two of the biggest \"is that all?\" moments in videogame history. I think we'll all be feeling a lot of that after the Oblivion remaster is finally in our hot little hands, even if PC Gamerscored it a sterling 93% back in 2006. And look, the issue here isn't that I'm mad about horse armor (I'm not) or that I'm mad Bethesda didn't remaster Morrowind (I am), and I'm sure not here to say you're wrong to be excited about an Oblivion update (well, maybe a little). It just feels like misplaced enthusiasm to me. Oblivion is a perfectly fine game but not at all one that warrants years of anticipation. The reality is that fans are so desperate for a \"new\" Elder Scrolls game they'll stand in line and hoot and holler for a fresh coat of paint on what is the third- or maybe fourth-best game in the series. Once it's out, I fully expect that sensation of \"perfectly fine\" will set in quickly, followed by the vague melancholy that comes from the realization that past glories are best left to lie in faded, shadowy memory. And then we'll all move on to other things: Back to Skyrim, and wondering what's going on withThe Elder Scrolls 6. (And yes, I am 100% going to say \"I told you so\" when it happens.) Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As usual, though, others on the PC Gamer team are a little more optimistic than I am. Lincoln:Oblivion was—I think—my first open world RPG, and at the time I wandered through it with wide-eyed wonder while getting my clock cleaned by dremora churls and failing to understand how magic worked. Now that my sensibilities have matured in a more Morrowind-ward direction, most of my remaining investment in Oblivion is tied to how goofy the guards sound. If they've changed out the voice samples to anything less absurd, I'll consider it a personal betrayal. Thinking about it now, though, the effect of a human slab of meat charging up to me and barking that I've violated the law might bemoreabsurd if heisn'tspeaking with a face that looks like a baked ham. So I guess that could be fun. Lauren:I didn't even play Oblivion for the first time until about 2016, so I don't reallyneedupdated textures and whatever \"next-gen upgrade\" equivalent to theSkyrim Anniversary Editionthat Bethesda slaps onto Oblivion to get me to play another few hundred hours without ever actually solving the Oblivion crisis. But if they HD-ify that opening cutscene flycam shot of Imperial City I will probably get goosebumps. I can't help it. They'd better have left the terrible conversation minigame intact though. I genuinely enjoy that thing. Morgan:Sure, Oblivion is the safe remaster, but it's also the perfect remaster for 2025. Take it from this 28-year-old: Nostalgia around the early Xbox 360 era is extremely potent at the moment, and for many of us, our first Oblivion playthrough is a core memory. Like Lincoln, it was my first open world RPG, and how I discovered some games will let you screw yourself over by saving the game right after punching an innkeeper in the face. If the price is right—as in closer to $30 than $70—I'm on board just for the novelty. Ted:I'm still curious about how far-reaching this remaster will be: It's been rumored since 2021, with some claiming a full engine-level overhaul. Other rumblings are that, despite the huge lead time, it's a largely cosmetic uplift more in line with the Metroid Prime Remaster. I'm nervous because Oblivion not only had pretty bad combat, but the most rigid, intrusive enemy and gear leveling I've seen in an RPG. It screams out for the sort of mechanics-level pass we know is coming to the ambitiousSkyblivionmod, but this official remaster remains an unknown quantity until tomorrow. I'm not too worried, even though I love this game: If it's bad, we've still got another Oblivion remaster on the way. If it's good, well then I guess we have two. I'm definitely ready to relitigate some \"best in the series\" debates. Sure, Morrowind is amazing and has the best writing and worldbuilding Bethesda's done, but Oblivion's where the studio actually got good at quest design. Compare \"The Ultimate Heist\" in Oblivion to \"Kill Hard-Heart,\" the corresponding final Thieves Guild quest in Morrowind⁠—it's night and day! Chris:I've yet to be swayed by a remaster: I guess I'm happy playing the original low-fi versions of most games. If there's one thing Oblivion could use it's a bit more hustle and bustle, though. Towns feel empty, the wilderness feels barren, and even in Imperial City itself you'll get a crowd of at most, what, five people? I'm not saying overstuffing a world full of randomized characters is the way to go—it didn't make Starfield feel more alive—but just a bit more foot traffic in towns and cities and a few more animals in the woods would go a long way. If it's just a graphical facelift, though, I'm not sure why I'd play it. I mostly like Oblivion just how it is, and like Tyler said,I hope they didn't make the NPCs hot.

    "title": "This cheating app teaches all the wrong lessons about AI – but some of you still might use it",
    "article_text": "Cluely wants to help you cheat at everything When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cluely, an AI app that promises to help you \"cheat at everything,\" perhaps deserves some credit for honesty. If you believe that artificial intelligence is a platform that, in some ways, can help you game the system by delivering melifilous prose written by a large language model (LLM), stunning art generated byChatGPT,or convincing video percolated bySora, then maybe Cluely and its founders are just being honest. It's more likely, though, that they are blustering their way to the launch of a product that makes a mockery of integrity. Cluely is a crafty app that installs in your browser and then can sneakily watch and listen to everything on screen. The primary use case is a Zoom video call where you're being interviewed for a high-paying development job. During such a call, you might be asked to Leetcode, which is essentially solving coding or algorithmic problems in full view of your interviewer. With Cluely running, it could quickly tell you how to respond to questions and even solve the coding problems. Lee claimed to have used Cluely to breeze through interviews with multiple major tech companies. Word apparently got around to Columbia University, where Lee and his Cluely co-founder were students. Lee was, according to letters he posted on X (formerly Twitter), kicked out. Lee detailed the entire experience in an X thread. I just got kicked out of Columbia for taking a stand against Leetcode interviews.Here's the whole story (long thread): pic.twitter.com/Q7LPWjwyA7March 27, 2025 Instead of remorse, Lee seems to express a level of satisfaction, like this is a plan gone well. And, in a way, it is. Cluely has,according to Techcrunch, raised $3.5 million in funding and is prepared to help us \"cheat at everything.\" If that statement makes you feel a bit nauseated, you may not be alone. Lee has spent a fair amount of time defending the app on X, and Cluely may not have helped its case with a tongue-in-cheek launch video that depicts the 21-year-old Lee using Cluely in a smartglasses-like app to convince his date that he is 31 and interested in her and her art. She catches on to the subterfuge and ultimately walks out, but the point is made. Cluely could help you cheat at dating. Cluely is out. cheat on everything. pic.twitter.com/EsRXQaCfUIApril 20, 2025 While Cluely has yet to reveal which LLMs it uses to power its answers, this is a funhouse mirror view of AI's potential. In his manifesto (which, it appears, has since disappeared from the site), Lee argues that we need to redefine cheating and that what Cluely's doing is no different thanGoogleor a calculator, which put answers at our fingertips and perhaps have been helping us \"cheat\" for decades. On X,I asked Lee about this perspective, writing: \"Do you worry that your experience teaches the wrong lesson about AI? People are already skeptical, and if they see it as a tool for cheating, maybe some will be less likely to use and engage. At the very least, more people will trust less (on things like job interviews) because they might believe the applicant is using AI to cheat.\" Moments later, Lee responded (For readability, I've fixed the punctuation): \"What exactly does \"cheat on everything\" mean? How do you 'cheat' on a conversation? Cluely (and AI) enables such an insane amount of leverage that it feels unfair, and \"like\" cheating. The world will be uncomfortable with this reality (as you yourself show), but it will soon become normal, and the day that AI maximalism is truly normalized, humanity's potential will 1,000,000x. Initial hesitation -> massive adoption has been how every single technology in the history of the world has spread.\" While I can't disagree with the notion about hesitation and then mass adoption, and am seeing that in real-time with consumer-grade AI, Lee seems to imply that you can't \"cheat\" at a conversation. I guess he has never readCyrano de Bergerac. None of this explains away the fundamental deception coded into Cluely. Ifollowed up on Xwith: \" 'Cheat' is a loaded word, but I also think it's one we do understand. Google search is super-powered research, a digitization of encyclopedic knowledge at your fingertips. A calculator is a math wiz in your pocket, but one that was banned from class unless educators allowed it. They understood the potential for cheating. A browser tool that watches and listens and then produces an answer without the knowledge of the convo's other participant is, many will agree, something different. BTW: Which LLM are you using?\" Lee has yet to respond, but perhaps that's because he knows the answer. Google and Calculators are tools. Cluely is a tool hidden behind a lie: \"This is me answering.\" It would be the same as secretly using Google or a calculator to answer an interviewer's questions. There's a fair chance they would notice your fingers frantically typing just off camera. Cluely just supercharges the subterfuge, but it doesn't make it any less like cheating. I did, by the way, install Cluely on my MacBook Air to see how it works. It's a powerful tool that overrides, with your permission, normal safeguards that stop third-party tools from watching the video and listening to the audio on your screen. It offers no alert to the person on the other side that they're being watched by a massive AI brain. It's early days, and Cluely does not appear to be fully real-time. You have to click the AI button for it to work and provide answers. Even so, the potential is there, and it's not necessarily a good one. Lee's efforts to normalize and redefine cheating won't make it any less of a deception or any more acceptable. He got kicked out of school for it, and now he wants you to put your own reputation on the line. Some might do it, I know I won't.

Disney is now busy pulverizing a portion of those glass bottles; nearly 2,000 pounds can be crushed in an hour and repurposed for use in other areas, potentially on horse trails, as a replacement for the floor in a greenhouse, or even where mulch once was. The industrial machine – a glass pulverizer – is located in a backstage area at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort in Orlando, Florida, out of sight from guests. It's pretty low-tech, with no high-tech components in use. All that crushed glass eventually becomes a somewhat shiny, clean, sand-like material. \"We've got one greenhouse almost complete with pulverized glass,\" said Debbie Mola Mickler, area manager at Disney's Horticulture. \"Cast members ask me questions about it because they walk by and their natural reaction is, 'Wow, your greenhouse floor is glistening.'\" 'Wow, your greenhouse floor is glistening.' And that's the product produced by the glass pulverizer. This project started when other environmental teams at Disney asked what to do with the glass, explained Jarrod Stewart, Disney's Environmental Integration Project Manager. \"Could we pulverize it? Use it potentially for road repair, other things?\" were the questions proposed to Stewart. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This article is part of a series of sustainability-themed articles we're running to observeEarth Day 2025and promote more sustainable practices. Check out all of ourSustainability Week 2025content. Thus began a search for a machine that could take a bottle of wine with a wax seal still around the top and a label on the front, separate it, and then safely crush the glass to disperse a sand-like material. \"I stumbled across the type of machine that we're running here that separates all those non-glass items,\" he said. \"It actually discharges the labels and all that, all that separately.\" The result is a sand-like material that can blend with coquina or replace mulch – no high-tech sensors required. \"There is no smart equipment on this machine whatsoever – not even in the control panel,\" Stewart said. At the core is a patented hammer mill. \"The glass bottle is gone, but the wax is still intact, even with the drips and everything coming off of it,\" Stewart said. \"It's a very interesting percussive action… that is the patented part of the machine.\" As more teams across the Disney World property heard about the pilot, interest grew. Debbie Mola Mickler saw it on the news and immediately called Stewart to request a test batch for the greenhouses and the horticulture team. The catering team wanted to be included, too, offering a transportation solution: \"They said, 'You know what, our trucks are running around the property all day… We'll just drop off the full bins and pick up the empties as we're driving by,\" Stewart said. The pulverizer's output is now used in select areas that guests can see. \"We've used it in a couple of on-stage locations,\" Stewart explained. \"One in Fort Wilderness, where it's actually replacing mulch around the food truck pad.\" In this case, it's a more permanent solution, as mulch would eventually need to be replaced due to wear and tear. Behind the scenes, Imagineering and Disney's facility teams are exploring even more uses, including non-structural concrete or footpaths. It could even end up at other Disney locations worldwide and even on the sea, courtesy of Disney Cruise Line – either with the produced sand-like material being used or with the glass being sent to be pulverized. \"The sustainability design team is determining how it can be used to work toward sustainable design goals that they have by using recycled material in construction,\" Stewart said. While the pulverizer remains in a backstage area, the initiative's impact is increasingly visible. Hey, can we participate in this? How do we help this grow? \"You know, sometimes when you ask people to sort their waste into yet another, you know, separate category, they're a little hesitant, or you might get a little pushback,\" Stewart said. \"In this case, because people see it, they're identifying with the story. They want to be part of it. So we're getting calls every week of, ‘Hey, can we participate in this? How do we help this grow? ‘” Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "Apple removed 'Available Now' from the Apple Intelligence webpage, but it may not have been Apple's choice",
    "article_text": "The National Advertising Division recommended it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Applehas long said that there is a long road ahead forApple Intelligence, but it’s been more of a long-winded road since Apple's AI was first announced at WWDC 2024. Earlier in 2025, the promisedAI-powered Siri features were pushed backto the ‘coming year,’ which is pretty vague. Now, Apple has made a change to its Apple Intelligence landing page,dropping the ‘Available Now’ taglinefrom under “AI for the rest of us.” Surprisingly, the Cupertino-based tech giant doesn't seem to have made the decision to remove the message itself, but instead was asked by the Better Business Bureau's National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD). In ashared release, the NAD recommends “that Apple Inc. modify or discontinue advertising claims regarding the availability of certain features associated with the launch of its AI-powered Apple Intelligence tool in the U.S.” It seems that launch features including the new Siri, still not being available, weren’t clear enough on the page. The NAD states that the Apple Intelligence landing pages made it seem like Apple Intelligence features, including Priority Notifications, Image Playground, Image Wand, andChatGPTintegration as well as Genmoji, “were available at the launch of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro.” However, Apple Intelligence didn’t begin its launch until iOS 18.2, which was released after the new iPhones. NAD’s argument states that the disclosures, presented as “footnotes” or “small print disclosures,” were not clear enough. The BBB’s NAD also had similar thoughts about Apple displaying the forthcoming Siri features, such as on-screen awareness and personal content, on the same page as the “Available Now” heading. The NAD even connected with Apple, who informed them that “Siri features would not be available on the original timeline” and that the corresponding language was updated. This evidently happened around the same time as Apple pulled one of its advertisements featuring the all-new Siri. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Apple, in the release, says “While we disagree with the NAD’s findings related to features that are available to users now, we appreciate the opportunity to work with them and will follow their recommendations.” And it’s clear the recommendations were taken to heart, as “Available Now,” according tosnapshots viewed on the Wayback Machineby TechRadar, was removed on March 29, 2025. That’s well before this release from the National Advertising Dvision making the ask that Apple stops or modifies it’s language, but also after the tech giant confirmed the delay with the AI infused Siri as of February 7, 2025. Either way, it’s clearApple is getting its ducks in a row, and it’s good to be clearer with consumers. TechRadar has reached out to Apple asking for further comment, and we'll update this when and if we hear back. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "title": "North Korean hackers are using LinkedIn to entice developers to coding challenges - here's what you need to know",
    "article_text": "Don’t be quick to open PDFs or run codes – North Korean hackers are on the rampage When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A hacker group from North Korea known as Slow Pisces has launched a sophisticated campaign targeting developers in the cryptocurrency sector through LinkedIn. The group, also known as TraderTraitor or Jade Sleet, poses as recruiters to lure victims with seemingly genuine job offers and coding challenges, only to infect their systems with malicious Python and JavaScript code. Thanks to this campaign, the group has been able to steal substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. In 2023 alone, they were linked to over $1 billion in stolen funds. A $1.5 billion hack at a Dubai exchange and a $308 million theft from a Japanese company are among the recent attacks. After initially sending PDF documents containing job descriptions, the malicious actors follow up with coding assignments hosted on GitHub. Although these repositories appear to be based on legitimate open-source projects, they have been secretly altered to include hidden malware. Victims, believing they are completing programming tests, unintentionally allow malware like RN Loader and RN Stealer onto their systems. These booby-trapped projects mimic legitimate developer tools and applications. For instance, Python repositories might seem to analyze stock market trends using data from reputable sources, while secretly communicating with attacker-controlled domains. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The malware evades most detection tools by using YAML deserialization, avoiding commonly flagged functions like eval or exec. Once triggered, the loader fetches and executes additional payloads directly in memory, making it difficult to detect or remove. One such payload, RN Stealer, is specifically designed to exfiltrate credentials, cloud configuration files, and stored SSH keys, particularly from macOS systems. JavaScript variants of the malware operate similarly, using the Embedded JavaScript templating engine to hide malicious code, which activates only for targeted victims based on factors like IP addresses or browser headers. Forensic analysis shows that the malware stores code in hidden directories and communicates over HTTPS using custom tokens. However, investigators were unable to recover the full JavaScript payload. GitHub and LinkedIn have responded by removing the malicious accounts and repositories involved. “GitHub and LinkedIn removed these malicious accounts for violating our respective terms of service. Across our products, we use automated technology, combined with teams of investigation experts and member reporting, to combat bad actors and enforce terms of service. We continue to evolve and improve our processes and encourage our customers and members to report any suspicious activity,” the companies said in a joint statement. There is a growing need for caution when approached with remote job offers and coding tests. Developers are advised to use strongantivirussoftware and run unfamiliar code in secure environments, particularly when working in sensitive sectors like cryptocurrency. Those concerned about security should verify they are using thebest IDEs, which typically include integrated security features. Staying alert, and working on a secure, controlled setup, can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to state-backed cyber threats.

    "title": "Google Messages update finally adds an important safety tool – and teases a feature I'm surprised the app doesn't have already",
    "article_text": "Live location sharing and content warnings could be on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. GoogleMessages looks set to receive a couple of new tools to make the service more useful and safer to use. And we’re excited to try out both once they’ve rolled out. The first is that Google appears set to add live location sharing to its app. That’s according toAndroid Authority’s recent APK teardown. You can currently share your location with another person throughGoogle Maps, but it sends the information as a static Google Maps pin. If you move, you’ll need to send your location again, which can make meeting up while you’re out and about a challenge. That looks set to change however, as in the latest beta code a single string referencing “live_location_sharing_shortcut” was discovered. For now the feature isn’t live, but the string suggests that Google is probably experimenting with live location sharing behind the scenes and could be preparing to release the feature in a future beta. As always, there’s a chance Google will never release live location sharing, but here’s hoping it does – and sooner rather than later, given how helpful it can be. The other update is one that wasannounced back in Februarybut finally seems to be live for a few via the latest Messages beta: new Sensitive Content Warnings (via9to5Google). Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. They’ll appear if a Google Messages user sends or receives nude images (if they have the setting switched on), though for adults, it’s switched off by default. Meanwhile, accounts owned by people under 18 will have the feature switched on by default. Supervised accounts can’t turn the warnings off themselves (though parents can control the setting through the Family Link app), while Unsupervised teens (users aged 13 to 17) can turn the warnings off in their Google Account settings if they choose. To change your settings, you’ll want to open Google Messages on your Android device, tap on your profile picture, then tap on Messages settings. Scroll down to find Protection and safety, then Manage sensitive content warnings to then be able to toggle Warnings in Google Messages on or off. Google says these warnings are handled by on-device AI (so the feature “doesn’t send identifiable data or any of the classified content or results to Google servers”). If the Android System SafetyCore behind the feature thinks the image might contain nudity, a few things happen. First, if the sender has the feature on, they’ll be warned about the risks of sending nude images before being asked to confirm if they do indeed wish to send it. Similar warnings and confirmations will appear if you’re trying to share a nude image with another person. The receiver will then (if they have content warnings on) see a blurred image, be warned about how nude images can be harmful, have the option to delete the image before seeing it, the chance to block the number which sent the image, and the option to view the image if they choose. With the feature finally starting to appear, it shouldn’t be long before more of us can rely on these AI-powered content warnings to help us stay safer online.

    "article_text": "ICE looks to use an algorithm for \"targeting and enforcement prioritization\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has awarded a $29.9 million contract to software firm Palantir to build a software system to quickly enforce the Trump administration's deportation targets,404 Media reports. Leaked messages show Palantir’s role includes finding the “physical location of people who are marked for deportation” and “producing leads for law enforcement to find people to deport and keeping track of the logistics of Trump’s mass deportation effort.” No other bids were heard by the department, as Palantir is the only vendor able to deliver the system on such a quick turnaround (September 25), the department argues. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month. Keeper generates and stores strong passwords so you never have to remember them again. Don’t let one weak password leave you exposed. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Palantir chairman Peter Thiel was an early backer of Trump, and the company already holds several defense contracts, and has worked in partnership with ICE since 2014. The software firm also works in partnership with the US and Israeli militaries, and took over the Pentagon’s Project Maven contract - using machine learning for unmanned drones and weapons systems - afterGoogledecided not to pursue the development following petitions and resignations from staff. Trump’s denial of due process to deportees, expulsion of legal residents, and evasion of court orders has garnered serious backlash, with civil rights organizations calling on tech companies to end their relationships with the administration and law enforcement agencies. This backlash led Ted Mabrey, Palantir’s global head of commercial towrite on Twitterthat new tech workers joining in the wake of Palantir’s contract to “expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle,\" adding that, \"the only way to counter these bullies is not to argue but to build.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

    "article_text": "One wrong click could expose victims to cyber fraud When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybercriminals are hijacking popularYouTubechannels at an alarming rate, exposing viewers to scams, malware, anddata theft- and with billions of views and millions of followers at stake, one wrong click can have devastating consequences. New research by Bitdefender Labs claims social media account takeovers surged throughout 2024 and continued evolving into early 2025. Content creators and influencers with significant followings and view counts have become primary targets. Bitdefender detected over 9,000 malicious livestreams on YouTube in 2024. These are often hosted on hijacked channels that impersonate trusted brands and public figures to spread fraud and malware. One such compromised account had a total view count of 12.4 billion; if just 1% of viewers were deceived, 124 million users would be affected. Attackers frequently impersonate popular brands like Tesla, Ripple, or SpaceX, hosting fake livestreams featuring deepfakes of public figures such as Elon Musk or Donald Trump to promote cryptocurrency scams and phishing links. Beyond YouTube, Instagram has also been a major target. Hackers impersonate Meta or Instagram Support in phishing emails, clone login pages, and manipulate creators into sharing SMS verification codes. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Malicious sponsorships are another method of infiltration. Cybercriminals lure creators into downloading malware-laced files disguised as promotional content. Malvertising - ads for fake AI tools or games likeGTAVI - that install info-stealers and remote access trojans on victims’ devices are also common tactics. Events that draw large online audiences, such asApplekeynotes, the XRP-SEC lawsuit, or CS2 tournaments, are frequently exploited. Attackers use these moments of peak interest to launch scams disguised as official livestreams or contests. For instance, during the 2025 White House Crypto Summit, fake YouTube streams promoted fraudulent airdrops to trick viewers into surrendering sensitive information or cryptocurrency. To stay safe, creators are urged to use thebest browserswith built-in security features, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), and closely monitor account activity for suspicious changes. Scrutinizing unexpected sponsorship offers, especially those tied to trending topics, is also essential. It’s recommended to implement thebest DDoS protectionto guard against service disruptions following account takeovers, and to use a reliableproxy serviceto add a layer of anonymity and security when managing accounts across platforms. Bitdefender also advises creators to train team members on current threats and to stay updated through official security bulletins from platforms and cybersecurity researchers. Tools like Bitdefender Security for Creators offer dedicated protection, including 24/7 account monitoring, scam email filters, and guided recovery options in the event of a breach.

    "article_text": "Some Chinese companies still want to list in the US When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Several Chinese companies are considering IPOs in the US despite major market instability brought on by US-China tensions, which have resulted in an aggressive trade war fuelled by tariffs. TheSouth China Morning Postrevealed how a handful of Chinese startups are currently exploring options to expand to the US, however no decisions have been made and they could back out at any time. Among the companies considering options overseas is Walnut Coding, which could seek to raise around $100 million. Founded in 2017, Walnut Coding describes itself as a “leader in coding education in China,” covering the likes of Scratch, Python and C++. In February 2024, it had 7.2 million paying customers. Computing infrastructure provider Shenzhen Cloudsky Technologies as well as Zaihui and Zhonghe Group, which are known for their software services, could also be looking to raise $100 million, according to unnamed people familiar with the matter. However, the companies’ explorations may grind to a halt depending on how the trade war plays out. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the delisting of some Chinese companies is currently “on the table” (viaBloomberg).

More broadly, the US has imposed triple-figure tariffs on some Chinese goods, but China has fought back by promising to take countermeasures to any “party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests.” Trump says more than 70 nations have reached out to start negotiations already. In relation specifically to the US, China hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US, promising to “fight to the end” in a battle that could go on for longer than previously anticipated.

    "title": "ChatGPT crosses a new AI threshold by beating the Turing test",
    "article_text": "But that's not the same as consciousness When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Artificial intelligence sounds pretty human to a lot of people, but usually, you can tell pretty quickly when you're engaging with an AI model. However, that may change asOpenAI's new GPT-4.5 model passed the Turing Test by fooling people into thinking it was a human over the course of a five-minute conversation. Not just a few people, but 73% of those participating in a University of California, San Diegostudy. In fact, GPT-4.5 outperformed some of the actual human participants, who were accused of being AI in the blind test. Still, the fact that the AI did such a good impression of a human being that it seemed more human than actual humans says a lot about the brilliance of the machine or just how awkward humans can be. Participants sat down for two back-to-back conversations with a human and achatbot, not knowing which was which, and had to identify the AI afterward. To help GPT-4.5 succeed, the model had been given a detailed personality to mimic in a series of prompts. It was told to act like a young, slightly awkward, but internet-savvy introvert with a streak of dry humor. With that little nudge toward humanity, GPT-4.5 became surprisingly convincing. Of course, as soon as the prompts were stripped away and the AI went back to a blank slate personality and history, the illusion collapsed. Suddenly, GPT-4.5 could only fool 36% of those studied. That sudden nosedive tells us something critical: this isn't a mind waking up. It’s a language model playing a part. And when it forgets its character sheet, it’s just another autocomplete. The result is historic, no doubt. Alan Turing's proposal that a machine capable of conversing well enough to be mistaken for a human might therefore have human intelligence has been debated since he introduced it in 1950. Philosophers and engineers have grappled with the Turing Test and its implications, but suddenly, theory is a lot more real. Turing didn't equate passing his test with proof of consciousness or self-awareness. That's not what the Turing Test really measures. Nailing the vibes of human conversation is huge, and the way GPT-4.5 evoked actual human interaction is impressive, right down to how it offered mildly embarrassing anecdotes. But if you think intelligence should include actual self-reflection and emotional connections, then you're probably not worried about the AI infiltration of humanity just yet. GPT-4.5 doesn’t feel nervous before it speaks. It doesn’t care if it fooled you. The model is not proud of passing the test, since it doesn’t even know what a test is. It only \"knows\" things the way a dictionary knows the definition of words. The model is simply a black box of probabilities wrapped in a cozy linguistic sweater that makes you feel at ease. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The researchers made the same point about GPT-4.5 not being conscious. It’s performing, not perceiving. But performances, as we all know, can be powerful. We cry at movies. We fall in love with fictional characters. If a chatbot delivers a convincing enough act, our brains are more than happy to fill in the rest. No wonder 25% of Gen Z now believe AI isalready self-aware. There's a place for debate around this, of course. If a machine talks like a person, does it matter if it isn’t one? And regardless of the deeper philosophical implications, an AI that can fool that many people could be a menace in unethical hands. What happens when the smooth-talking customer support rep isn’t a harried intern in Tulsa, but an AI trained to sound disarmingly helpful, specifically to people like you, so that you'll pay for a subscription upgrade? Maybe the best way to think of it for now is like a dog in a suit walking on its hind legs. Sure, it might look like a little entrepreneur on the way to the office, but it's only human training and perception that gives that impression. It's not a natural look or behavior, and doesn't mean banks will be handing out business loans to canines any time soon. The trick is impressive, but it's still just a trick.

    "article_text": "Network edge devices are a key point of entry for attackers When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It won’t come as much of a surprise to learn that cyberattackers are evolving their tactics, and that the number of attacks is growing each year. New research from Sophos shows that these incidents involving network edge devices like routers,VPNs, andfirewalls, are becoming a growing point of intrusion - accounting for nearly 30% of initial compromises observed inSophos’ Annual Threat Report. Within ransomware and data exfiltration attacks, VPNs were the most popular initial compromise type - making up 25% of events, even higher than compromised credentials, which sits at just over 15% - concerning given thatbillions of credentials are stolen from businesses around the worldevery year. Unsurprisingly, ransomware topped the table for number of incidents, with over 90% of incident response cases for midsize organizations, and 70% of small business cases involving the attack.

Keeper generates and stores strong passwords so you never have to remember them again. Don’t let one weak password leave you exposed. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) A noticeable trend in cybersecurity is the rise in social engineering attacks, primarily to collect credentials in order to move forward into the targeted organization’s network. This is largely due to AI enabling attackers to send out more sophisticated phishing attacks at a higher rate than ever. “Over the past several years, attackers have aggressively targeted edge devices. Compounding the issue is the increasing number of end-of-life (EOL) devices found in the wild – a problem Sophos calls digital detritus. Because these devices are exposed to the internet and often low on the patching priority list, they are a highly effective method for infiltrating networks,” said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher at Sophos. Out-of-date tech poses a serious risk to cybersecurity teams, and iscosting organizations in operational costs and security risks- making lifecycle management an integral part of cyber defense. “However, targeting edge devices is part of a larger shift we’re witnessing in which attackers don’t have to deploy custom malware. Instead, they can exploit businesses’ own systems, increasing their agility and hiding in the places security leaders aren’t looking,” Gallagher adds.

    "title": "The second pair of open earbuds with Bose tech are coming, but not from Bose",
    "article_text": "Here's a clue for you: hello, Moto When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Motorola seems to be about to launch its first ever pair of open earbuds in partnership with Bose. And they'll be launching alongside a new Motorola smartwatch too. That's according to well-known leaker Evan Blass, who posted an image of both products tohis X account. This isn't the first time Motorola has worked with Bose on a set of buds: it did the same with the Moto Buds+. And if that's any indication, the new earbuds should sound great: in ourMoto Buds+ reviewwe described them as \"brilliant budget wireless buds\" – although the app lacked support for some Android devices, and wasn't available for iOS at all. The product name, price and availability haven't been announced yet, although Blass previously reported on the existence of \"Moto Loop Earbuds\". The images tell us that the earbuds are clip-ons, come in a white gold finish and include a case very much like the one you get with a set ofBose QuietComfort 2 earbuds. Given the Bose connection, it's worth reading up on theBose Ultra Open earbuds: we reckon they're thebest open earbudson the market right now at the more premium end, and they offer a very impressive audio experience despite being open. But obviously, some people want a more affordable option, and the Moto option might provide that. Bose is on a budget partnership roll right now –Skullcandy just announced its new buds that have Bose sound and noise cancellation tech built-in, and are launching at just $99 / £99.

As for the smartwatch, that's a bit less exciting: the Moto Watch Fit, if that's what it's called, looks very like a squarer version of the currentMoto Watch 40. It's been reported as anApple WatchSE rival, so while it may be a little more expensive than the Watch 40 it should still be a fairly affordable device.

    "title": "'Ruined my entire week, month, and year': The Last of Us season 2's new episode has devastated viewers, unsurprisingly",
    "article_text": "Spoilers incoming! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well, it's here.The Last of Us' TV viewers onMaxhave caught up to the crushing linchpin of the story's second act that those who played the game have been dreading. At the end of the second episode, Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) takes revenge for her father's death and brutally kills Joel (Pedro Pascal) in front of Ellie (Bella Ramsey), who can do nothing but cry and plead in anguish, and in vain. With confirmation that a third season is on the way, there's been heavy implication that the story of the second game would be split across seasons, and I assumed that they might tweak the order of the narrative to push Joel's death to the end of the second season. But no, here we are, looking out today across a landscape of social media posts and reviews from people who are – among other emotions – crushed, furious, confused, and impressed. I have to start withthe post on X from @scarjsnthat I referenced in the headline, saying \"ellie hugging joel's body just ruined my entire week, month, and year\" because that seems to have hit the target for a lot of people, as does this post. i don’t know if there’s anything i’ll ever be able to do to emotionally recover from this moment. #TheLastOfUsSeason2 pic.twitter.com/bisjISeNnjApril 21, 2025 The moment has hit people in a few different ways. There is, it has to be said, the Pedro Pascal of it all. There is a pretty major portion of the world whose attachment is to having this extremely charming and handsome star at the center of the show – especially given his adorable real-life relationship with Bella Ramsey. A large number of people are devastated at losing him as much as the character. But for sure there is a huge amount of love for the character being expressed in people's sadness and anger. It takes a few forms, including people taking what you might call a bittersweet approach, looking at how we got to see the best parts of his character in the final stretch of his life… Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. joel couldn’t save his daughter, so he protected every goddamn teenage girl until it killed him #TheLastOfUs pic.twitter.com/SwOqvsBfhAApril 21, 2025 …and on the other hand, we have people burning with white hot and unassailable fury at Abby's actions. Adding her to my list of Top 10 MOST HATED TV CHARACTERS. And it’s only been two episodes. IDGAF what her reason was. I hate this mf’er with a passion and hope she eats pavement (the actress great tho, like kudos to her). #TheLastOfUs #TLOU pic.twitter.com/VqvgRkYStVApril 21, 2025 In the current world where people seem increasingly unwilling to keep the real world and fiction separate, the TLoU team and Max seem to have prepared a bunch of social content of everyone on the show palling around, having a great time, and generally loving each other very much. It's a slightly sad fact that the post below from Pascal was clearly necessary, and that the reason behind it was instantly noticeable, with one Reddit noting \"The fact that Pedro posted this photo after episode 2 so his fans wouldn't hate her\", while the Daily Beastdescribed it as Pascal 'shielding' Dever from fans. (When the game came out, the actress who portrayed Abby in it received a long-running flood of abusive messages and death threats.) A post shared by Pedro Pascal he/him (@pascalispunk) A photo posted by on Bella Ramsey's portrayal of Ellie throughout the whole episode has drawn a lot of praise, not just for the big climax (which we'll come to), but more broadly for how subtly and honestly they portray the mixed feelings that come in the aftermath of the dance. That's helped by the show filling itself with subtle nods to their bond going beyond outward actions or words (pay close attention to the guitar…), but also in Ramsey's delivery of the line below (full or dramatic irony as it may be). \"I'm still me, he's still Joel and we... nothing's gonna change. ever.\" 😭😭😭#TheLastOfUs pic.twitter.com/d5ZbLgZLGoApril 21, 2025 There are other shifts in Ramsey's physicality that denote changes deep in Ellie's core. \"She looks somehow older in the space of an episode and like a genuine demon waiting to be unleashed,\"says this Reddit thread from a usersaying any concerns about Ramsey playing the older Ellie of season 2 had been eliminated. Of course, subtlety in the delivery out the window when Ellie is injured, trapped helpless on the floor, and forced to watch the person she loves the most die horribly. Ramsey goes through so many modes in those scenes, and looks as physically destroyed by her anguish as she sounds. The nuclear fury, the painful realization, the cruel half-hope, and the end. bella ramsey, the emmy is yours pic.twitter.com/7ufQGEqhqHApril 21, 2025 The interesting question is how well the viewership at large responds toThe Last of Us' big change. Obviously, that's going to depend partly on what actually comes next, and I'm not going into anything from the game here. But it's a big risk – this moment is so cruel to so many characters, and it's possible for a dark show to gotoodark in the eyes of its viewers. That's the question raised byThe Guardian, which asks \"will this show survive that horrific death?\". Writer Graeme Virtue adds: \"You could also call that ending brave, or even foolish … By killing off Joel in such a savage fashion, and further traumatising Ellie, you surely risk pushing the story too far into bleakness.\" Collider has an interesting take on the unflinching brutality of it all:\"Like it or not, we needed to see [Joel die] in 'The Last of Us' season 2\". \"Some viewers may have thought it was too much, but, unfortunately, the depiction of Joel's death is a necessary plot point of this adaptation ofThe Last of Us, and it isn't about gratuitous violence and gore,\" writes Julio Bardini. \"Instead, it's about being true to one of the most important unspoken rules of storytelling:if someone dies, you've got to show a body.\" Bardini notes that permanent death has become hard to believe in the era of legacy-sequel revivals or long-running franchises simply needing to get people in their seats, and the return of a fan-favorite is an easy way to do that. If you want people to feel the devastation thatTLoUviewers are feeling right now, you need to make clear that there is no ambiguity about it. It's fair to say the show achieved that, and now we are at whatEsquire has called \"past the point of no return.\" As Brady Langmann says: \"This show belongs to Bella Ramsey now.\" Matt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

    "title": "I can't wait to try Edits, Instagram's answer to CapCut, and it's out now as a free download",
    "article_text": "Edits promises to be a one-stop shop from ideation to export When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Instagram’s answer to CapCut is finally here. Edits was first teased by Adam Mosseri, the Meta-owned social media giant's head, in mid-January, as TikTok was facing its first ban in the US. It was originally supposed to launch in February, then March, but here we are in April, and today’s the day. As initially promised, Instagram Edits is available for free on Android and iOS. It lands as a familiar timeline-based editor offering deep integration with Instagram, meaning you can view your metrics, watch other Reels, browse through all the available sounds and audio clips, and even apply popular effects. Unlike CapCut, which is owned by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, or other video-editing apps for mobile, Instagram is billing Edits as a one-stop shop. As you can see from the screenshots below, there's a lot of focus on creation and ideation. Beyond importing video, making cuts, adding text, and implementing effects, you can use sticky notes of sorts to create lists of ideas or manage various projects. As noted above, you can watch other Reels and browse for them without leaving the app. Plus, you’ll have the ability to save notes associated with them – maybe it’s one you want to remix or just an excellent custom audio you want to use in your next video. The big appeal, though, for the Instagram faithful is a promised high-quality camera for \"enhanced video recording.\" This way, you can capture and edit right in the app, versus shooting in another app and then moving it into Instagram. Again, as a trend for Meta, the goal is to own the whole process. Now, whether you shoot in the app or import, there are plenty of editing tools available. Mosseri initially teased that Edits would have all the tools you’d expect, and those are here. Instagram is tossing in some more unique ones, though, including the ability to pull from popular effects like a green screen. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. More advanced effects, like Cutouts, which allows you to isolate a person or object on screen with tracking, or Antimate, which likely utilizes a Meta LLM, can turn images into video for engaging moments, are also included. Both seem pretty handy, and are located at the very bottom of the interface as a row of tools. Above it, you’ll have a classic timeline that harkens back to iMovie and looks quite reminiscent of CapCut. You’ll have your main video track with audio below it, as well as room for on-screen elements like text or overlays. While I haven’t tried Edits yet, the core functions seem to be on a par with those of other video editors, and it should be easy enough to quickly create an edit with drag-and-drop, cuts, splits, and more. Edits also has a Captions tool, as well as options to record a voiceover and add other elements. Instagram is also promising to listen to feedback, and already has a list of features that are set to arrive in the next few updates to Edits, including the ability to use AI to modify videos, likely with a prompt; keyframes, collaboration features, and an expansion to built-in elements like fonts, filters, and voice effects, among other things. The platform also promises to listen to feedback on Edits and use it to inform the development roadmap. I'm curious to see how Edits stacks up, given that CapCut, which I use quite a bit, disappeared for a while TikTok was banned. You can edit up to 10 minutes of video, and Instagram promises watermark-free exports to its own platform as well as general saves to the device. Additionally, while the AI features aren’t make or break, they could let creators spice up content, and I like the promised functionality of Cutouts. So, yes, while the design does resemble CapCut, that platform didn’t necessarily reinvent the wheel of video editing on the fly. If anything, Instagram launching Edits as a free video editor on iOS and Android should inspire some new features for competing apps to help level the playing field. If you’re interested in trying Edits, it’s rolling out now for Android and iOS. Jacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

    "article_text": "The end of unlicensed VPNs in Pakistan? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pakistan's telecom authority continues its quest to regulate the use of unlicensed VPNs across the country despite pushbacks. On April 18, 2025, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) granted the needed license to three companies in order to provide their services in the country. The Authority now urges all VPN providers operating in Pakistan to obtain a license to avoid potential service disruptions. All this comes as increasingly more Pakistanis have been using some of thebest VPNservices to access X, which has been blocked since February 2024, and other restricted social media platforms. \"The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has commenced the licensing ofVirtual Private Network (VPN)service providers under the Class License for the Provision of Data Services in Pakistan. As part of this process, PTA has already granted Class Licenses to provide VPN services to three companies,\" the PTA wrote in anofficial announcement. The plan for a new licensing category for VPN providers was first unveiled in December last year in a bid toregulate Pakistan VPN usage. Companies need to apply for a permit to operate within the country and avoid potential blocks. As the Pakistani English-speaking newspaperThe Dawnpointed out at the time, the PTA plan envisages local companies to provide VPN orproxy servicesto citizens, instead of foreign companies, which are more difficult to control. This may mean the anonymity of Pakistani VPN users could be compromised when using a licensed provider as authorities may be able to monitor VPN traffic. A post shared by PTA (@ptaofficialpk) A photo posted by on As mentioned earlier, the Authority is now urging all VPN providers operating in the country to apply for the needed license. \"Timely licensing will help prevent potential service disruptions and ensure uninterrupted access for their customers,\" wrote the PTA. VPN services remain a necessary tool at the time of writing to keep accessing all the main social media platforms in Pakistan, including X, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and even Bluesky. Given last year's failures in successfully regulating VPN usage in Pakistan – authorities were forced to withdraw the ban on unregistered services due to a lack oflegal grounds to ban VPNs– it's difficult to predict what's at stake for VPN users in the country. Talking to TechRadar back in December,Proton VPNconfirmed that if the PTA's VPN framework is eventually enforced for all providers, the company's response would be to replace its physical servers with its Smart Routing technology, as the companydid in Indiain 2022.

IT admins will be able to access an XAM console that will provide visibility on user lifecycle, surface insights, policies across users, their devices, and the applications they access. \"The way people work has fundamentally changed, and security needs to catch up quickly,” said David Faugno, Co-CEO at 1Password. “The explosion of SaaS has increased access management and governance complexity, and now, agentic AI is compounding that challenge.” “Organizations need a new approach, one that not only secures managed devices and applications but also the unmanaged tools that employees and AI agents actually use to get work done. That’s exactly what 1Password Extended Access Management is built for. We’re not just solving today’s problems; we’re shaping the future of identity and access management security - one that empowers productivity without compromising protection,” Faugno added. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! From today, 1Password has made an SDK for Agentic AI available to help developers build secure AI workflows through programmatic management of vault items. What’s more, developers and IT admins will be able to create scoped API keys to allow AI agents to access vaults without exposing credentials, and allow AI agents to perform efficiently without exposing businesses to additional risk. The 1Password enterprise password manager now also offers secure vaults for AI agents, where they can retrieve information needed to access service providers, while also providing audit logs. “AI agents will rapidly become the hardest-working members of today’s workforce,” said Jeff Shiner, Co-CEO at 1Password. “They operate non-stop at machine speed, scaling workflows in ways we’ve never seen—but they don’t fit neatly into old security models. That’s why we created Agentic AI Security: to help businesses move fast and stay secure, giving developers the tools to innovate confidently while providing security teams the visibility they need.” 1Password has also announced that it has partnered with Drata to offer enhanced compliance through continuous monitoring, secure access enforcement, and real-time insights across the edge, AI-driven tools, and employee-owned devices. “Security and compliance are inseparable, especially as SaaS sprawl and AI adoption introduce new layers of complexity and risk,” said David Faugno, Co-CEO of 1Password. “Organizations can’t achieve lasting compliance without securing how people, devices, applications, and AI agents access their critical business data, and you can’t secure access without continuously verifying compliance.” “This partnership with Drata helps unify these efforts, giving companies the ability to enforce strong security policies across all identities, applications, and devices—both managed and unmanaged—while staying continuously audit-ready. It’s a step toward a more modern, automated, and resilient approach to trust at scale,” Faugno concluded. Benedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham. During this time he studied BA Politics with Journalism, for which he received a second-class honours (upper division),  then continuing his studies at a postgraduate level, achieving a distinction in MA Security, Intelligence and Diplomacy.

    "title": "Witkoff expects to meet Putin – White House",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is heading to Russia for another meeting with President Vladimir Putin later this week, the White House has confirmed. Witkoff has held multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including at least three meetings with Putin, and is seen as one of the architects of the rapprochement between Moscow and Washington during Trump’s second presidency. Russian presidential adviser Yury Ushakov confirmed on Tuesday that reports of Witkoff’s upcoming visit wereaccurate. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists later in the day that both Trump and Witkoff“wanted everybody to know that the negotiations continue.” “We feel, again, we are hopefully moving in the right direction, and the special envoy Steve Witkoff will be heading to Russia again later this week to continue talks with Vladimir Putin,”Leavitt said. The White House did not announce Witkoff’s exact travel plans after the Financial Times reported that he would skip a meeting with European and Ukrainian officials to visit Moscow instead. Washington is expected to present its peace framework in London on Wednesday, following a series of high-level meetings in Paris last week, where Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held discussions with French, British, German, and Ukrainian officials. Rubio, however, will not attend the latest round of talks due to his“busy”schedule, according to spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Instead, Washington will be represented by General Keith Kellogg, another of Trump’s envoys tasked with direct negotiations with Kiev. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the US proposals could include formallyrecognizing Crimeaas Russian territory and potentially lifting sanctions on Moscow. Meanwhile, the Financial Times claimed that Russia is prepared to halt hostilities along the current front line. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, warned that“a lot of fakesare being published now, including by respected publications,”and urged the public to rely on official sources regarding developments in US–Russian talks on the Ukraine conflict. Russia has repeatedly stated that any peace deal must address the“root causes”of the conflict, including NATO’s eastward expansion and Kiev’s aspirations to join the US-led bloc. Moscow has also demanded that Kiev recognize not only Crimea, but also the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, along with the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as part of Russia.",

    "title": "Rubio and Witkoff to skip London Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will not attend the upcoming Ukraine talks in London, despite earlier plans to take part, the State Department has confirmed. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, has also withdrawn from the meeting, according to the Financial Times, and is expected to visit Moscow instead. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce cited scheduling conflicts as the reason for Rubio’s withdrawal from Wednesday’s talks, insisting this does not signal a change in the US commitment to the peace process. “Secretary Rubio is a busy man… And so when there’s certain plans, they’re conditional. And in this particular instance, while the meetings in London are still occurring, he will not be attending. But that is not a statement regarding the meetings; it’s a statement about logistical issues in his schedule,”Bruce told journalists on Tuesday. General Keith Kellogg, another Trump envoy tasked with negotiating with Kiev directly, will represent Washington at the London discussions. The talks will include officials from the UK, France, and Germany – countries that advocate continued military support for Ukraine – as well as representatives from Kiev. The London talks follow a series of high-level meetings in Paris last week, where Rubio and Witkoff held discussions with European and Ukrainian officials. According to the New York Post, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov reportedly told the US envoys that Kiev is“90%”aligned with Washington’s proposed peace framework, which has not yet been made public. Sources cited by the Washington Post on Tuesday claimed that the US proposals include formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and potentially lifting sanctions on Moscow as part of a future agreement. Meanwhile, the Financial Times claimed that Russia is prepared to halt the hostilities along the current front line. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged the media and public to rely on official sources regarding developments in US–Russian talks on the Ukraine conflict, warning that“a lot of fakes are being published now, including by respected publications.”Both Washington and Moscow have officially confirmed that Witkoff will travel to Russia for talks“later this week.” Moscow has stated that the status of Crimea – which joined Russia in 2014 following a referendum held after a Western-backed coup in Kiev – and the four other former Ukrainian regions that voted to join Russia in 2022, is not subject to negotiation. Russian officials maintain that recognizing the“reality on the ground”is essential to achieving a lasting peace.",

    "title": "Date of Pope’s funeral announced",
    "article_text": "The funeral Mass for Pope Francis will be held on Saturday, April 26 in St. Peter’s Square, the Holy See Press Office announced on Tuesday. The Vatican stated that Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Dean of the College of Cardinals, will preside at the service, which will be“concelebrated by patriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests from across the globe.” The late Pope’s body will then be taken into St. Peter’s Basilica and then onward to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore for entombment. The Vatican has confirmed that the Pope’s body will lie in state inside St. Peter’s Basilica from Wednesday morning, where the faithful will be allowed to pay their respects. Viewing will begin at 9:00am on April 23 and continue until the day of the funeral. Francis died on the morning of Easter Monday at the age of 88, according to the Holy See. He passed away at his residence in Casa Santa Marta, Vatican City. The official cause of death was listed as“stroke, followed by a coma and irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse,”according to Dr. Andrea Arcangeli, Director of the Directorate of Health and Hygiene of the Vatican City State. He had also been suffering from multiple chronic illnesses, including pneumonia, hypertension, and diabetes. The Pope was last seen in public on April 20 during Easter Mass. Although his address was delivered by clergy due to his failing health, he rose from his wheelchair and waved to the crowd, saying:“Dear brothers and sisters, happy Easter.” According to his final testament, released by the Vatican, Francis requested a simple tomb“in the ground; simple, without particular ornamentation, and bearing only the inscription: Franciscus.” His final resting place will be at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, fulfilling his wish to rest near the icon of the Virgin Mary, Salus Populi Romani. This departs from the tradition of papal burials beneath St. Peter’s Basilica. Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, in 1936. He became a priest in the late 1960s and was elected pope in 2013, becoming the first Latin American and first Jesuit pontiff in history. His 12-year papacy was marked by a focus on humility, social justice, and interfaith dialogue. He was highly regarded for his advocacy for the poor, environmental stewardship, and efforts to reform the Catholic Church. He also worked towards improving relations between the Catholic Church and other religious denominations, visiting the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq as well as seeing Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill in 2016, in the first such meeting of its kind.",

    "title": "The EU’s illusion of relevance: No vision, no power, no future",
    "article_text": "The defining trait of today’s Western Europe is not unity or strength – it is the complete absence of a vision for the future. While the United States, Russia, China, India, and even Latin America actively shape and debate their long-term direction, Western Europe remains stuck in nostalgia. Its politicians are not building tomorrow but clinging to yesterday’s comforts. The continent’s political imagination seems limited to one goal: maintaining the status quo of a world that no longer exists. This backward-looking mentality has transformed the European Union into what can best be described as a“terrarium of like-minded people”– an ecosystem where each actor competes for influence, all the while privately despising the others. In theory, the EU was designed to create a shared geopolitical force. In practice, that unity has been reduced to cynical self-interest and mutual sabotage. Germany wants to preserve its economic dominance, sending constant signals to Washington that it alone is a stable transatlantic partner. France, despite its limited military capabilities, flexes what remains of its armed forces to assert superiority over Germany and southern Europe. Britain, once an outsider, is suddenly interested in being part of“Europe”again – but only to stir division and feed the fires of confrontation with Russia. Poland plays its own game, maintaining privileged ties with the US and remaining aloof from Franco-German maneuvering. Italy conducts foreign policy like an independent middle power, working with Washington and Moscow alike. Smaller European states scramble for relevance, knowing full well they are pawns on someone else’s board. Brussels, meanwhile, produces a steady flow of bureaucratic theater. Figures like Ursula von der Leyen or Kaja Kallas make loud proclamations, but everyone knows they lack real power. These are political actors without a stage, reading from scripts that no longer matter. The spectacle of European unity has become hollow – not only in appearance, but in substance. Western Europe’s decline didn’t begin yesterday. But the last 15 years have exposed how brittle the EU’s foundations truly are. After the Cold War, the dream of a strong, united Europe gained some traction: a common currency, a common foreign policy, even whispers of strategic autonomy from NATO. That dream died in Iraq in 2003, when Paris and Berlin briefly opposed Washington’s invasion. But when France rejoined NATO’s command structure in 2007, it signaled the end of any real independence. The Americans, with British support, had reasserted dominance. The euro, once hailed as the tool of European power, became Germany’s weapon of economic control. Southern and eastern member states were locked into a financial order they could not escape. Germany imposed its will during the eurozone crisis and the pandemic alike, and was hated for it. Smaller nations resented their role as appendages to the German economy, with little recourse. So when the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, the rupture of Russian-German ties was quietly welcomed across the continent. France, which gave little to Kiev, now enjoys more diplomatic prestige than Germany, which gave billions. Poland’s foreign minister practically celebrated the sabotage of Nord Stream – not because it harmed Russia, but because it weakened Berlin. EU enlargement, once seen as the triumph of European power, has become a liability. For two decades, expanding eastward was treated as a geopolitical project aimed at absorbing former Soviet spaces. But it failed to give Western Europe more clout with Washington. The new members did not submit to Berlin or Paris; they looked to the US instead. In the end, the EU overreached, alienated Moscow, and gained nothing substantial in return. Having failed at building a real foreign policy, the EU is now desperately trying to preserve what it has. But without a dream of the future, politics loses meaning. Western European life has become a loop of managing decline, while tensions within the bloc grow sharper. Britain may have left the EU, but geopolitical pressure has pushed it back into the game. Unable to solve its own domestic crises – with four prime ministers in three years – London doubles down on anti-Russian rhetoric to stay relevant. But it doesn’t want to fight, so it pushes its continental allies to do it instead. It’s classic British strategy: let others bleed. Most Germans would love to restore ties with Russia and get back to cheap energy and easy profits. But it can’t. The Americans are firmly entrenched on German soil, and Berlin’s military-industrial elite wants NATO spending to continue. Southern Europe, impoverished and increasingly resentful, can no longer sustain German prosperity. France hopes to exploit this, imagining itself as Europe’s new nuclear umbrella. Macron talks big, but everyone knows he rarely delivers. This brings us to 2025. As tensions with Russia and China rise, EU leaders have been lining up to visit Washington. Except, of course, for the Germans, who are still trying to form a government after chaotic elections. From Poland to France, each leader went to ask Trump for preferential treatment. Divide and rule is still the American playbook, and the Western Europeans keep falling for it. In the East, Hungary and Slovakia have had enough. Years of lectures from Brussels on LGBT rights and liberal values have created deep resentment. They now speak openly of aligning with Russia or China. Spain and Italy, meanwhile, are refusing to see Moscow as a threat. Meloni deals with Washington bilaterally and doesn’t pretend to represent broader European interests. The European Commission, tasked with representing the EU, has become a parody of itself. Kaja Kallas, recently named High Representative for Foreign Affairs, immediately overstepped her role by demanding tens of billions in new aid for Ukraine. The backlash was swift. In the EU, power over money stays with national governments. Even von der Leyen, as compromised as she is, knows better than to touch those coffers without permission. What is left of Western Europe today is a political shell. A group of aging powers clinging to past glories, locked in competition with each other, lacking the will to act but refusing to step aside. Their one shared goal: to be seen in the room when Washington, Moscow, and Beijing make decisions. But it won’t be as equals – it would be as supplicants. For now, the Americans hold the leash. Only the US can impose discipline on its European satellites and give their politics a sense of direction. Russia watches all of this with measured patience. Because ultimately, if stability returns to Europe, it will be because Washington permits it – not because Brussels earned it.

    "title": "Germany tapping industry to bolster NATO response to ‘Russian attack’ – Handelsblatt",
    "article_text": "Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, has reached out to major logistics and defense companies to prepare for a possible NATO deployment to Eastern Europe“in the event of a Russian attack,”Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday. Several eastern NATO members, especially the Baltic states, have repeatedly alleged that Russia is preparing for an invasion – an accusation Moscow has consistently denied. The Bundeswehr is reportedly holding confidential discussions with firms including Deutsche Bahn, Lufthansa, and Rheinmetall to secure their support in transporting troops, weapons, and equipment. According to the newspaper, the German Defense Ministry has asked Deutsche Bahn to examine how it could help transport military convoys by rail during a crisis. Meanwhile, Lufthansa is being considered for basic training support for fighter pilots through its flight school. Rheinmetall is already involved in military logistics through a recent €260 million ($300 million) contract and is also in talks to expand its role. This effort forms part of Germany’s strategic role as NATO’s central logistics hub, the outlet reports. Under the military bloc’s new defense framework, Berlin has committed to mobilizing thousands of soldiers and hundreds of aircraft and ships within 30 days if a crisis arises. Defense officials told the newspaper that the Bundeswehr is not able to manage such large-scale mobilization on its own. German military leadership has therefore turned to the private sector to build what they describe as a“strategic deployment corridor”across the country. “The Bundeswehr relies almost exclusively on civilian commercial service providers for the logistical transport of military goods and equipment outside of crisis zones,”the Bundeswehr Operational Command told Handelsblatt.“In sea and air transport for extra-wide and extra-heavy equipment, this figure is even 100 percent.” The initiative comes as Germany seeks to recover from decades of underinvestment in its armed forces, which have left its military ill-prepared for large-scale conflict. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s €100 billion ($115 billion) special fund, announced after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, aims to reverse this trend. Germany’s chief of defense staff, Gen. Carsten Breuer, recently stated that the Bundeswehr must be war-ready by 2029 so that it is able to fight Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has consistently rejected allegations that Moscow harbors aggressive intentions toward NATO countries, calling them“nonsense”designed to alarm Western Europeans and legitimize major increases in defense budgets.",

    "article_text": "Washington will propose a peace deal recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea and freezing the front lines in the Ukraine conflict at a meeting with Ukrainian and European officials this week, the Washington Post has reported, citing sources. The US is expected to hold talks in London on Wednesday with Ukrainian and European officials as US President Donald Trump continues his push for a deal. Trump’s envoy Keith Kellogg is set to meet foreign ministers and security advisers from France, Germany, the UK and Ukraine – while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff will skip the meeting. People familiar with the matter told the outlet on Tuesday that US proposals, presented to Ukraine in Paris last week, include Washington formally recognizing Crimea as Russian territory and eventually lifting sanctions against Moscow under a future accord. One Western official described the pressure on Ukraine as“astounding.” European officials are expected to push for security guarantees for Ukraine and postwar reconstruction efforts, possibly funded in part by frozen Russian assets, the report said. Trump has threatened to walk away if progress is not made soon, and told reporters on Monday that he would be releasing details of the US proposals“over the next three days.” US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has had multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, will visit Russia later this week, Moscow has confirmed. According to one of the Post’s sources, it was“Witkoff’s idea”for the US to designate Crimea as Russian“without forcing Ukraine to recognize it.” Crimea held a referendum to join Russia in 2014 following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. The new Ukrainian government, along with its Western supporters, has refused to recognize the vote’s legitimacy. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has ruled out relinquishing any territorial claims against Russia and has urged the US and other nations to continue providing military aid – a policy the Trump administration has said it will end. Moscow insists that the status of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, and the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia in 2022, is not up for negotiation. Russian officials have emphasized that recognizing the“reality on the ground”is key to achieving lasting peace.",

    "title": "Pope Francis was a great man who ultimately made one terrible mistake",
    "article_text": "When a great man and leader of the Roman-Catholic Church – and beyond it – like Pope Francis dies, it may seem almost impious to speak or write about politics. But in his case, we know for certain that it simply means doing what he told us to do. For one of his fundamental teachings was that we have a religious and moral – not merely a civic – duty to engage in politics. He made this clear, for instance, in one of his major statements, the 2020 encyclicalFratelli Tutti(All Brothers). There, he spelled out the pronouncedly broad and political – not merely intimate, small-scale, or private – meaning of the story of theGood Samaritan, one of the most famous parables taught by the founder of all types of Christianity, Jesus of Nazareth. In Fratelli Tutti, Francis stressed that the Good Samaritan story“summons usto rediscover our vocation as citizens of our respective nations and of the entire world, builders of a new social bond”in order“to direct society to the pursuit of the common good.”That is about as far away as you can get from the intellectual platitude and ethical cop-out of religion-is-just-a-private-matter. And that was a good thing, too. Because,as Francis made clear time and again, he – rightly – saw our world in deep social, ecological, and, fundamentally, spiritual crisis. If you share his belief or not, it is important to understand that political engagement to save this world, for him, was a matter of survival of not just a species and its much-abused planet, but of God’s creation. There is something else we should remember about this late pope. He was known for being both genuinely relatable – especially with the poor, weak, abused, sinful (his last major meeting was with JD Vance, after all), and troubled – and, at the same time, capable of harsh rebuke and tough determination. Having worked as a bouncer in his youth and later as a Jesuit taskmaster, he knew how to handle the gathering of careerist, vain, pushy, and scheming egos that the higher Church also is. He was a decent and mostly kind man, but no push-over. And yet, with all his assertiveness, he was also humble, not in an ostentatious but a substantial manner: the kind of humility that makes you give up on many of the lifestyle perks that have corrupted the papacy and insteadwash the feet of prison inmates. Or admit that you are not the one to judge, as once when commenting on a priest who was said to be gay. Think about it: it is true, obviously; and, by the standards of tradition, it is at the same time something sensationally extraordinary for a pope to say about a priest. For, remember, the Roman-Catholic Church, is not a fake democracy – as secular states usually are now – but an unabashed absolute, if elective, monarchy. Against that background – Francis’s instructions to engage with politics and his fundamental humility – two simple questions make sense: What is the political meaning of his tenure as pope between 2013 and 2025? And where did he succeed and where did he fail? A full disclosure won’t do any harm either: I am writing about this pope as someone raised as a Roman-Catholic yet now largely lapsed. Largely, because, in reality, with something like a Catholic upbringing, about which I am far from complaining,“there are,”as the Russians wisely say about another experience that shapes you for life,“no formers.”Perhaps, that explains why I have always felt much sympathy for him. Although, come to think of it, that was due to his politics. Regarding those politics, for starters, let’s note a basic piece of context that, however, is often overlooked: It’s commonly noted that Francis was a multiplefirst: first pope from Latin America, first Jesuit, first one not from Europe for well over a millennium. But there was yet another important first: even if the Cold War between – very roughly – the capitalist West and the socialist-Communist Soviet camp ended in the late 1980s and Francis became pope in 2013, he was, actually, the first substantially post-Cold War pope. Counterintuitive as that fact may be, it is not hard to explain it. It was the result of the de facto rule that popes get elected when they are old and likely to be set in their ways and – usually, not always – serve until death. Specifically, once the Cold War had ended, the very Polish and very conservative John-Paul II – a quintessential Cold War pope – stayed in office until 2005. His successor, the not merely conservative but leadenly reactionary Benedict XVI from Germany was, in essence, the Angela Merkel of the Vatican: the one you call when, in reality, everything must change, but you are in obstinate denial about it. And did Benedict fulfill those expectations! It was really only after rigid Benedict abdicated and, in effect, retired – the first pope to do so in more than half a millennium – that there was an opening for finally moving the Church beyond this sorry state of stagnation. And Francis, once elected to his own surprise, certainly did his best – or, as his many critics and opponents would gripe, worst – to use that opportunity. Apart from setting an example by his personal modesty – for instance, just two rooms in a Vatican hostel, a comparatively simplepectoral cross, no flashy cape or dainty red slippers, and, finally, orders for a fairly simple coffin, lying-in-state, and burial – Francis tackled major unresolved issues inside the Church, such as finance scandals and corruption, sexual abuse, and the prevalence of rule by clique and intrigue. On these issues, he certainly didnotuniversally succeed. Regarding child abuse by clericals, his reactions and actions were honest, well-intentioned, and sometimes unprecedented and consequential: as when he, in essence,forced a mass resignation of bishops in Chile and defrocked a truly demonic US cardinal for his revolting crimes and sins. But his record remains mixed. He himself, to his credit, ended up admitting his“grave mistakes”in this crucial area.Victims of clerical child abusersand critics find that his efforts did not go far enough. Franciscould neither defeat nor eradicate the hardy networks, lobbies, and plotsof the Vatican and the Church leadership more broadly. In particular, the – surprise, surprise –conservative US cardinalsform a powerful, mean lobby. But to be fair, no single person could have cleaned up these Augean Stables. That would take a miracle, one that did not take place under this pope. Yet Francis did have an impact. His challenge was sometimes fierce, and the resistance it provoked proves that he hit a nerve. This, clearly, is an issue which will be decided, if ever, in the future. In that respect, note that kind, smiling Francis was worldly and tough enough to promote – where he could (an important caveat) – like-minded men to high office. Ashe installed the preponderant majorityof the 135 or 136 cardinals who will elect his successor, his policies might be continued. Yet Church politics is less transparent than the Trump White House and much more complex. Nothing is certain. Yet what about the world beyond the upper ranks of the Church? That is, after all, clearly what Francis – the pope with a personal cross that depicted Jesus as the Good Shepherd – cared about the most. For practical purposes and to greatly simplify, think of that world-beyond-peak-Church as consisting of two concentric circles: the inner yet large circle consists of currently about 1.4 billion Roman Catholics globally, and the outer, even larger one of everyone else in a world population over 8 billion. There, Francis pursued two great lines: He clearly sought to finally do justice to the fact that demographically and in terms of commitment and dynamism,Roman-Catholicism’s center of gravity has inexorably shifted away from Europeand, roughly speaking, to the Global South-plus: Latin America, Africa, and Asia, too.  Indeed, over the last half-century, Africa and Asia have been the only two regionswhere the increase in the number of Catholics has exceeded population growth. When elected, he immediately pointed out – with a hardly hidden edge, I believe – that his cardinal brothers had plucked him“from the ends of the Earth.”That was a statement in favor of those“ends”and against the breathtaking, institutionally inbred provincialism that has made80 percent of popes come from tiny Italy. By now, though,  the cardinals who will elect the nextpope come from 94 countries and less than 40 percent are from Europe,“with a record number from Asia and Africa.” This, true globalization of the Roman-Catholic Church in its most fundamental meaning, namely as the community of its members is what Francis was in sync with as no pope before him, not even the globe-trotting John-Paul II. If the Church is wise, it will follow his example; if it is foolish – which, historically speaking, happens a lot – it will revert to Benedict XVI’s futile retreat into the past. The other major policy Francis consistently pursued was – believe it or not – a form of socialism. Recall that socialism is a broader church than Marxism. Socialists, even by the narrowest, most modern definitions, existed before Marxism. If we widen the lens to ancient history, a certain rebel called Jesus, executed by the indispensable empire of his day, obviously, was one, too. Francis understood that and stuck to it. That is why The Economist sniffles at what it mislabels as his populist and Peronist leanings. In reality, the last pope was a sharp critic of populism, if understood as, say, Trumpism (or Sanderism-AOC-ism, I would add): thefakeappeal to longings for justice solely to control, mobilize, and profit. The core of Francis’s de facto socialist position was – as The Economist, to its credit, also admits –“scorn for capitalism”or, to quote the Washington Post, another party organ of the global oligarchy – a strong concern for“social justice.”Indeed. And then some. In sum, Francis was not a Marxist. He did not see eye to eye with Latin American Liberation Theology and his behavior during the right-wing dictatorship in Argentina may have been less than exemplary. But, as pope, he was, in effect, a man of the Left. He had the breadth of mind and the strength of character to reject the unfortunate recent hegemony of liberal capitalism in favor of something fairer and more moral, something worthy of humanity. In the dark post-Cold War that we are forced to inhabit, that fact made the Roman-Catholic pope one of the main forces (next to China, intriguingly) – weak as it may have been – of survival of leftwing ideals. Those tempted to underestimate such influence - as Stalin is reported to have done:“The pope? How many divisions?”- should ask themselves where  his Soviet Union is now (hint: nowhere). And yet the Church is still around. There was another issue of immense importance for our future on which he stood out by being more honest and more courageous than all too many others: Francis did repeatedly censure Israel’s – and the West’s – brutal slaughter of the Palestinians, using terms such as“cruelty”and“terror”and pointing out that what Israel is doing is not even war, but, clearly something worse. And yet, those who now claim that he condemned the Gaza Genocide are wrong, unfortunately. I wished he had, but he did not. The fact remains, painful as it may be for those who liked and respected him (such as I), that he failed to take this crucial and necessary step. The closest he came to it wasthe following, far too cautious statement:“According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide. It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.” That was more than almost any other leader in the“value-driven”West; it was also more than the studious public silence practiced by Pius XII during that other holocaust, when the Germans did not support Jews committing a genocide, as now, but – together with their many collaborators and friends – committed a genocide against Jews. But both are pitiably low bars. As the pope, that is, not just some political leader but a man with great soft power and extraordinary moral duties by design, he should, as a minimum, have condemned the genocide as being just that and told all Roman-Catholics that not opposing it in every way they can is a grave sin. He should also have excommunicated co-genocider-in-chief Joe Biden and preening neo-Catholic JD Vance.Pour encourager les autres.Francis did have a steely side. This was where the world needed him to show it most, but he did not. I like to think he would be the first to admit this fact. Because that is the way he was: great, fallible, and humble.",

    "title": "US slaps tariffs of up to 3,521% on China-linked solar imports",
    "article_text": "Washington has set tariffs of up to 3,521% on solar imports from Southeast Asia, according to information published by the US Department of Commerce on Monday. The hikes follow allegations that Chinese-owned manufacturers operating in the region had violated trade rules. The tariffs target imports from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, countries that collectively supplied over $12.9 billion in solar equipment to the US last year, according to Bloomberg. Known as antidumping and countervailing duties, the measures aim to counteract the impact of what the US Commerce Department deems to be unfair subsidies and pricing practices. The decision was made following a petition lodged by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which represents several US-based manufacturers. The domestic firms alleged that Chinese solar manufacturers operating factories in the four Southeast Asian countries exported panels at prices lower than production costs and benefited from unfair subsidies that undermine the competitiveness of American products. The penalties vary by company and country: Jinko Solar's products from Malaysia face combined dumping and countervailing duties of 41.56%, Trina Solar's Thai-made goods are subject to 375.19% tariffs, and Cambodian suppliers, who did not cooperate with the probe, face punitive levies of up to 3,521%. Critics of the measure, such as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), argue that the tariffs would hurt US solar manufacturers by increasing the cost of imported cells, which American factories use to assemble panels, Reuters noted. The International Trade Commission, an independent, nonpartisan US federal agency that investigates trade-related matters, is set to vote in June to determine whether the domestic industry was materially harmed by the imports, a necessary step for the tariffs to take full effect. After similar duties were imposed on solar imports from China roughly 12 years ago, Chinese firms responded by setting up operations in other nations that weren’t affected by the tariffs, noted Bloomberg. The new levies will come on top of the broad tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump, which have jolted global markets. So far, Trump has imposed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and threatened a further possible hike to 245%. China has accused the US of“bullying,”retaliated with a 125% tax on US products and vowed to“fight to the end.”",

    "title": "Netanyahu ordered security service to spy on protestors – intel chief",
    "article_text": "The head of Israel’s Shin Bet, its domestic intelligence agency, has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of firing him for his refusal to carry out a number of illegal operations, including spying on domestic protestors. Ronen Bar was formally sacked last month, with the official reason cited as a lack of trust and the spy chief’s alleged failure to prevent the October 2023 Hamas attack. It marked the first time in Israeli history that a domestic security chief was fired by the government. However, the Israeli Supreme Court has issued an injunction freezing the dismissal. In a 31-page affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court on Monday, Bar dismissed the official reason, stating that it“does not lie in the professional realm but in a demand for personal loyalty”to Netanyahu. He claimed that the Israeli prime minister wanted“to see the Shin Bet act against citizens involved in protest activity and demonstrations against the government,”with a special focus on monitoring“protest funders.” According to Bar, he was also told to ignore court rulings in the event of a constitutional crisis and to obey the prime minister. On top on that, Bar claimed he was pressured to help Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges, avoid testifying in the case. At the same time, the Shin Bet head acknowledged the agency’s failings ahead of the Israel-Hamas war and indicated he would resign before the end of his term. Netanyahu is on trial in three graft cases, in which he is accused of taking bribes and luxury gifts from media personalities in exchange for furthering their financial interests. The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing. Responding to the affidavit, Netanyahu’s office said it was“full of lies,”adding that Bar had“failed miserably”in his response to the Hamas attack. Since the Hamas surprise assault, Netanyahu has faced widespread and persistent protests across the country. Many Israelis have accused his government of failing to prevent the deadly incursion and criticized his handling of the Gaza war. Demonstrators, including families of hostages held by Hamas, have demanded Netanyahu’s resignation and early elections.",

    "title": "White House claims entire Pentagon working against secretary of defense",
    "article_text": "The Pentagon is at war with its own chief, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. In an interview with Fox and Friends on Monday, Leavitt affirmed US President Donald Trump’s full confidence in Hegseth’s leadership. “This is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement,”she stated. Leavitt alleged that those opposed to Hegseth resent his commitment to“standing up for the war-fighter”and are resorting to“leaking and… lying to the mainstream media”to undermine him. President Trump’s administration has risen to defend Hegseth following a New York Times report published last Sunday, which accused him of sharing sensitive information regarding operations in Yemen with his wife and brother, who lacked security clearance. The NYT article is tangentially related to the ‘Signalgate’ scandal, which erupted in March after The Atlantic revealed it had accessed an internal chat among Trump administration members discussing attacks on Yemen’s Houthi rebels. This leak was attributed to National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who reportedly mistakenly saved editor Jeffrey Goldberg’s contact under an incorrect name before sending him an invite. According to the NYT, Hegseth had another private chat group on the Signal app with a dozen members from his inner circle, including his wife. Hegseth’s spokesman, Sean Parnell, claimed that the Times was attempting to bring the Signalgate story“back from the dead.” Last week, three Pentagon officials who were suspended amid an internal investigation into alleged leaks released a joint statement denouncing their alleged mistreatment. Senior adviser Dan Caldwell, deputy chief of staff Darin Selnick, and Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg, claimed that“unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.” In an opinion piece for Politico, former chief Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot argued that Hegseth is“presiding over a strange and baffling purge that will leave him without his two closest advisers of over a decade,”namely Caldwell and Selnick, as well as other key staff members.",

    "title": "China announces retaliatory sanctions against US officials",
    "article_text": "Beijing has decided to sanction individuals in the US as retaliation for Washington’s recent measures against six Chinese officials in Hong Kong. China is targeting members of the US Congress, government officials, and NGO leaders“who have acted egregiously regarding Hong Kong-related issues,”Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun announced during a regular briefing on Monday. He described the move as a rebuke to American“interference”in the affairs of the autonomous city. In late March, the US State Department accused Beijing of using its laws to“intimidate, silence, and harass 19 pro-democracy activists”in Hong Kong, forcing them to leave the territory. The US imposed sanctions on those it deems responsible, including Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Paul Lam and five security-related officials. The Chinese government has yet to disclose the specific persons targeted by the new restrictions. Hong Kong operates under a legal and political framework shaped by its 156 years of British rule, which concluded in 1997. Throughout the 2010s, the city experienced multiple waves of violent protests, which activists claimed were a response to Beijing’s encroachments on traditional freedoms, culminating in the unrest of 2019. Beijing alleges that those events were orchestrated by Western powers seeking to undermine Chinese sovereignty. In response, the national government passed a new security law in 2020, granting local authorities more power to address security threats. The legislation drew condemnation from the US and other Western nations, which claim it violates the terms of Hong Kong’s handover to China. Tensions between the US and China are currently high in the face of new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration on imported goods from a variety of countries. China, widely seen as the primary target of the measures, has refused to make concessions and hasurgedother nations to resist US pressure. In addition to commercial disputes, Washington and Beijing are at odds over Taiwan, a self-governing Chinese island that relies on the US for its defense. While China advocates peaceful reunification, it has warned that any attempt to declare formal independence could trigger armed conflict. China contends that certain elements within the US government are pushing Taiwan toward this outcome.",

    "title": "China condemns US-Philippines ‘full-scale battle’ drills",
    "article_text": "China has vehemently condemned joint US-Philippines military drills that kicked off on Monday, accusing Manila of colluding to undermine regional stability and provoke tensions over Taiwan. The 2025 Balikatan exercise, which started on April 21 and runs through May 9, involves around 14,000 troops from the US and the Philippines along with contingents from Australia and Japan. Several other countries have sent observers. The drills include live-fire training, amphibious landings, aerial surveillance, and a simulated island defense operation near the Luzon Strait, close to Taiwan. Fighter jets, warships and an array of weaponry including a US Marine anti-ship missile system will also be involved in the“full-scale battle scenario,”American and Filipino military officials have said. At a press conference on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun slammed the exercise, stating that while the international community is facing“the impact of unilateralism, protectionism, bullying, and hegemony… drills like the Balikatan undermine regional peace. “The Philippines, in collusion with countries outside the region... has undermined regional strategic stability, damaged the region’s economic growth prospects, and openly stood in opposition to regional countries,”the spokesman said. Guo went on to condemn the use of the Taiwan issue as an excuse to strengthen regional military deployment and provoke tension and confrontation, stressing that the matter is“purely China’s internal affairs.” “Those who play with fire will get burned,”Guo cautioned. Taiwan has governed itself since 1949, when nationalist forces retreated to the island after losing China’s civil war. Beijing maintains that Taiwan is part of China and has opposed any form of foreign involvement in the issue. Only a handful of nations currently recognize the island’s sovereignty, and most of the world, including Russia, adheres to Beijing’s One China policy. While Washington also officially recognizes Taiwan as part of China, it has nevertheless maintained unofficial relations with the government in Taipei and has supplied billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to the self-governing island over the years.",

    "title": "US government wants Google to sell Chrome",
    "article_text": "The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has stepped up its antitrust proceedings against Google, focusing on the company’s dominance in the internet search market. The DOJ is advocating for sweeping measures, including mandatory divestiture of the Chrome browser, according to media reports. The trial, which started on Monday, follows years of investigations, public hearings, and courtroom testimony, all of which led to a landmark judicial ruling in August that Google holds an unlawful monopoly in the search market. Judge Amit P. Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia is hearing arguments from the government and the company over how to best fix Google’s monopoly and is expected to order measures, referred to as“remedies,”by the end of the summer. In court filings, the DOJ has contended that Google must face consequences for its allegedly monopolistic behavior. Among the proposed remedies is a court-ordered sale of its widely used Chrome web browser, which plays a critical role in directing users to Google’s search engine. “This is the time for the court to tell Google and all other monopolists who are out there listening, and they are listening, that there are consequences when you break the antitrust laws,”the New York Times quoted DOJ lawyer David Dahlquist as saying. The DOJ has also demanded the termination of agreements that grant Google default search engine status on smartphones and other devices, and requested that the company share critical data with competitors to level the playing field in the search market. The plaintiffs argue that Google, which controls about 90% of the global search market, has maintained its dominance through unlawful agreements that sideline competitors, ultimately harming both consumers and advertisers. A trial held last year, which centered only on liability, revealed that Google pays Apple over $20 billion annually to ensure its search engine remains the default on Apple’s Safari browser. Arguing before Judge Mehta on Monday, Google attorney John Schmidtlein dismissed the government’s proposed remedies as“extreme”and“fundamentally flawed.” “Google won its place in the market fair and square,”Schmidtlein said, according to the Washington Post. He claimed that the government’s proposals“will reward competitors with advantages they never would have earned in a market where Google competed.” Google has said it is open to easing agreements with Apple and others to give rival search engines better placement on mobile devices. However, it rejects most of the government’s proposals, arguing they would hinder innovation. The company has also pointed to growing competition from emerging AI firms such as OpenAI.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said that he will reveal his plan to settle the Ukraine conflict later this week. According to the New York Post, the White House proposal could include the deployment of Western European troops to the country to uphold a possible ceasefire. The announcement follows last week’s remarks by Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who hinted that Washington could give up on its efforts to stop the fighting unless it sees tangible progress towards peace made by Russia and Ukraine. “I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,”Trump said on Monday, referring to his plan. “But we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia… We will see how that works,”he told journalists. The New York Post reported on Monday, citing a senior US administration official, that Russia and Ukraine are currently discussing Trump’s proposal internally. The terms for peace“are not yet set in stone,”but the US president’s plan could include the deployment of Western European troops to Ukraine once the fighting ends, the source said. According to the official, the so-called“‘resiliency force’ is part of the security guarantees that the Ukrainians want and we hope they get.” A separate peacekeeping force to monitor a possible truce, which would look like a“joint commission”of Russians, Ukrainians and a third, non-NATO country is also being discussed, the source said. The US could also be involved in it, but not as“boots on the ground, but the monetary force, along with a third party,”the official added. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s plan could include the official recognition of Crimea as Russian territory by Ukraine. Russia has categorically ruled out the possibility of Western European troops being deployed to Ukraine. It has said repeatedly that any peace deal must address the“root causes”of the conflict, including NATO’s eastward expansion and Kiev’s aspirations to join the US-led bloc. Moscow also demanded that Kiev recognize not only Crimea, but the People’ Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions as part of Russia. The Ukrainian leadership has so far rejected the idea of making any territorial concessions to Russia. Last week, Russian UN envoy Vassily Nebenzia stressed that a full ceasefire is“simply unrealistic at this stage,”accusing the West of using negotiations as a cover to rearm the Ukrainian forces.",

    "article_text": "The mufti of Moscow has expressed his condolences to all Catholics over the death of Pope Francis. Albir Krganov praised the late pontiff for his efforts to stop international conflicts and establish links with other religious denominations. Pope Francis died at the age of 88 on Monday, a day after attending Easter Sunday Mass at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican. He had headed the Catholic Church since 2013. “On behalf of Russian Muslims, we express our deep condolences to Catholics around the globe on the passing of Pope Francis,”Krganov, who also leads the Spiritual Assembly of Muslims of Russia (DSMR), said in a statement on Monday. During his 12-year papacy, Francis“devoted great attention to the issues of social justice, support for those in need, and the protection of human dignity,”he said. “His Holiness repeatedly advocated peacemaking and called for an end to conflicts, including the one in Palestine, emphasizing the importance of respecting humanitarian rights and searching for concord between peoples,”the Muslim leader noted. In his Easter Sunday address, the Pope again urged the sides of the“terrible conflict”in Gaza to“call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace.”The Palestinians in Gaza find themselves in“a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation”due to Israeli attacks, he stressed. Krganov also highlighted the pontiff’s attempts to promote“inter-religious dialogue,”saying that“the document he signed between the Vatican and Al-Azhar University became a unique example of cooperation between Christians and Muslims.” Pope Francis and the grand imam of the Cairo-based Al-Azhar University, Ahmed el-Tayeb, signed a Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together during the pontiff’s trip to Abu Dhabi, UAE in 2019. It was the first time in history that the head of the Catholic Church had visited the Arab Peninsula. “Muslims will remember him [Pope Francis] as a man who sought dialogue, justice, and peace,”the mufti of Moscow concluded.",

    "title": "US senator says new 9/11 investigation could happen",
    "article_text": "Republican US Senator Ron Johnson has suggested that new congressional hearings into the September 11 attacks may be forthcoming, citing unanswered questions surrounding the official narrative and the handling of evidence. On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four passenger airliners, crashing two into the World Trade Center towers in Manhattan. A third plane struck the Pentagon, while the fourth crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), World Trade Center Building 7 collapsed due to fires ignited by debris from one of the nearby towers. During an interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson which was published on Monday, Senator Johnson questioned several aspects of the 9/11 investigation, including the collapse of Building 7. “I don’t know that you can find structural engineers – other than the ones that have the corrupt investigation inside NIST – that would say that that thing didn’t come down in any other way than a controlled demolition,”he said. Senator Ron Johnson drops BOMBSHELL:Tells us that 9/11 Hearings are being planned, Building 7 was potentially a \"Controlled Demolition\"“Structural Engineers say that thing didn't come down in any other way than controlled demolition. Molten steel. Destruction of evidence. We…pic.twitter.com/aBQzCakll7 Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, also criticized the removal and destruction of physical evidence from the site, calling it“totally contrary to any other firefighting investigation procedures.” “Where’s all the documentation from the NIST investigation? There are a host of questions that I want and I will be asking, quite honestly, now that my eyes have been opened,”he added. When asked whether the public might see hearings on the issue, Johnson replied,“I think so.”He further suggested that President Donald Trump,“being a New Yorker himself,”might have an interest in reopening the case:“What actually happened in 9/11? What do we know? What is being covered up? My guess is there’s an awful lot being covered up in terms of what the American government knows about 9/11.” Johnson also said he recently spoke with former Congressman Curt Weldon and plans to“work with him to expose what he’s willing to expose.” Earlier this month, Weldon urged Trump to appoint“people of impeccable integrity”to lead a commission to“study the facts”surrounding 9/11. In aninterviewwith journalist Tucker Carlson, Weldon dismissed the label of conspiracy theorist, suggesting that the CIA and the government have long engaged in disinformation.“You know, what gets me is reporters who call people conspiracy theorists. Well, that’s all the agency does! They’re the ones who create the conspiracies,”he said.“They have whole courses for their agents on how to make people look like they’re conspiracy theorists.” The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, remains the most comprehensive US federal review of the attacks. However, critics have pointed to omissions and the continued classification of key government documents. Johnson also referenced a bipartisan effort with Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in 2023 to obtain unredacted FBI files.“We wanted to get those answers, those documents for the families. Again, we didn’t get squat from the FBI,”he said.",

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Buyers' Guide Living Remarkable Living Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Dining Dining Experiences Dining Experiences Experiences Travel Singapore Women Women Farhanah Khailani comes from a family of massage therapists harking back four generations, starting with her great-grandmother. She tells CNA Women what it means to keep the tradition going and live up to her family’s heritage. (From left) Farhanah Khailani, her mother Halijah Tahir, and her grandmother Hajar Agil, are all tukang urut, or massage therapists in Malay. (Photo: CNA/Izza Haziqah) This audio is generated by an AI tool. For the past six decades, Hajar Agil has seen a steady stream of people almost every day, often from morning to late evening. Some come to her current home in Bedok; other times, she travels around Singapore to see them. Hajar is a massage therapist, and she has one goal in mind – to “fix” her clients with her “magic hands”, as her granddaughter Farhanah Khailani describes them. Now in her seventies, Hajar is very much sought after by clients, who come to her through word of mouth, from neighbours, friends, friends of friends, and extended relatives. But Hajar doesn’t work alone. Helping her is her entire family:Four generationsof massage therapists, including her daughter Halijah Tahir and granddaughter Farhanah. The family specialises in Javanese and Malay massage, and Farhanah recalled that as a child, she would sit beside her grandmother and watch her work. These make up some of her earliest memories, she told CNA Women. “We help peoplefeel better. Whether it’s a neck sprain, an injured shoulder, orprenatal and postnatal care, you name it, we know how to approach it and ‘fix’ the problem,” said the 35-year-old. “My entire family,  including my aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, knows at least the basic techniques – it’s like coming from a whole family of First-Aiders. “Of course, we also know when we cannot ‘fix’ something, ” she added. “If it’s serious, like an injury that involves a huge loss of blood, we always encourage our clients to seek medical help from a doctor.” Farhanah learned the art of massage from Hajar, whom she affectionately calls Baba. The matriarch taught all her four children, including Farhanah’s mother Halijah, and nearly all her grandchildren. Farhanah runs an interior design business with her husband, but massage therapy is close to her heart. It is both her passion and her family’s legacy, she said. “I think it’d be really ‘sayang’, such a waste, if I didn’t learn how to urut (Malay for massage),” she said. “It’d feel like losing a part of my family’s history. This is something that all of us, particularly the women, share, and I’ll do whatever I can to keep it going.” Hajar was born in the 1950s. Growing up, she vividly remembers watching her mother, Yang Salamah, helping others by massaging their body aches and sprains. Most of the time, she would treat people in their kampung in Geylang, but there were also days when she would head to the community centre at Kampong Ubi, with Hajar in tow, to treat complaints, from a sore shoulder to a sprained finger. “So many people in our kampung and neighbouring kampungs knew about my mum’s magic hands,” Hajar told CNA Women in Malay. “I remember there was even a pair of police officers who helped us get water from the well in Beach Road – it was a time when we didn’t have running water and had to fetch it from wells – because my mum massaged one of their hands after he sustained an injury.” Inspired by the way her mother could ease others’ pain, Hajar decided to learn from her. “I saw how she impacted others just by making them feel better,” she said. “I wanted to do the same for others, too.” It wasn’t easy at first. As a tukang urut, one would have to touch many parts of a person’s body to address their needs, which could be embarrassing. “You can’t be geli,” Hajar said, using the Malay word for being squeamish or to be put off. Her daughter, Halijah, 54, and the family’s third-generation tukang urut, agreed. Growing up, she watched her mother and late grandmother massage others, but she was uncomfortable doing so herself. “I felt embarrassed to massage others,” Halijah said. “The thought of seeing and touching people’s bodies made me cringe slightly. Even though I’d learned the basics from my mum, it wasn’t until I was in my twenties that I got the hang of it and learned the full range of techniques.” Halijah got married at 19 and gave birth to Farhanah, her eldest child, a year later. As she navigated new motherhood and the physical toll that came with it, she decided to delay her return to her job in the offshore industry. Instead, she accompanied her mother on her house calls. Eventually, Hajar began passing some of her clients to Halijah. By the time Farhanah was seven, Halijah had become particularly skilled in prenatal and postnatal massage. “I got really good at it,” she said. “Women, new mums, would come to me and tell me how much they enjoyed my massages, how their bodies felt renewed. I have my mother and grandmother to thank – they taught me everything.” For Farhanah, massage has always been part of her world. “I remember crawling around Baba as she massaged her clients,” she said. “As a baby or toddler, I’d hold the legs of Baba’s clients while she pressed on them to help them feel better.” Unlike her mother, Farhanah never felt “geli”. She was fascinated by the craft from the time she was a pre-teen. When she was old enough, she began running errands for her grandmother, including fetching her special massage ointment, writing down client appointments in the family’s logbook, and setting up mattresses in clients’ homes for the sessions. By her late teens, she was already massaging her friends’ hands, legs, or shoulders whenever they had a headache or muscle tension. When she was 20, both her mum and grandma began passing clients her way. It wasn’t just so that she could practice, but that demand had grown so much that Hajar, Halijah and Farhanah’s aunts and uncles couldn’t keep up. “Every day, even at this age, I still see so many clients,” Hajar said. “I can’t bear to turn anyone down, so I still accept them. But instead of me attending to them, I get my girls or grandkids to do it.” Some days, clients crowd Hajar’s flat, seeking help for sprains and other injuries. There were even times, when Farhanah was younger and staying with her mum and Hajar, when the family had people knocking on their door at 3am to seek massages for their injuries. “It can be stressful and frustrating, but Baba never turned anyone away,” Farhanah said. “Those moments make me realise how much she values her gift, her ‘magic hands’ that she got from my great-grandmother. “It’s not always easy dealing with people and pain, but seeing the way my mum, aunts and Baba handle the situations makes me realise that it’s a great blessing to be able to help others and be part of a family that’s so empathetic to everyone. “Whenever I can lift the burden from my mum’s or grandmum’s shoulders, I’m happy to do so and will accept whoever they send my way,” she added. As a fourth-generation massage therapist, Farhanah feels proud to continue what her late great-grandmother started, even though she herself has no daughters. “I’m blessed with two sons who are nine and 13,” she said. “It’s different from having a daughter who can learn from me the way I learned from my mum and Baba, but just because they’re boys doesn’t mean they can’t learn the practice.” The men in the family, including Farhanah’s late uncle and her male cousins, were all taught basic massage. If she has male clients, Hajar asks her sons to attend to them. Farhanah’s eldest son has already shown signs of interest. “He follows me to meet clients, and though he doesn’t get to sit in with all of them the way I sat with my Baba, he still has an idea of what needs to be done,” said Farhanah. “I get him involved in simple cases like massaging heads, necks, shoulders or hands.” Hajar said that she feels heartened and proud that her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are not only interested in carrying on the family practice, but that they also have a sense of responsibility to do so. “When it comes to urut, we still need to be ikhlas (sincere),” she said. “I believe God gave my mother this talent to help others when they’re injured, in pain, or want to feel better. I’m grateful that this tradition can be continued. I pray it will last for as long as possible.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. At some point, you’d figure thatTodd Snyderwould level off. After all, the brand’s been making some of the best menswear in the game for years, improbably improving its offering (and collaborations) pretty much every season. It’s a trajectory that would seem unsustainable, and yet every year it continues, with the same sense of ease and elegance that their clothes exude. For those already familiar with the brand, no introduction is needed. You already know that Todd never stops refining the pieces you love, never cuts corners on fabric or quality, and that its color palette manages to somehow be adventurous but controlled at the very same time. For those unfamiliar, we’ll still do our best to keep it short. Todd Snyder (the designer) is a virtuoso when it comes to effortlessly tasteful menswear. He was the director of menswear at J.Crew in the 2000s—where he brought us the Ludlow Suit and the Secret Wash shirt, among other hits—before leaving to focus on his eponymous label in 2011. Ever since, he’s sought to apply some of the world’s finest fabrics to designs that straddle the line between contemporary and classic, always beautifully tailored and deftly detailed. Today, the size of the entire Todd Snyder offering—including the range of exceptional shoe designers he stocks—keeps on growing, so we thought we’d give you a quick primer on what the brand does best. Just know, whether you’re in the market for some wardrobe elevating all-stars or a flashy hitter for holiday season, you can probably find it at Todd Snyder. When it comes to off-the-rack suiting, Todd Snyder is virtually unbeatable—especially in the under-$1,000 category. By no means and in no world are we calling that “cheap,” but in regards to value propositions, you really won’t find anyone in that range who incorporates the kinds of fabrics (sourced from venerated Italian mills and legendary suppliers), construction elements and tailoring like Todd Snyder does. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Nearly every brand has entered the polo fray over the past year, but Todd Snyder’s—which existed long before the category’s surge in popularity—soar above the rest. The classic Johnny collars are as versatile as ever, the open-knits arejustrevealing enough, and for those questioning brisk-weather utility, the long-sleeved numbers might be even better than the short. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder has been championing Champion—and designing with it—for more than a decade now, to the point where the partnership has transcended any sort of “collaboration” title at this juncture. Every season, you can count on Todd Snyder to have some of the comfiest, well-made, retro-riffing sweats you can find, down to the archive Champion logos themselves. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder has been around for enough transitional seasons to know what makes a sweater work, not to mention how essential sweaters are when it's too warm for a coat but too cold to go without at leastsomethingcozy. Whether it's an oversized merino V-Neck, an indulgent cardigan, or classic cashmere crew, the brand has exactly the pieces you want to throw into your haul-everywhere summer tote. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Here’s the thing about Todd Snyder: it plays together like a symphony, but everything in the line also works just as well in a solo performance. Take its outerwear: The denim truckers are top-tier, the tailored zip-ups are handsome as anything, and the trenches straddle the line between classic and contemporary. Coats on, but to Mr. Snyder, hats off. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Pants are famously difficult, but Todd Snyder makes it easy. They’ve got all the cuts you might want—wide-legs, slim ones, classic straights, funky high-rise waistlines—in sumptuous fabrics, all clearly delineated between. Even better, every pair is built to make an impression that anchors whatever else you decide to layer on around them. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder If you didn’t think Todd Snyder was a head-to-toe operation, you were mistaken. Their in-house offerings—Chelsea Boots, Tyrolean Derbys, crepe-soled Desert Boots and other time-honored staples—are often slept on but are as considered, well-made and effortlessly styled as the rest of their collection. But real heads also trek to Todd for the carefully curated third-party offerings from brands like Paraboot, Yuketen,AsicsandNew Balance. In other words, you could treat Todd Snyder like nothing more than a shoe store, and it would be one of the best around. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder No “great” brand is actually great if they don’t have the shirting to match the rest of the catalog. But Todd Snyder’s live up to those standards, and then some. Their smartly-tailored dress shirts are cut from some of the finest fabrics in the world, but the more casual fare, including many seasonal options, also hits in all the right places.

    "title": "3 Scandinavian Menswear Brands Every Office Drone Should Know",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. For more menswear brands making clothes for the corporate grind,start here. It’s only a couple of seasons into2025: Global Meltdown Edition, and we’ve already noticed a few recurring plot lines. The one we’re keeping an especially wary eye on right now pales in comparison to, like, the price of eggs, but presents a set of very real dilemmas nevertheless. We’re talking, of course, about the topsy-turvy state ofoffice style, and how the heck youshould be getting dressedfor your RTO mandate, whether it involves schlepping in one day a week or five. More specifically, we’re talking about the type of office-friendly clothing that won’t make you dread the AM commute, that may, in fact, provide all the incentive you need to hustle your ass out of bed in the morning. Evenmorespecifically, we’re talking about the type of clothing that hails from one place and one place alone: Stockholm, the biggest city in thesecond-happiest country on earth. Which means we’re really talking about menswear brands like NN.07, Another Aspect, and Sunflower, each of which is pumping out wardrobe hits at a clip that’d make Max Martin blush. No idea what to buy for your newly-hybrid work week? They’ve got no shortage of good suggestions. NN.07 Mr Porter NN.07 Mr Porter You might knowNN.07as the brand behind Jeremy Allen White’sjacket of choiceonThe Bear, but if you stopped there you’re missing out. Its Colby 5910 button-down, for example—a kitten-soft Oxford shirt with a Goldilocks cut—is the kind of piece you’ll find yourself wearing on weekends as reliably as workdays. Looking for pants to pair it with? Try the Aden 1923 chinos, a loose-but-not-sloppy riff on theCasual Friday staplerendered in an organic cotton-twill that’s just as comfortable as your favorite jeans—and a heckuva lot more put together. NN.07 Mr Porter NN.07 Mr Porter Or check in with the team atSunflower—your favorite menswear newsletter’s favorite menswear brand—whose relaxed tropical wool trousers boast all the hallmarks of their vintage source material, sans the musty smell. (If your office skews casual, the Twist Jeans look especially killer in brown, and will positively crush with leather slip-ons and a lightweight sweater.) At first glance, Sunflower’s semi-sheer shirts and loose jeans might remind you of more established Scandinavian labels like Acne orOur Legacy, but where those brands lean hard into the latter half of the “Scandinaviancool” premise, Sunflower tones it down a notch—to an extent. Its house-speciality Stable shirt, for instance, comes in the type of cotton poplin that wouldn’t raise an eyebrow anywhere but the snootiest law firm, but is also available in barely-there linen and a sheer seersucker blend. Sunflower SSENSE Sunflower SSENSE Sunflower SSENSE Sunflower SSENSE Then there’s Another Aspect, a low-key Copenhagen label that’ll make you reconsider basically everything already in your closet. Its pants fit better, its knits sit better, and its shirts look like they waltzed out of a 1995 paparazzi spread. If you decided to grab, say, the Another Shirt 1.0 and the Another Jeans 3.0, you’d unlock a minimum of three new outfits instantaneously. (That number grows to at least seven if you get creative.) Here’s the best part about all three brands, though: they demand nothing from you or your wardrobe. You can add a single piece from whichever of ‘em without worrying about how it’ll get along with the office-vetted clothing already at your disposal, or you can spring for a head-to-toe overhaul without giving your coworkers whiplash. Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Another Aspect Silver linings can be hard to find as the WFH-era becomes a memory, but scoring a grip of new clothes you’ll love wearing in the office—and maybe even moreoutsideof it—is a major W in our books, no matter where 2025 heads next.",

    "title": "12 Best Sleeper Sofas in 2025 That Sleepyhead Editors Recommend",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. A night on one of the best sleeper sofas doesn't have to be a tossing-and-turning affair. Theplush sleep surfaceswill eliminate all memory of any time spent on a minuscule futon. Is there a better gift you can give an overnight guest aside from a guest bed? Unlikely. However, actually finding one of these excellent couches is easier said than done. There are hundreds of sleeper sofas available online that purport to be comfortable sofasandcomfort sleepers, which can range wildly in footprint, aesthetic, and, importantly,price. You’ll find plenty of options that promisesupportive, built-in innerspring mattresses—only to learn that said mattress is only an inch and a half thick. According toLindsay Pennington, a Los Angeles–based interior designer, sleeper-sofa innovation is largely thanks to accessibility of excellent, lighter-weight foam mattresses. “[Previously], if a sleeper sofa had a really high-quality mattress, it would be bottom-heavy,” Pennington says. “The frame would probably sag over time because it was supporting the weight of the mattress. It would also be more difficult to open and actually lay out the mattress [because of that weight].” These improvements have ushered in the era of the sleeper sofa being a legitimately comfortable, functional, and versatile option for many people hosting the occasional guest. To help you pick the best sleeper sofa for your specific space, we tried top options and scoured the internet to find additional picks, keeping in mind considerations like price, size, and mattress type. Below, find the best sleeper sofas on which you’ll actuallywantto spend the night. Urban Natural Urban Natural Mattress Sizes: Cot, twin, full, queen, queen plus, or kingConversion Mechanism: TraditionalMattress Type: HiPerform, cooling gel, or Tempur-Pedic The beauty of American Leather’s Gaines Comfort Sleeper is that you can customize it to seemingly endless specifications. It’s available in nearly every standard mattress size, plus the addition of a smaller cot option. The brand’s patented Tiffany 24/7 sleep system mechanism features zero bars or springs, so you don’t need to worry about tossing and turning in discomfort. Rather, the three-sectioned mattress seamlessly folds into itself. One-third folds up into the backrest of the couch while the other two thirds fold into the seat of the couch. And while the sofa comes with a high-density, five-inch foam mattress, you can choose to upgrade to cooling gel or Tempur-Pedic options. It’s largely because of the mattress quality that Pennington recommends American Leather sleeper sofas to her clients—but she also appreciates the elevated aesthetic and craftsmanship that appears more like a custom piece of furniture than a sleeper sofa. “It's going to hold its shape longer, it's going to have better stitching—it's just going to look a lot better for a lot longer,” she says. “Plus, it's super customizable.” On that front, you can pick between 25 leather upholstery options and 55 fabric shades, plus four types of wooden legs. You can also choose your own journey with cushions, opting for plain, tufted, in multiples, or bench-style. Sixpenny Sixpenny Mattress Sizes:Full or queenConversion Mechanism:Tri-fold gliding frameMattress Type:Foam A top reason to get a sleeper sofa in the first place is if you’re low on expendable space. “A lot of people work from home and have had to convert a bedroom or guest room to an office,” Pennington says. “If they're only having guests once a month, or twice a year, or every quarter, they don't need that space to be a guest room all the time.” The Sixpenny Aria is available in both full and queen sizes, and it’s armless, saving a few precious inches on each side and minimizing bulk—helpful for smaller spaces. That said, be sure to take note of your doorway dimensions compared to the Aria’s measurements; no-fit deliveries are subject to a 10 percent restocking fee, according to the brand. When one of our editors tried this model, she was impressed by its fluffy yet supportive feeling that kept her firmly atop the mattress, rather than sinking in. (If you’re looking for a plusher-feeling mattress than what the three and a half inches of foam can offer, though, you can alwaysadd a topper.) She was also impressed by how easy it was to transition the couch into a bed, calling the process a piece of cake. All you have to do is throw off the seat cushions and backrests, then lift the bottom two-thirds up and out of the sofa. The final third folds down from the backrest to meet it. From there you can add the backrests back to the bed to create an especially inviting aesthetic for guests you want to impress. OMHU Teak New York Mattress Sizes:King-equivalentConversion Mechanism:Pull-outMattress Type:Foam The OMHU Teddy is extremely simple in design, made of up two stacked mattresses, two L-shaped cushions, and three metal bars that hold together the whole shebang. To convert the Teddy from a couch to a (roughly king-size, but not exact) bed, simply remove the chrome-plated bars and pull the top mattress to the floor, push it up against the remaining mattress, and reinforce the rectangle with the bars. With this sleeper sofa, the hardest work you’ll have to do is select which of the 21 colors you want. When we put the Teddy to the test, we found the transition process—both from bed to couch and couch to bed—took all of two minutes for one person to complete on their own. Just know that in couch form, it might be best to situate the piece of furniture against a wall. We noticed if you lean back too far without a wall to support you, the L-shaped cushions might fall right off. While the stiffness of the mattresses made them easy to maneuver, that level of firmness might be abitmuch for certain sleeping positions, like side or stomach sleepers. But the ease of transitioning the setup, plus the fact that you can zip off and machine-wash the cushions and mattress covers makes this bed a win for people who live with kids and pets, in particular. Article Article Mattress Sizes:QueenConversion Mechanism:TraditionalMattress Type:Memory foam When in couch form, you’d never know the Article Vati actually houses a memory-foam mattress within its frame. The inconspicuously versatile piece from the Scandinavian brand is a puffy two-seater that would look inviting in nearly any room. It’s available in eight fabric colors and three performance velvet shades, and it’s also notably affordable compared to other options on the list. The Vati features a more traditional sleeper sofa design. The mattress is stowed, folded in half, below the cushions. But because it’s a memory foam mattress, it won’t degrade as quickly as one with innersprings. The memory foam mattress is also four inches thick, so it really does the trick when you need a comfy place for someone to lay their head. The mattress is about as wide as your average queen-sized mattress, so it can certainly fit two people comfortably. But at 70 inches long, it’s a bit short for some folks who are over six feet tall. Crate & Barrel Crate & Barrel Mattress Sizes:Twin, full, queenConversion Mechanism:TraditionalMattress Type:Innerspring Before you commit to a sofa that converts to a queen- or king-size bed, ask yourself a key question: Are most of your friends visiting you solo? Because if you’re generally just hosting one unattached person, you can get them a nice sleeping surface and get yourself a superb small-space-friendly reading seat in one fell swoop. This is the promise of the Axis Twin Sleeper Sofa from Crate and Barrel. While the “sofa” part of the name is king of a misnomer, its 25-inch depth seat makes it a great for curling up and getting cozy. If you’re sold on the Axis but do want that bigger mattress, know that it’s also available in full and queen sizes, too. The mattress is, sadly, a traditional innerspring that may remind you of old-school sofa beds. That said, the mattress is an impressive five and a half inches thick, which means it can sag a decent bit before you’ll really start to feel the springs underneath your back. And for a small fee, you can upgrade to Crate & Barrel's air mattress, which includes the same innerspring but with an extra inflatable layer of cushioning aimed to boost comfort. Koala Koala Mattress Sizes: QueenConversion Mechanism: Pull-outMattress Type: Foam If you haven't seen the Teddy Sofa on Instagram, chances are you have seen Koala.GQ's senior visuals editor Daria Di Lello tested it out, saying that its addition finally did her two-bedroom justice. Di Lello says that it's as comfy as her regular old bed mattress, and while sitting on it and sleeping on it it's on the firmer side, which is her preferred mattress feel. To flip the sofa to a bed, it's quite simple, opening up like a billfold wallet. Underneath the sofa there's a tray on wheels which you pull out to rest the extended half of the seat cushion on. The result is roughly a queen-sized mattress, low to the ground, which you can make like a regular bed with regular sheets. The seatback of the sofa has hidden compartments that guests can use like a night stand to store things like a phone, a book, a glass of water, etc. Delivery was seamless for Di Lello who was given a three-hour window, and two dispatchers arrived on time. She opted for white-glove assistance so they set it up for her within about 30 minutes and removed the empty boxes when they left. Joybird Joybird Mattress Sizes: Queen (slightly shorter than a traditional queen, at 72 inches long)Conversion Mechanism: TraditionalMattress Type: High-density foam and memory foam Sometimes, there simply aren’t enough places to sleep, which is where the sleeper sofa sectional comes into play. Joybird’s Briar functions like a three-car garage: There’s a spacious queen mattress, plus the narrower extra spot on the chaise where a smaller person could cuddle up. It’s also functional for accommodating a crowd in couch form, with enough space for four people (or more, if you squeeze). The four-and-a-half-inch mattress consists of three inches of high-density foam, plus an inch and a half of plush memory foam. For a fee, you can upgrade from that standard foam to a Tempur-Response memory foam. No matter what mattress model you choose, though, for tall folks, the Briar might require some curling up, as it’s a bit shorter than a standard queen. The Briar is available in a whopping 79 fabric colors and textures, and you can also customize the orientation of the chaise. And considering one reviewer says their model has held up for six years and counting, you can consider this a staple piece in any room in which it lives. West Elm West Elm Though the idea of the daybed might conjure images of being awkwardly fed grapes, the modern daybed actually makes for a pretty nice sleep surface. The West Elm Shelter Daybed, for example, is constructed of solid wood (oak, to be exact). The sleep surface itself is made of fiber-wrapped foam, which is quite soft and comfortable. And, as with any West Elm sofa, the Shelter comes in a staggering number of fabric options so it’s customizable to your space. You will, however, have to convince someone to feed you grapes on it yourself. It would probably help if you returned the favor. With the mattress stowed away, you can fully appreciate the couch’s elegance. There’s nothing particularly eye-catching about any individual aspect of the couch’s design, but the proportions are balanced in such a way that you’ll feel almost compelled to just sit in it. Once you do, you’ll be able to sink into the 22.5 inches of seat depth, which offers plenty of room for you to cross your legs. The seat back is 15.5 inches tall, enough to support people of most heights. Edloe Finch Edloe Finch Edlow Finch Ashbury Sleeper Sofa is firmly a mid-century modern couch. And like a lot of vintage mid-century pieces you might find, this one packs some unique tricks. For example: There are hidden legs in zippered off compartments on the back of the couch cushion that allow you to transform the couch into a bed that’s about as long as a full-size mattress, but a little bit more narrow. Rove Concepts Rove Concepts The Milo Sleeper Sofa is a master class in functional furniture you’re actually excited for guests to sleep on. The secret sauce? The Milo’s construction doesn’t use a metal frame, which, in cheaper sleeper sofas, may dig into your back for a hella uncomfortable night—especially when paired with an extremely thin mattress. Milo only requires you to gently unzip a cleverly hidden zipper at the back of the sofa cushions and delicately tug to reveal your new bed—no brute force needed. Size: In addition to measuring the spot where you want the sofa bed to live to ensure it’ll fit both in sofa and bed form, also pay attention to mattress dimensions. “I don’t think a sleeper queen is always the size of a queen, queen,” says Pennington. She’s right—a number of options are slightly shorter or narrower (or both) than standard mattress sizes. Conversionmechanism: While most of the sleeper sofas on our list use a traditional pull-out frame that lifts from the bottom of the couch after seat cushions are removed, other options exist, as well. Some daybeds, for instance, use a trundle system that pulls out from under the seat, and the frameless Teddy from OMHU drags directly onto the floor. Mattress: Foam mattresses in sleeper sofas are increasingly common, allowing for lighter-weight pieces of furniture that are easier to maneuver. Some models may still have traditional innerspring components, which may degrade faster. Also pay attention to mattress height, as that loft may translate to plushness and comfort. Cushions: While a lot of the emphasis while shopping for a sleeper sofa might land on the mattress portion, keep in mind that you’re probably going to use the item as a couch quite a bit—if not for the majority of the time. That’s why Pennington suggests making sure you think it’s comfortable in sofa-form, too. “Prioritize the comfort and durability of the cushions, because it's also being used as a sofa,” she says. Traditional: These usually involve a metal frame tri-folded within the couch, and a thinner-than-average mattress on top of it. The high-quality options offer great support, comfort, and durability so you can keep them in service in that guest room or office for years to come. Just know that the internal metal support system often makes these heavier than a typical couch—crucial info if you’re someone who moves a lot. Also, since a full-on mattress emerges from its depths, these require a large enough space to store both your couch and a bed. Futon-style: These fold in such a way that you can lie down straight on the surface of the couch itself, rather than pull out additional materials, so they're often a good choice for smaller spaces. Another big perk is that they're less bulky than pull-out beds, but they also have a reputation for landing on the firmer, stiffer side. Daybed: A convertible sofa daybed that transforms into a twin or queen bed with or without a pullout trundle can be easier to convert to a bed than a traditional pullout couch, though it'll be just as heavy to transport. What should I know about sleeper sofas? Traditional sofa beds have a bad reputation for being expensive, heavy, and often pretty ugly. At their worst, they resemble an ugly Transformer: a hunk of metal emerging from your couch, with a flimsy-looking mattress on top, and a sinkhole in the middle that lands you right on top of the dreaded support bar in the middle. But sleeper sofas have evolved in a lot of ways in recent years. More futon-like options have emerged comprised of comfy layers of foam (denser at the bottom, cushier on the top), just like today'smattressesare made. While we didn’t review any recliners or sleeper sectionals for this piece, those options are great, too. Where do I get the best sleeper sofas? We recommend shopping from a retailer on this list. While we’re certain you can find good options at most retailers, be advised that in our testing, we did find that some less-expensive options weren’t the quality sleepers that slightly pricier brands tend to offer. We tested as many of these sofas ourselves as we could, sleeping on them, sitting on them, and repeatedly transitioning them from couch to bed and back again as if we were counting workout reps. When we couldn't get our sleepy heads on certain models, we researched options based on variability and high-quality materials—and punted anything that had wishy-washy reviews.",

    "title": "The Ultimate Abercrombie and Fitch Shopping Guide of 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Serious question: at what point is a comeback complete? Particularly when it comes to Abercrombie & Fitch, it does feel like some clarity around the issue would be helpful, because the brand has, quite simply, just been very good for quite a while now. There’s something of a formula to how they’re getting it so right: classic staples are imbued with a bit of volume and a dash of archive inspiration, and everything clocks in at prices that won’t make you blanche. After a few years in the wilderness, Abercrombie’s clothes now feel nostalgically like how mall brand clothes used to feel—substantial and well-made, yet easy to wear from day one. As a result, these days they’re kind of appealing to, well, everyone. Their baggier pants are a favorite among those both veterans of and newcomers to the Wide Arts, while their knitwear catalog contains plenty of all-time classics, and their basics are just as considered as those four times their price. This all adds up to mean that you can easily turn to Abercrombie to build the foundation of your whole wardrobe, or just use certain pieces as spackle to cover up some of your existing closet gaps. Still, because the offerings are plentiful and it’s nice to have some guidance, we thought we’d make things a little easier and round up both our favorite categories, and our favorite pieces within them. (I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time amidst the brands digital and IRL racks in my life, so I do feel quite comfortable speaking on the matter.) Now, happy shopping, and may all your sizes be in stock. We probably could have included polos in the knitwear section, but Abercrombie’s current output is so notable it deserves a standalone category. In summer, their lightweight, more porous variety go absolutely nuclear, but the winter line-up is just as strong. The long-sleeve Johnny collars, for instance, will look great dressed up a bit with some slacks or toned down with some cords or jeans, as will the cable-knit short-sleeve versions. There are also button-through polos for anyone looking to thread the needle between a button up and a classic cardigan, and those crazy kids even put out a Plisse nod that’s plenty good and doesn’t need to be put in a special net to launder. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch When it comes to basics, the more considered the cut and materials, the more expensive they usually are.Usually. Not at Abercrombie, though, where well-priced tees, sweats and the like are preposterously soft, and available in a range of silhouettes and fabric weights. . Particular highlights include the cropped tees, the Essential Hoodie (offered in washes that look straight off a thrift store rack) and the waffle tee, but the entire suite is worth your serious attention. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch If you’ve tried on a pair of Abercrombie pants in the past year or so, there’s a good chance you did so with some sort of agenda. Maybe you wanted to give a wider pair of pants (or RealTree camo print) a shot, or maybe you just had gotten tired of your denim rotation and “heard good things.” Whatever your end goal was, however, there’s a good chance Abercrombie delivered, thanks to fabrics structured enough to hold their shape over time, but still soft enough to move around in comfortably. These days, the brand’s bread-and-butter is baggy, but they’re still pumping out excellent straight and tapered pieces if that’s more your bag. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Outerwear—especially outerwear for city or suburban life—really doesn’tneedto be as technical as the Gore-Tex’d mainstays we’ve all been buying up these past few years. On that note, if you’re not planning to summit K2 soon, Abercrombie has some real heaters. The Cropped Workwear Jacket, for instance, looks like the hand-me-down trucker we all wish our Dads had given us. . The Hooded Bomber Jacket looks quite a bit like one from a certain venerated Detroit-based workwear brand, just without that noisy, impossible-to-remove outer label. What’s more, their vegan leather trucker ages surprisingly well, and there’s even a double-breasted overcoat fit for a stroll with King Charles. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Aside from the Wide World of Pants, the button-up space is one of the more ascendant in all of menswear. For years, unless you were searching for a slim shirt, there wasn’t really anything interesting out there for you at a price point south of $Welp. This meant your only bet was going vintage. But in recent seasons, mall brands have blown out their slate, and it’s no longer difficult to find a host of cuts at exceedingly reasonable prices. Abercrombie is one such purveyor: Today, their flat-hemmed flannels will remind you of some of the best on offer from venerable Scandinavian brands, their Oxfords are stupid soft and rightly roomy, and their cropped Work Shirt is simply a sleeper for anyone looking for a new daily beater button-up. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch We’ll level with you: suiting probably won’t ever be the leading category at Abercrombie, and it’s also not necessarily the first place we’d look on our own hunt, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have some great options at even better prices. Particular standouts include the just-loose-enough A&F Collins Tailored Double-Breasted Blazer, as well as its single-breasted counterpart. And of course, if you’re just looking to add another pair of dressier slacks to the rotation, there aren’t many better $100 options on the market. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch For years, the only way to get your hands on a wonderfully worn-in, perfectly faded graphic t-shirt was to hit the vintage racks. The dealers knew this, which meant sometimes the best ones could run you hundreds of dollars. Well, Abercrombie has democratized that process in an astounding way. Not only have they licensed some of the coolest graphics from the most popular properties of decades past—particularly ones from the 1980s and 1990s, when hand-drawn design was still popping—they’ve also applied those graphics to their broken-in, vintage-mimicking blanks. Wizard. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch Knitwear isn’t an easy category to nail. Oftentimes, it’s best to stick to a few styles, engineer the living daylights out of them, and offer a tight, thematically similar selection. But this isn’t one of those times. Abercrombie has never agreed with this sentiment, and that’s really a good thing for all of us. Right now, they’re running a whole slate of killer classics—beefy rib-stitch crews, chunky cable-knits, fuzzy cardigans, roomy v-necks—but they’ve also got a whole range of freakier knitwear that reads far fancier than it’s two-digit price tag.

    "title": "13 Best Face Sunscreens Our Editors Tested and Loved in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Last year, we wrote that, without embellishment, the best skin care advice we can give you is to wear the best face sunscreen (a.k.a.broad spectrum SPF) every single day. And, we pretty much nailed it. SPFs guard against UVA and UVB rays that cause sunburns and skin cancer as well aswrinkles, loss of elasticity,hyperpigmentation, redness, and all-aroundpissed off skin. Skin without ‘em is bummed out and burned out by the end of summer, which is no good for anyone. But look, we also know that a lot of SPFs kinda suck. They can be goopy and pasty; they can smell weird and cause breakouts; they can leave a white cast on skin and some streakiness if not applied properly. And if a formula checks one of those boxes, it’s enough to make you not want to wear it. So, to ensure that you don’t have to deal with any of that and instead just reap the benefits, we put a bunch of formulas through the ringer. Here, the best face sunscreens for everyone—no matter whether you want a physical blocker, a chemical blocker, an SPF moisturizer, or a tinted sunscreen. Ultra Violette Sephora Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 3% Homosalate 7% Octisalate 5% Octocrylene 8%) |Key active ingredients:squalane and pentavitin for hydration and barrier protection |Water resistant?80 minutes |Size(s):1.7 fl. oz. ​​Why we like it:The Aussie sunscreen brand that had a million skin care devotees polling their friends on when they were traveling to the Sunshine Coast is as dreamy as the reputation that precedes it. On skin, it feels cushiony and plush like a moisturizer that gives just enough hydration to skin without weighing it down. Sometimes SPF can be goopy and hard to layer with other products, but this one feels light and layerable. Who it’s best for:So long as you’re looking for a chemical filter, this SPF can work for all skin types. It does have skin-supporting and skin-hydrating ingredients, so if you’re someone who wants to cut out a few skin care steps, look no further. About the formula:Because the United Stateshas outdated sunscreen filters(TL;DR: the FDA regulates SPF actives and hasn’t yet approved the filters that are used in many other countries over yonder), the formula doesn’t mimic the Australian formula completely. In the U.S. rendition of the legendary Ultra Violette Supreme Screen, a cocktail of avobenzone, octinoxate, octocrylene, and homosalate replaces bemotrizinol, bisoctrizole, and a few other actives, but you still get the other skin-soothing ingredients like squalane and pentavitin. Coola Amazon Sephora Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 1.75% Homosalate 5.0% Octisalate 2.0% Octocrylene 5.0%)| Key active ingredients:Antioxidant plant complex of red raspberry seed oil, meadowfoam oil, prickly pear extract to defend against toxins and UV damage| Water resistant?80 minutes| Size(s):1.7 fl. oz. Our tester’s take:If you find a sunscreen to add to yourskin care routinethat is something you look forward to wearing, then you know it’s a good one. That means you’ll actually want to apply it alongside your dailymoisturizerbefore going outside, which will help to preventskin aging. Because of its elegant application and breathability—especially when I’m working up a sweat—grooming writer Adam Hurly wholeheartedly recommends it. Who it’s best for:Coola’s SPF option works well for acne-prone skin, oily skin, and sensitive skin individuals, and it has 80 minutes of water and sweat resistance. I wear it comfortably before jogging under the sun, or whenever I think I’ll be sweating between errands or simply sprawling out in the park. About the formula:The formula has a little bit of a melting texture that needs no encouragement to sink right into skin. Once applied, it wears slightly shiny for the first 30 minutes or so, but it settles down nicely after that. Coola’s SPFs are enhanced with plant actives and antioxidants—red raspberry seed oil, buriti oil, meadowfoam seed oil, and prickly pear extract—that help to guard against free radical damage on skin, so if you’re looking for a single product in addition to a moisturizer or daily serum, this could be an easy win. Augustinus Bader Dermstore Formula:Mineral (Titanium Dioxide 9.102%%; Zinc Oxide 13.175%) |Key active ingredients:TCF8, a proprietary ingredient aimed at cell renewal; microalgae and cotton seed extract protect against photodamage, and buriti oil and raspberry seed oil provide antioxidant protection for free radical defense |Water resistant?80 minutes |Size(s):1.6 fl. Oz. Our tester’s take:It’s hard to find an SPF that we’d recommend shelling out $140 for, but Augustinus Bader has us standing here preaching from the rooftops. The formula goes onto skin and, without too much maneuvering, blends seamlessly. It has a bit of a velvety texture that doesn’t leave too much shine on skin once its in place. Thanks to a whole who’s who of skin care ingredients, it’s also easy to pare back the number of products I’m using when this SPF is on my countertop (including the brand’s proprietary TCF8—more on that in a sec). Who it’s best for:People looking for a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t feel chalky on skin or leave behind too much streakiness. It helps if they have a little change rolling around in their pockets, because this stuff definitely doesn’t come cheap. About the formula:Zinc oxide heavy formulas can leave a white cast on skin, but this formula does a solid job at blending down nicely. Beyond the active SPF filters, this formula contains an ingredient that Professor Bader originally created as part of a burn cream. When he saw how effective it was at repairing compromised skin, he brought it to a wider audience in his moisturizers, creating the brand we know and love today. In its use at the heart of this SPF, the formula helps to support skin evenness, hydration, and reduce fine lines. EltaMD Amazon Dermstore Formula:Hybrid chemical-mineral (Zinc Oxide 9%, Octinoxate 7.5%)| Key active ingredients:Cyclomethicone for lightweight hydration; niacinamide for barrier fortification| Water resistant?Not formally tested for it.| Size(s):1.7 fl. oz. Our tester’s take:EltaMD is a fave of dermatologists because of its robust protection. This option combines mineral and chemical filters, allowing it to blend imperceptibly on darker skin tones without leaving a white cast. NYC-based board-certified dermatologistAsmi Sanghvi, MD gives this SPF two thumbs up: “This is my favorite facial sunscreen,” she says. Who it’s best for:According to Dr. Sanghvi? Everyone. But our rosacea-prone tester particularly liked it (as well as the brand’s newGreen Tint Broad Spectrum SPF 50) for redness. “It is lightweight, non-comedogenic, and is suitable for all skin types, including acne-prone and sensitive skin, and provides excellent protection without leaving a white cast or greasy residue.” The formula:We like this formula a lot because it gives you the best of both worlds around the clock. For starters, it comes in both tinted and non-tinted versions. The tinted version is a solid mineral option for darker skin tones to help prevent a white cast on skin. It also has multiple sun filters so that you can get the benefits of a mineral SPF in a more cosmetically elegant formula. Supergoop Sephora Nordstrom Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 7.5%)| Key active ingredients:Rosemary leaf and sunflower extracts for antioxidant defense| Water resistant?80 minutes| Size(s):2.4, 5.5, and 18 fl. oz. Why it’s great:Hurly says he never travels without his giant refill of Supergoop’s Play sunscreen in tow because this SPF covers all his needs—whether hitting the beach or exploring a new city. Supergoop’s entire range of sunscreen products is one of the best options in the United States, and could compete with the many of the options overseas where there are more updated sun filters like Tinosorb and Uvinul. This product, in particular, is the brand’s most universal, given its full-body wear, lightweight application, and 80-minute water resistance. Who it’s best for:Anyone looking for a head-to-toe SPF product that is layerable, easy to wear, and relatively inexpensive. The formula:When you think: “classic sunscreen” this formula comes to mind. It goes onto skin, sinking in seamlessly and blending imperceptibly, thanks to its chemical formula. Because of a host of skin-supporting ingredients—sunflower, rosemary, and rice bran extracts—it fends off environmental aggressors and feels more like a moisturizer than most. Plus, its 80-minute water resistance makes it a great choice for folks who are active or hitting the beach. Cardon Cardon Amazon (2-pack) Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate)| Key active ingredients:Cactus extract soothes and hydrates skin; turmeric provides anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial abilities, while chia seed extract provides oger-3-powered defense.| Water resistant?Not formally tested for it.| Size(s):1.2 fl. Oz. Our tester’s take:Cardon’s core products are the perfect baseline regimen for most men (see: Hurley’s praise for them in these posts aboutgel moisturizerandclay face wash). This SPF moisturizer combines two imperative morning skin care steps into one with a pocket-size product that travels easily and lasts much longer than you’d expect. Its anti-inflammatory, hydrating, and antioxidant ingredients make it a superb moisturizer, but the inclusion of chemical UV defenses rounds it out for minimalists who want to wear a product that does it all. Who it’s best for:People who want a moisturizer that doubles up on sun protection. It’s a one-and-done product that gives you the protection you need. About the formula:You might think that because it’s a moisturizer the formula is slightly thicker than other SPFs, but that’s not the case with Cardon. It manages to feel light and silky on skin while still packing in ingredients that help keep your skin hydrated like cactus extract, as well as vitamins A, C, and E for additional antioxidant defense. Sunbetter eCosmetics Formula:Mineral (Titanium Dioxide 3.5%, Zinc Oxide 10.0%) |Key active ingredients:Green tea and olive extracts help to fend off damage from pollution, blue light, and more. | Waterresistant?80 minutes |Size(s):1.7 fl. Oz. Our tester’s take:Some formulas are developed for daily use and others are meant for the times when your skin is the most sensitized, like after a visit to the derm’s office or if you’re using a retinol or acid. With a soaring SPF 75 from mineral protection, the cream gives you extra assurance that you aren’t accidentally incurring damage on your skin after spending money to help address an issue. On skin, it gives a slight bit of tint and wears comfortably (though it’s not quite as layerable as other formulas). Who it’s best for:People with a concern about getting sun damage, which is folks who’ve gotten laser treatments, microneedling, or are using a sun-sensitizing product like hydroquinone, retinol, or an acid. About the formula:Because mineral filters lay atop the skin to give you protection, it’s actually really hard to get a formula that is 50+ because they wind up having that lifeguard white-nose strip effect. This formula manages to be both cosmetically elegant and effective. It also has antioxidants like green tea and olive extracts that help to prevent from environmental aggressors. Neutrogena Amazon Walmart Formula:Chemical (Avobenzone 3%, Homosalate 10%, Octisalate 5%, Octocrylene 10%)| Key active ingredients:Silica for smooth application and dimethicone for mattified wear.| Water resistant?80 minutes| Size(s):3 fl. oz. Our tester’s take:Hurly says that, “Neutrogena is my ‘old reliable’ whenever I need a guaranteed great defense at a low cost.” While we recommend the SPF 50 (if you’re putting the stuff on, you might as well get better protection), you can also pick up the same formula in an SPF 30. It’s honestly a super versatile product that will work well for most people. Who it’s best for:This product is perfect for all skin types thanks to its oil-free formula (oily and acne-prone folks will especially appreciate that), and it even keeps skin looking more matte than before. The formula:The water-based formula feels light and airy on skin. It’s water resistant up to 80 minutes, so if you need a daily sunscreen for your outdoor activities, here is one that won’t break the bank—and won’t break out your skin, either. Good Weather Skin Good Weather Skin Formula:Mineral (Zinc Oxide 15%) |Key active ingredients:Squalane and sea buckthorn oil |Water resistant?40 minutes |Size(s):1 fl. oz Our tester’s take:It’s hard to make a sunscreen feel splashy these days, but Good Weather Skin has managed to do so with its buttery yellow formula that glides onto skin and leaves it feeling dewy and with an ever-so-subtle sheen. With an SPF 30, it's a really solid option for people who want a daily sunscreen that feels like skin care and doesn’t have that chalky texture that many SPFs usually do. Who it’s best for:People looking for a medium-weight daily SPF that they can wear outside. It has a slightly dewy finish, which should work for most people, but if you want something slightly more matte, go with a traditional mineral sunscreen. About the formula:Packed with sea buckthorn oil, squalane, peptides and niacinamide, the label on this SPF reads a lot like a who’s who of top skin care ingredients. It somehow does deeply hydrate skin while protecting it with zinc oxide. Particularly in the summer, you could simply wear this formula as a standalone moisturizer-SPF duo. Vacation Vacation Vacation is hardly the new kid on the block anymore, but its products have a cult following for their featherlight wear and great smell. Cetaphil Amazon Senior commerce editor Ian Burke uses this SPF moisturizer every morning in the summer—though he should really be using it year round—and swears by its lightweight feel. ISNTREE Amazon GQ's marketing and production manager Mari Herrema says this sun gel from Isntree absorbs quickly, feels light on the skin, adds a bit of a glowy effect, and has no white cast. Bioré Amazon GQcontributor Tyler Sparling—who “has theeeee most oily skin” (his words)—says this is the only sunscreen that's light enough for everyday use. “It does not feel heavy,” he says. “It’s the only way I can wear SPF every day.” Mineral SPF Versus Chemical SPF:This is one of the first things to consider when shopping for sunscreen. Do you want it to use chemical UV filters, or mineral ones? The difference could impact how it feels on skin, and how it applies. Face Sunscreen vs. Body Sunscreen:The difference between face sunscreen and body sunscreen is roughly analogous to the difference betweenface washandbody wash. The sensitive skin of your face requires a gentler formula than that of the body, and should be formulated to be mindful of things like acne, anti-aging efforts, oil accumulation and sensitive areas around the eyes. Face Sunscreen vs SPF Moisturizer:So, what is the difference between a face sunscreen and anSPF-packed moisturizer? If you’re going to be working up a sweat or going for a swim, then you need a sunscreen with water resistance. This will be promised in two separate intervals: 40 minutes or 80 minutes. If a product doesn’t say it’s “water resistant” as a benefit, that doesn’t necessarily mean itlacksthe resistance. Instead, it usually means the brand didn’t endure the expensive FDA testing to clear the product for that claim. In these tests, the product needs to prove its water-resistant wear for at least 40 or 80 minutes, and then those benefits can be slapped on the container. Even if a product retains its potency well beyond 80 minutes, it’s currently only able to promise 80 minutes of water-resistant protection. However, if you do plan to work out under the sun or go for a swim, make sure your product promises the benefit. Shopping for “sport sunscreens” is usually one of your best bets, but brands will definitely boast their water resistance if they earned the right to do so. For this roundup of facial sunscreens, you’ll see this time distinction noted or that it was “not formally tested.” When you’reGQ’s grooming writer, you get a lot of products sent to your doorstep. And of all the categories of products that pile up, facial sunscreen ranks highly with me. I never leave the house without a facial sunscreen on (okay, maybe at 9 p.m. I’m SPF-free, but never during the daytime). Needless to say, I’ve been testing these products every day of the past 11 years, and I’ve become a loud and proud advocate of daily SPF wear. The products on this list are those I would spend my own money on and which have the most universal appeal—not to mention that they wear comfortably and deliver on their defensive promises. Adam Hurly has been covering the grooming industry since 2013. For most of that time, he's beenGQ’s primary grooming contributor, too.

    "title": "How Long Does It Take to Build Muscle? Here’s the Truth",
    "article_text": "How long does it take to build muscleis not, of course, a question with a simple answer, despite what the TikToks or Reels promising to unlock the one thing you need to get big might suggest. In fact, they tend to raise many more questions: Like, should you be fasting? Or should you be cutting out cardio, relying solely on supersets, smashing calisthenics, attending military bootcamps, doing everything on the bosu ball, using only kettlebells, taking protein immediately after your workout, nailing creatine, eating lots and lots of beef, training at a specific heart rate, squatting with your partner on your shoulders, performing every workout without your top on, or adding a resistance band to absolutely everything? The list of suggestions goes on. There’s a gym obsession for everyone, but none of it will get you in shape the way that focusing on the (somewhat less sexy) essentials will. So let's go back to basics. This is the only information you really need to tackle the perennial question: how long does it take to build muscle? The process of building muscle is known ashypertrophy. We enter hypertrophy when we apply tension to our muscles during exercise. “This tension stimulates a cascade of biological signals in the body which leads to an increase in muscle protein synthesis, a process during which new proteins are produced and integrated into the muscle fibers, leading to larger and stronger muscles,” explainsHarry Cox, founder of London’s high-endClub Q Health. Resistance trainingis a great way to build muscle in the gym. Essentially, this means moving your body with weights to make those movements harder. A bicep curl with a dumbbell is harder than it would be with no weight, for instance. This is resistance training. The heavier the weight—or greater the resistance—the more our muscles are forced to adapt, making them grow stronger over time. Do it right and you can build muscle by weight training as little as two to three times a week, according to fitness expertPenny Weston. “You should always make sure to increase your weights to push yourself and ensure you are creating as much resistance, and therefore muscle trauma, as possible,” she says, referring to a method calledprogressive overload. To progressively overload your muscles, you’ll want to go heavier on at least two out of your four sets per exercise. Cox says that it’s important to do enough sets to stimulate the muscles without becoming overly fatigued. “For most people, this will fall roughly between 10-15 sets per muscle, per week,” he says. Which doesn’t mean you need to do 10 sets on the leg press in one day. Not if you want to be able to walk or sit down, that is. “I recommend each muscle group is trained two to three times per week,” he says. “Rather than doing 10 sets of chest in one workout, you could do five sets on Monday and another five on Thursday.” Then there’s the concept oftraining to failure, which is exactly what it sounds like: putting maximum strain on the muscle until you can no longer perform another rep. The thinking is that this fast-tracks muscle growth. Cox says “aiming to push yourself anywhere from 1-3 reps shy of failure seems to be beneficial,” findings which are backed up bymultiple studies. Everything from yogurt to cereal is touted as high protein at the moment, but does adding protein to your diet make a difference? We’ve learned the principles of building muscle, and the most efficient way to do it, above. But what about the actual building blocks of muscle itself? “In order to build muscle, the body must be in what is called ananabolic state,” says Cox. To get into this state, you need to be taking on more calories than you’re burning off. Think of it like a construction site. The more bricks you make available, the faster the building can grow. The same is true of muscle growth. “An adequate protein consumption stimulates muscle protein synthesis, which helps to build up your muscle fibers,” says Cox. “A protein intake of 1.6-2.2 gram per kilogram of bodyweight is considered to be optimal for maximizing muscle growth.”  In other words, if you weigh about 175 pounds, you should aim for a daily protein intake of 128g-176g. While it’s true that protein can make you feel full and is therefore a way to lower calorie intake if you’re trying to lose weight, it isn’t caloriefree, so you will still see you weight gain if you overdo it. Plus, your bowels won’t be in the best shape. “Carbohydrates are also really important when trying to build muscle as they are the body’s main source of energy for workouts,” Weston notes. Don’t sleep on healthy fats, either. “They are a great source of energy for exercising, so you can push yourself harder in your workouts and therefore build muscle,” says Weston. “Plus, fats are also so important for hormone and cell health, including muscle cells.” Sorry, but no. “I am a firm believer that silver bullets don’t exist, particularly when it comes to fitness,” says Cox. “The solution you’re actually searching for is right in front of you: consistency over time.” Weston seconds that: “Building muscle shouldn’t feel too complicated. Just stick to a routine, with proper form and allowing a few rest days per week, rather than trying to follow a fad workout program.” If you’re exercising a couple of times per week and have adjusted your diet accordingly, Weston reckons you’ll see results in about six to eight weeks. “It’s quite a slow process,” she says. Nor, Cox adds, can it be accelerated—without taking steroids, that is. “Many people will try and shortcut the process by doing more workouts or doing longer workouts and while that seems like it should work, it will often just cause more fatigue without any additional stimulation,” he says. Which brings us to a vital part of muscle building:notgoing to the gym. Our muscles are torn in the gym, but actually built back up at home, while we sleep. Skip this part and you’ll be left with lingering injuries instead of a growing body that’s ready to go again. “You need to give your body time to heal and repair the muscle damage,” says Weston. “Sleep plays a big part in building muscle because this is when our bodies release helpful hormones, like testosterone.” We’re all different, with strengths, weaknesses and imbalances in biomechanics that can make following the same plan a bit tricky, at least without the input of a personal trainer. With that in mind, use the below guide from Cox not as a bible, but as a rough plan from which to build your own muscle-building routine. The more you tailor it, the better it should work for you. And remember: “Taking time to build muscle through diet and exercise is best, so take it slow and steady,” says Weston. “If you’re not seeing results straight away, just know that is completely normal, and just be consistent!” Monday:Push (Chest – 6 sets/Shoulders – 5 sets/Triceps – 5 sets)Tuesday:Pull (Back – 8 sets/Biceps – 6 sets)Wednesday:Legs (Quads – 6 sets/Hamstrings – 6 sets/Calves – 5 sets)Thursday:RestFriday:Upper Body (Chest – 6 sets/Back – 4 sets/Triceps – 5 sets/Biceps – 4 sets)Saturday:Lower Body (Quads – 6 sets/Hamstrings – 6 sets/Calves – 5 sets)Sunday:Rest This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Is It Even Worth It to Become a Doctor or Lawyer Anymore?",
    "article_text": "When it was reported last month thatlaw school applications are up 20%, some of us who graduated around the 2008 recession thought of that one friend, the liberal artist-activist who, after six months of financial uncertainty, became conveniently passionate about the law. He got busy. He got a haircut. He got a Big Law job he never spoke about except when brandishing his pro bono bona fides. Law student applications are a bearish indicator—thebearish indicator if you’re young and insufferably promising. Morgan Stanley is revising up the chance of a recession. Gen Z’ers are revising up the chances Aiden takes the LSAT. He should check in with my one friend before he does. Big Law attorneys’ wages, which stagnated decades ago, show no sign of recovery with AI encroaching on billable hours. And the prestige associated with both Big Law School and Big Law is under direct threat from the White House. The Trump administration issued anumber of executive orders targeting lawyers, including those that have investigated him: taking away the security clearance they need to do business, inquiring about their DEI practices, promising sanctions against those that sue the government. Already, the law firms Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have cut deals with the White House, promising to spend firm hours that would have once been devoted to pro bono work grooming the administration’s pet causes. (Other firms, including Perkins Coie, are suing the administration over the orders.) For the lawyers at those firms—currently getting roasted by debt-burdened but resolutely upright public defenders on professional listservs—capitulation isn’t just an inconvenience or ideological affront. It’s a violation of the deal they struck with themselves when they went back to school. The deal that allowed them to fig leaf their personal ambition with the prestige of participating in the broader social project of supporting the Constitution of the United States (and the constitution of the state in which they passed the bar). Eight months ago, I launchedUpper Middle, a publication documenting the growing discomfort among “comfortable” millennials. Consultants at McKinsey—another tempting career for wayward achievers—had just dropped numbers reporting that middle managers were the target of roughly a third of job cuts in 2023 despite constituting 17% of the workforce. That spike arrived amid broader white-collar wage stagnation and a surge in living costs in metroplexes. Then there was the cultural assault: Trump railing against the deep state as post-woke Silicon Valley broligarchs depicted the “professional managerial class” as a conspiracy of feckless, self-righteous elites. The economy was booming, but cocktail parties were ending early. When I began advertisingUpper MiddleonInstagram—where the millennials hang out after the kids go down—I expected to reach (and monetize) plenty of overcompensated, overcompensating senior associates and junior partners. I didn’t. Instead, I found myself writing for doctors, many of whom emerged from the pandemic having lost conviction in the broader social project of public health. They were exhausted. They were just doing a job. They sounded like journalists—my defanged pack—when they bemoaned careers that had felt like a calling and become a persistent irritation. We shared an allergy to fig leaves. Over the last few weeks, during the Trump administration’s assault on Big Law, I’ve had the displeasure of watching and listening to lawyers go through a similar process of discovery. They’re coming to terms with the fact that prestige and purpose can be pried away by power. Several attorneys I’ve spoken with have asked a variation of the question I’ve heard so often from medical professionals: “Was I lying to myself?” Very few have the courage to spell the whole thing out. “Was I lying to myself thinking I was special?” Special. Elite. Prestigious. Americans have a whole vocabulary to avoid saying theotherc-word you’re allowed to say in England. But class anxiety is what drives American overachievers to accumulate all those diplomas, certificates, and letters of rec. We hope credentials will close the gap between us and the owners of the businesses who cut our six-figure checks. But that’s not how anything works. As sociologist C. Wright Mills put it all the way back in 1951: “White-collar workers are often closer in their economic fate and social reality to wage-workers than to the owners of the businesses they work for.” We just don’t like to admit this. We don’t like the idea that, as Wright pointed out a few pages later, our status rests upon “sharing the authority of those in charge of the enterprise.” There’s an upsetting truth in there: Power that can be un-shared isn’t really power at all. Does this mean that the highly paid attorneys who graduated in 2011 have been lying to themselves this whole time? Was the pro bono stuff just cover for a collective boner for money, status, and box seats to the US Open? Not entirely. Like the pediatricians who used to push (really push) MMR vaccines, lawyers are motivated, at least partly, by a higher calling. And that is special. But they are lying to themselves if they don’t admit something has changed. They are no longer being paid to be members of a professional priesthood working in service of the rule of law. They are being paid to do jobs they have less and less freedom to define. In the absence of that freedom, the money doesn’t seem so great. But it’s not nothing. One of the time-honored ways in which the upper middle class copes with this kind of precarity is by leaning into its refined tastes. We live in a consumer society and, oxymoronic as it may sound—it isn’t—buying stuff with money allows us to express a sophistication that can’t be bought. If fits matter more to us than our parents, it might be because, 50 years ago, life in America was affordable and luxuries were expensive. Now, life in America is expensive and luxuries are affordable. In the absence of true stability, we can microdose wealth one Beams+ sweater or CDMX vacation at a time. People with multiple degrees might identify as former singularly gifted kids, but there sure are a lot of them. Except maybe we can’t. Tariffs make it hard to predict whether email workers will be able to afford Japanese menswear, Italian Illy pods, and Delta Comfort+ going forward, and a glance at one’s portfolio can kill the shopping mood. The tariffs were implemented knowing they would likely hurt, as Fox News host Harris Faulkner put it last week, “the 401(k) people.” In other words, the risk-averse institutionalists who stick their salary in an index fund, betting (patriotically and narcissistically) on the information economy—their version of America’s future. Those people are largely outside the MAGA base of service business owners, big-business scions, day-trading degens, and “real Americans” without retirement plans. Arriving amid attacks on law firms and universities, the message was: You can wait this recession out in your nearest law library, but we’re not going to listen to your highly informed opinions when you get out. When there’s nowhere left to hide, safety is about numbers. People with multiple degrees might identify as former singularly gifted kids, but there sure are a lot of them. Just under 15% of Americans now hold a graduate or professional degree, and roughly 21% of Americans are members of households with at least double the median household income, the traditional financial qualification for being upper middle class. Our reluctance to think of ourselves as a class has led so-called elites to vastly underestimate our own power. We’re more comfortable interrogating our privilege than we are weaponizing it. We’ve chosen to negotiate from positions of weakness, cozying up to authority rather than, say, starting managerial unions. We’re coy about salaries, stock options, benefits, and beleaguered 401(k)s—all the things that we like to pretend don’t really matter—denying each other the data we need to renegotiate our relationship with true power. But that seems to be changing:Big Law associates are organizing onlineandmedical residents are unionizingin increasing number. If the fig leaf of prestige falls, the upper middle class will be exposed for what it is. A bit hypocritical? Sure. A bit precious? Absolutely. But also knowledge-bulked and economically well-endowed. When I talk to doctors or lawyers about their work, their lives, and the misalignment of their expectations and their circumstances, I hear anger in their voices. The upper middle class is spoiling for a fight. If the powers that be don’t want to share authority—if they’d rather oil up and wrestle—well…let’s fucking go.",

    "title": "Even ‘The Last of Us’ Director Mark Mylod Was “Emotionally Blindsided” By That Big Death Scene",
    "article_text": "Major spoilers forThe Last of Usseason two episode two to follow. As the team behindThe Last of Usprepared to crack the back of season two, a unique challenge presented itself: How do you do justice tothe biggest, most devastating death in video game history? When roughly half of your audience is anticipating your next big move, how do you live up to their enormous expectations, while allowing the TV show to be its own distinct thing? Well, for starters, you call Mark Mylod. A veteran director who has worked on some of HBO’s greatest shows, Mylod was uniquely positioned to deliver this emotional gut-punch. AsSuccession’s lead director, he presided overLogan Roy’s beautifully anti-climactic demise in the final season. Prior to that he had seen off Diana Rigg’s Olenna TyrellandIan McShane’s Brother Ray inGame of Thrones. The guy knows how to kill off a character. “It is becoming a habit,” Mylod tells me. AsThe Last of Uswriters Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann decreed, the demise of Joel (Pedro Pascal) plays out a little differently than in the game. While on the hunt for Joel on the outskirts of Jackson, Wyoming, Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) stumbles upon—and awakens—a horde of infected. Joel and Dina (Isabela Merced) then save her from the horde, who go on to storm and eventually breach the community walls in Jackson. Abby then directs them to a cabin in the mountains where her WLF crew are taking shelter. After a gut-wrenching monologue, Abby beats Joel to a pulp with a golf club (hard to forget that from the source material), before Ellie (Bella Ramsey) bursts in and is forced to watch her finish the job by sticking the jagged, broken handle of the club straight through his neck. Fans will notice the subtle changes, but most viewers will just be bowled over by the emotion of the scene, which is as punishing as it was onPS4. Putting it like that almost makes it sound straightforward, but this was a mammoth task for Mylod, as this pivotal episode—which also features a peak-eraGame of Thrones-style battle—is his first (and possibly last) time at the helm onThe Last of Us. He worked on it for six months from start to finish, across three separate snow-laden locations in northern Canada. A few days before the episode’s release, we hopped on Zoom with Mylod to talk about changes from the game, plans for an all-timer ofa one-shot takehe scrapped before shooting, and some of the moment that left him so moved he forgot to say ‘cut’. GQ:The last time we spoke,you had just killed Logan Roy. Now, you’ve killed Joel. What’s going on? Mark Mylod:It's weird. And it's a new form of character murder, isn't it – Character-ocide? It is becoming a habit. I killed off a couple of characters inGame of Thronesas well. So it is becoming addictive. You’ve come into arguably the biggest show on TV right now for just one episode, and it’s this huge emotional turning point. What’s that like? It's really terrifying. But, [writer] Craig [Mazin] asked me if I'd like to do the episode, which, and when I found out which episode, I couldn't say no to that. I was already a huge fan of the show, and the chance to work with [Mazin] kind of conquered all terror. It was odd to begin with, but the scale and the ambition of the episode was such that there was no choice but to just get stuck in and there was no time for nerves. How long were you working on it from start to finish? I think it was December [2023] to May [2024] roughly, somewhere within that zone in terms of everything from pre- to post-production, which for one episode is obviously a lot, but it was a humdinger of an episode. It was basically broken down into three stages, where there was three mountains—two figurative, one literal. There was Fortress Mountain in Alberta, [Canada], for a big chunk of the mountain work and the snow work, which had its own challenges, particularly to do with working at high altitude and in freezing conditions. There was the battle, which was a tremendous logistical challenge up at Minotti Bay, about an hour north of Vancouver, where incredible design team had built a version of Jackson. And then, of course, there was the work in the lodge [a real lodge in the mountains north of Vancouver], with the climactic scene with Abby and Ellie and Joel and the rest of the gang in there. And oddly, even though, from a production point of view, that was relatively simple—it's a room full of brilliant actors and a camera—it was far and away the most terrifying and the most daunting. Because of the responsibility of bringing that writing to life in a way that felt authentic and emotionally true and [lived up to] the history of the game, but also had its own life through our version of those characters. Had you played the games? No, I’m not a gamer. I watched the first season in awe with millions of other people. The thing that drew me to the project was this extraordinary combination of this morality play about consequences, about parental love, seeing love through this kind of looking glass… this dark side of love. Let's zoom in on Joel's death scene. There was all this expectation and pressure on that moment, and you somehow managed to live up to that. What were the challenges you faced in doing so? I felt huge pressure and responsibility to do justice to such a huge moment, but once you get over that and you dig into the work, then it's really about working with the actors to support them through that physical and mental strain of having to make themselves so vulnerable in those moments. That meant building a relationship with Kaitlyn and with Bella and with Pedro specifically. It's an incredibly joyful thing for me just to explore and push and prod and push till we feel we've got every single thing out of that moment. And to build to that moment of Joel's death, it was really just about supporting Bella, talking with her, so that when we came into the close-up, when we were really going to push and push and push to get everything out of all the reaction. [That] was always the pivotal moment for me, everything on her face—and just to work with Bella till we just knew [we had it]. There was one take where I'm just watching it, and the end of the take, I can't speak, I can't even say “cut.” There's that visceral emotional reaction to watching an actor's performance, where all sensible knowledge that you're in a room and there's a camera pointing at a bunch of actors and somebody holding a microphone, etc.—you're that lost in the moment and so, so emotionally blindsided. There’s a moment where Kaitlyn is giving her speech to Joel, and she looks over at the golf clubs and the camera shifts focus. And then just as the focus returns to her, she turns her head back and we see a perfect tear fall down her cheek… [Laughs] I know! I remember the time thinking, ‘Oh, my God, that is too good.’ I mean, just shot-wise, in terms of the camera operator and the focus-puller, [we] just got the exact pacing. You know, focus-throw and focus-pull can be so cheesy if you get it wrong, but that beautiful confluence of the work of the camera and the actor’s performance was just so beautifully encapsulated in that moment. Is that something you can plan for, or was it just good luck? I do think you can put yourself in a position to have good luck. My plan was to have that gear-change from the emotional outpouring of Kaitlyn's character in that moment, into the physical threat of the reveal of the murder weapon, and for the awful pit-of-the-stomach feeling that one hopes the audience is having in that moment. So the idea of for camera being there, and at the end of that speech, throwing the focus led by Caitlin's character over to reveal thegolf clubsin that moment, was very deliberate. The added beauty of working with such a great actor is that, of course, you know, she takes that idea and then doubles down on it with the perfection of that tear in that moment. Were there different versions of how you would shoot the scene? There are specific touchstones in my head. I had investigated the idea of a oner [a one-take shot] at one point. That was one of my early conversations with Neil Druckmann, because that's very much the style of the game. So I played with that idea. It didn't feel like that direct repetition would serve the moment best in our television storytelling. It felt like [we needed] the ability to go into those close shots and to check in with [the other members of Abby's WLF crew] and that discomfort. I find it fascinating that idea, in the secondary layer of the circle… This mission they've been on for, for so long, and here they are fulfilling that promise to Abby, but having to witness this extraordinary brutality that the consequences of violence, the way that's perpetuated through generations… Checking in on that psychic damage being done to those characters was fascinating and tragic to me. I was more interested in their reactions to the violence than the violence itself. And obviously, there were key moments, one of which we've just spoken about, that gear-change into switching from dialogue into action. And of course, just capturing those beautiful performances and that tragic triangle of Abby, Ellie and Joel. And I did plan that [overhead shot with Ellie lying with Joel’s dead body on the floor], pulling up that vacuum of hope at the end. There are some slight tweaks from how it plays out in the game – like Abby finishing it off by stabbing Joel in the neck with the broken club, rather than beating him. Was that to make it feel more final? Exactly. Joel has endured this beating, fulfilling the promise from five years ago, it's got to be slow. But at the end of it we wanted this utter finality of – in terms of creating that response in Ellie – there is no hope. That's absolute curtains. And that seemed a very effective way of achieving that. This scene brings to an end that relationship between both characters and actors with Bella and Pedro. How emotional was it on set? Bella, I know of old. I directed her first-ever scene onGame of Throneswhen [she was 11]. So we've known each other since she was literally a child. Rekindling that relationship was lovely, and there was an immediate intimacy and connection there with Kaitlyn and Pedro. Particularly in that relationship withPedroand Bella, I didn't want to be the gooseberry in the room there. They've built that connection over the years that they've been working together, and so I would step back from that and not try to insert myself into that. There’s a particularly affecting moment when Joel’s fingers twitch as he’s in a state of semi-consciousness. Is that actually Pedro lying there? I'd asked him for that on one of the takes. And then I remember watching and thinking, ‘Oh, God, that’s the desperation of pointless hope’. So, yes, he is doing that. Pedro is a traveller and an explorer as an actor. Each take is an exploration. What nuance can we find here? What is the level of pain here? What is the endurance? What is the level of acceptance of the consequences in your life on every level, from the huge philosophical and moral questions? What is the level of connection and awareness of Ellie's presence in the room? As an actor and as a director, we're working together there to try to calibrate that and find an emotional response in ourselves to any given moment. We’re running out of time, and we haven’t even gotten to the gigantic, peakGame of Thrones-tier battle sequence at the centre of this episode. Can you tell me a bit about the scale and the challenges of shooting that? It was actually really, really fun. Because, if you imagine, as a director, that you join a production that is like: here's an incredible stunt team. Here's an incredible AD team, here's an incredible VFX team. Everybody's working their ass off to achieve this incredibly ambitious sequence. And given all those assets, human and otherwise, you've got to be an idiot to mess it up at that point. And so it just comes down to working every single moment, from the big plan down to the micro level of, is that makeup right? Is that level of violence right? Is it cold enough? We just all worked our asses off. And I'd walk away at the end of each day, and it was cold and sometimes it was rainy which was not our friend, but each day I'd be replaying the sequences in my head with a gentle feeling of elation, a bubbling optimism that what we were capturing through this cumulative effort all these extraordinary craftspeople was was something that was going to be really visceral. I's an extraordinary kind of juxtaposition with the intimacy of those that large sequence. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "I Finally Found Better Shorts Than Patagonia Baggies",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. InGQ’s annual survey of theshorts market, Patagonia Baggies are never far from top of mind. Their appeal might be simple—an unbeatable trifecta of silhouette, quality, and price—but in the grand hierarchy of outdoorsy shorts with real-deal style chops, they reign supreme. Around this time every year, though, when the Recommends braintrust convenes for our seasonal Shorts Summit to conclude that shocker,Patagonia Baggies are still great, we also caucus on any surprising new contenders for the crown. And after putting The North Face’sClass V Pathfinder Belted Shortsthrough the paces in the wilderness this weekend—hiking, climbing, swimming, the works—they might’ve overthrown the king in my own power rankings. Because these are shorts predicated on performance above all else, let’s start there. The Class Vs are made from an almost-entirely recycled nylon blend that dries ridiculously fast, enhanced by a meretouchof stretch to ensure maximum range of motion (a boon no matter how much relaxation is on the agenda). They’re also outfitted with a webbed belt at the waist to make sure they, y’know, actually stay up, regardless of context, use case, or proximity to water. The North Face The North Face The North Face The North Face They boast a total of four pockets—two standard slash pockets plus hidden zipper pockets on either side—along with the aforementioned belted elastic waistband, a feature both simple and a touch more involved than its standard-bearing counterparts. I’m 5’9” with a 30” waist and went with a size small, the right move all-around. As hiking shorts, the Class Vs never sagged, even with a bunch of stuff loaded inside their pockets and an entire crash pad beating against them for well over two miles. Asclimbing shorts, they restricted approximately zero movement, even when I found myself contorted into pretzel-out positions that most non-climbers would describe as “no, please, god, no”. And asproxy swim trunks—because darn right they double as proxy swim trunks—they were dry before I even reached the car. (As someone who prefers a bit of extra breathing room when confronted with the choice, I would add that they’re a touch slimmer in the thigh than a typical pair of Baggies, though I wouldn’t consider them remotely narrow, either.) The belted waistband is a huge boon for anybody used to the Baggies' sometimes-flimsy drawcord. Hidden pockets—four in total, one more than you'll find on their Patagonia counterparts—kept my stuff secure on the go. Here’s the real kicker, though: at $65, they’re also just a few buckscheaperthan a pair of Baggies, and objectively more tricked-out—see: that extra zipper pocket, webbed belt, et al.—which isn’t quite the Baggies’ remit, but does make you wonder, well,shouldn’tit be, given the contextual similarities between them? As a near-lifelong Baggies devotee, I’m not going to pretend that the Class Vs willsupplant themin my closet altogether. But Iamresolutely stoked to have a pair at my disposal, and will be putting them through the wringer all spring long, officialGQshorts survey be damned.",

    "article_text": "By now, whether you’re a venerable Canadian body-horror filmmaker or a slightly confused Baltimore hardcore-band member, you’re probably aware thatCharli XCX closed out her Coachella performance this past weekend with a strobing video slideshow that bid an apparent farewell to the era known as “brat summer” and nominated a number of potential successors whose own season of zeitgeist-dominance might be imminent.

    "title": "Can You Really Buy a Birkin Direct From a Chinese Factory?",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. With growing fears aroundtariffsand an ongoing trade war with China, Chinese manufacturers have pitched American consumers an enticing proposal: Buy iconic goods from us and save money by cutting out the middleman. These suppliers took over TikTok last week, flooding For You pages with viral videos about where to source your favorite products from Lululemon,Hermès,Birkenstock, and more. Many of the videos have been removed, but the message has stuck with American consumers. Some viewers have vowed to buy from these manufacturers in an attempt to stick it to big Western brands—but what are they actually buying? Experts say consumers should be aware of the risks when going straight to suppliers because many people lack the knowledge to make informed choices. Suppliers on TikTok have claimed to make everything for your favorite brands: Birkenstock sandals, Hermès Birkin bags, Lululemon activewear. Some manufacturers said that these iconic products are mostly assembled in China and finished with logos elsewhere, allowing the brands to claim that their garments are made in the US or Europe. So if you want something, they have it—without the logo—for a fraction of the price. In this economy, who can resist a bargain? One viral video, from a now-removed account called @senbags2, featured a man breaking down the cost of the raw materials—including a leather hide, thread, hardware, edge oil, lambskin lining, zippers—and labor that go into a Birkin bag. He claimed that Hèrmes charges $38,000 but that it’s actually “$1,400 USD for one Birkin out of factory.” Another clip, which has 8.5 million views, features a factory worker in Yiwuadvertising Birkenstock Boston clogs, which cost $165 on the brand’s website, for $10. Notably, he references the shoes as “high end clogs and sandals” in his other videos. Many of these videos have been taken down. A TikTok spokesperson said the platform is removing content and accounts that violate itspolicyagainst “the trade or marketing of regulated, prohibited, or high-risk goods and services,” which includes counterfeit goods. Probably not. In the best-case scenario, these are pretty decent replicas, meaning they look similar to the original product but aren’t claiming to be authentic. Margaret Bishop, a global textile and apparel industry consultant, said that luxury brands don’t allow their legitimate suppliers to sell the same product directly to consumers. “Any contracts they have with their supply chain would specifically ban the factory selling direct to anyone, with or without a logo, with or without finishing,” Bishop said. If a factory is claiming that they are selling a luxury product without the logo, they are doing so “without the authorization of the brand that owns the intellectual property,\" she added. Worst case, they areillegal counterfeit goods, which is bad for many reasons beyond its illicit nature. Vidyuth Srinivasan, CEO of luxury authentication company Entrupy, has studied counterfeits for his business. He said over 60% of the thousands of counterfeit goods that Entrupy has tested contained harmful chemicals like arsenic or lead. Additionally, consumers don’t know who is making their products and whether they’re abiding by proper safety regulations. “You are buying something that you think is cheaper and better, and it's a big F.U. to some of the brands, but you don't realize that you're actually harming yourself,” Srinivasan said. The manufacturers in the videos are vague about the authenticity of their goods and their clients, which should set off alarm bells for consumers. When the world feels unjust—such as when your country’s leader announces tariffs that willjack up the price of everyday goods—consumers often believe counterfeit luxury goods aremaking the world more fair, according to Wiley Wakeman, assistant professor in the department of management organization at Stockholm School of Economics. But there is no evidence that that is true, Wakeman said. While consumers think they have found a hack to sidestep high prices from brands, they might be contributing to less savory business practices. There's no way to guarantee the product you are getting directly from manufacturers is made with the same materials or under the same labor practices as the big brands. “A lot of modern Chinese manufacturing is really amazing,” Wakeman said. “They can do things in ways that are fantastic. A lot of workers get paid very well, but that is not universal. It's kind of a patchwork of different manufacturers, different standards, and different motives.” A lot of brands do use factories and suppliers in China—but it’s unlikely that the ones on TikTok are the ones making these brand-name products. Hermès makes most of its products in France, with about a quarter of manufacturing occurring in other countries including Switzerland, Italy, the UK, the US, Portugal, and Australia,according to its website. Birkenstockstates on its websitethat it makes most of its products in Germany, with the rest assembled in other countries in the European Union. Lululemon uses suppliers in China, butit refuted claimsthat it used a factory featured in s now-deleted viral TikTok. The brand has a list of its suppliersavailable on its website. President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, which include a 145% tariff rate on Chinese imports, have created anxiety about the rising cost of goods. With the proliferation of Chinese manufacturing videos on TikTok, people—such asthis creatorwho received 26.7 million views—have said they can avoid tariffs if they buy straight from the source. You can’t skip the tariff, however, even if you’re buying direct. You will likelyabsorb the costthrough some sort of additional charge. So while you may be saving money on the product, it will still cost more to get it to your doorstep. Textile consultant Bishop added that while a lot of China-based factories sell goods direct to consumer—but it might be getting harder. DHL has justsuspended shipmentsof high-value B2C products over $800 from China to the US, which Bishop said gives customers one less option for getting the goods from Chinese factories. Sidestepping the middleman also means you are taking on all the procurement risk yourself. While it’s more expensive, buying from a reputable brand gives consumers more reassurance because there are safeguards that ensure you get a quality product—or any product at all. “If you get a product and there's a defect in it, if it's a reputable brand or retailer, that brand or retailer will either replace it or refund your money,” said Bishop. “If it's a counterfeit, that's on you. If it's a knockoff, good luck.”",

    "title": "Rosemary Oil for Hair Loss: Does It Work?",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Looking to use rosemary oil for hair loss? Let's talk about it. Firstly, you might smell a bit like a roast dinner. (It's a nice, pleasant, and pure thing for a Sunday afternoon, but there's probably a reason whyByredohasn't released a 'Poulet Rôti'candleyet, too.) Secondly, your hair will—purportedly—grow back longer and more lusciousthan ever before. It sounds a bit like a miracle, but that's what thousands of bald guys on the internet are hoping for. On many TikTok and Instagram accounts that are occupying our feeds, talking heads have long been singing the praises of rosemary oil. It's some sort of newhair drug, they shout, wide-eyed, and infinitely happy at the #ad check clearing in their bank account. Last month, their hair was coming out by the fistful. Now: thick, silky, strong! Wow! But what's the deal?Male pattern baldnesshas affected guys for centuries, and there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all cure, so the fact that so many social media influencers are saying so many nice things about rosemary oil all of a sudden seems kinda…weird. So, naturally, we're going to get to the bottom of it and find out if all the hype is worth it, or if it's all just a bit of hokum. Rosemary oil is an oil that's derived from the rosemary shrub. It's extracted from the leaves and its flowers using a process known as steam distillation. For thousands and thousands of years, this plant has been used in natural herbal remedies across Mediterranean countries like France, Morocco, and Tunisia. But because there's so much demand for it these days, it's now being grown in the UK as well. According to a2022 study, researchers found that rosemary oil was apparently as effective atencouraging hair regrowthas some over-the-counter treatments. Other studies, includingthis onethat was published by the São Paulo State University, found that rosemary oil has the natural ability to kill some fungi and bacteria. So if you're losing hair because of an infection or an unhealthy scalp, there may actually be some benefits. “Rosemary oil can absolutely help,” says Taylor Rose, a trichologist (a.k.a. hair and scalp specialist) and founder ofThe Healthy Hur. “It's especially effective when used to treat reactional hair loss.” Rose has a TikTok account dedicated to teaching others how togrow their hair back thickerand fuller using nothing but natural remedies. Ina videothat she posted last year, she revealed how she managed to help herthinning hairlinegrow back in just three months, thanks to a rosemary and mint spray that she made at home. “Rosemary oil as a potential topical treatment for hair loss has been mentioned in clinical studies for a number of years now, so this isn't particularly novel,” says Zoë Passam, a consultant trichologist atPhilip Kingsley. However, she isn't fully convinced. “As a trichologist, my main concern would be that people may follow these trends when they would be better served by finding out the reason for their hair loss. Some types of hair loss are progressive, so seeking appropriate advice early is likely to lead to better outcomes.” “Sure, rosemary has been used to soothe sensitive scalps,” saysTiffany Hall, a trichologist who runs two clinics supporting those who are experiencing hair loss. “And while there is some research out there that has seen some good results when it comes to regrowth, the science isn't fully there yet, and many other factors could have contributed to it.” If you want to give rosemary oil a go and see if it works for you, there are a couple of ways that you can use it. Firstly, you can massage it directly into your scalp. This is probably the best way, because you're applying it straight to where it's needed the most. Mix about five drops of rosemary oil with a teaspoon of carrier oil (which is like coconut oil or jojoba oil), and gently massage it into your lid after a bath or shower. Rinsing it out afterwards is entirely up to you, but if you don't, you should be careful of your clothes and sheets. If you do decide to rinse it out, let the oil sit for at least 10 minutes before doing so. Secondly, you can mix rosemary oil straight into yourshampoo. It's best to do this sparingly, so add two or three drops directly to it when it's in your hand before use. The neat thing about this is that you can also do this for any of yourconditioners, creams, and any lotions that you might use. Botanic Hearth Amazon Nature Spell Amazon Weleda Amazon Mielle Organics Amazon Rosemary oil may not work for everyone, but according to a2015 trial, participants showed a significant increase in follicle count after just six months of use. However, it's worth noting that this was a controlled study, so it may not be an accurate representation of real-world results. What it will do is hydrate. Rosemary oil is known for adding shine, strength, and a tall glass of water to dry scalps. A2020 paperby the Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences also found that it has significant “anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumorigenic, antinociceptive, and neuroprotective properties.” It all sounds very complicated, but what this essentially means is that it could, on paper, reduce dandruff, irritation, and itching. While it might have some benefits, it's not recommended for everyone. “If you're allergic to certain essential oils, I would recommend avoiding rosemary oil altogether,” says Richard Spencer, a consultant trichologist and owner ofThe Spencer Clinic. “To add to this, even if you're not allergic to it to begin with, applying it too often can cause some sort of reaction and sensitivity, so I'd recommend using it once or twice weekly maximum. But, to reiterate, if you're using it for hair loss, there's no real proof that it can stimulate or accelerate regrowth, so it's essential that you explore other remedies.” So, while some studies like this2013 reviewby Kinki University support the claim that rosemary oil does help with hair loss, some experts aren't buying it, and recommend other treatments that can actually make a difference. “There are clinically proven effective and safe treatments for hair loss,” saysDr Mia Jing Gao, a consultant dermatologist with a specialist interest in hair loss. “Rogaine is a product that contains the active ingredient minoxidil. Minoxidil 5% is a safe and effective treatment for male-pattern hair loss, which can be purchased over the counter and used at home. There is strong scientific evidence proving its efficacy at increasing hair density and promoting growth. It works for up to two out of three men, but it does take patience and persistence as it needs to be used daily and takes four months to see results.” “Tablet treatments like Finasteride can be effective, but patients need to be counseled about the side effect profile,” she continues. “It's important to note that all of these hair loss treatments only work for as long as the treatment is continued. There are other causes of hair loss, not just hereditary male pattern hair loss. Ultimately, if you are concerned about hair loss. I recommend seeing a doctor to check the diagnosis and consider treatments earlier rather than later.” This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "Somatotypes Explained: What's an Ectomorph, Endomorph, and Mesomorph",
    "article_text": "Three years ago, I took it upon myself toradically change my diet—and, in turn, to see if I could make any muscular gains. A relative of mine told me that no matter what I did, it would probably be hard for me to do because I am, in his words, a “hard gainer.” In other words, I’m an ectomorph: lanky and lean, with a high metabolism, little body fat, and not a lot of muscle. Ectomorph is a common term at the gym, along with mesomorph and endomorph. Taken together, they represent three generalized body types, orsomatotypes. Ectomorphs are long and lean. Endomorphs are rounded, with lots of muscle and body fat, a stockier structure, and a slower metabolism. (Think of football linemen.) Mesomorphs are athletic and muscular, capable of gaining weight or losing weight easily thanks to their efficient metabolisms. Body types are often discussed among bodybuilders, nutritionists, and personal trainers. How someone is built typically informs what someone should eat and the exercises someone might do in order to achieve a particular physical end. But the history of somatotypes, and their legacy (and usefulness) today, is not so straightforward as it might appear. The somatotypes are the product ofWilliam Sheldon. In the 1940s, the American psychologist and physician posited that the psychologies of people were biologically predetermined by their physiological makeups. What you looked like, Sheldon argued, correlated with how you behaved. Long and lean ectormorphs were thought to be sensitive, introverted, and shy. Muscular mesomorphs were thought to be active, assertive, and aggressive. Rounded endomorphs were expected to be extroverted and relaxed, but also lazy. Sheldon’s research was highly irregular and controversial. He based his assumptions, for instance, off ofnude pictures of college students, who thought they were being photographed for the purpose of posture correction. (Which would have been weird enough.) He assigned personality traits to each person’s shape—and, from there, linked someone’s shape to their behavior. “Through body type,”wrote Amanda Mull in The Atlantic, “Sheldon believed it could be possible to predict things like future criminal behavior and a child’s potential for leadership—quite literally, that physique was destiny.” Sheldon’s ideas came on the heels of the eugenics movement of the early 20th century, now universally seen as a repugnant and racist. And constitutional psychology, that field of research that grew out of Sheldon’s notions, was widely debunked over time. Drawing straight lines from someone’s physical shape to their personalities is obviously fraught. (As Mullpoints out, fat people are commonly stereotyped with traits of “laziness, carelessness, and low intelligence.”) Research conducted by the University of Texas at Dallas demonstrated just how hard it can be to shake people free of their biases when it comes to drawing conclusions about others based on what they look like. In astudyusing 140 gray 3D models, with the same face and standing with the same posture, participants were asked to assign personality traits—picked from a list of 30 adjectives they were provided—to the models based on their body shapes. Male models with broad shoulders were considered extraverted but irritable. Rectangular female models were described as shy. What the study showed was that positive or negative impressions of other people are based sometimes entirely on their body shape. Thinner models were thought of as curious, while fatter models were described as careless. At the time, Dr. Alice O’Toole, one of the study’s co-authors and a professor of cognition and neuroscience at UT Dallas,notedthat while there is “no strong evidence linking body type to personality traits,” people nevertheless “tend to infer personality traits from body shape in systematic and reliable ways.” What, then, do we do with the concept of body types, which can still hold a place in personal nutrition and training? The first thing, according to certified personal trainer Andrew Payne, is to understand that fitness behavior and physiology determines a person’s body type—not that a set-in-stone body type creates a person’s personality or gives them an immutable set of personality traits. “No one exists within purely one somatotype,” hewritesfor the National Academy of Sports Medicine. “Instead, we are all constantly in flux and fall uniquely on a spectrum somewhere between all three.” As Payne notes, one pound per month is the norm for healthy muscle gain, while one pound per week is the norm for healthy fat loss. Heoutlinesa variety of approaches to take depending on one’s current body type and the future body type they’re perhaps trying to attain. Endomorphs, for example, should build more aerobic exercises into their routines if they’re looking to lose weight; ectomorphs, on the other hand, should focus on strength training. The most important thing, however, is not to obsess over one’s body type as some sort of marker of the sort of person you are or will become. As Payne writes, “We know that no one is hopelessly predetermined to either be fat, muscular, or thin.\" Eat more, for starters. But there's slightly more to it than that.",

    "title": "Why a Healthy Gut Is So Important for Overall Wellness",
    "article_text": "The human gut figures prominently in some of the English language’s most cliched expressions. We’re often told to “trust our gut” when it comes time to make a tricky decision. Movies or television shows with gory violence might make some people “sick to their stomachs.” You may even find yourself saying your stomach is “tied up in knots” when anxious or stressed. These metaphors are based in some deep physiological truths. While we might think the gut serves a single, stinky function, it is, in fact, doing much more. The proper, healthy workings of our gut helps regulate our mood and how we otherwise feel. A gut in correct order will keep our immune system in top shape. In short: A happy gut is vital to our overall health. “It’s the connection to so many different systems in our body: our mood and our cognitive health, as well as our immune system,” says Monique Richard, a registered dietitian, nutritionist, and spokesperson for the National Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Composed of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestines, and, yes, the anus, the gastrointestinal tract—more commonly referred to as the digestive tract—is the largest part of the human digestive system. (The liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are also part of the digestive system, but separate from the digestive tract.) That’s the gut. The food we eat and the liquids we drink travel through the digestive tract and are slowly broken down into various nutrients, such asproteinsandfats. You might have heard the phrase “gut microbiome,” and that refers to the good gut bacteria. Inside the intestines aretrillionsof strains of two main bacteria, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, and we need them. How else do our bodies break down what we consume? “The microbiome is the metropolis of transportation,” says Richard. “It helps with absorption, digestion, and elimination.” Good gut bacteria metabolize different vitamins and micronutrients—and this is where the gut begins intersecting with other bodily systems. The metabolic processes that take place in our digestive tract will produce short-chain fatty acids, which help with our overall cognitive health. Inflammatory inhibitors, cytokines, and other immune defense mechanisms are centered in the gut itself, and the good gut bacteria play a role in shutting down inflammation throughout the body. “When we protect the integrity of the gut, we protect immune responses,” Richard says. There are also indirect ways we can treat our gut right. It's not always complicated: Simply slowing down and chewing when we eat is a simple step to take better care of our gut. If we masticate our food properly, it’s easier to absorb and digest. And if you slow down while you’re eating, Richard points out, there’s less chance stomach acid goes shooting up into your esophagus. What’s more, the gut acts something like a relay man to the central nervous system. Nearly 100 million nerve cells line the digestive tract. This “enteric nervous system” communicates with our brain, and can have a direct impact on how we’re feeling. Good gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which helps modulate our mood. Of course, the gut is only as good as what we feed it. Bacteria need to eat, too. That means we need to balance our diet with healthy plant foods, according to Teresa Fung, a nutrition professor at Simmons University in Boston. “We want beneficial bacteria, and they need their ‘food’ to thrive,” she says. “The beneficial bacteria in our gut thrive when we eat whole grains and minimally processed fruits and vegetables.” Rice, leafy vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds: Basically, if it’s grown in nature, it’s good for our gut. That’s because our bodies can’t break down foods rich infiberand other nutrients. What it means is that they survive their journey through the digestive tract and reach the gut microbiome, where they serve as a food source for our good gut bacteria. The food our gut bacteria feast upon are known as theprebiotics,not to be confusedwith the probiotics you might find on the supplement shelves of your local grocery store. Supplemental probiotics, which deliver lactobacillus and bifidobacterium to the gut, can be useful. But if we’re feeding ourselves the right way, then outside supplementation isn’t necessary. “Just like in diet, diversity matters in the microbiome,” says Richard.",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. On a predictable schedule, there’s a headline that makes you spit out your Diet Coke. This week, it’s that sucralose, the artificial sweetener found in Splenda, as well asDiet Coke with Splendahas been found to be “genotoxic,” meaning it can break down DNA, which is widely accepted as something that’s not good and can lead to unpleasant things like leaky gut syndrome. But not so fast. EpidemiologistGideon Meyerowitz-Katzwrote apiecein response to the study and the glut of “extremely misleading” media coverage that followed. He noted that the study took place in petri dishes, and said that it would take chugging 50,000 cans of Diet Rite Cola over two hours to reach the specific sucralose concentration levels where DNA damage was found to occur in the study. Agnostic of any health benefits or deleterious effects, artificial sweeteners are a guaranteed source of panic whenever a study pops up. Last February, artificial sweeteners found themselves under the media microscope when erythritol, another popular artificial sweetener, waslinked to cardiovascular eventsin a study published inNature. In a bipartisan display of fear, bothCNNandFox Newscovered the study, warning of the devastating effects of the very scary-sounding sugar alcohol, erythritol. Some experts expressed a deep skepticism about the study, including Dr. Peter Attia, who wrote that there was “no need for alarm,” while poking holes in the study’s methodology, though acknowledging that he and his patients do not prefer this sweetener given its “non-trivial gastrointestinal side effects.” Researcher and registered dietician Kevin Klatt also went long on the study’sshortcomingsin a Substack post. “If you see this and think, it’s time to scare everyone away from using any erythritol ever, you might be putting the cart before the horse and probably just selling clicks or bolstering a fearmongery wellness brand that has folks micro-optimizing every aspect of their lives,” wrote Klatt. Both Attia and Klatt mention fearmongering in their analysis (both also pointed out that we naturally produce erythritol) and the gist was the same: the study’s coverage was making a whole lot out of nothing. We know there is one sweetener linked to weight gain, dental decay, diabetes, and a whole host of other issues: sugar. As for the fake stuff: we’re still figuring it out.",

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar’s Chanel Linkup Was Years in the Making",
    "article_text": "“I’m best-dressed moving forward,” Kendrick Lamarproclaimedon his 2023 track “The Hillbillies,” approximately one month after he appeared in head-to-toe Chanel at that spring’sKarl Lagerfeld-themedMet Gala. (Blink and you might have missed him—the rapper skipped the famed red-carpet steps.) As of this week, Lamar is now an official Chanel ambassador, and a star in the French luxury house’s spring eyewear campaign. In the new campaign that dropped on Tuesday, Lamar poses in double-C shades alongside fellow brand ambassadors Lupita Nyong’o, Margaret Qualley, and Nana Komatsu. “Chanel has a timeless legacy and that is always something I can get behind,” Lamar said in a press statement. “Since they don’t make clothes for men, I knew it would have to be glasses.” Not that Chanel not making “clothes for men” has necessarily stopped Lamar—or a host ofother famous fellas—from wearing the label. After the 2023 Met Gala, Lamar and his creative partner, Dave Free, designed a sparkling set piece and produced a teaser film for Chanel’s spring 2024 couture show, which Qualley opened. During the show, Lamar, wearing a checkered tweed zip-up, sat in the front row next to Naomi Campbell. With designer Matthieu Blazy—renowned for his menswear at Bottega Veneta—now installed as creative director at Chanel, might we finally see the house make an official push into the men’s market? In July 2023, Kendrick Lamar attended Chanel's fall couture show in Paris. Then, in January 2024, Lamar's creative partner Dave Free, Naomi Campbell, and Lamar sat front row at Chanel's spring couture show. InaBusiness of Fashionarticleannouncing Lamar’s ambassadorship, editor Robert Williams posited that the linkup could be a sign that KDot is ready to move on from theconfrontational energy that’s defined his latest upsurge. “Tying up with Chanel—one the world’s most carefully controlled, risk-averse brands—could signal that Lamar is opening a new chapter and putting a year of controversy behind him,” Williams wrote. In recent months, Kendrick Lamar has also shared a stylist, Taylor McNeill, with actor Timothée Chalamet,who is the faceof the brand’s men’s fragrance,Bleu de Chanel. (In February, the duo met to filma joint interviewahead of Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime-show performance, and according toPage Six, the flared Celine jeansthat Lamar memorably woreduring his set were ones that McNeillhad initially set asidefor Chalamet.) Prior to that, Lamar has also worked extensively withPharrell Williams, a former Chanel eyewear partner, who produced Lamar’s Grammy-winning track “Alright,” as well as other songs off of prior albumsGood Kid, M.A.A.D CityandMr. Morale & the Big Steppers.",

    "title": "Queer Asian Rom-Coms Are Back in Cinemas. They Took A Long Road to Get There",
    "article_text": "The Korean-American director Andrew Ahn, 39, broke through in 2016 with his debut featureSpa Night, a slow, sexy, beautifully observed film about the coming of age—and sexual awakening—of a closeted Korean-American teenager who works at an all-male spa inL.A.'s Koreatown. The film won the John Cassavetes Award at the 2017 Independent Spirit Awards—but even then, Ahn's path forward seemed murky. “I didn't think that I could make a film career of queer and Asian work,” Ahn says. “I thought I'd have to make a white-person movie. I think about [the director] Justin Lin—he madeBetter Luck Tomorrow[a hit 2002 indie featuring an all-Asian cast], and then he made that movieAnnapoliswith James Franco. I thought that's what I'd have to do to build my career.” Instead, Ahn doubled down. ForDriveways, his follow-up, Ahn cast Asian actors in lead roles that had been written as white, giving future Oscar nomineeHong Chauone of her best pre-The Whaleshowcases. And in 2022, he showed that he could do lighter fare, with the horny, tenderhearted rom-comFire Island, a streaming hit on Hulu that managed to tell a story set in the Pines, the notoriously white gay community on Fire Island, and center it on gay Asian men, played byJoel Kim BoosterandBowen Yang. Now, Ahn is in town to promote another rom-com, once again starring Yang and once again centering the queer Asian-American experience. His new filmThe Wedding Banquetis a remake of the Oscar-nominated 1993 Ang Lee classic, starring Yang and Lily Gladstone. While it follows many of the same beats as the Lee original, Ahn’sWedding Banquetis a comedy of errors about a lesbian couple who strike a deal with their gay friends, to exchange a visa marriage for IVF money. It will also be the first of Ahn's films to get a proper theatrical release—a remarkable achievement for a rom-com about queer Asian characters, even one that features a recent Oscar nominee (Gladstone, ofKillers of the Flower Moon) and a standout from one of last year’s biggest blockbusters (Yang, fromWicked.) “I feel like I had to assemble this AsianAvengerscast in order to make it,” Ahn says. Along with Yang and Gladstone, the film features Kelly Marie Tran, the Vietnamese-American actress who played Rose Tico in two recentStar Warsmovies, Han Gi-chan, a BL star in South Korea, Youn Yuh-jung, an Oscar winner for her role as the grandmother inMinari, and the legendary Joan Chen, a revered veteran who’s appeared in classics likeThe Last EmperorandTwin Peaksand is in the middle of another resurgence, thanks to last year'sDìdi. Twenty years ago, Alice Wu'sSaving Face, an indie rom-com about a lesbian Chinese-American surgeon, her pregnant mother—played by Chen—and her dancer girlfriend, opened in limited release in US theaters after a successful festival run in the Toronto International Film Festival and the Sundance Film Festival.Saving Facewas a modest success but later became a touchpoint for Asian-American directors likeThe Farewelldirector Lulu Wang (“There was Ang Lee, there was Alice,” Wang told theNew York Times) and Ahn. But inSaving Face’s aftermath, for almost two decades, no queer Asian rom-com received a major theatrical release in America, relegated mostly to streaming or a handful of theaters. “I think it's really tricky as an artist who exists within communities that have been pushed outside of the mainstream, to make art that is mainstream,” says Ahn. “I think there's a real tension between the art and the commerce of it. For many years it was really difficult to figure out, ‘How do you make an Asian-American led rom-com film?’” “It wasn't even that long ago, what a big dealCrazy Rich Asianswas,” Yang adds. It feels like a moment worth celebrating then thatThe Wedding Banquetis one of two queer Asian rom-coms getting notable US theatrical releases this month—the other being Roshan Sethi'sA Nice Indian Boy, a gay Indian-American take onGuess Who’s Coming to Dinner, starring Karan Soni and Jonathan Groff. Soni, Ahn notes, \"was very supportive ofFire Island.Everybody knows everybody, especially if you're gay and Asian. As a community, we've been inspired and we've seen people have success and we've seen the growth of our talent. And so I think it's finally coming to fruition. My hope is that it's a continual crop and not an explosion and then nothing.” “It all to me still personally feels precarious,”A Nice Indian Boy's Soni tellsGQ, in a Zoom interview. “It could go away. I don't feel like this safety in it, personally, but maybe that's just my trauma being in Hollywood for a while. But I'm always here to celebrate it and that it's there.” “I think it's the direction Hollywood needs to go,” Koni continues. “We've seen every version of a certain story with a certain cast. I think it's all been done at a certain point now. And I feel like in order for movies to still be relevant in the future—because we have to be honest, there's our phone, which is sucking up entertainment for so many people—in order for them to persist and continue, they have to expand.” There’s a reason why the romantic comedy—a genre that has been maligned for its narrative formula and propensity to revel in aesthetic pleasures—has often been the ideal form for that expansion. The genre has always been powered by aspiration and universality, making it the ideal Trojan horse in which to smuggle complicated, sometimes thorny ideas into the mainstream. Consider, for example, the sophisticated class commentary of Gregory La Cava’s 1936 screwball classicMy Man Godfrey, released in the middle of the Depression. Or the corporate feminism of ‘80s rom-coms likeBaby BoomandBroadcast News, which became hits in a decade when women were breaking the glass ceiling in the workplace. As Yang sees it, the fact that rom-coms are formulaic is what makes them an ideal platform for subversion. “You can break the formula. You can subvert so many things about them,” he says. “It is [about] this universal thing, this thing that everybody wants in some form, to experience this acceptance and love.” Sethi’sA Nice Indian Boyis a sharp example of how formula can create something that feels new. Infusing the romantic-comedy formula while borrowing from Bollywood tropes—including a musical number and references to the classic Indian rom-comDilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—the movie makes traditional Indian wedding rituals and the specific experience of being Indian-American and queer the center of the plot. “This movie is not revolutionary,” Soni says. “A Nice Indian Boyis very much following the classic norms of a lot of rom-coms, but I think it feels revolutionary because the point of view is completely different. And I think that's a really exciting thing because the movie feels fresh but old-fashioned at the same time. And I think if we open up the POV a little bit, there's a lot of movies that haven't been made and stories that haven't been told.” The film is personal to Soni and Sethi, partners in real life. “We were like, what would be the most personal version of a gay love story to us? And being Indian, our parents have to approve of our [partners]. It's just a given,” Soni says. That specificity and intimacy are what drew Groff to the production. “Truth be told, the fact that Karan and Roshan are together in real life and making this rom-com about love and about family, it added this special element to it that made me more invested in wanting to do it,” says Groff. “I think that their love is in every frame of this movie… It's like a Gena Rowlands and [John] Cassavetes kind of situation.” It’s interesting to think about how incremental true cultural change can be. The success of 1993'sThe Joy Luck Clubsignaled to Hollywood that the Asian-American community had stories worth telling. It wasn't until a decade later, in the early 2000s, thatBetter Luck TomorrowandSaving Facecame along to undercut model-minority clichés by showing Asian-American characters who were subversive. It took another ten years before Asian-Americans could be portrayed as aspirational figures, in films likeCrazy Rich Asians. The last few years have seen the movement go from strength to strength, from action-packed epics likeEverything Everywhere All At Onceto quiet dramas likePast Lives. “It feels like it also goes through cycles, the way that a lot of cultural moments do,” says Yang. “Like, I don't want to think of Asian cinema as a low-rise jean, but it just is this interesting thing where, as the generations grow and as new audiences emerge, you realize that there was no reason for it to ever go away.” DuringCrazy Rich Asians’ promotional run, Ahn remembers that movie’s star, Constance Wu, taking every chance she got to talk up his filmSpa Night. “She kept talking about it in interviews and on panels,” he says. “She talked about the legacy of Asian-American indie film, and people found the film that way. And so, as much as I couldn't imagine how a movie likeCrazy Rich Asiansmight directly affect me, it did.”",

    "title": "The ‘Sinners’ Post-Credits Scene Isn’t Just Worth Waiting For—It’s Essential",
    "article_text": "This story contains major spoilers forSinners, including discussion of the ending. Ryan Coogler’s fourth film,Sinners, was a sensation this opening weekend—it pulled in $45.6 million domestic and over $60 million globally, and perhaps as importantly, became the center of the cultural conversation despite landing at the same time as the first round of the NBA playoffs. It’s become a bonafide phenomenon, causing uproar over where and how it could be seen in its “proper” 70mm IMAX format, putting the city in a chokehold and prompting sold out screenings from Thursday afternoon through Sunday night. The film itself is a fascinating curio we’ll be arguing about for years—a horny, funny, violent, frightening and thrilling Carpenteresque carnival attraction with a Williams-worthy knockout Ludwig Göransson score that is practically a co-lead in the film, Spielberg-quality blocking and pacing (and elite Spielberg oners), and a fun, cheap infusion of eye-in-the-door-hole melodramatic ‘80s-sleepover Rick Baker-y trash, all of which combines to make a flick with swaggering, summer-blockbuster mojo that came a few months too soon. The very few audience members who haven’t enjoyed it (I won’t lend any one stupid score-aggregating site the credit it does not deserve, but the film is “performing” very well) seem to be bumping on the lack of imagination the film brings to the conventions utilized to tell its story. It’s no longer a secret thatSinnersis (to a degree) a vampire film, and one that uses antiquated fairytale-hokey vampire lore to make the rules of its world—wooden stakes through the heart, pickled garlic brine that sizzles like holy water or hydrofluoric acid. But focusing on the vampire of it all, and even the blues, is largely missing the point. The film is a very thinly-veiled parable about how the vampiric mainstream love and acceptance of white institutions compromises Black artistry. Lazy critics have been putting Ryan Coogler in conversation with Spike Lee for as long as he’s been a filmmaker, for obvious and extremely dumb reasons. Coogler has always been a disciplined, structured storyteller, a culture-literate pop politician naturally able to navigate the studio system in the era of IP in a way Spike could never dream of. But in this case,Sinnersis in conversation with Spike notjustbecause it’s the work of a young Black filmmaker with electric chops, an encyclopedic handle on the history of cinema and impeccable instincts, but because this specific film is one of the most purely symbolic, metaphorical recent movies/bully pulpits you will find outside of Spike's unique, voicey cinematic universe. To say a lot ofSinners’splot dressing is beside the point wouldn’t be right, but also wouldn’t be wrong. Either way, let’s quickly run it down—and here’s your final spoiler alert, you’re on your own after the end of this sentence. The core relationship in the film is between the Moore brothers, Elias (Stack) and Elijah (Smoke), twins who survived the German trenches and two separate European-diaspora organized-crime families in Chicago. They’re both played bythe great Michael B. They hail from Rick Ross’ ancestral home of the blues, Clarksdale, Mississippi, portrayed in the film as a cotton town in apparent need of another juke joint. Having realized the Northern metropolis is just another racist Southern town with tall buildings standing in for plantations, the native sons have come home from Chicago to provide for their community, because Mississippi is the devil they know, and because they’re hustlers, distributors looking to bring authentic experience to their brethren. On their first day back in town, the brothers put together a proper heist crew of local laborers and artisans and turn an old sawmill into a juke joint, an unlicensed bar/club offering illicit Irish-style beer, Italian wine, and music, performed by their slide-guitarist griot blood-cousin Sammy, or Preacher Boy (Miles Caton), and an ancient, perfectly craggy blues-harp player named Delta Slim (give Delroy Lindo his fucking Oscar, for the love of God). The brothers pull off a well-attended evening but have to face the reality that making their juke a for-us-by-us proposition means a majority of their gate will be paid with plantation credit rather than legal tender, which is one way the film signals working within and selling primarily to a niche demographic isn’t “enough” if you want to “make it” in America. Eventually the vampires show up, led by Jack O’Connell as Remmick—an Irish supervillain in a movie directed by a Black man named Ryan—who has come to take Preacher Boy and his “true” Black artistry, his stories and his songs. Armed with Charley Patton's guitar, his art wrought from generational pain, Preacher Boy’s “magic” talent is a flame that attracts evil because it can pierce the veil between life and death, and because Remmick can’t do what Preacher Boy does, with his talent “brought from home.” The two most important vampiric rules in the film are that vampires must beinvited into enter a space, which suggests that their demonic possession has to be welcomed, or self-inflicted by their eventual victims, and that once they suck your blood and devour your soul, they also steal your talent, your memories, your ideas, and your language. It’s no coincidence the Irish peckerwood music O’Connell and his initially all-white folk trio play is corny and sucks, until they start feasting on folks from the juke, who join their undead demon band and import percussion and energy. These vampires steal swag, the way, oh let’s say a mega franchise/cinematic universe built on lame dudes in tights can be lent soul and cool and cultural import by an imaginative Oakland kid with otherworldly talent who grew up on Too Short. In the lead up to the film there was rampant speculation that before his cancellation, Jonathan Majors was meant to play one of the brothers, and it’s understandable until you see the film, in which it’s obviously necessary for Smoke and Stack to be portrayed by one person. Coogler is smart enough to know how powerful and singular his De Niro’s presence is, and doesn’t ask us to buy him as two separate characters for long. He splits the brothers up early, and when he reunites them you can see them as the halves of a whole, the manifestation of a single conflicted person torn between two impulses. In what’s oddly become the year of one-actor-plays-multiple-guys movies—from the dual DeNiros in Barry Levinson’sThe Alto Knightsto the many Robert Pattinsons in Bong Joon-Ho’sMickey 17—it’s Coogler who makes the best use of the device, reminding us that it’s a wonderful way to illustrate the duality of man. Smoke represents the independent integrity of the artist that won’t be co-opted or compromised by blood money, and Stack stands in for the desire to work within the system, to reap its institutional power and bountiful resources and buy into its siren call of immortality. In other words: Smoke resists the vampire’s kiss, Stack does not. As with Jordan’s Erik Killmonger inBlack Panther, Coogler once again has the sense to give his demonic villains logic and reason that complicates the morality of a classic structure, be it comic book or horror. The devil has a point here; Remmick, Hailee Steinfeld’s white-passing Mary, and eventually Stack all attempt to sway Smoke by selling him on their belief in the purity of what the juke represents, and making the cynically American argument that in a country ruled by twin forces of parasitic capitalism and institutional racism, he and his brother were never going to be truly free. The vampires intend to build a new eternal klan, based on love, and once Smoke gives himself up to them, they’ll create their own juke that can last, a new heaven here on Earth—which is a pitch I’d imagine a young filmmaker might hear after he has miraculously, successfully resurrected a long-dormant boxing franchise, then having fallen for that pitch, spent nearly ten years of his career in service of a comic-book universe. When Smoke won’t come outside or let the vampires come in, Stack contemptuously yells, “Novision!” By the end, nearly everyone but Preacher Boy is dead. He escapes, then lives another 60 years. The film’s coda comes in the form of a post-credits stinger, that signature mic-drop that may very well constitute the MCU’s lasting contribution to cinema. But while Marvel has spent nearly 20 years using its stingers as sponcon teasers for its next spate of movies, at best—and at worst, as a dumping ground for forgettable, utterly meaningless throwaway gags designed to annoy even the hardest-core Marvel zombie—Coogler uses his post-credits slot to make a final statement that’s absolutely essential to any coherent reading of his film. So the credits roll—and then it’s 1992, the year thatBlack Pantheropens on a basketball court in Oakland, but we’re in Preacher Boy’s club, fashioned to look like the greatTipitina’s in New Orleans. Stack swaggers in, dressed in full Biggie-era superstar regalia: Coogi, designer shades, fat gold link with an iced-out Jesus piece, and his badass love on his arm draped in a chunky two tone leather. He’s fly as fuck, and has capitalized on all of life’s Earthly pleasures, a picture of the wealth and success Remmick once tempted him with. He offers Preacher Boy one last shot at eternal life, and Preacher Boy once again denies him. He’s had his fill of this place and is content with the life he lived, practicing his art humbly on the margins of culture, on his own terms. He tells Stack that the momentous day they shared together, putting together the juke, was the happiest of his life. Stack, through Gucci-tinted lenses, agrees, remembering those last moments with his brother, the last time he saw the sun, the last day he owned his soul, the last day he was free. He says, “I miss the real.” Preacher Boy smiles, and the final shot of the film is the trio, in an open car, driving down a dirt road through cotton fields. Coogler’s real-life career complicates the film’s ultimate message, because in practice he is more Stack than Smoke. He bought into the promise made by the vampire hordes, believed he could make change by working from within the system, and largely has won. He made a historic deal to own this film, and its wild success has cemented what we already knew, that he is one of the premiere filmmakers of his generation, in league with the Peeles and Gerwigs, who has likely written himself a blank check on top of his multiple existing blank checks to tell whatever original stories interest him going forward. Who knows how much he stands to profit from true ownership of his film in 25 years—but that hardly seems to be the point. He’s telling us that this movie is a piece of his soul no one else can own, at least in terms of financial custodianship. So perhapsSinnerscan be best understood as a cautionary tale, of Coogler looking back on the last decade of his life and expressing regret at the devil’s bargain he made. Through this brilliant original story, he’s telling us that as an artist in this fucked-up industry, in this fucked-up country, we’re all going to be killed by something. It's up to you to let the right one in.",

    "title": "A Look at Royal Appearances at the Cannes Film Festival",
    "article_text": "When they arrive at the Cannes Film Festival, all the paparazzi turn their lenses towards them. We aren’t talking about the stars of the silver screen but the royals who manage to steal the limelight as soon as they step onto the famous red carpet at the Palais des Festivals. Some of their appearances are legendary. Think of Princess Diana in a splendid sky-blue chiffon gown in 1987, or the legendary meeting between Grace Kelly and Rainier of Monaco, which took place in May 1955, at his princely palace, when Alfred Hitchcock’s muse was attending the festival in France. Many prominent members of Europe’s royal families are regulars at the festival, though Monaco’s ruling dynasty is the best represented:Pierre Casiraghi, his wifeBeatrice Borromeo, and his sistersCharlotte CasiraghiandAlexandra of Hanoverall regularly attend the festival. Here's a look at some of the most famous royal family appearances on the Croisette in Cannes over the years. A year before becoming the princess of the Rock—to use the popular nickname for Monaco—Grace Kelly visited Cannes in 1955 as an actor, a living Hollywood legend, and a Hitchcock muse. After marrying Prince Rainier, she would regularly attend the Cannes Film Festival. Grace Kelly met the man who was to become her husband and prince, Rainier of Monaco, while attending the Cannes festival in 1955. After they married, Princess Grace would often make the short journey from her home in Monaco for screenings and events in Cannes. The Princess of Wales in Cannes in 1987, when she attended the screening ofThe Whales of Augustby British director Linday Anderson. Prince Charles is at her side. Even at an event filled with celebrities, all eyes were on Diana that evening. The Duchess of York and ex-wife of Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson has also visited Cannes on several occasions. In 2000, when she was no longer a member of the royal family, she returned as a correspondent for NBC’sTodayshow. Monaco is roughly 35 miles from Cannes and members of the Grimaldi family can regularly be spotted at the festival. A passionate cinephile, Princess Caroline of Monaco attended the screening of director Bertrand Blier’sToo Beautiful for Youwhere she was seated next to France’s minister of culture at the time, Jack Lang. Caroline made an impression on the red carpet in her black and white outfit. Like her mother, Caroline of Monaco, Charlotte Casiraghi regularly attends Cannes events where she is welcomed as both a princess and a muse. On a visit to the South of France, Rania, one of the world’s most admired queens, stopped by the Cannes Film Festival. In 2011, the year they were married, the royal couple attended the AmFAR Gala, the festival’s most important charity event. Princess Stéphanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, with her husband, Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume, represented the country at the 2017 festival in Cannes. The Duchess of Calabria and Palermo and her younger sister, Maria Chiara, made a special appearance on the red carpet two years ago to see the latest film in theIndiana Jonesseries. Caroline of Monaco, Princess of Hanover through her marriage to Prince Ernst August, was accompanied by producer Paul Rassam and actor Carole Bouquet at a screening of Martin Scorsese’s latest film. Charlotte Casiraghi glowed on the red carpet for the showing ofMarcello Mio, by director Christophe Honoré. The couple attended a preview screening ofThe Count of Monte Cristo. Charlotte Casiraghi and her sister-in-law, Beatrice Borromeo, attended the opening ceremony of the 2023 edition of the festival, accompanied by Dimitri Rassam, Casiraghi’s ex-husband.

    "article_text": "The Met Galahas seenZendayatake the forms of Cinderella, a saint, and several personas in between. After serving as a cochair for the Met Gala 2024 and impressing us enough to make bothVanity Fair'sbest dressed listand thetop theme winnersof the night, all eyes are on Zendaya to see what she'll dream up for theMet Gala 2025. As a cochair last year alongside Condé Nast Global Chief Content OfficerAnna Wintour,Chris Hemsworth,Bad Bunny,andJennifer Lopez,Zendaya helped plan and promote the fundraising event. Though she was an early arrival on the carpet, that didn’t mean her look was necessarily completed early:Law Roach,who has worked with Zendaya on her fashion since she was 13,toldThe New York TimesThursdaydays before the event that the actor’s dress “isn’t even made.\" Zendaya, however, seemed unbothered. “Hopefully with the Met, since I’ve been away for so many years, maybe this time around I won’t be so stressed,” shetoldUSA Todayahead of the 2024 event, her first since 2019. The actor made her Met Gala debut in 2015, the same year thatRihannaestablished herselfas a Met must-watch with her canary yellow Guo Pei gown for the year’s “China: Through the Looking Glass” theme. The then 18-year-old Zendaya made a great first impression at the event herself in a knee-length Fausto Puglisi gown with a dramatic train and coordinating headpiece. She attended every year between 2015 and 2019, stealing the show in looks such as a Versace take on Joan of Arc for 2018’s “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” theme, and even brought Roach along with her in 2019 to be the fairy godmother to her over-the-top, Tommy Hilfiger–clad Cinderella. That look, complete with a pumpkin carriage purse and special effects smoke billowing from Roach’s magic wand, coordinated with the night’s “Camp: Notes on Fashion” dress code. The star then took a break from attending the party for a few years, only to make her triumphant Met Gala return in 2024. Zendaya donned not one buttwoshow-stopping lookson the red carpet, wowing onlookers first with a bold peacock blue Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano haute couture look, then later reappearing in a second look, also designed by Galliano. Her head-turning take two was a black archival Givenchy gown from 1996—Galliano's very first haute couture collection for the house. She topped the look off with a colorful floral headpiece, posing herself as a bouquet: A centerpiece-worthy statement whose beauty would change with time as a nod to the exhibit's \"Garden of Time\" theme. As for the Met Gala 2025, all eyes are on Zendaya to see what she'll wow us with next.

    "title": "Who Will Attend Pope Francis’s Funeral?",
    "article_text": "Dozens have confirmed their attendance for Pope Francis’s funeral, which is scheduled to take place on Saturday, April 26, at 10 a.m. on the parvis of St. Peter’s Basilica. It has been 20 years since the world witnessed a papal funeral service. During Pope John Paul II’s funeral on Friday, April 8, 2005, the front row was reserved for Italian and Polish authorities (as the pontiff hailed from Poland), who were also able to bring more representatives than the other delegations, 200 official ones from around the world with heads of state and government, kings and queens, ministers. During that service, dignitaries were arranged in alphabetical order, according to the country’s French nomenclature and ordered according to diplomatic protocols. Here is who is slated to attend Pope Francis’s funeral: Pope Francis and Giorgia Meloni on June 14, 2024 in Fasano, Italy. Prime MinisterGiorgia Melonihas canceled international engagements scheduled for the weekend in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in order to attend the late Pope’s funeral on Saturday. President of the RepublicSergio Mattarella,who has already paid his respects to the pope at Santa Marta will also attend. Pope Francis meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during an audience at the Apostolic Palace on October 11, 2024 in Vatican City, Vatican. European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen,French PresidentEmmanuel Macron,and Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyall plan to be present, according toLe Figaro. President of RussiaVladimir Putinhas not announced intentions to attend the funeral. Donald and Melania Trump meet with Pope Francis in May 2017. Among the first to confirm attendance at the funeral was President of the United StatesDonald Trumpwith his wife,Melania. Brazil’s PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, accompanied by his wifeJanja, will also be in attendance. Lula had also attended the funeral of John Paul II. Official confirmations are forthcoming, but there is no doubt about the participation of royal families from Catholic countries from Spain to the principality of Monaco, but also that of representatives of the British royal family given the recent visit ofKing CharlesandQueen Camillato Pope Francis.All sent messages of condolence.

    "title": "Appeasing Donald Trump Won’t Work",
    "article_text": "WhenDonald Trumptook office in January 2017, he was greeted bymassivedemonstrations. Millions participated in women’s marches in Washington, DC, and elsewhere, with more protests to follow, giving rise to a resistance movement. We’re seeing a new one develop, with peoplemobilizingagainst Trump’s authoritarian agenda, complete with trade wars and culture wars, as well asElon Musk’s dismantling of federal agencies. While everyday Americans are pushing back, some elite entities, in law and academia, have been responding to Trump’s radical agenda and demands with appeasement—which already looks like a losing strategy—as other institutions fight back. “Law Firms Made Deals With Trump. Now He Wants More From Them,” declaredTheNew York Timeslast weekin a piece detailing how efforts to avoid retribution haven’t insulated firms “from his whims.” Pretty clearly, appeasement in the face of executive orders and threats provides an opening for Trump to ask for more, just like any would-be autocrat might. According to theTimes,Trump “has mused about having them help with his goal of reviving the coal industry.” Ahh, just what every ambitious young associate has always dreamed of: doing pro bono work for Big Coal. There’s reportedly talk of firms, which have collectively pledged close to $1 billion in pro bono work, being tasked with helping out the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Meanwhile, four law firms that opposed Trump’s executive orders have already had wins in court. Over in academia, Columbia University has provided a great example of how not to survive Trumpism. In trying to reinstate $400 million in federal funds, the schoolcavedto a number of administration demands, such as “banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and taking control of the department that offers courses on the Middle East from its faculty,”according toThe Guardian.While the brand has been tarnished, the money still hasn’t been restored because, as you may have guessed, the administrationhas more demands. (Oh, and amid all this came a weird story about how Trump demanded Columbia pay him$400 million25 years ago due to a proposed real estate deal.) Now let’s look at Harvard, an Ivy League school that haspushed backagainst Trump’s demands. The university received a letter, signed by officials from three major government agencies,ordering everythingfrom “governance and leadership reform” to “admissions reform” to the nebulous “viewpoint diversity in admissions” (which sounds like an affirmative action program for Trumpers). The letter reads as if the Trump administration plans to make the venerable Harvard into something more like the conservative vassal Hillsdale College. The university’s decision to make the government’s demand letter public was smart because the missive drew quick blowback; according toTheWall Street Journal,there were even “some on the right who publicly said it was overreach.” Since the publication of the letter, the Trump administration has put in jeopardy the institution’sability to enroll foreign studentsand threatened to strip Harvard of itstax-exempt status. Just like Joseph McCarthy used fears of communism in the 1950s to squash dissenting views—something my familyknows all too well—the Trump administrationhas tried to castits campus clampdown as an effort to root out antisemitism. Inconveniently for Trump, though, Harvard presidentAlan Garber,a “mild-mannered”Jewish doctor and economist, had already been responding to concerns about antisemitism on campus and had deliberately steered the university away from responding to world events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Yet Garber has been anything but mild in response to Trump’s threats,declaringin a message that “no government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.” Harvard is digging in for a long legal fight, which could eventually wind up in the Supreme Court. In a lawsuit filed Monday, Harvard accused the Trump administration of using the threat of slashed funds as “leverage” in a “pressure campaign” against the school,according to CNN, and dismissed the idea of the cuts being in the interest of fighting antisemitism. “The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America’s position as a global leader in innovation,” read the lawsuit. The elite university might face even more attacks, but it’s still in a better position than Columbia, and can boast of having the public in its corner:The Onioncaptured this unlikely moment withits headline“Nation Can’t Believe It on Harvard’s Side.” Harvard, already America’s wealthiest university, received “nearly 4,000 online gifts totaling $1.14 million” in less than 48 hours after Garber’s email, according toThe Harvard Crimson. Like so many things in Trumpworld, there’s been plenty of confusion in the rollout of the attack on Harvard, along with some backpedaling over the letter. “There were differing accounts inside the administration of how it had been mishandled,”according totheTimes,as “some people at the White House believed it had been sent prematurely.” The Trump administration is waging several different wars at the same time—from trade wars to culture wars—along with assaults on science, higher education, and public health. And that’s not to mention its attacks on the media, with the Associated Pressproviding another exampleof pushback. A federal judge recently ordered that the AP’s presidential access be restored after the White House barred the outlet from events for refusing to go along with Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico, which he says should now be called the Gulf of America. This is all happening simultaneously as the Trump administration continues to be dogged with problems of incompetence, from the secretary of defense’sreported problems with Signal chatsto atariff rollout—and walkback—that caused global market havoc. There is no way for one administration (especially one this incompetent) to fight so many wars at once. The lesson from Harvard is: Stay visible, stay loud, and stay fighting. That’s the only way for institutions to survive what’s coming. HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Can the Academy Force Oscar Voters to Do Their Homework?",
    "article_text": "In a perfect world, every Academy voter would watch every nominated movie before casting their final Oscar ballots. But as those horrendous anonymous interviews with voters that the trades publish each year have shown us, that is rarely the case. As one votertoldThe Hollywood Reporterof the films up for best animated feature in 2023: “I watched at least part of all of them—a couple of them in their entirety—and I didn’t really give a shit about any of them.” The Academy is hoping to fix this problem with a new set of rules announced Monday. The board of governors says members must now watch “all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round for the Oscars.” This rule pertains only to the final round of voting after nominations, and means that any voter who has not watched all the nominated movies will not be able to vote in that specific category. “I applaud the Academy because it’s a positive step,” says one Academy member. “They needed to do something.” But the announcement didn’t include information abouthowexactly this requirement will be enforced. Many Academy members watch Oscar-nominated films through the members-only Academy Screening Room streaming app, which should make viewing much easier to track than it was in the DVD screener days. If a member sees a film in another way, such as at a guild screening, at a festival, or in a movie theater with the rest of us, they’ll reportedly have to fill out and submita formstating when and where they watched a film. This new system would be similar to what BAFTA voters have been using for several years. If a BAFTA voter does not watch all the films in any given category, that category will essentially be “greyed out” on their e-ballot when they go to vote. In the past, the Academy has had a similar requirement for those voting in the preliminary and nomination rounds for certain categories—like animated, live action, and documentary shorts. But this is the first time the Academy has made a viewing requirement for all voters in all categories, speaking to how high a priority it is. Some Academy members tellVanity Fairthat they already don’t vote in categories where they haven’t seen the films, but they know that’s not the case for everyone. “I’m always shocked to find out how many people voted in categories where they had only seen one film,” said another voter. In part, this new rule is one way for the organization to get a handle on a membership that has ballooned from 5,765 voting members in 2012 to nearly 10,000 now. The group’s more international and younger makeup has given many members a growing feeling that such a large group of voters may not be watching everything. Failing to see every movie can lead to coattail voting, in which a voter simply marks a single frontrunner over and over down their ballot.OppenheimerandEverything Everywhere All at Once,for example, both won seven Oscars each, including best picture—hauls that could have been inflated because most voters may have actually watched each of those films. The Academy often announces rules in the spring that reflect on the biggest issues of the most recent Oscar season. This year, the organization also announced new rules about the use of AI (after last year’scontroversy surroundingThe Brutalist) and a stricter deadline for films to get their PGA credits sorted (due to the overwhelming number of best-picture contenders this past year whose nominees were listed as “nominees to be determined”). But the concern about voters not watching all the movies in a category has been a growing issue for the past few years, sources tellVanity Fair. Because Academy members are still allowed to self-report public or guild screenings, this is still in many ways an honor system—and there might likely be plenty of ways for crafty voters to get around this new requirement. Could you leave a movie playing on the Academy site while you clean your house? Sure. Could you fast-forward through the last hour of a three-and-a-half-hour epic that you don’t want to finish? Probably. Could you say you attended a screening at the Grove AMC when you really didn’t? Seems likely. But if you’re going to go through all that trouble just to game the system, maybe your energy would be better spent actually watching the movies. It’s an honor just to be nominated—but it’s an even bigger honor to have your film literally seen by Academy voters.

    "title": "2025 Was Supposed to Save the Film Industry. What Happened?",
    "article_text": "Maybe the most glaring indicator of a failing year in movies is how we react to its successes. Last weekend,Ryan Coogler’selectrifying vampire movieSinnersopened to big box office numbers in the United States, following a raft of critical praise. It earned an “A” in audience exit scoring, something a horror movie hasn’t achieved in nearly four decades. This would seem to be one of the mostpositive Hollywood stories of the year,an original film coaxing audiences off of their couches and then mightily delivering on what it advertised. And yet, to hear some trade reports tell it, theSinnersvictory comes with a lot of caveats. There is concern about itsbudget, about itsoverseas performance, about arights deal secured by Cooglerthat could spell terrible, horrible, no good things for the future of the industry. People who follow this stuff very closely, day in and day out, have seemed reluctant to embrace the early good news aboutSinners.Part of that could beblamed on bias;Sinnersis a movie very much about Black cultural identity in America, and such films have long been looked at as financial liabilities. But another reason for the pushback may simply be that things have been so awful in the film industry this year that it feels risky to be optimistic at all. How bad? Well, the biggest domestic hit of 2025 is currentlyA Minecraft Movie, a based-on-a-video-game kids action comedy that is not exactly a high-water mark of quality. Next down the list isCaptain America: Brave New World, aleaden and depressing attemptto give the old Marvel Universe a shot of new life. The movie performed okay, far below where it needed to—on some ineffable meter in my head—to make up for its cruddiness. Then there’sthe made-for-TV stylingsofSnow White, a movie no one wanted and no one liked—and not just forstupid, racist, sexist internet reasons. As Marvel slips toward the edge of the cliff, it seems that Disney’s live-action remake model has already fallen off of it. (Though, of course, we’ll see howLilo & Stitchdoes later this year.) To be fair, we knew those movies would probably be bad. But I had high hopes for a new film from Korean masterBong Joon-ho, the sci-fi adventureMickey 17. It sadly proveda grand disappointment, a rehash of past work with a clunky new political message tacked on. Some critics and audiences enjoyed it more than I did, soMickey 17is by no means a total wash. But the movie didn’t exactly seep into the cultural consciousness the way thatParasitedid. Horror—of the varietal that’s far cheaper to produce thanSinners—has become a reliable place to turn to for a buzzy taste of the zeitgeist, but what have we gotten this year?Heart Eyes,Wolf Man,Presence(interesting, but little seen),The Monkey,Death of a Unicorn(only horror-adjacent), and the execrable Sundance dudOpus. All came and went with a whiff. We’re four months into the year and it almost feels like nothing has come out yet. By this time each year, the beginning of“best movies of the year so far”list season, one can typically turn to international films to make up for the lack of outstanding homegrown fare. This year, it’s a different story. Not counting films that were eligible for last year’s Oscars (and thus last year’s lists) but only opened in a real way in 2025—great films likeHard Truths,I’m Still Here,Vermiglio, and others—there’s been precious little to cling to. That said, seek outOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl, from Zambia, wherever you can. And tryBlack Bag, andBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, and the sprightly comedyOne of Them Dayswhile you’re at it. There have been at least a few worthwhile movies this year, even if nothing lives up to the great redemptive promise of 2025—the thought of which many in the industry were clinging to during the turbulent days of the Hollywood labor strikes, which immediately followed the near-extinction level event that was the pandemic. This was supposed to be the better year, the rebuilding year, and yet, as of late April we’re still wading through the wreckage. That may explain the hesitancy to embraceSinnerstoo soon; once bitten, twice shy, and all that. But while that mindset is understandable, it’s also frustrating. Now may be the time for radical optimism (thank you,Dua Lipa) rather than the kind of cynicism that has come to dominate so many forecasts of Hollywood futures. I’ve no doubt that some big, industry-sustaining sequels are on their way—Jurassic World: Rebirth,Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,Challengers 2: They Actually Do It This Time. (I might have made one of those up.) But I’m more eager to see howSinnerscontinues to perform; ifJoseph Kosinski’sF1will be a sturdy follow-up toTop Gun: Maverick; if Pixar can launch another successful original film withElio; if the Stephen King adaptationThe Life of Chuckwill work as sentimental summer counterprogramming. It’s fun and refreshing to be a little hopeful after several dark months. The alternative is pessimism that only feeds into the creativity-averse ethos seemingly shared by many current studio executives and their acolytes, including those in the media. Who knows what wonders will begin their journey to American theaters in Cannes next month, or what the big Labor Day film festivals will send our way. Maybe the theater-owner survival slogan coined during the strikes should be altered. “Stay alive ’til the second half of ’25” doesn’t have quite the same ring, but it’ll do in a pinch.

    "article_text": "There are certain things thatGeorge Clooneyhas lots and lots of: SAG Awards for one, and Golden Globes too. He’s got a few Oscars on the shelf. Plenty of money in the bank. Several real estate holdings. Lots of name recognition, two Sexiest Man Alive titles, and a good amount of pals, it would seem. This man is also someone who seems like he ownsmanysuits, three-piece and otherwise. There’s at least one column in his life that’s totting up to zero, however: Clooney said in aninterview Monday withCBS Morningsthat he and wifeAmal Clooneyhave “never had an argument.” Chatting withrecent space returneeGayle Kingin support of his Broadway debut,Good Night and Good Luck, Clooney gushed about his wife of 10 years and the nearly-8-year-old twins they share, doubling down on that no-fighting statement: “We still haven’t. We’re trying to find something to fight about.” This is a callback to two years ago, whenGeorge and Amal spoke to King in a joint interviewon the same show and revealed that they never bicker. “It’s maddening to some of our friends,” Amal said. “I have a cousin actually, every time we see him his first question is, ‘So, have you had an argument yet?’ Like, before he says hello.” She attributed their harmony mostly to luck and a lack of cynicism. There’s also the fact that Amal is a globally renowned human rights lawyer: Maybe she’s just very,verygood at work-life balance and doesn’t argue off the clock. This week, George had his own thoughts about what makes his marriage so smooth. “I think because I started so late with Amal,” he said. The two married when Clooney was 53, un-confirming his longtime bachelor status. “I feel so extraordinarily lucky to have met this incredible woman, and I feel as if I hit the jackpot. There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t think I’m the luckiest man in the world.” His chill, not-gonna-argue-with-you nature seems to extend beyond his personal life: In response to King bringing upDonald Trump’s recent attempted jab ofcalling him a “second-rate movie star”on social media, George just laughed and shrugged. “That’s true!” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "title": "Alex Soros Has Thoughts on Dems' 2028 Prospects, Elon Musk, and “Anti-American” JD Vance",
    "article_text": "Alex Soroshas a long — long — list of Democrats he’d like to see run for office in 2028. “Josh Shapirois great.AOCis great. You know,Raphael Warnockis great. You know,Gretchen Whitmeris great. I mean, I likeTim Walz.Chris Murphy.Brian Schatz. Like, these guys are great,” hetoldNew York Magazinein a sweeping new profile. As the son of the liberal billionaire (and rightwing boogeyman)George Soros, Alex’s view on who’s best positioned to lead the fractured party going forward is no small thing. According toNew York, the elder Soros spent $100 million on Democrats in 2024 and hundreds of millions more on causes they care about—money that Alex had no small part in directing as chair of his father’s $20 billion philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, and president of his super-PAC. What is clear from Alex’s conversations withNew Yorkis that he has little time for the post-election day finger-pointing about Democrats moving too far left. “First of all, it’s not smart after an election to go after your base,” he said. “Second of all, you know, the quick takes, the hot takes—let’s see which age well.” Alex argued that his own party was too quick to circle the wagons around forcing former PresidentJoe Bidento bow out of the race after hisdisastrous debate performance. “The fact of the matter is that ifDonald Trumphad gone on that debate stage and, you know, shit his pants and had a heart attack, Republicans would still be there saying, ‘Yeah, he’s our guy,’” he said. “That meltdown that we had publicly is a discipline problem.” If anything, he said, it was staking out progressive issues like police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s murder that helped clinch the 2020 race for Democrats. “The George Floyd protests may have been the reason that Joe Biden won the 2020 election,” he said. “It galvanized people to vote; it’s maybe why we won Georgia.” But Alex didn’t just reserve his fire for naysayers in his own party. He also took aim at MAGA world, recalling howElon Muskused to like his tweets and once suggested they meet up, before blowing him off. “We both used to believe in civil liberties; now, he’s against them. He used to be a believer in climate change; now, he’s against it,” Alex said. He also called out vice presidentJD Vancefor cozying up to the leader of Germany's anti-immigrant party Alternative für Deutschland (Afd) on a visit to Munich, where he snubbed ChancellorOlaf Scholz. \"In my view, Vance is anti-American,” he said. “He’s against America. You know, at least the America that defeated Hitler, the America that desegregated.” The story is laden with other juicy palace intrigue about how 39-year-old Alex wound up taking the reins of Open Society, rather than his older brotherJonathan Soros.

    "title": "Pete Hegseth Gets a Pass and a Back-Pat From Friends on Fox",
    "article_text": "You remember what it was like being a rookie at work—how you dropped that whole tray of fries in front of your manager and accidentally locked yourself in the stock room? Well, according to his old pals atFox & Friends, that’s kind of like what Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethis going through. Except, instead of, say, mixing together the wrong froyo flavors, he may have kind of, sort of texted sensitive military strike plans to people he wasn’t supposed to in unauthorized Signal group chats—twice. On Tuesday morning, hostBrian Kilmeadesuggestedthat Hegseth’s reported use of a private Signal chat to communicate with his wife and others about plans for the March 15 bombing of Yemen might just “be part of a learning curve” for Hegseth. Kilmeade offered up this weak defense in light ofThe New York Times’reportingSunday that Hegseth shared details about the Yemeni strike in yet another Signal chat—this one, wholly separate from the one where he accidentallysharedthe same strike plans with an editor fromThe Atlantic. In writing off Hegseth’s indiscretion as part of a “learning curve,” Kilmeade was obviously trying to cut Hegseth some slack. But it was also an unintentionally savage burn: One good reason not to put TV hosts in charge of the world’s largest military is because they don't know what the hell they're doing. Hegsethjoinedhis old colleagues Tuesday ostensibly to defend himself amid calls from even hisinner circlethat he be fired. But Hegseth instead spent his time blaming “left wing reporters” for spilling the beans about the original Signal chat and alleged leakers who have since been fired from the Pentagon for sharing details about the second. That Hegseth was himself the one who reportedly leaked the details of the military strike, both accidentally and intentionally, to people who had no business being privy to them, apparently wasn’t worth mentioning. Hegseth also claimed to have been targeted by the Deep State within the Pentagon. “They’ve come after me from Day One,” he said, not mentioning that at least one of the officials who was fired,Dan Caldwell, was alongtime Hegseth aidewho worked for him even before he became Secretary of Defense. All three of the fired officials have denied leaking and havesaidthey still have not been told what they’re being investigated for. Hegseth insisted the investigation was still ongoing. “Leaking is not okay in national security policy,” Hegseth told Kilmeade, “and we will stand behind that every day of the week.” But Hegseth apparently didn’t grasp the irony in that statement. While Hegseth has maintained that nothing in his Signal chats was classified information, on Tuesday,NBC Newsreported that, in fact, the strike plan details that Hegseth shared on Signal were first sent to him by the head of U.S. Central Command via a secure government system. According to NBC, Hegseth then turned around and relayed that information in both Signal chats less than 10 minutes after he received it himself. WhilePresident Trumphassaidpublicly that Hegseth is “doing a great job,” NPRreportedMonday that the White House is looking for possible replacements.

    "article_text": "Tina Knowles, the mogul and mother of musiciansBeyoncéandSolange, may have a calendar peppered with glamorous engagements and to-dos, but there’s one routine appointment she wishes she hadn’t missed: A mammogram. Knowles revealed Tuesday that last July doctors discovered two lumps in her left breast. One was benign, the other was stage 1 breast cancer. She was blindsided by the news,she recently toldPeople, and knows now that it may have been caught even earlier if she hadn’t had a scheduling SNAFU due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “I forgot that I didn’t go to get my test two years before I thought I had,” she toldPeople, “because Covid came and they called me and canceled me and they said, we’ll call you when we start testing again. And I just thought I had done it. So you cannot play around with that.” She underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor, as well as a breast reduction, and now feels “great,” describing herself as “cancer-free and incredibly blessed that God allowed me to find it early.” Her daughters and family were, of course, by her side throughout the ordeal. In her memoirMatriarch, which hit shelves April 22, she writes that Beyoncé “took it well, staying positive, and I could already feel her mind racing, focusing on this as a task to tackle with precision.” Solange pledged to “take care of this,” and the two, withKelly Rowlandand Knowles’ niece,Angie Beyincé, both of whom Knowles considers bonus daughters, “became my team.” That team, shetoldCBS Mornings’Gayle Kingin an interviewthat aired Tuesday, was with her as she nervously waited to go into the operating room. Through tears, Knowles described the girls singing the hymn “Walk With Me” over her. “I went in there feeling like you know, God has got me,” Knowles said. Of course, there’s a reason they say that laughter is the best medicine, and Knowles got a dose before the procedure. “All of them showed up in the hospital,” she said. “I was nervous, so they started just joking with me.” Solange played her theviral “very mindful, very demure”TikTok video. “She’s showing me this and we just look at it right before the surgery. I just start laughing. I get out of my head, I just said, I’m so happy you’re all here.” Now that the scary incident is behind her, Knowles is determined to stay healthy and tell her story to remind people “not to slack on” their routine appointments and mammograms. \"I want to show people you can go through that and still be fly,” she toldPeople.

    "title": "Beyond 'Conclave': Five More Movies About Picking a New Pope",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis’s decline in health was painfully apparent for some time, and it was a strange coincidence that his final struggles came soon afterConclave, a drama about theprocess of choosing a new Holy Father,gripped moviegoers and made its mark on awards season. With the pontiff’s death at the age of 88 this week,Conclavebecame the immediate reference pointfor anyone seeking to understand the centuries-old process of electing a new pope. The traditions may be familiar, regardless of your faith: the gathering of cardinals from around the world; the cloistered series of votes beneath the watchful eyes of God and Adam from Michelangelo’s ceiling frescos in the Sistine Chapel; the black smoke from the burning of ballots that indicates no decision, and the white smoke that signals a new head of the Holy See has been selected. Popes have been a source of fascination and drama for as long as the Vatican has existed. InConclave, based on the2016 novelbyRobert Harris, the head of the college of cardinals (Ralph Fiennes) struggles to guide the process toward a morally righteous candidate amid politicking and backstabbing. Although it was a work of fiction, Harris acknowledged drawing inspiration from the effort to replace Pope John Paul II in 2005. “There’s an alleged diary by a cardinal from the conclave that elected [Cardinal Joseph] Ratzinger as Pope Benedict that describes the ballot process and an attempt to try and stop Ratzinger,” he toldTimemagazinelast year. “There was also a great liberal cardinal from Milan who was expected year after year to become the pope. He was always the favorite, but he only came third after the first ballot. That’s theStanley Tuccicharacter in the movie and sets up the human drama, the man who’s waited all his life only for it to slip away from him.” In a 2016 interview withPublisher’s Weekly,Harris explained why this age-old process was so fertile for drama. “A candidate needs two thirds of the votes to be elected. The cardinals are locked into the Sistine Chapel and are required to hold four secret ballots per day until a winner emerges. It is between the ballots, in the lunch breaks and in the evenings, that the politics happens,” he said. “The cardinals gather in one another’s rooms, in the corridors, and in the dining rooms. There are factions. They switch their votes, trying to rally the maximum support behind the candidate who best represents their view. It’s nothing new. This has been going on for seven centuries.” There are many films that feature dynamic tales from the Vatican (1965’sThe Agony and the Ecstasycomes to mind, starring Rex Harrison as Pope Julius II and Charlton Heston as Michelangelo, as they battle over the paintings that will adorn the Sistine Chapel.)Angels and DemonsfindsTom Hanks’sProfessor Robert Langdon at the center of a murderous conspiracy to tamper with the election of a new pope. There are also quite a few TV series based around the Vatican, among themJude Law’stransgressiveThe Young Pope,from 2016. In this roundup, we are sticking to films—and the ones below all share the trait of being about the process ofchoosingthe pope. FilmmakerNanni Moretti’scomedy drama is named after the Latin phrase the Vatican uses when a new pope has been chosen: It literally translates asWe have a pope. Only in the case of this movie, the cardinal who is elected (played byMichel Piccoli) suffers an emotional breakdown just before stepping out on the balcony to greet the thousands assembled in St. Peter’s Square to see him. Cardinals can choose not to be on the ballot. But in Moretti’s film, Cardinal Melville only declares his reluctanceafterhe’s been elected. Resisting at that point would seem to defy the will of God, but the new pope is gripped by doubts and overwhelmed by his new responsibilities. Moretti himself costars as the psychoanalyst who is brought in to help restore the holy man’s faith—if only in himself. Moretti himself is not religious, but he saw the movie as a playful way to explore how intimidating it can be to do the right thing. “[Spanish filmmaker Luis] Buñuel used to say, ‘Thanks to God, I am an atheist.’ But that’s not the case with me. I’m very sorry I’m not a believer,” Morettitold reportersat Cannes Film Festival whenHabemus Papamdebuted. “I showed my film to numerous faithful, and when the pope says there is need for great changes, everyone applauds, and when he says the world needs a guide, who can provide love and understanding for all, the faithful in my film are full of enthusiasm and very pleased at the thought of this possible change. That’s what I wanted to depict.” More than a half century before Fiennes, Tucci,John Lithgow, andIsabella Rossellinistarred inConclave, another stellar ensemble gathered for this Cold War–infused papal election drama. Anthony Quinn led the cast (which included Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud) as a Ukrainian archbishop who was imprisoned for decades by the Soviet Union, only to be released from his Siberian labor camp as part of a peace deal with Western democracies. After journeying to Rome, he becomes part of a conclave seeking to replace the late pope—and is himself elected, a marked change from the age-old tradition of Italian popes. Directed by Michael Anderson,The Shoes of the Fishermanwas based on a novel, written by Morris L. West in 1963. It was noteworthy for exploring the diplomatic and political dimension of the Holy See and its role in defying the communist dictatorships controlled by the Soviet Union. The story presaged the 1978 election of a Polish pope, John Paul II, whose home country was among those ruled by the Soviets and whose tenure was marked by his efforts topush backagainst that authoritarian rule. Quinn’s fictional Pope Kiril also demystified the role of pope to emphasize the man beneath the cassock, vestments, and ornate regalia. “Some of the people on the film seemed afraid of having a pope who was human,” Quinn said in an on-set interview in 1967. “The other day, in a scene, I expressed anger and, even though it was appropriate, it startled the people who were watching. Well, my best ally turned out to be the monsignor who was our adviser on ritual and who works with the present pope. He found it perfectly natural.\" Historians now consider this story to bemore legendthan fact, but a woman was said to have sat on the papal throne for years during the early Middle Ages, when there were divisions among the Roman Catholic factions. First mentions of her only date back to the 1200s and are now regarded as spurious rumors meant to mock and belittle the church. But the lack of historical record gave authors and screenwriters latitude to imagine their own versions of events. Pope Joan has generated numerous books, novels, and films over the years. This particular movie starredLiv Ullmannin the title role, a young woman of sincere faith who disguises herself as a monk and makes her way to Rome, having survived all of the degradation and abuse that medieval times could foist upon a woman. In the guise of a holy man, however, she is safe—and her ability to connect the faithful with the teachings of Christ allow her to rise in the ranks of the Holy See and eventually become elected pope herself. Following the legends, she is only exposed when the cardinals discover that she is pregnant. The movie costarred Oscar winners Olivia de Havilland as a fiery Mother Superior and Maximilian Schell as an amorous monk, as well as Italian cowboy starFranco Neroas the royal descendant of emperor Charlemagne. The film (also directed byTheShoes of the Fisherman’s Anderson) embraced its less-than-authentic origins by framing the story as the hallucination of a modern evangelical preacher, who is working through her traumas by imagining herself as Pope Joan. The result was lambasted by critics and was subsequently re-edited to become a more straightforward historical drama, excising all the present-day therapy sequences. The National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures was expected to lambast the film as sacrilegious but, surprisingly, gavePope Joana form of absolution: It found the movie too silly to be harmful to the faith. From the office’s review: “We become tempted to quibble over such historical inaccuracies and anachronism… Olivia de Havilland’s Mother Superior complete with plucked eyebrows, or the polyphony of the Sistine choir, which, in a better film, we might overlook.” It’s virtually unheard of for a pope to meet another pope, since new pontiffs are only chosen after the previous one dies. But in 2013, after only eight years in the papacy, Pope Benedict XVI decided to step down, clearing a path for the new pope, the now late Francis, to replace him. This film, starringAnthony Hopkinsas Benedict andJonathan Pryceas Francis, explored what their personal conversations may have been. ScreenwriterAnthony McCarten(who later wrote the Freddie Mercury biopicBohemian Rhapsody) adapted his own stage play for the film. He drew inspiration from various speeches and statements the men had made over the years to craft a story in which they debate their disparate philosophies and the evolving position of the church itself. “I imagined this was built around a double confession by these two popes. And they were monologues, and they remain monologues in the play, but when you do a movie, the resources were there to be able to actually turn these into flashbacks,” hetoldVanity Fairin 2019. Pryce spoke about the transformational influence of Francis, who was praised for liberalizing church policies on many issues. “The person who created this religion was a highly political figure and seen as a very dangerous figure by the establishment of that time. I’m talking about Christ, obviously,” Pryce once toldVanity Fair. “What he was saying and doing, certainly, what he was saying was very similar to what the message of the film is, which is to care for your fellow man, to have empathy and sympathy, to take care of the dispossessed and the poor.” Okay, most pope stories are heavy tales, rife with high emotion and deep meaning. This one is not that. It’s utterly ridiculous. But who says the pope can’t have a laugh? (Or take a joke?) Robbie Coltrane, now best known as Hagrid from theHarry Potterfilms, starred as a fun-loving parish priest who doesn’t take the vow of celibacy very seriously, rocks out to Guns ‘n’ Roses, and accidentally stumbles into the leadership role due to a ballot error during a Vatican conclave. No, it doesn’t make sense, but remember whenJohn Goodmanbecame the sovereign ruler of England inKing Ralph?Same kind of deal. Just go with it. So, the pope is a slob, but he means well. He discovers the Mafia has infiltrated the Vatican and is using it for gun running and other criminal enterprises, which puts a literal target on his mitre. The party-down pope is marked for death, which triggered a real-world controversy, so the film was retitledThe Pope Must Diet, out of concerns the title advocated violence. (On posters, the added letter looked more like a crucifix than a letter.) “There’s a lot of thickos who will take it in the wrong way,” Coltrane said inThe Independentat the time. “But anyone who sees it as an attack on Catholicism is being paranoid and perhaps feeling a bit guilty about something.” Despite the church’s stance againstThe Pope Must Die(t), Coltrane maintained that John Paul II should watch it. “I think the pope seems quite a jolly fellow,” Coltrane said. “He might enjoy it.” HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife,Jennifer Rauchet?

    "article_text": "Prince Williamwill attendPope Francis’s funeralon behalf ofKing Charles, Kensington Palace confirmed on Tuesday. The Prince of Wales will join world leaders, includingPresident Donald TrumpandUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, at the funeral service at St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican on Saturday. King Charles,the last head of state to have an audience with Pope Francis, will not travel to the Vatican, in accordance with protocol and precedence which dictates that the Sovereign does not attend funerals, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. The attendance of Prince William alongside world leaders highlights the vital role he plays as heir. When Pope John Paul II died in April 2005, Charles andQueen Camilla’s wedding was delayed as Charles was required to attend in place of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. King Charles and Queen Camillavisited the late Pope during their tour of Italy two weeks ago. The meeting took place at Casa Santa Maria, wherePope Francis died on Easter Monday morning. Charles and Camilla were celebrating their 20thwedding anniversary and received a gift from the Pope during the private meeting. King Charles has spoken of the “devastating” loss of Pope Francis and said that he and Queen Camilla “remember with particular affection their meetings” with the Pope over the years and “were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month.” As a mark of respect for the pontiff, flags were flown at half-mast at palaces around the country. Pope Francis died on Monday at age 88, as the result of a stroke. A month earlier, he had been hospitalized for five weeks while being treated for double pneumonia. On Easter Sunday, the pontiff had appeared to greet crowds and was driven around St Peter’s Square, where he was cheered on by thousands of well-wishers.

    "title": "Meghan Markle Nixed the Name American Riviera Orchard Because It Sounded Like “Word Salad”",
    "article_text": "WhenMeghan Markleannouncedin Februarythat her new lifestyle brand would change its name from “American Rivera Orchard” to As Ever, she mentioned that she first filed a trademark for As Ever in 2022 to use as a potential option. In a new episode of her Lemonada Media podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder,the Duchess of Sussex explained the process behind changing the brand's original name, inspired by a common nickname for Santa Barbara, which started when Netflix came on as her business partner. “I had secured As Ever as a name in 2022,” she told her guest,hair coloristKadi Lee,adding that she went back to it when “everything started to evolve last year” because she had partnered with a large company. She originally wanted American Riviera to be the broader brand, with “Orchard” being one of a handful ofsales verticals. “Maybe have the ‘orchard’ be really small,” she said. “When that’s not feasible, the name suddenly became this word salad. I didn’t love that so much.” She said that the change to As Ever helped her have some privacy as she developed her company’s products. “We were able to focus in the quiet and put our heads down and build on something that no one was sniffing around to even see about,” she said. “Which is really, really helpful—to have that quiet period.” Though Meghan didn’t specify in the episode, she said in February that she worried the “American Riviera” name would limit her to products made in the area. In addition, the duchessreportedlyexperienced challenges due to the difficulties of securing a trademark associated with a location. Lee, the beauty expert and co-founder of the salon and haircare line Highbrow Hippie, also does Meghan’s hair color. In their conversation forConfessions of a Female Founder,Meghan said they first met after a pandemic-era attempt to dye her hair at home went poorly, and hairstylistSerge Normantsuggested Lee. “Because it was the pandemic, I kept ordering boxed hair dye. I thought, I’m going to look just like she does on the box,” Meghan said. “Instead, it was this very inky, almostElvira-esque black hair. I had texted Serge and he said, you need to see Kadi. You came over. We were masked and all the things.” Lee also remembered meetingPrince Harrythat day in 2020, using “H,” the nickname that Meghan and her friends often use for him. “It's so vivid in my memory too. So much was happening that day with LA in general, and the city, and the protests,” Lee said. “You were so warm and both you and H wrapped us up in these big bear hugs. I was like, I don't even know these people and I'm not a hugger. But let's do it because I think everyone was just so, just needed this exhale of, okay, it's going to be okay, but what now?” In the episode, they discussed Lee’s journey from being an amateur hairstylist during her days as a student at Spelman College to launching her own business, and Meghan mentioned that she has been busy with her own new projects, including the podcast,As Ever, and her Netflix series,With Love, Meghan.“I’m doing the podcast right now, the show, and the brand,” she said. “That's three launches at the same time. It’s a lot of moving pieces, but it’s also energizing.\" In response, Lee praised her skills as a businessperson and hostess. “I look at what’s coming up for you and it all makes complete sense because nobody entertains like Meghan,” she said. “Everything is just beautiful and intentional and thoughtful, and that’s why you’re not gonna lose.

    "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio Was a Big Pope Francis Guy",
    "article_text": "After thedeath of Pope Francis, tributes have emerged from world leaders and celebrities—including oneLeonardo DiCaprio,who recalled his “deeply moving”2016 meetingwith the late leader onInstagram. “Pope Francis was a transformational leader — not only for the Catholic Church, but also for environmental reform and activism,” wrote DiCaprio, who has been on alifelong climate crusadesince establishing his eponymousfoundationin 1998. “He demonstrated a deep and unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship, most notably through his groundbreaking 2015 encyclical Laudato Si’.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The Oscar winner was referring to an environment-focusedencyclical letterFrancis wrote and released—a “powerful document” that “served as a clarion call for a fundamental shift in how we relate to the planet,” DiCaprio wrote. “Emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life, Pope Francis urged individuals, communities, institutions, and world leaders to unite in caring for our common home. His words helped catalyze momentum ahead of the global 2015 COP21 conference, ultimately contributing to the formation of the Paris Agreement.” The 50-year-old actor met with Francis back in 2016 to discuss the urgency of climate change for the National Geographic documentaryBefore the Flood,produced by DiCaprio and released later that year. During their visit, DiCaprio reportedly spoke Italian and gifted the pope a book of art. “That experience was enlightening, deeply moving and thought provoking,” DiCaprio wrote on Monday. “Pope Francis was one of the most extraordinary spiritual leaders of our time,” he went on. “His legacy will continue to inspire generations of environmentalists around the world. May he rest in peace.” DiCaprio’s frequent collaboratorMartin Scorsese,who hadmultiple meetingsof his own with the pope, also remembered Francis after his passing, tellingVariety:“The loss for me runs deep—I was lucky enough to know him, and I will miss his presence and his warmth. The loss for the world is immense. But he left a light behind, and it can never be extinguished.” The acclaimed filmmaker has made multiple movies centering on themes of religion, including 1988’sThe Last Temptation of Christ,starringWillem Dafoe,and 2016’sSilence,featuringAndrew GarfieldandAdam Driver.Following a 2023 meeting with the pope, Scorsesesaidhe intended to make another biblical film. “I have responded to the pope’s appeal to artists in the only way I know how: by imagining and writing a screenplay for a film about Jesus,” Scorsese said at the time. “And I’m about to start making it.” Scorsese toldtheLos Angeles Timeslast year that the project would be an adaptation ofA Life of Jesus,another book bySilenceauthor Shūsaku Endō.

    "title": "‘Sinners’ Should Be a Major Player at the Oscars. Will It Be?",
    "article_text": "In a sense,Ryan CooglerandMichael B. Jordanhave been here before. Their first studio collaboration,Creed,hit theaters under great scrutiny nearly a decade ago, before outperforming expectations both with critics and at the box office. The boxing film marked a pivotal turning point aftera series of flopsfor its distributor, Warner Bros., and thrillingly showcased Coogler’s big-scale filmmaking chops as well as Jordan’s leading man bona fides. The buzz around the movie, a reimagining of theRockyfranchise, was so good that awards chatterswiftly followed—before just as swiftly petering out. The movie only received one Oscar nomination, forSylvester Stallone’s moving performance as an aged Rocky Balboa. Mind you, this was at the height of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy—and in a year with a best-actor field, at least, that hasn’t aged too well. (Not evenDanish GirlnomineeEddie Redmaynewould disagree.) Sinners,the number one movie in America this weekend, was also directed by Coogler, with Jordan as its star, and distributed by Warner Bros. In an even more impressive accomplishment, the film pulled off the largest opening-weekend haul for any original movie since the pandemic. As millions flocked to theaters around the world to catch Coogler’s rousing Southern vampire tale, one question started coming up in my conversations with fans and strategists alike: Is there awards potential here? More specifically, does this movie’s commercial success—and, based on that eye-catching ‘A’ CinemaScore, likely long theatrical tail—improve its chances? I’d argue it should. The merits of the film, as my colleagueRichard Lawsonthoroughly laid outin his review, are clear and worthy.Sinnershas several Oscar-winning Coogler regulars, such as costume designerRuth E. Carterand composerLudwig Göransson,operating not only at the top of their game, but also in completely new modes of their craft. The movie’s centerpiece, that showstopping juke joint dance that collapses centuries of history into one joyous expression, is one of the most striking sequences of Coogler’s career. And thewhole ensembledoes richly distinctive work. But the Oscars are also about narratives, and what contenders say about their industry. In that regard,Sinnershas a hell of a story to tell. Let’s start with Coogler, an Oscar nominee for best picture (Judas and the Black Messiah) and best original song (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever). (Black Pantherwas also nominated for best picture, but Coogler did not produce that film.) Among his generation’s filmmakers, Coogler has a track record that is unmatched, between his critically lauded independent breakout (Fruitvale Station), his brilliant remixes of iconic franchises, and now his first truly original feature.Sinnersis a major, complex piece of art that’s both thoughtful and entertaining. Just as fascinating is the deal Coogler negotiated to make the film, which will see him own the rights to the project after 25 years pass; the move generated plenty of debate, but speaks powerfully toSinners’ exploration of ownership, Black art, and the establishment. The film would be a fitting choice for Coogler’s first best-director nod. Jordan was always something of a long shot to be nominated forCreed.He came closer to getting his first Oscar nomination after appearing inBlack Panther,in which he portrayed Erik Killmonger, one of the great Marvel Cinematic Universe villains. Jordan received a Critics Choice nomination for that performance, as well as numerous other mentions from precursor groups. He ultimately missed out on breaking the Oscars’ curse around comic book movie performances—Angela Bassettlater got a nomination for Coogler’sBlack Panthersequel, though she did not win—and hasn’t been in the conversation again since. But Jordan is also one of Hollywood’s most proven leading men under 40, with several dynamic performances under his belt. And his showing inSinnersis arguably his finest work—sexy, scary, and utterly commanding. Oh, and he plays twins. In Jordan’s hands, the idea never turns into a gimmick. Though she’s one ofSinners’ youngest cast members,Hailee Steinfeldis the only Oscar-nominated actor in the film. She’s terrific, as are the movie’s other female leads; you’ve got standouts inWunmi Mosaku,who’s admittedly more overdue on the Emmy side—LokiandLovecraft Countryalone!—andLi Jun Li,who managed to make an impression in the star-studdedBabylona few years back. But in addition to talk about Coogler and Jordan, one narrative demands particular attention this season: that ofDelroy Lindo. Lindo is an industry icon—an indispensable through line inSpike Lee’s filmography and a scene-stealer in award-winning films such asGet ShortyandThe Cider House Rules.His snub a few years ago for histowering turnas a Vietnam War vet in Lee’sDa 5 Bloodsremains, in this writer’s opinion, one of the most outrageous oversights in recent memory. It’s absurd that he’s never been nominated at the Academy Awards. InSinners,Lindo plays elder blues musician Delta Slim with equal parts wit and melancholy, before nailing one of the film’s most devastating monologues. It’s a firmly supporting part, but the kind that, with the right packaging, could finally get him over the finish line. With the Oscars, packaging is always key. It’s why campaigns run for months, with strategists tinkering with their messaging at every beat along the way.Sinnersevolves into a hard genre movie, but that hasn’t stopped other gory hits backed by big ideas, likeGet OutorThe Substance.Its spring drop means it’ll have to stick around in the minds of voters for nearly a year, butEverything Everywhere All at OnceandDune: Part Twojust proved how that can be possible. Still, these remain real hurdles, and Coogler and Jordan know all too well that the Academy doesn’t always care about critical and commercial success. You can go all the way back to their debut collaboration,Fruitvale Station,for the pair’s first example of a great film that didn’t go the awards distance despite initial hopes. But withSinnersappearing primed to easily cross $100 million domestically, it would surely be one of the year’s highest-grossing best-picture nominees.Sinnersis a movie not based on any IP, not expanding upon any cinematic universe, and that’s a story Hollywood just might want to get behind.

    "title": "How the Next Pope Will Be Chosen: Inside the Phases of the Conclave",
    "article_text": "On Sunday, April 6,Pope Francisappeared in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican to the surprise of the more than 20,000 faithful who were following the Sunday Mass in the capital of Catholicism. Absent there since January, hospitalized for several weeks with various health and mobility problems in recent years, his arrival in a wheelchair—pushed by his “savior,” his inseparable personal nurse,Massimiliano Strappetti—was his first public display since March. With a trickle of voice and weak movements, the pope wished a happy Sunday, in Italian, to those gathered, and thanked them for their presence: “Grazie a tutti!”—the same formula he had used a couple of weeks earlier from the balcony of the Gemelli, the “hospital of the popes” in Rome. Since his release, after 38 days hospitalized for a respiratory condition that caused fears for his life, the effects of which were still visible in the oxygen cannulas that the pontiff wore, the Vatican had only distributed a photograph of him with his back turned, a “proof of life” with which the Holy See had affirmed that Francis, born Jose Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires in 1936, was back to work, removing any trace of doubt. Sick, weak, and convalescing, the pope was still the pope. And he himself was in charge of reminding others of it in the homily he had written that Sunday, read byArchbishopRino Fisichella—the usual substitute in his absence. There, in a defense of the sick, among whom he included himself, he demanded not to relegate “the fragile far from our lives, as, unfortunately, a certain type of mentality sometimes does today.” But his health during those weeks—highlighted by press releases from the Holy See, which published twice-daily and meticulously detailed updates on his condition, even including whether the pontiff had slept well or sat in an armchair, coupled with the precedent ofBenedict XVI, who abdicated in 2013, becoming the first pope in six centuries to refuse to die on the papal seat—left half the world, or at least the 1.375 million Catholics who exist today, with visions of white smoke and conclaves: that unique way the Vatican has had to elect its rulers for eight centuries. These visions became reality in the early morning of Monday, April 21, a few hours after Francis, his voice reduced, gave the Easter Sunday blessing,urbi et orbi—“to the city and to the world.” In addition to the influence of films like theOscar-winningConclave(Edward Berger,2024) or series likeThe Young Pope,(Paolo Sorrentino,2016), our century had already lived through two conclaves, and Francis himself was aware that his earthly time was limited: In 2024, for example, he dedicated himself to removing pomp and ritual from the funeral rites of the popes. His death was a sign of normality, because neither the Vatican nor the Catholic Church wanted him to step aside. The pope did not want to either, as he had made clear on several occasions. As long as his mind did not fail, he said, everything else was acceptable or bearable. On the contrary, the abdication of his predecessor, Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger), did not sit entirely well with the episcopate 12 years ago when, in February 2013, he made “a decision of great importance for the life of the Church,” as Pope Benedict himself defined it. The man who had been one of John Paul II’s most trusted men endured eight years as pope until he declared, God willing, that he did not have the strength to continue. To do the work of the pope, Benedict XVI said, “it is also necessary to have the vigor of both body and spirit, a vigor that in recent months has diminished in me to such an extent that I have to recognize my inability to exercise.” Ratzinger, who would spend more time as pope emeritus than as pope, was then 85 years old, three years younger than Francis. Both Benedict XVI and Francis lived their pontificates under the shadow of the very popular John Paul II. The most recent pope was, at 88, one of the longest-living popes of all time. In fact, he has been the longest-living of the last centuries, with the exception of Leo XIII, who died in 1903 at the age of 93. Although he is not a bad example: His last years of pontificate were full of reforms and activity. But being a pope in recent decades is not the same as being a pope in the early 20th century. Not only has the world changed inside and outside the Vatican, but so has the very way of executing the role of pope. Today, even though the impact of the popes already transcends their faith, and their figures are expected to be a world reference even beyond their faithful, the Vatican remains one of the strangest countries in the world. From its very conception, its only reason for being a country has been to provide a state (Vatican City) that hosts the institution that governs the Catholic Church (the Holy See). It has no constitution, but it does have a fundamental law that starts by making things clear from the beginning: The pope is an absolute monarch who rules as “sovereign of the Vatican City State.” He has full legislative, executive, and judicial powers.” The pope is “sovereign of the Vatican City State,” and in his figure are concentrated “the plenitude of legislative, executive, and judicial powers.” In addition to his responsibility to those 1,375 million Catholic souls and his duties as bishop of Rome, the pope, head of state, rules over one of the smallest micronations on the planet: 44 walled hectares, erected from the Roman cemetery in which St. Peter would be buried, located on the right bank of the Tiber, on a hill opposite the seven hills of classical Rome, from which it receives its name. It is one of the least-populated: It has only 673 citizens, of whom just over 450 reside in the Vatican. A quarter of these are soldiers, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, who receive temporary citizenship for the duration of their service and who directly defend the pope, not the state. The rest work abroad, mainly in diplomatic missions. It is the only country that has just one demographic column, the one that shows deaths, because no one can be born a Vatican citizen, only acquire citizenship, and always on a temporary basis, for the duration of their mission or service. It is also possibly the only country in the world in which—“at present,” according to the Vatican itself—there are no pets. The strangeness does not end there. It has no official language (Latin is the language of the Holy See, not of Vatican City), but it does have its own currency. It was formerly the Vatican lira, but since 2002, it’s been the euro, which it can use despite not being part of the European Union. The faces of the three sitting pontiffs since 2002 adorn the currency. The Vatican also has a unique diplomatic body: the apostolic nuncios, who serve as ambassadors to a particular country and act as diplomats to the churches of each nation. There are no hospitals in the Vatican, but there are some 3,500 external workers—a third of which are women. Giving more say to women, both in the secular and episcopal spheres, is one of the milestones that Francis’s pontificate boasted the most. Among these workers there are also some 150 members of the Gendarmerie, the Vatican police, whose commander receives citizenship and holds the rank of prefect, which is more or less equivalent to that of minister. This division between the Vatican and the Holy See serves another purpose: Although he has power, the pope does not govern the state. However tiny it may be, earthly and day-to-day affairs would consume the real mission of the pontiff. These fall on the Vatican secretary of state, who serves as a sort of prime minister. The post has been held by the ItalianPietro Parolinsince 2013. A diplomat of the Holy See since the age of 31, seasoned on three continents and with several services as deputy secretary of the Vatican on missions, he was the most logical choice when his predecessor retired in 2013, when Francis was already serving as pope. He was named cardinal a few months later and has just turned 70. Two other secretaries depend on Parolin, whose main mission is to translate encyclicals and other papal texts into policy: the one for general affairs (who is currently an interim) for internal matters, and the British cardinalPaul Richard Gallagher,secretary for relations with states, who could be seen as a foreign minister, one of the most important positions in a country that can be considered a diplomatic superpower. A diplomacy with centuries of experience, but which has had to be transformed with the passage of time, the stature of today’s Vatican is a shadow of what once were the mighty Papal States: large portions of land of what we now call Italy at the service of the popes and their “courts.” Defended not by 150 soldiers but by armies of thousands of men, cavalry, and artillery units under the command of the captain general of the Church—an office that traditionally used to go to the nephew, grandson, or brother of the pope. For a millennium, the Vatican was a European force to be reckoned with, with enough power to maintain its status as arbiter of the European monarchies. From there also comes the image of games and power play that surrounds the Vatican today: The fame of the Vatican comes from tradition, but the present Vatican is a concession of 1929, a gift from Mussolini to Pius XI restoring the status of nation to the papacy, which had been left with nothing in the 19th century, after capitulating first to France and then to the newly unified Italy. Today’s Vatican has only the physical symbols of what it was as a nation. John Paul II, who was not Italian, was not well received by the Vatican. His response? To travel more than a million kilometers beyond its walls. Something similar has been happening to the Holy See for half a century. The image of that curia of intrigues has been moving away from reality, little by little, since 1978. The culprit? “John Paul II, who was very badly received for not being Italian [Karol Wojtylawas Polish] in a Vatican that believed itself to be the center of the Church,” according to journalist and writerJuan Vicente Boo,one of the best connoisseurs of the country. The author of essential titles such asDeciphering the Vatican: From Inside and Out(Espasa, 2021), a book that opens with the words of Francis to Boo during one of the pope’s trips: “How do you explain the world inside the Vatican?Idon’t even know!” This was one of many exchanges the pope had with the one who was Vatican correspondent for 23 years forABC,a role that began as an accident, when John Paul II’s health failed in 1998 and the seasoned journalist, an expert in defense and international issues, was “asked to go there for a few months to cover the relay.” But the Polish pope, who had even lost his speech, like Francis in his last days, would recover and make it to 2005: “You never know how the health of a pontiff will evolve.” For almost two centuries, popes did not leave Italy, but John Paul II took the papacy out of the Vatican and turned the world into his parish. Health problems aside, John Paul II was already a global pope by 1998. He was a geopolitical figure who had been key in the last decade of the Cold War, an indefatigable traveler, and he took the figure of the head of the Church everywhere, from the podium of the United Nations to the farthest corners of the planet. And that was the key: As soon as he was elected, this pope, whom the curia did not take seriously, became the traveling pope—the one who crossed practically the whole world in endless tours, with more than 100 trips outside Italy. While popes usually did not leave Italy, John Paul II travelled more than a million kilometers. To give us an idea, Paul VI, one of the three popes of 1978 (he was succeeded by John Paul I, who had a heart attack after 33 days and was succeded by Wojtyla), was called “the pilgrim pope” for having made nine international trips in 15 years of papacy—and for being the first pope to leave Italy since the beginning of the 19th century, of course. John Paul II knew perfectly well who he had to convince of his role: everyone outside of those 44 walled hectares, absorbed in their own history. “Francis appointed lay people and women to positions of responsibility” that had only been held by bishops and cardinals. “It is a complete change of culture in the Vatican.” Incidentally, during those trips, John Paul II gained the unwavering support of the United States—and found personal kinship with Ronald Reagan—in his particular anti-communist crusade. This synergy was literal in some cases: One of the pope’s informal audiences took place during a refueling of his plane in Alaska. All this was taking place at the same time that a profound transformation of the Vatican began, opening doors to the media—a mission entrusted for many years to the Spaniard Joaquín Navarro Valls, one of the architects of the system that lets us known everything about the health of the popes—and turning the internal structure into something more suitable both for a global world and for a pontiff with a charisma out of the ordinary, who wanted to take his message far beyond Catholics, and knew how to do it. The funeral of John Paul II in 2005 was the largest in living memory: Three million people came to Rome, forming lines of up to five kilometers long to bid farewell to the pontiff. The Vatican hosted diplomatic delegations from 169 countries, and the event, which more than two billion people watched on television, became the largest gathering of heads of state this side of a United Nations General Assembly. No one before or since, not even Queen Elizabeth II, has gathered so many international authorities for their funeral. Until the last moment, John Paul II was loved—or at least respected—by everyone. “All this was very intimidating for the cardinal electors, who were coming from a long pontificate and had no experience in conclaves,” says Boo, who lived the process closely. And, of course, after John Paul’s death, “nobody wanted his position. It meant replacing a giant. The choice of Joseph Ratzinger—the most deft of the pope’s confidants, but first and foremost a brilliant theologian, whose main passions were study and writing—was a way for the curia to overcome an insurmountable first hurdle: the task of succeeding the most popular pope in history. Ratzinger, who had officiated at his friend’s funeral, was among those who least wanted the job: He was 78 when he was elected, even though most priests in positions of power in the Vatican have to step down at 75 (although popes can extend their mission), and all he wanted was to retire and devote himself to his pending writings. He had suffered two strokes and had a pacemaker. “He was terrified when he saw that he was being voted in. He was physically exhausted.” The resignation of Benedict XVI, beyond small (aVatileaksthat was given more credibility than it really contained) and large (his inability to deal with the issue of sexual abuse by the clergy, a mission in which Francis had somewhat more success and commitment than his predecessors) scandals, must also be understood as that of a man who accepted a position that no one, not even he, wanted: perhaps the most ungrateful papacy possible, with the mission of replacing one of the protagonists of the history books of the late 20th century. Benedict XVI made 24 trips outside Italy, an average of three per year. In Madrid, in 2011, Spanish-speakers coined him “Benedict XV Palito.” This shows the difference between the impact of Ratzinger, who was always perceived as distant, and that of Wojtyla, with his hard-earned “John Paul II, the whole world loves you.” Two years later, Ratzinger claimed to have “consulted with God” on whether or not to continue, and the answer was no: “From February 28, 2013, at 8 p.m., the See of Rome, the See of St. Peter, will be vacant and a conclave for the election of the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convened by the competent authority.” The vacant seat, calledsede vacanteorapostolica sedes vacans,refers to the interregnum between popes. If the pope dies (or leaves, as in the case of Benedict), absolute power reverts to the College of Cardinals, an institution composed of all the cardinals—an honorary title that can only be granted by the pope and that comes with the possibility of electing popes—whose dean is in charge of convening the conclave in which the new pontiff will be elected. Ratzinger knew this very well because, among other things, it was he who had to convene the 2005 conclave, in which he would be elected pope. On the other hand,conclaveis a beautiful word because it was born solely and exclusively to define these meetings. It comes from the Latincum clave,“with key,” and arose from one of the longest electoral processes ever recorded, papal or otherwise: 34 months of vacancy andpro eligendo Romano Pontifice,back in the 13th century. This was at a time when the Vatican was more the scene of earthly interests than of the redemption of souls, when the cardinals numbered only around 20, three of whom died during the deliberations between 1268 and 1271. And, without a pope, there are no substitutes. In 1274, after the bad electoral ordeal, Pope Gregory X imposed the current rule: All voting cardinals stay under lock and key, and no one leaves until there is no new pope. The world is bigger today, and since the 20th century, the number of cardinals has not stopped growing. For the 2013 conclave, there were more than 200. Although only 117 of them had the power to vote: Those under 80 years of age, whose attendance in Rome is mandatory for the procedure as long as they don’t resign (which was the case for two cardinals in 2013). All can participate in the first part of the process, liturgies aside. “In that ‘pre-conclave,’” explains Boo, who covered both 2013 elections, “there are preparatory deliberations, meetings of all the cardinals present. There, for seven, eight, ten days, as many as they need, they deal with all the issues that seem relevant to them: the problems of the Church, the hopes, the issues or changes that need to be undertaken. And from there, a sketch of the possible candidate emerges.” One of the returning candidates in 2013 was the Jesuit José María Bergoglio, who was among the most-voted after the death of John Paul II (he came second only to Ratzinger). As he packed his bags in his beloved Argentina to go participate in the election, he was already thinking about his return. He wasn’t eager to leave his country, nor was he in the best of physical states: He was 76 years old and had just retired as archbishop. He was also thinking about what his retirement would be like, with a broken back and the orthopedic shoes he had always been forced to wear. Even so, he left convinced that, no matter how long the conclave dragged on, he would be back by Easter—so much so that he bought a return ticket and wrote the homily for Easter Sunday (which fell on March 31 that year). The first part, the cardinal congregation, began on March 4. And after a week of deliberations, it was decided that the conclave as such would begin on March 12. After five ballots, Bergoglio was elected pope. In these voting rounds, traditionally three a day, one can also see the importance of this “sketch,” especially now that the number of cardinals is high: None of the ecclesiastical factions alone is enough to elect a pope—not even an alliance of a few. The white smoke—lactose and a couple of other chemicals added to the burning ballots—only emerges with a two-thirds majority. If there is not a consensus reached, or the leading candidate does not fit the profile sought after deliberations, the process drags on. Since then (and this will remain as one of his legacies), Pope Francis carried out another great internal transformation: He simplified a hierarchy with centuries of rigidity, removing superfluous titles and positions that were previously lifelong. “He turned the Vatican into his executive secretariat,” Boo explains. “Before, priests who started working in the Holy See saw it as a career, with promotion after promotion, a kind of cult of bureaucracy in itself. And that has now disappeared. Now priests come in, they have a term or two of five years each, and they go back. If you add to that the change in the hierarchy, where now everyone is equal, and which has appointed lay people and women to positions of responsibility, it’s a complete change of culture.” The latest of these appointees is the nunSimona Brambilla,prefect of one of the dicasteries (the departments into which the Vatican structure is divided), a position that before Francis’s pontificate had only been held by archbishops or cardinals. A more agile and transparent Vatican for a pope whose intention was to be a missionary. Francis was not as well-traveled as John Paul II—who was under 60 when he was elected, for one thing—but he decided to dedicate a good part of his 47 trips abroad to tour the poorest and most troubled countries, even those where the number of Catholics is minimal. In 2017, for example, he visited Myanmar, a country that was then undergoing ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya people, a Muslim minority. The pope denounced the situation from neighboring Bangladesh, while visiting in a refugee camp. In Bangladesh there are approximately 0.3% Catholics. In Myanmar, barely 1%. And among those affected by the forced displacement imposed by the Myanmar regime, it is possible that there were no Catholics at all. His visits, in that sense, are reminiscent of those of John Paul II, who made member countries of the Warsaw Pact, where the influence of the USSR had taken almost all power and legitimacy away from the Catholic Church, one of his main targets. Although the difference is that Francis, a pope in favor of total nuclear disarmament, the fight against climate change, and other ideals not compatible with the reactionary wave sweeping the world, did not count on—nor did he seek—the backing of countries like the United States. Now, the pope who gave impromptu press conferences, who was “joking and friendly” in his travels, and who dismantled a good part of the previous Vatican structures, “has returned to the house of the Father,” as communicated by hiscamerlengo,or chamberlain,Cardinal Farrell.The last trip for a pope who had spent his last weeks in a wheelchair or blessing the faithful from the popemobile, at an age that no “traveling pope” had reached before. He depended on third parties to transmit his voice through his writings. Like John Paul II, he chose to continue until the end; and the cardinals can now take an example from the weight of age and the election of Benedict XVI, who preferred to live a quiet retirement to make way for a more vital pope. Francis’s last days have been gentler than those of John Paul II, who was devoured by Parkinson’s disease until he was left without strength or speech. “His suffering was almost a form of government,” his successor Ratzinger would later recount. Ratzinger was also quoted by Bergoglio in the homily he shared during his return to public appearances, two weeks before his death: “The greatness of humanity is essentially determined by its relationship with suffering.” The quote came into the homily because, “at this moment of my life,” Francis wrote, “I share the experience of illness, of feeling weak, of depending on others for many things, of needing support.” But also of a future in which, he quoted Isaiah, “something new is germinating.” A pope will emerge from a Vatican crafted to the measure of his predecessor, completely different from the one left by those who came before him and with less and less room to turn back. A pope who, between conversations and votes, will have to be chosen by the more than 250 cardinals—149 of them appointed by Francis in the last decade of his pontificate, with hardly any internal resistance—that are part of the Church today.

    "article_text": "For three decades, photographerGuillaume Bonnhas traversed East Africa, documenting how civilization’s quintuple threats of modernity, development, population growth, armed conflict, and climate change have imperiled the region’s wildlife, habitats, and human communities. Some of his most distinctive pictures—originally shot on assignment forVanity Fair—are those depicting camouflage-clad local rangers from game reserves, conservancies, and elsewhere, who risk their lives to combat criminal rings of poachers seeking the valuable horns and tusks of rhinos and elephants. The result is an epic new book,Paradise Inc.,published just in time for Earth Day. Herewith,VFshowcases some of Bonn’s most arresting images, which, in the words of the Maasai elder and peace activistEzekiel Ole Katato,convey the “profound struggle…between humanity and the untamed.” The photographs, often in jarring juxtaposition, underscore the cruel bargain of Western “progress”—and the paradoxical damage brought on by a half century of conservation and preservation efforts. As journalistJon Lee Andersonwrites in his introduction: East Africa, “in all its wondrous beauty and diversity, is a real-life repository for our collective sense of natural perfection, and a glimpse of temporal eternity. Just as determinedly, however, Guillaume wishes us to see the fragility of that paradise, the future of which now hangs in the balance.” —David Friend The reserve is renowned for its stunning wildlife, including the famous Great Migration of wildebeest, zebras, and other animals, as well as its rich population of predators like lions, cheetahs, and leopards.

    "article_text": "Conservancy Association releases findings of three-year study on carbon storage capacity of more than 100 tree species native to Hong Kong Hong Kong’s forests can store more than 7 million tonnes of carbon, equivalent to one-fifth of the city’s annual emissions, according to estimates in a first-of-its-kind local study. The research, which looked at more than 100 native tree species, also found those with the best potential to capture the greenhouse gas, providing data for authorities and private developers when assessing the carbon footprint of their projects. Coinciding with Earth Day on Tuesday, the Conservancy Association released the findings of a three-year study on the carbon storage capacity of more than 100 trees native to Hong Kong. The group’s conservation manager, Dr Angie Ng Ying-sim, said the study could provide more data to assess the effects of green investments for the city’s development, such as projects involving reforestation and forest protection and management for carbon dioxide removal. Ng said Hong Kong had immense potential to create a carbon sink – a natural area which absorbs more carbon than it produces – which could be a nature-based solution to the government’s goal for the city to be carbon neutral by 2050. Woodlands make up a quarter of the city’s 111,900 hectares (276,500 acres) of land, while grassland and shrubland form another third. The effects of a carbon sink can be maximised by planting species that can store more carbon.",

Commissioner for Primary Healthcare Dr Pang Fei-chau also said on Tuesday that the refund policy would be standardised to cover all days. “If the resident seeking medical attention chooses to visit another healthcare institution while waiting at the A&E department, they can apply for a refund,” he wrote in a local newspaper. “When the A&E charge is adjusted to HK$400 (US$52) from January 1, 2026, the refund amount will be HK$350.” He added the government would compile information on the consultation hours and locations of primary healthcare doctors in the community. This information would be accessible to the public through platforms such as the official electronic health record platform, eHealth. Previously, special full refunds at A&E departments were implemented during long holidays to alleviate overcrowding and reduce the strain on public hospitals. Residents could receive a full refund by submitting an application.",

    "title": "Hongkongers with spinal cord injuries may regain mobility with help of new lab",
    "article_text": "New laboratory at Polytechnic University to start clinical trials for advanced therapy products after facility is fully licensed Hongkongers with spinal cord injuries may have a chance to regain mobility with the help of advanced therapy products developed by a new laboratory at Polytechnic University (PolyU), with clinical trials to start as soon as the facility is fully licensed. The scholar in charge of the laboratory said the institution hoped the facility could work in tandem with its proposed medical school to provide a one-stop shop for healthcare, ranging from treatment to rehabilitation, contributing to the city’s push to become a health and medical innovation hub. PolyU is one of three local universities seeking to establish the city’s third medical school. Professor Larry Chow Ming-cheung, head of the university’s applied biology and chemical technology department, said the advanced therapy products (ATPs) laboratory, which will be the third of its kind in Hong Kong once it is fully licensed, would allow patients greater access to cutting-edge treatments. ATPs refer to medicines based on genes, cells or tissue. Examples include chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, which uses the patient’s modified T-cells to attack cancer cells. “Building a production line for ATPs is incredibly expensive for individual companies due to the stringent standards, but our laboratory can essentially attract biopharmaceutical companies to invest in Hong Kong by providing access to a ready-made production facility,” Chow said.",

    "title": "Witkoff expects to meet with Putin – White House",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is heading to Russia for another meeting with President Vladimir Putin later this week, the White House has confirmed. Witkoff has held multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including at least three meetings with Putin, and is seen as one of the architects of the rapprochement between Moscow and Washington during Trump’s second presidency. Russian presidential adviser Yury Ushakov confirmed on Tuesday that reports of Witkoff’s upcoming visit areaccurate. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told journalists later in the day that both Trump and Witkoff“wanted everybody to know that the negotiations continue.” “We feel, again, we are hopefully moving in the right direction, and the special envoy Steve Witkoff will be heading to Russia again later this week to continue talks with Vladimir Putin,”Leavitt said. The White House did not announce Witkoff’s exact travel plans after the Financial Times reported that he would skip a meeting with European and Ukrainian officials to visit Moscow instead. Washington is expected to present its peace framework in London on Wednesday, following a series of high-level meetings in Paris last week, where Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio held discussions with French, UK, German, and Ukrainian officials. Rubio, however, will not attend the latest round of talks due to his“busy”schedule, according to spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Instead, Washington will be represented by General Keith Kellogg, another Trump envoy tasked with direct negotiations with Kiev. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that the US proposals could include formallyrecognizing Crimeaas Russian territory and potentially lifting sanctions on Moscow. Meanwhile, the Financial Times claimed that Russia is prepared to halt the hostilities along the current front lines. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, warned that“a lot of fakesare being published now, including by respected publications,”and urged the public to rely on official sources regarding developments in US-Russia talks on the Ukraine conflict. Russia has stated that any peace deal must address the“root causes”of the conflict, including NATO’s eastward expansion and Kiev’s aspirations to join the US-led bloc. Moscow has also demanded that Kiev recognize not only Crimea, but also the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, along with the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye, as part of Russia.",

    "title": "Germany taps industry to bolster NATO against ‘Russian attack’ – Handelsblatt",
    "article_text": "Germany’s military, the Bundeswehr, has reached out to major logistics and defense companies to prepare for a possible NATO deployment to Eastern Europe“in the event of a Russian attack,”Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday. Several eastern NATO members, especially the Baltic states, have repeatedly alleged that Russia is preparing for an invasion – an accusation that Moscow has consistently denied. The Bundeswehr is reportedly holding confidential discussions with firms including Deutsche Bahn, Lufthansa, and Rheinmetall to secure their support in transporting troops, weapons, and equipment. According to the newspaper, the German Defense Ministry has asked Deutsche Bahn to examine how it could help transport military convoys by rail during a crisis. Meanwhile, Lufthansa is being considered for basic training support for fighter pilots through its flight school. Rheinmetall is already involved in military logistics through a recent €260 million ($300 million) contract and is also in talks to expand its role. This effort forms part of Germany’s strategic role as NATO’s central logistics hub, the outlet reports. Under the military bloc’s new defense framework, Berlin has committed to mobilizing thousands of soldiers and hundreds of aircraft and ships within 30 days if a crisis arises. Defense officials told the newspaper that the Bundeswehr is not able to manage this large-scale mobilization on its own. German military leadership has therefore turned to the private sector to build what they describe as a“strategic deployment corridor”across the country. “The Bundeswehr relies almost exclusively on civilian commercial service providers for the logistical transport of military goods and equipment outside of crisis zones,”the Bundeswehr Operational Command told Handelsblatt.“In sea and air transport for extra-wide and extra-heavy equipment, this figure is even 100 percent.” The initiative comes as Germany seeks to recover from decades of underinvestment in its armed forces, which have left its military ill-prepared for large-scale conflict. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s €100 billion special fund, announced after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, aims to reverse this trend. Germany’s chief of defense staff, General Carsten Breuer, recently stated that the Bundeswehr must be war-ready by 2029 so that it is able to fight Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected allegations that Moscow harbors aggressive intentions toward NATO countries, calling them“nonsense”designed to alarm Western Europeans and legitimize major increases in defense budgets.",

    "title": "US to propose recognizing Crimea as Russian under Ukraine peace deal – WaPo",
    "article_text": "The US will propose a peace deal that involves the recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea and freezing the Ukrainian conflict front lines, at a meeting with officials from Kiev and Western Europe this week, the Washington Post has reported, citing sources. US President Donald Trump’s envoy Keith Kellogg is set to meet foreign ministers and security advisers from France, Germany, the UK and Ukraine in London on Wednesday. Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will reportedly skip the meeting. US proposals, presented to Ukraine in Paris last week, also include Washington eventually lifting sanctions against Moscow under a future accord, people familiar with the matter told the outlet on Tuesday. One Western official reportedly described the pressure on Ukraine as“astounding.” European officials are expected to push for security guarantees for Ukraine and postwar reconstruction efforts, possibly funded in part by frozen Russian assets, the report said. Trump has threatened to walk away from a Ukraine peace initiative if progress is not made soon. He told reporters on Monday that he would be releasing details of the US proposals“over the next three days.” Witkoff, who has had multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, will visit Russia later this week, Moscow has confirmed. According to one of the Post’s sources, it was“Witkoff’s idea”for the US to designate Crimea as Russian“without forcing Ukraine to recognize it.” Crimea held a referendum to join Russia in 2014 following a Western-backed armed coup in Kiev. The new Ukrainian government, along with its Western backers, has refused to recognize the vote’s legitimacy. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has ruled out relinquishing any territorial claims against Russia and has urged the US and other nations to continue providing military aid – a policy the Trump administration has said it will end. Moscow insists that the status of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, and the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia in 2022, is not up for negotiation. Russian officials have emphasized that recognizing the“reality on the ground”is key to achieving lasting peace.",
