    "article_text": "Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian aid organization, is completing a field hospital after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Burma and cost hundreds their lives. (Credit: Samaritan's Purse) As Burma, also known as Myanmar, struggles in the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake,Reverend Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse, praised the swift cooperation of the Burmese government and shared his confidence in a generous U.S. response under President Donald J. Trump. \"America has always been generous,\" Graham told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is not against aid. He supports aid, but he does not support waste,\" Graham continued. \"And that’s what’s happened in some of these cases in the past—our government has wasted too much money. But I think the president will be very generous.\" Graham also reflected on the president’s personal trials. \"I believe God saved his life,\" he said, referencing the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. \"And the president believes that—he says that. So we need to pray for him. There are many people that would like to see harm come to him. So we just need to pray for God’s continued protection and hand onPresident Trump.\"PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VISIT TO NORTH CAROLINA 'GAVE PEOPLE HOPE': REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM Samaritan’s Purse has already begun surgical operations in Naypyidaw, the capital city of Burma, which lies between Yangon and Mandalay and is among the areas most severely impacted. The organization is operating out of a soccer stadium provided by the Burmese government, which has also granted full cooperation, including visa approvals and facility access. Graham reported that Samaritan’s Purse initially deployed 60 beds and two operating theaters. The government contributed an additional 24 beds via medical container units, known as connexes, including one operating room. \"So it was 84 beds and three operating theaters,\" Graham explained. \"The rest of the hospital arrives tomorrow… we should be fully operational by the day after tomorrow.\" A Samaritan’s Purse medical professional prepares for surgery at the organization’s Emergency Field Hospital in Burma. The field hospital includes multiple operating theaters and is providing critical care following a deadly 7.7 magnitude earthquake.(Courtesy of Samaritan's Purse) According to the organization’s official press release, Samaritan’s Purse is establishing afull-scale emergency field hospitalequipped with an emergency room, laboratory, pharmacy, critical care unit, and two permanent operating rooms. Nearly 100 earthquake victims were already waiting for surgery when the team arrived. Graham emphasized urgency: \"Speed is critical after a deadly earthquake like the one that rocked Myanmar,\" he said. \"We praise God that we are already able to provide surgery even while we are still building the full field hospital.\" One of the first patients treated was a woman who shielded her son during a building collapse. \"She covered her son’s body with her body to protect him,\" Graham shared. \"She had problems with her spine. They had to operate on her, and she’s recovering—she’s doing well.\"DONALD TRUMP JR., KRISTI NOEM JOIN FRANKLIN GRAHAM IN HELENE-TORN NORTH CAROLINA WITH SAMARITAN'S PURSE With over3,500 confirmed deathsand thousands more injured or missing, the humanitarian need is immense. \"People are lined up to come in, there’s just no help up there,\" Graham said. \"This is a very poor, very desperate part of the world... It’s going to take years for them to build back. If they can build back, I don’t know.\" Samaritan’s Purse sent more than 104 tons of critical supplies, including six water filtration systems, hygiene kits, emergency shelter material, and solar lights, aboard a 747-cargo plane from Greenville, South Carolina. They currently have more than 80 Disaster Assistance Response Team members in-country, with more arriving soon.

The team lives in tents and works in austere conditions. \"We provide our own accommodations. We have our own water, we have our electricity, we’re self-contained, but it’s a tough assignment,\" Graham said. Still, the team remains committed. \"They’re holding clinics during the day, operating during the night… But our team is motivated. They are excited for the opportunity to serve the people of Myanmar and to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Samaritan’s Purse staff and local volunteers unload emergency relief supplies from trucks in Burma.

This is a very long way from home.\" \"We want every patient to know that God loves them and they are not alone. Please pray for everyone affected and for our Disaster Assistance Response Team as they serve those who are hurting in Jesus’ Name,\" Graham added.Samaritan’s Purse is aChristian humanitarian organizationled by Rev.

    "title": "Senate approves Peter Hoekstra as next US ambassador to Canada",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday blasted some Republican members of Congress for trying to block his powers on instituting tariffs. Canada has a new U.S. ambassador to sort through its strained relations with Washington as the Senate on Wednesday approved PresidentDonald Trump’snomination of Peter Hoekstra in a 60-37 vote. His confirmation as U.S. ambassador to Canada comes at one of the most challenging times in Washington’s long relationship with its northern neighbor after Trump launched a series of tariffs targeting Ottawa and repeatedly claimed he believes Canada should become the U.S.’s 51st state. But despite heightened concerns over Trump’s ambitions for Canada, particularly among Democratic lawmakers,Hoekstra’s Senate confirmationprocess was a relatively smooth road. TRUMP PICKS FORMER CONGRESSMAN PETE HOEKSTRA TO BE AMBASSADOR TO CANADA Peter Hoekstra, President Trump’s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Canada, attends his Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on trade, security and other U.S. interests.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) \"I do have a special appreciation for Canada as a neighbor,\" he told senators at his confirmation hearing last month. Following questions from Delaware Democrat Sen. Christopher Coons, Hoekstra affirmed that \"Canada is a sovereign state.\" However, he declined to comment on the president’s repeated desire to incorporate Canada as the next U.S. state – a proposal Ottawa has consistently rejected. \"How the president and the relationship between the former prime minister in Canada and the characteristics, the nature of that relationship… I don’t know,\" he added. The Michigan lawmaker and former ambassador to the Netherlands during President Trump’s first term referenced his state’s close ties to Canada during his opening remarks last month before theSenate Foreign Relations Committee. \"My home state is connected to Canada by four and soon to be five, bridge crossings along maritime board, across the Great Lakes, vital lakes that drive businesses, jobs and livelihoods in both states,\" Hoekstra highlighted. \"If confirmed, I will work tirelessly to build on that record of cooperation extended, obviously nationally.\" CANADA STARES DOWN CONSEQUENCES OF TRUMP TARIFF WAR: JOB LOSSES, GROCERY PRICE HIKES, POSSIBLE RECESSION A truck with vehicles crosses the Blue Water Bridge border into the United States from Sarnia, Canada on April 3, 2025.(Geoff Robins/AFP via Getty Images) Canada is the U.S.’s largest trading partner and the number one purchaser of U.S. goods. \"I think there’s 36 states that see Canada as their number one trading partner internationally,\" Hoekstra confirmed. The U.S. is also, by far, Canada’s largest trading partner and top purchaser of Canadian goods, but Trump has repeatedly called the relationship \"unfair.\" In 2023, theU.S. importedsome $443 billion worth of goods, accounting for 72% of all Canadian exports, while Canada imported $317 billion U.S. goods, accounting for 49% of Ottawa's total imports.

Additionally, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles and parts, which will also drastically affect Canada as automobiles are a chief export item to the U.S. Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.",

    "title": "Conservative leader Friedrich Merz secures German government coalition after months of political drift",
    "article_text": "American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'Fox & Friends' to analyze the conservative party winning the chancellor election in Germany. Conservative and center-left parties reached a deal to form a new German government on Wednesday after weeks of negotiations, paving the way for new leadership in Europe’s biggest economy after months of political drift. Friedrich Merz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, is expected to become Germany’s next leader under the agreement, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The parties involved sent an invitation to a news conference on the coalition deal at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). Merz’s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany’s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz’s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority. GERMANY'S CONSERVATIVE ELECTION TURN POINTS TO 'TRUMP EFFECT INTERNATIONALLY,' EXPERT SAYS It’s still going to be a little while before parliament can elect Merz as chancellor, perhaps in early May. Before that can happen, the coalition deal will need approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats’ membership and by a convention of Merz’s CDU. Details of the agreement weren’t immediately available. Friedrich Merz is expected to become Germany’s next leader after the center-right Christian Democratic Union and the center-left Social Democrats reached a deal to form a new German government.(Michael Kappeler/dpa via AP) But already last month, the two sides pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that’s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy. That was an about-turn for Merz, whose party had spoken out against running up new debt before the election without entirely closing the door to future changes to Germany's self-imposed \"debt brake.\" The election took place seven months earlier than planned after Scholz’s unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting and widespread discontent. Germany, the 27-nationEuropean Union'smost populous member, has been in political limbo since then. WORLD LEADERS REACT TO TRUMP’S SWEEPING TARIFFS: ‘TUMULTUOUS TIMES’ AHEAD The market turbulence caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs added to pressure for Merz’s Union and the Social Democrats to bring their coalition talks to a conclusion. The tariffs threaten to add to the woes of an export-heavy economy that shrank for the past two years, and generating growth will be a central task for the new government. Increasing doubts about U.S. commitment to European allies also played into the prospective coalition's decision to enable heftier defense spending. Merz said last month thatGermanyand Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \"‘whatever it takes’ must also go for our defense now.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Another factor in the haste to reach an agreement was a decline for the Union in the opinion polls, showing support slipping from its election showing, while the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished a strong second in February, gained as the political vacuum persisted. The prospective new coalition brings together what have been post-World War II Germany’s traditional big parties, but the Union’s election-winning performance in February was lackluster and the Social Democrats dropped to their worst postwar showing in a national parliamentary election. Together, they have 328 seats in the 630-member lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.",

    "article_text": "Dr. Roger Seheult, a critical care physician and pulmonologist, shares his top recommendations for bolstering the immune system. Theflu vaccineis recommended annually for all Americans 6 months and older, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — but a new study from Cleveland Clinic suggests that it might not have the protective effects people expect. The preprint study, which was published on MedRxiv.org this week, looked at infection data for the 2024-2025 flu season. Researchers found that among 53,402 Cleveland Clinic employees in northern Ohio, getting the influenza vaccine was associated with a 27% increase influ infections. BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS — SOME MAY SURPRISE YOU Vaccinated employees were compared to those who did not get the vaccine over a 25-week period. The flu vaccine is recommended annually for all Americans 6 months and older, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \"The influenza vaccine can be highly effective in reducing the severity of illness, preventing hospitalizations, and minimizing thespread of the virus, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the virus strain and individual factors, such as age and underlying health conditions,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. While previous work by these researchers on vaccine effectiveness has been published in major journals, this most recent study is still in the pre-print stage, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed. The researchers noted several limitations of the study, including that \"trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine\" was used in about 99% of the included employees. \"The possibility that other influenza vaccines might have been more effective cannot be excluded,\" they wrote. It is also possible that home testing kits might have missed some infections. \"This study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season,\" the researchers wrote in the study.(iStock) Additionally, the study did not compare the risk of flu-related hospitalizations or deaths, nor did it measure whether the vaccine decreased the severity of illness. The population studied also did not include children and contained very few elderly or immunocompromised individuals, the researchers stated. \"The results do not suggest that vaccination increases the risk of flu,\" Cleveland Clinic stated. \"Instead, the study implies that the effectiveness of this season’s vaccine in preventing influenza may have been limited in relatively healthy healthcare workers.\" Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, reviewed the study findings and said the results are \"misleading.\" \"It is observational, so does not prove that the vaccine doesn’t decrease spread,\" he told Fox News Digital. FOR COLD AND FLU TREATMENTS, DO YOU NEED A PRESCRIPTION OR ARE OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDS GOOD ENOUGH? \"The biggest bias I see is that it is comparing vaccinated healthcare workers (80% are vaccinated against flu) with general population trends, as the study doesn’t take into account thathealthcare workersare more likely to be exposed to flu in their profession, so we would expect the infection rate to be higher, whether vaccinated or not.\" Siegel also said he believes the study misuses the word \"effectiveness.\" The study did not compare the risk of flu-related hospitalizations or deaths, nor did it measure whether the vaccine decreased the severity of illness.(iStock) \"The flu vaccine is intended to decrease severity rather than decrease spread,\" he noted. \"The real yardstick for flu vaccine effectiveness is the rate of hospitalization or visit to a doctor’s office or urgent care, which is usually down by well over 100,000 per year or more due to the vaccine.\" \"The flu vaccine is intended to decrease severity rather than decrease spread.\" This effectiveness varies year to year based on how well the vaccine fits the predominant strain, the doctor added. \"At the same time, the flu vaccine tends to decreaseviral load, which should decrease overall spread within a community.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dr. Jacob Glanville, CEO of Centivax, a San Francisco biotechnology company, echoed that the study has not yet undergone peer review. \"We should await that process, as it will serve to check statistical methods and other study design considerations,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I still tell my patients that a benefit from receiving the flu vaccine is that even though you may get the flu, your case may not be as severe as those who did not receive the flu vaccine,\" one doctor said.(iStock) \"For example, it would be important to rule out reporting avoidance by non-vaccinated Cleveland Clinic employees. Did they have any policies that would discourage non-vaccinated subjects to report illness?\" \"The whole world isaffected by influenza, so if this phenomenon is real, it should also be easily supported by other studies from this season.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Dr. Mike Sevilla, a family physician based in Salem, Ohio, agreed that thehigher rate of infectionsuggests that this year's influenza vaccine was not as effective as hoped. \"I wouldn't think that this is expected. However, in comparing previous years, the effectiveness of the annual flu vaccine can vary widely, from about 10% up to about 60%,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccine can vary widely, from about 10% up to about 60%.\" Sevilla shared that in his office, he did see increased cases of influenza this season, but not necessarily as severe cases. \"I still tell my patients that a benefit from receiving the flu vaccine is that even though you may get the flu, your case may not be as severe as those who did not receive the flu vaccine,\" he said.

    "title": "This weight loss plan performs better than traditional dieting, study finds",
    "article_text": "Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, shares why a low-glycemic index diet is essential for healthy glucose levels and reduced inflammation. The traditional diet of restricting calories is a tried-and-true method forweight loss— but new research reveals that a certain intermittent fasting regimen may be more effective. Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus compared two randomized groups of dieters on their change in weight after a 12-month period. The participants were between 18 and 60 years old with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 to 46, which is considered overweight or obese by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. OBESITY MOST RELEVANT IN THESE 3 SOUTHERN CITIES One group followed daily caloric restriction (DCR) and the other followed4:3 intermittent fasting(IMF), where dieters eat freely four days a week and undergo intense calorie restriction on the remaining three days. Study participants were between 18 and 60 years old with a BMI of 27 to 46, which is considered overweight or obese by the CDC.(iStock) After the year-long study, the intermittent fasters reported an average body weight loss of 7.6%, compared to 5% for the calorie-restricted group. The study, which was published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, concluded that 4:3 IMF resulted in \"modestly greater weight loss\" among adults who areoverweight or obese. FRESH FOOD CONSUMPTION COULD HELP SOLVE DIET-RELATED ILLNESS: EXPERTS In an interview with Fox News Digital, lead study co-authors Danielle Ostendorf and Victoria Catenacci noted the difference between IMF and time-restricted eating (TRE). \"IMF involves cycling between complete or near-complete (over 75%) energy restriction on ‘fast’ days and [as necessary] energy intake on non-fast days,\" they said. \"This study shows that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an effective and safe weight-loss approach.\" \"TRE involves limiting the daily window of food intake to eight to 10 hours or less on most days of the week – for example, 16/8 or 14/10 protocols.\" In the study — which was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the participants had a fast daycalorie goalthat was 80% less than their baseline energy requirements, which equates to about 400 to 600 calories per day for women and 500 to 700 calories for men. On fast days, participants consumed about 400 to 600 calories per day for women and 500 to 700 calories per day for men.(iStock) The three fast days could not be back to back, the researchers noted, and on the four \"non-fast\" days, participants could eat what they wanted without counting calories, but were encouraged to makehealthy choices. \"This study shows that 4:3 intermittent fasting is an effective and safe weight-loss approach and can be considered as an option among the many other evidence-based dietary strategies for adults seeking weight loss,\" said Ostendorf. STUDY REVEALS EXERCISING EVERY DAY MAY NOT BE NECESSARY: ‘BETTER THAN NONE’ In several otherrecent trials, different versions of IMF, such as 5:2, have been tested without any significant difference compared to DCR, the study noted. \"Once we completed our trial, we were actually somewhat surprised to see that our data didn’t align with these prior published studies of IMF versus DCR,\" Ostendorf said. The study concluded that 4:3 IMF resulted in \"modestly greater weight loss\" among adults who are overweight or obese.(iStock) The researchers believe that three-day fasting is the \"sweet spot for an IMF paradigm,\" as it’s not too rigid but still effective. For those interested in trying the 4:3 IMF method, Ostendorf suggests starting with onefasting day— eating about 500 calories — and adding the others over time, allowing the body to acclimate. Participants in both groups met regularly with a registered dietitian, which might not be accessible to all people looking to lose weight, the researcher added. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"All participants in our study received a comprehensive behavioral support program to provide strategies to support them in their weight-loss journeys,\" she added. \"In the 4:3 IMF group, content was tailored to that approach.\" \"[This] likely played a large role, because it provided participants in both groups with support for the randomized dietary paradigm, includingnutrition information, accountability, behavioral change strategies and social support.\" The researchers noted that participants worked with a dietitian to help guide them through their regimen.(iStock) The participants reported that it was easier to eat all their calories in one sitting during fast days instead of spreading them out. For more Health articles, visitfoxnews.com/health \"We recommended that participants stay hydrated withnon-caloric beverages, such as black coffee or sparking flavored waters, throughout the day,\" Ostendorf said. The researchers mentioned that more research is needed into safety for other populations, including children and adolescents, older adults, pregnant women, and people with conditions like diabetes,cardiovascular diseaseor cancer.

    "article_text": "Amanda Harpell-Franz, mother of a 7-year-old boy with autism, shares how the boy's service dog, Kalvin, has helped him socially and emotionally. Having a furry friend can add fun and companionship for anyone — but forchildren with autism, it can be life-changing. A recent study from the University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine evaluated the impact ofservice dogson autistic children and their caregivers in 75 families. Working with nonprofit service dog provider Canine Companions, the researchers found that having a service dog was associated with \"significantly better child sleep behaviors,\" including less sleep anxiety and better sleep initiation and duration. VETERANS WITH PTSD GET ‘SIGNIFICANT’ BENEFITS FROM SERVICE DOGS, FIRST NIH-FUNDED STUDY FINDS In an interview with Fox News Digital, lead researcher Dr. Maggie O’Haire, associate dean of research at the university, said the research was sparked by the growing number of programs that pair service dogs withautistic children. A recent study from the University of Arizona College of Veterinary Medicine evaluated the impact of service dogs on autistic children and their caregivers.(iStock) The sleep improvements are particularly important for the child and the entire family, O’Haire said. Children were able to sleep in their room more independently when the dog was present, the researchers found. SERVICE DOG BY HER SIDE, TEXAS TEEN WINS MISS DALLAS PAGEANT DESPITE EPILEPSY, AUTISM \"The dog provides that source of calm and comfort, which probably reduces the anxiety,\" she said. \"And also, if they wake up a little bit in the night and their service dog is there, they're probably more easily able tofall back to sleepon their own.\" Families also reported experiencing less stigma and judgment and making more positive social connections when out in public with a service dog, according to O'Haire. Washington mom Amanda Harpell-Franz shared that her son, Evan, who has autism, has also enjoyed the many benefits of having a service dog. \"Evan is vibrant, curious, compassionate — he just lights up our lives,\" Harpell-Franz described her 7-year-old son in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"Most people who meet him say there's something about him that is just so endearing and engaging.\" Evan, 7, is pictured with his service dog, Kalvin. Since the family welcomed Kalvin, Evan's mother said he is attending school and extracurricular activities consistently and without struggle.(Canine Companions) \"He’s very active,loves being outside, loves connecting with his friends,\" she said. \"He loves to swim … He’s just a life-giving kid.

The mosaic is on display for the first time since being found. WASHINGTON –The Museum of the Bible (MOTB) in the nation’s capital has opened an exhibit giving visitors a deeper understanding of humankind's journey of seeking truth. Titled \"C. S.

EXCAVATION NEAR SITE WHERE JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED AND BURIED RESULTS IN ANCIENT DISCOVERY \"Letter to Mr. Rooke\" was dated Dec. 8, 1937, several years after Lewis convertedto Christianity. Wesley Viner, associate curator at the museum, told Fox News Digital the letter is part of an ongoing correspondence about thenature of poetry, knowledge and Christianity. A rare letter penned by C.S. Lewis in 1937 is on display at The Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C.(The Museum of the Bible) \"In this particular letter, Lewis describes the vision possessed by certain poets as ‘knowledge in the deepest sense,’ but he rejects the idea that poetry must focus exclusively on ‘great subjects’ like truth, faith or God,\" said Viner. Viner added, \"Instead, he humorously notes that some of humanity's greatest poetry is concerned with ostensibly mundane and trivial topics, like ‘men sticking bits of pointed metal into each other in a quarrel.’\" The exhibit brings together worshipers of all ages, museum leaders said. \"The great revelation of poetry, Lewis argues, is that ‘there are no trivial nor uninteresting things,’\" Viner said.

    "title": "200 million social media records leaked in major X data breach",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk announces his platform X is experiencing a major coordinated cyberattack. X, formerly known as Twitter, has been making headlines recently, with Elon Musk claiming that hackers have been trying to disrupt the platform. However, the most recent news involving the social media site is particularly alarming and puts its users at serious risk. Earlier this month, reports emerged of a major data breach involving X, after a self-proclaimed data enthusiast known as \"ThinkingOne\" claimed to have released a database containing over 200 million user records on a popular hacker forum. The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user’s X profile. Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips –sign up for Kurt’s ‘The CyberGuy Report’ now. X app on an iPhone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images. ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those fromSafety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership. The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter’s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks. Partial confirmation of the data (Safety Detectives)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data. The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X’s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data. While the full scope and impact of the breach remain unclear, the incident highlights ongoing security challenges for the platform, especially following its acquisition by xAI in late March 2025. X logo on a smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself. 1) Use strong antivirus software This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they’re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 2) Remove your personal data from the internet Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing. To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 3) Change your X account password Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there’s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts. To change your X account password, go toSettings and privacyfrom your profile menu, then selectYour accountand tap onChange your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren’t necessary, now is the time to remove them. Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity. Go toSettings > Privacy and safetyand lock down your account visibility. 5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.2FAhelps stop this by requiring a second code to log in: 6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft. NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data – years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed – highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren’t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.

Their latest video of Atlas, their bipedal robot, has blown up online with its mind-blowing human-like movements, including breakdancing. These impressive moves are the result of a collaboration between Boston Dynamics and the Robotics and AI Institute. Stay protected & informed! Get security alerts & expert tech tips –sign up for Kurt’s ‘The CyberGuy Report’ now. Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Breakdancing, including the famous \"coffee grinder\" move, is just one of the many impressive feats Atlas can perform. The robot now demonstrates an impressive range of movements that would make even the most seasoned breakdancers envious, such as crawling on all fours with surprising agility, executing forward rolls and cartwheels and performing handstands. It's clear that Atlas is no longer just a walking, talking machine. It's becoming a breakdancer. Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CHINA'S TRON 1 ROBOT HURDLES OVER OBSTACLES LIKE IT'S NOTHING The secret behind Atlas' slick moves lies in the combination of reinforcement learning and motion capture technology. Human dancers perform movements while wearing motion capture suits, and this data is fed into Atlas' learning model. Through reinforcement learning, Atlas practices and refines these movements, allowing it to mimic human actions with uncanny accuracy. The result is a robot that can bust a move like a pro. Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SCARY AI-POWERED SWARM ROBOTS TEAM UP TO BUILD CARS FASTER THAN EVER The latest fully electric version of Atlas features impressive specifications. Standing at 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 196 pounds, this agile robot can reach a top speed of 5.6 mph (approximately 8.2 feet per second). Atlas boasts 28 degrees of freedom, allowing for complex movements and maneuvers. It's equipped with advanced lidar and stereo vision sensors for precise environmental awareness. Unlike its hydraulic predecessors, this version is powered by a fully electric system with all-electric actuators. At its core, Atlas runs on a custom control and computing system, enabling its remarkable performance and adaptability. This new generation of Atlas is stronger and more dexterous than its predecessors, with a broader range of motion that sometimes exceeds human capabilities. DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON’T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) CHINESE ROBOT'S KUNG FU MOVES WILL MAKE YOUR JAW DROP WhileBostonDynamicsdoesn't publicly disclose the exact cost of Atlas, industry experts estimate that each unit costs between $500,000 to $1 million to produce as of 2025. This high price tag reflects the cutting-edge technology, advanced materials and countless hours of research and development that go into creating such a sophisticated robot. However, as with most technologies, the cost is expected to decrease over time as production scales up and technologies mature. It's worth noting that Atlas is primarily a research platform and is not currently available for commercial purchase. Instead, Boston Dynamics leases these robots to select partners for research and development purposes, with annual leasing costs estimated to be in the six-figure range. Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) While watching a robot breakdance is undeniably cool, the implications of this technology go far beyond entertainment. The agility and adaptability demonstrated by Atlas could have significant real-world applications, such as emergency response and search and rescue operations or assisting in environments designed for humans. In fact, Atlas has been trialed in Hyundai Motor Group's vehicle factory since late 2024, potentially revolutionizing manufacturing processes. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Atlas humanoid robot breakdancing (Boston Dynamics)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) As we watch Atlas effortlessly spin and cartwheel, it's hard not to be amazed at how far robotics has come. From clunky, barely mobile machines to smooth operators that can outperform humans in certain tasks, the progress is nothing short of miraculous. While we may not see breakdancing robots on every street corner just yet, Atlas' latest performance gives us a glimpse into a future where the line between human and machine movement becomes increasingly blurred.

    "title": "Courtroom Coup: Ending the district judges' war on presidential authority",
    "article_text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson discusses stopping 'activist judges' and the reconciliation bill on 'Hannity.' Democrats triedevery strategy– congressional investigations, impeachments, smear campaigns, weaponizing the criminal justice system, and even ballot disqualifications – to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president again. Yet, on November 5th, the American people spoke loud and clear: enough was enough. Trump won all seven battleground states and the popular vote – a feat no Republican had accomplished since President George W. Bush more than 20 years ago. On his first day in office, President Trump took bold steps to fulfill his campaign promises and right the wrongs of the last administration. He declared an emergency on the southern border and immediately launched a mass deportation campaign to remove terrorists and other dangerous criminals who had a free pass to enter the country under Joe Biden’s watch. No American wants to live next to a terrorist or violent criminal. It’s not controversial. And yet, just like everything Trump does – someone, namely theradical left, has a problem with it. TRUMP-BACKED BILL TO REIN IN FEDERAL JUDGES GETS HOUSE-WIDE VOTE Thankfully, the Supreme Court has started topush back. Earlier this week, the court reaffirmed the president’s authority to enforce the Alien Enemies Act, rejecting yet another attempt by lower courts to tie the hands of the executive branch. Since Trump took office, activist judges in district courts have aggressively blocked his executive actions, issuing nationwide injunctions at an unprecedented rate. In fact, in just the first nine weeks of his presidency, district courts issued more nationwide injunctions than in all four years of Joe Biden’s presidency and all eight years of Barack Obama’s term. In 2025, unelecteddistrict judgeshave overstepped their bounds, inserting themselves into cases where they lack standing or subject matter expertise. Even more concerning, their rulings have had serious consequences for national security—including Judge Boasberg’s attempt to delay the deportation of dangerous gang members. For the party that claims to be the defender of democracy, the fact that an unelected lower court judge can micromanage the commander-in-chief should trouble every single American. Simply put, injunctions and temporaryrestraining ordersare being weaponized against the executive branch. Currently, 677 unelected district court judges hold the same functional veto power as the president – a man who received 77.3 million votes nationwide. Make this make sense. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The No Rogue Rulings Act should be a priority for both sides of the aisle. Let’s be clear – this bill does not strip judges of their ability to decide cases, nor does it interfere with the Supreme Court’s authority as the highest judicial power. This bill ensures that judicial decisions apply only to the specific case at hand, preventing any single judge from imposing a nationwide injunction that far exceeds the scope of their jurisdiction. President Trump is doing everything he can to deliver on his promises to the American people, but his time in office is limited. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Supporting the No Rogue Rulings Act ensures that the elected President – not unelected judges – can implement the policies Americans voted for to bring forward the urgent change this country needs. Every day we fail to act is another opportunity for a rogue judge to undermine the safety of 330 million Americans. The question is simple: Will we be governed by the Constitution and the President we elected or 677 judicial monarchs nobody voted for? We know our answer.

Patrick Morrisey joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the importance of diversifying American energy for national security purposes and why he supports the president unleashing coal energy. I don’t have to tell you that Biden-era policies drained the pocketbooks of American families. But just how bad was it? Everything got more expensive. Food, consumer goods and especially energy.During President Joe Biden’s administration,energy prices increased by over 30% as a direct result of his disastrous anti-energy agenda. But the Biden era is over, and that’s nowhere more apparent than in America’s energy outlook. President Donald Trump is reversing course and returning us to the Golden Age of American energy production. That’sgreat news for Wyoming and for America. One big way the president isunleashing American energyis by removing costly regulatory hurdles. On day one, Trump declared a national energy emergency to spur domestic energy and critical mineral production and lower prices for all Americans. He reversed the Biden administration’s unconscionable decision to pause LNG export permits. He has opened up new federal lands and offshore locations for responsible leasing, and he has proposed permitting reforms. Under the leadership of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the administration is protecting mining jobs out west and reversing the Biden administration’s assault on U.S. energy.

Unfortunately, the Biden administration swiftly dismantled those reforms, replacing them with permitting hurdles and endless environmental reviews designed to stall progress.

(Photo by: Marli Miller/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) As a result, vital projects – oil and gas exploration, pipelines, roads, bridges – are stuck in limbo, not due to a lack of ability or resources, but because Washington’s bureaucratic machine obstructs them. Now, thanks to Trump, America is poised to completely overhaul this permitting process and eliminate liberal inefficiency and obstruction. Trump has been an ally and friend of coal country. Unlike Democrats, who are still obsessively pushing their radical Green New Deal, Trump knows that intermittent wind and solar will not meet all of our energy needs in the era of cloud computing and artificial intelligence demands. Trump, likewise, has been honest with the American people about the importance of baseload energy sources. And Wyoming knows that better than anyone, we’ve been America's No. 1 coal producer since the 1980s, making ever cleaner baseload energy from coal a reality. But Trump isn’t content to just stick with what we’ve always done. He wants to innovate. And so does Wyoming. We want to unleash our traditional energy sector while investing in new and exciting nuclear technology. Wyoming began construction on the first new-generation advanced reactor in Kemmerer last year. When completed, it will supply energy to 400,000 homes, creating 1,600 construction jobs and 250 high-paying permanent positions in the process. Wyoming contains the largest uranium deposits in the country, presenting the opportunity to lead the way from mining to fabrication to energy production. America will not achieve Trump’s energy goals without nuclear energy, which means America will not achieve energy dominance without Wyoming. Trump's pro-energy agenda will also lower prices for Americans and create good-paying jobs in the process. His recent executive order aimed at increasing America’s critical mineral production will spur jobs across western mining communities that have been left behind by the elites in Washington. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s time to restore our rightful position as the world's leading mineral producer. Wyoming is key to freeing America from dependence on hostile foreign powers for critical minerals. We have the critical minerals, we have the technology and we have the workforce necessary to boost their production. Trump is making America safer by investing in American energy. Energy independence serves as a vital national security asset. By reducing our reliance on foreign energy sources, America becomes less vulnerable to supply disruptions and price manipulation from our adversaries.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP After spending four years here in the Senate during the Biden administration trying to work and get answers from bureaucrats who were more focused on placating far-left environmental activists, I’m excited to work with Zeldin, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who all have relevant real-world management skills and experience. Under Trump’s administration, I know we will right the ship and deliver on his energy commitments to the American people. Our country is blessed with amazing natural resources that are critical to our economic and national security. We must use those resources. We must invest in our energy security. Wyoming is grateful that President Trump is delivering on his promise to Make American Energy Great Again. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. CYNTHIA LUMMIS U.S. Sen.

    "article_text": "On the morning of October 7th, 2023, my family awoke to the blaring sounds of sirens in Rehovot, a city just 15 miles from Tel Aviv. As thousands of rockets rained down on Israel, reports began emerging of aHamas-led incursioninto Israeli communities along the Gaza border, accompanied by livestreamed videos from the terrorists showing the horrific massacre. My son, 19-year-old Nimrod Cohen, was serving in the Israel Defense Forces as a tank gunner near Gaza. As hours passed without any word from him, I turned to social media to gather more information. That’s when I stumbled upon a video on YouTube showing Hamas terrorists swarming a burning tank. Nimrod lay on the ground, helplessly being dragged away by an armed terrorist. THE FORGOTTEN AMERICANS OF HAMAS' TERRORIST MASSACRE ON OCTOBER 7TH Yehuda Cohen, right, with his sons Nimrod, left, and Yotam.(Courtesy The Cohen Family) That day, 1,200 people were tortured, raped and slaughtered, and 247 people were taken hostage. Nimrod, now 20, remains among the 59 hostages still held in Gaza. We later learned that the three other soldiers in Nimrod’s tank - Cpt. Omer Neutra, Sgt. Shaked Dahan and Sgt. Oz Daniel - were killed on that Black Saturday, leaving him as the sole survivor. My family has spent the last 18 months in agonizing uncertainty. We have traveled the globe to raise awareness of the plight of our son and the other hostages who are held captive in a complex network of Hamas-built tunnels beneath the Gaza Strip. Tragically, we now know that 41 hostages died while held captive, seven were recovered by military operations and 147 released via a ceasefire deal. While it pains us to make such a deal that would lead to the release of terrorists from Israeli prisons, it is a sacrifice we are willing to make. Yehuda Cohen's son, IDF Cpl. Nimrod Cohen, was serving as a tank gunner along the Gaza border when he was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7.(Courtesy The Cohen Family) Thanks to the efforts of PresidentDonald Trumpand the U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, a ceasefire deal was finalized earlier this year, allowing for the release of some hostages. Two hostages freed during the first phase of the ceasefire confirmed that Nimrod is still alive. Tragically, we received heartbreaking details: he has been shackled, tortured, and kept in a cage. His mental health has deteriorated, and he is suffering from a skin disease and ear infection due to lack of medical care. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Israeli hostage Nimrod Cohen with his mother Vicky Cohen.(Courtesy The Cohen Family) Despite all of his pain and suffering, my Nimrod told those freed hostages to relay a simple message to his family: \"I’m okay. Don’t worry about me. I love you.\" In the Jewish tradition, every individual is considered a universe unto themselves. This belief is deeply ingrained in theIsraeli ethos, which emphasizes the importance of ensuring that no one is left behind. Therefore, when the ceasefire agreement collapsed and hostilities reignited last month, we were devastated as it meant that Nimrod’s life continues to hang in the balance, subject to the whims of a volatile and unpredictable conflict. The United States has long been considered the leader of the free world. I implore the Trump administration to stay the course and continue applying diplomatic pressure to all parties involved, so that our family, the nation of Israel - and all those who believe in liberty - can begin to heal from the suffering caused by this brutal war.

I pray that one day soon, I can take a photo of my Nimrod with the leader I believe can end his suffering and bring this devastating conflict to a close.

    "title": "5 critical reasons why the next antisemitism envoy must think bigger",
    "article_text": "UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer calls Francesca Albanese’s reappointment a \"horrible statement on the state of the UN today.\" Antisemitism is rising at alarming levels – both worldwide and right here at home. That makes the selection of the next special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism one of the most consequential decisions left for PresidentDonald Trump’s administration. As Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks warned, \"Antisemitism is the world’s most reliable early warning sign of a major threat to freedom… It matters to all of us.\" It is imperative, then, that the next special envoy takes a broader, more assertive approach than any of their predecessors. The role of thespecial envoy, as outlined by the U.S. Department of State and enshrined in legislation, has been largely focused on foreign policy – documenting and addressing antisemitism abroad, shaping U.S. responses, and strategizing ways to curb this ancient hatred on the global stage. Every time conflict erupts in the Middle East, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. surge by 400%.(Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images) In the past, some who have held this office have essentially ignoredantisemitismat home, citing these duties as if they imposed jurisdictional constraints. The reality, however, is that global and domestic antisemitism are inextricably linked – and the next special envoy must understand and address that from day one. STOP TALKING, START TEACHING: NEW YORK MUST FIGHT TO END ANTISEMITISM IN OUR SCHOOLS Here are five critical reasons why the new envoy must wield their authority to fight antisemitism without artificial borders: Every time conflict erupts in the Middle East, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. surge by 400%. It is an undeniable pattern. The special envoy must be ready to push back immediately and forcefully against targeted campaigns of misinformation, scapegoating and conspiracy theories – often led by foreign state actors, that turn Jewish communities and institutions into targets. And whenever anti-Zionism is used as a thinly veiled disguise for outright Jew-hatred, including at theUnited Nationsor the International Criminal Court, the envoy must call it out for what it really is. Members of the United Nations Security Council meet in New York City on May 20, 2024.(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo) International organizations that have long histories of institutional bias against Jews, including, for example, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, often use their massive platforms to give credence and cover to antisemites both foreignanddomestic. Time and again, they distort laws, manipulate norms, and promote falsehoods that fuel anti-Jewish blood libels. The special envoy must not remain silent – they must correct the record every single time, with citations. HERE'S HOW TRUMP CAN TAKE ON SURGING ANTISEMITISM IN AMERICA International movements, like the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, that single out the Jewish state for demonization, delegitimization or double standards fuel antisemitism here, in the United States. A recent study even found that pro-BDS activity \"is the strongest predictor of anti-Jewish hostility on campus.\" Given that the nonprofit umbrella group for U.S.-based BDS organizations funnels money toterrorist organizations; that more than 30 of its leaders are actual violent terrorists; and the well-documented evidence that the antisemitism BDS leaders spout often breaks through the \"nonviolent\" veil, leading to innocent people getting hurt, it is well within the special envoy’s mandate to expose, denounce and combat these dangerous antisemitic movements. American universities and collegesare on the front lines of addressing antisemitism, but they are also at the forefront of a related challenge brought on by the influence of global bad actors. The federal government mandates transparency in foreign funding for educational institutions, requiring disclosure under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act. However, recent studies reveal widespread noncompliance, with billions of dollars in unreported funds flowing from authoritarian Middle Eastern regimes into U.S. campuses. THE POLITICAL RIGHT AND THE ANTISEMITIC INFLUENCER PROBLEM Research also found a strong correlation between the receipt of these funds and a sharp increase in antisemitic incidents. According to the Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy, from 2015 to 2020, institutions that accepted this undocumented money experienced, on average, 300% more antisemitic incidents than those that did not. There is some good news, however: The recent collaboration between the State Department and theDepartment of Educationwhich resulted in the closing of Confucius Institutes – programs funded by the Chinese government to spread propaganda on American campuses – is an excellent model for the special envoy to follow, which proves that public and political pressure can actually compel colleges to spurn dangerous foreign influence. As recent lawsuits have alleged, several of the specific groups fomenting antisemitism in the United States (including, for example, Within Our Lifetime and National Students for Justice in Palestine) are alleged to be working in direct coordination with Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The State Department and the Department of Justice are already working to enforce the various laws against providing support for terrorism. The special envoy should be a central part of those conversations, working to stop the antisemitism here by exposing the nefarious networks that are actually behind it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The next special envoy cannot afford to be a passive observer. They must push for social media platforms to aggressively combat online hate speech. They must work with national and international authorities to clamp down on antisemitic rhetoric before it escalates into violence. Antisemitism is not a foreign problem. It is not a domestic problem. It is a global problem – and we need a special envoy willing to fight it on all fronts.

    "title": "American farmers have a voice in Washington again",
    "article_text": "USDA Sec. Brooke Rollins shares the Trump administration's new strategy to fight bird flu as egg prices remain high. Before you can reap an abundant harvest, you have to put in the hard work of tilling the soil, sowing good seed, and waiting for it to take root. No one understands that better than our farmers. In my 50 days as USDA secretary, I’ve become convinced American farmers, ranchers, and producers have been some of the hardest hit by failed policies and a lack of leadership from Washington over the last four years. That’s why President Trump and I are fighting every day for farmers so that American agriculture will be prosperous for generations to come. Like every otherfederal agencywrecked by disastrous policy decisions under the Biden administration, we at USDA inherited a mismanaged department that was not fulfilling its mission, but was instead focused on expanding woke policy initiatives such as diversity, equity, and inclusion. American farmers have been paying the price of these misplaced policy priorities. FEDERAL DIETARY GUIDELINES WILL SOON CHANGE FOR AMERICANS, HHS AND USDA ANNOUNCE With an unprecedented agricultural trade deficit approaching $50 billion after four years of the United States seated on the sidelines of trade negotiations, farmers picked President Trump to change the status quo and return us to the trade surplus he handed to the last administration. American farmers have been hurt by the Biden administration’s failure to enforce the Phase One trade agreement signed by China under President Trump’s watch and the administration’s silence in response to the EU’s arbitrary non-tariff barriers on American producers. That’s exactly why President Trump is taking action. He knows farmers need to be treated fairly instead of facing unjustified barriers like Brazil’s 18% tariff on imported ethanol or Canada’s restrictive quotas, which tariff milk as high as 313%. Our farmers, ranchers, and producers are the backbone of our nation’s economy and deserve a level playing field. AtUSDA, we are meeting the challenge head-on and holding our trading partners accountable. That’s why I’ve announced an aggressive international travel agenda to expand market access and to reassert what our great farmers produce for the world. In the next six months, I’ll travel to India, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Japan, Vietnam, and Peru to give voice to American farmers who have been neglected in trade negotiations. My team will also host additional trade missions in Hong Kong, the Dominican Republic, Taiwan, Cote d’Ivoire, and Mexico. Reversing disastrous trade policies won’t be easy, and it won’t happen overnight. President Trump is the ultimate dealmaker and together we will ensure our farmers are treated fairly by our trading partners. At the same time, we continue to respond to the ever-evolving needs of our farmers and ranchers here at home as they continue to produce the safest, most abundant food supply in the world. Your voice is being heard in Washington once again, and we immediately began to take action to ensure farmers and ranchers have the tools needed to enter this new golden age of American prosperity. Over the course of the last 50 days, working closely with DOGE, theUSDAhas been hyper-focused on canceling contracts and grants from the previous administration that no longer align with our mission and are not effectively serving American farmers, ranchers, and producers. We are realigning our focus on programs our constituents actually need. We have directed Congressionally authorized payments through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) to help our farmers respond to increased input costs and falling commodity prices. We have launched anaggressive planto respond to the bird flu outbreak by providing federal aid to farmers to help them quickly accelerate repopulation and have completed 336 biosecurity assessments on farms across 15 states since our plan launched. We have rolled out a funding opportunity to find a long-term solution to stopping the bird flu once and for all and find a long-term solution through therapeutics, vaccines, or other innovations. We are taking action to ease burdens on pork and poultry industries to enhance line speed efficiency and rid facilities of burdensome, unnecessary, and duplicative reporting thereby increasing productivity. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We approved the distribution of federal funds to provide fresh fruits and vegetables for food banks through USDA’s Congressionally authorized Section 32 funds. And we took action to release a biofuels incentive program across 29 states which help unleash American energy and incentivize the production and use of homegrown U.S. biofuels. To that end, USDA is committed to working alongside the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) that support the biofuel industry and to support EPA’s review of any potential emergency fuel waivers to allow the nationwide year-round sale of E15. In the current agricultural economy, U.S. biofuels remain a bright spot and tremendous opportunity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As President Trump works to rebalance our current trade deals and expand market access around the world, USDA has the backs of our farmers, ranchers, and producers as they enter the spring planting season. American farmers made their voices heard, and their president is back. Under his leadership, they will always have a voice in Washington. Brooke L. Rollins is the 33rd secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump delivers remarks from the White House during a news conference with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As financial markets areweighed down by new tariffs, and boardrooms debate hitting pause on investment plans, American workers, farmers and businesses face a moment of uncertainty. However, the surest way to spur growth and opportunity is through new trade deals – not trade wars. And nowhere is the opportunity greater – or more elusive – than withIndia. I recently returned from meetings with Indian officials and business leaders in Delhi and Mumbai, and I was struck by the optimism among Indian CEOs about the future of the trading relationship between our countries. There is good reason for it. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meet in the Oval Office at the White House on Feb. 13, 2025. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Trump administration trade officials were there at the same time, meeting with the Indian government on its proposal for a new bilateral trade agreement. The proposal is aimed at achieving $500 billion in two-way trade by 2030, a bold goal agreed to by PresidentDonald Trumpand Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their February meeting at the White House. HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT Inking this deal is a golden opportunity for President Trump, and even more so for American businesses and workers. The U.S.-India economic relationship is among the most consequential in the world. Our economies are deeply intertwined in sectors ranging from technology to energy to agriculture, and the potential for export growth is massive. India’s economy is projected to expand from $4 trillion today to as large as $35 trillion by mid-century. The security implications are enormous, too. India’s strategic perch in the Indo-Pacific makes it a powerful alternative toChina. One Indian leader shared with me that all of his country’s free-trade agreements are to the east, and they are eager to have one to the west. America should be eager, too, for economic and national security reasons alike. A free trade deal would be a boon to efforts by both sides to enhance our defense production, enhance deterrence and increase interoperability of our armed forces. President Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Feb. 13, 2025.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) LIBERATION DAY AND TRUMP TARIFFS ARE NOT THE END OF TRADE. IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING President Trump enjoys a warm relationship with Prime Minister Modi, and their relationship will greatly help both sides negotiate a historic trade agreement that unleashes the power of our free markets. India imposes tariffs that average 10% higher than those the U.S. levies on Indian goods. The negotiators on both sides have already made progress toward rectifying this imbalance, with Trump declaring this week that India will drop its tariffs significantly. India also dropped its 6% digital services tax, a long-standing issue for American companies of all sizes and sectors that engage in digital trade. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER These are strong indicators of progress, but the record of past U.S. trade agreements promises even more. While America’s 20 trade agreement partners represent less than 10% of the world’s GDP outside the United States, in recent years they have purchased nearly half of all U.S. exports. On a per capita basis, these countries purchase 14 times more U.S.-made goods and services than other countries. The United States desperately needs more of these deals. It has been 13 years since the United States entered into a comprehensive trade agreement with a new partner, while others like the EU and Japan have been racing ahead with new agreements at a record pace.With its tariffs now in place, negotiating new agreements should be the administration’s overriding focus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Alternatively, if a deal is not reached and the administration continues its tariff onslaught, the risks to America’s economy and security would be severe. In this moment of geopolitical change, the last thing we need to do is incentivize our allies and partners to enter into new trade pacts with our strategic competitors. Anew trade agreementwith India is the first of many opportunities President Trump has to build on a strong personal relationship to take a burgeoning commercial partnership to the next level. India is proof that our trusted partners are willing to make concessions and drive a deal. For the sake of American businesses and workers, America needs to lean in and take the win.

    "title": "Why this high school athlete is joining the race to get men out of women’s sports",
    "article_text": "Fencer Stephanie Turner appears on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the moment she took a knee in protest of a transgender opponent during a tournament and the message she hopes to send. I’m ahigh school athlete, and I run – for the same reasons most high school girls run: because it’s fun, because I’m fast, because I enjoy the competition, and because I know my athletic prowess opens a path to scholarships. High school track offers me great opportunities for all of that.But I don’t run to be frustrated, to be disappointed, and to keep losing races (and scholarship opportunities) to male athletes who shouldn’t be running against me in the first place.Thestate of Washingtonis enforcing policies that present me with all those hurdles when I step out on the track knowing I’m going to be racing against a male who should be competing against boys – a male with a man’s strength and speed, who suddenly moves into a position where he’s virtually guaranteed to win every race he enters. Title IX is supposed to ensure that women and girls have a fair chance to compete (and win) in every sport without facing the physical and biological edge men would bring to our contests.(Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images | AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) As a senior who’s likely to be running against a male student in the near future, I believe Washington’s policy isn’t fair. So do a lot of our state’s high school coaches. So do a growing number of other people (in both political parties). I’M A 3-SPORT HIGH SCHOOL FEMALE ATHLETE IN MAINE – I SHOULDN’T HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST BIOLOGICAL MALESIn fact, those numbers are growing fast enough that PresidentDonald Trumpissued an executive order recognizing that Title IX prohibits males from competing in women’s sports.Additionally, just recently, in the southern part of my state, the Kennewick School Board – caught between the president’s executive order and our state officials’ unwavering policies – voted 4-0 to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education. The board says my state’s school superintendent, the state’s Office of Public Instruction, and the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association are all in violation of the president’s order and Title IX… and the board is asking for \"urgent\" federal intervention. The board described what happened at last year’s state 400-meter championship as an example of what’s wrong. A male from Spokane, at the time a junior who had run for the high school boys’ team, now identifies as a girl and easily defeated the young women competing against him. That wasn’t much of a surprise – according to Athletic.net, he’s won every 400-meter he’s entered since he first decided to transition. HERE'S THE MESSAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SENT WITH HIS ORDER KEEPING MEN OUT OF WOMEN'S SPORTSFunny thing: The 400-meter race is one I’m competing in this semester, so I know what to expect when I run against this student, now a senior. My years of hard work, faithful practice, and personal sacrifices will come up against his anatomical advantages, and I’ll lose – every time. The Kennewick School Board, quoting from the president’s executive order, called that \"demeaning, unfair, and dangerous.\" I agree and have now filed my own complaint with theDepartment of Education’s Office of Civil Rights through my attorneys with Alliance Defending Freedom. Another female athlete and I are asking administration officials to investigate our state’s violation of our Title IX protections, and those of all the other women student-athletes in Washington. It’s not an unreasonable request. For 50 years, Title IX has guaranteed high school and college students an equal opportunity to enjoy the benefits of education (including sports) regardless of sex. The law is supposed to ensure that women and girls have a fair chance to compete (and win) in every sport without facing the physical and biological edge men would bring to our contests. DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST THEIR WAY ON WOMEN’S SPORTS – AND HERE'S THE POLITICAL PRICE THEY'LL PAY Right now, that fairness is out the window. The state officials monitoring women’s sports seem to believe a leopard can run as fast as a cheetah – after all, they’re both cats with spots.We keep hoping they’ll come around to seeing things differently, but for now, the clock is ticking on our request. The spring semester and track season are already half over. We’re hoping the Office for Civil Rights will jump on this and look into what’s happening as soon as possible. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I know there’s a lot of political pressure on this issue. Helping people understand why we need toprotect girls’ sportsmay prove to be as difficult as defeating a male out on the track. But this is about fairness – not just for me, but for all women.

    "title": "UK to co-host global conference with aim of resolving Sudan’s civil war",
    "article_text": "The British government is bringing together foreign ministers from nearly 20 countries and organisations in an attempt to establish a group that can drive the warring factions inSudancloser towards peace. The conference at Lancaster House in London on 15 April comes on the second anniversary of thestart of a civil warthat has led to the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, but has been persistently left at the bottom of the global list of diplomatic priorities. Half of Sudan’s population are judged to be desperately short of food, with 11 million people internally displaced. The initiative holds risks for the UK foreign secretary,David Lammy, since it may require him to place pressure on some of the UK’s Middle Eastern allies to make good on their promises no longer to arm the warring parties. The UK along with Germany and France, which are co-hosting the conference, have not invited to London the two warring parties, the Sudanese Armed Forces or the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), aparamilitary group that has attacked non-Arabic groups in Darfur. The two sides are judged to be a long way from seeking peace and it is thought diplomatic energy is best placed on securing a consensus among rival external backers that a ceasefire must be demanded and impunity for war crimes will end. Sudan’s foreign minister, Ali Youssef, has written to Lammy to protest against his exclusion. Youssef also criticised invitations to the conference for the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Chad and Kenya, which he termed “stakeholders in the war”. Sudan’s government has accused the UAE, a close UK ally, of complicity in genocide by covertly arming the RSF, headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti. The UAE has condemned as a publicity stunt the Sudanese government’s decision to take on 10 April its claim of UAE complicity to the international court of justice, saying Abu Dhabi helped the RSF commit genocide against the Masalit tribe in West Darfur. The Sudanese government, itself backed by another UK ally Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt, has also been accused of war crimes. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have formally been accused by the UN of using starvation as a weapon of war. A harsh spotlight is also very likely to fall in London on the impact of USAID cuts on the provision of humanitarian aid in Sudan as well as the withdrawal of funding from academic groups that have been monitoring war crimes and the build-up of famine. NGOs such as Human Rights Watch are also urging the ministerial conference to emphasise the importance of civilian protection, independent of a ceasefire. At an event previewing the conference, Kate Ferguson, the co-director of the NGO Protection Approaches, said: “The conference comes at a critical moment for civilians in Sudan as areas of control under various armed forces rapidly evolve and civilians face an increasing spectrum of varied attack.” She added: “A new vehicle is needed to take forward civilian protection. This is a moment here to create something new that is desperately needed – whether that is a coalition of conscience or a contact group.” Ferguson added that “citizens were facing an unimaginable triple threat of armed conflict, identity-based atrocity crimes and humanitarian catastrophe”. Shayna Lewis from Avaaz said: “The solution that can yield the greatest impact for civilian protection is the restoration of telecommunication networks. More than 25 million people are cut off from the internet and cannot send texts or make phone calls. This is the equivalent of half of England’s population being cut off from the outside world and that explains why it is so difficult for the media to cover Sudan.”",

    "title": "Revealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas",
    "article_text": "Amazon,MicrosoftandGoogleare operating datacentres that use vast amounts ofwaterin some of the world’s driest areas and are building many more, the non-profit investigatory organisationSourceMaterialand the Guardian have found. WithDonald Trumppledging to support them, the three technology giants are planning hundreds of datacentres in the US and across the globe, with a potentially huge impact on populations already living with water scarcity. “The question of water is going to become crucial,” said Lorena Jaume-Palasí, founder of the Ethical Tech Society. “Resilience from a resource perspective is going to be very difficult for those communities.” Efforts byAmazon, the world’s largest online retailer, to mitigate its water use have sparked opposition from inside the company, SourceMaterial’s investigation found, with one of its own sustainability experts warning that its plans are “not ethical”. In response to questions from SourceMaterial and the Guardian, spokespeople for Amazon and Google defended their developments, saying they always take water scarcity into account.Microsoftdeclined to provide a comment. Datacentres, vast warehouses containing networked servers used for the remote storage and processing of data, as well as by information technology companies to train AI models such asChatGPT, use water for cooling. SourceMaterial’s analysis identified 38 active datacentres owned by the big three tech firms in parts of the world already facing water scarcity, as well as 24 more under development. Datacentres’ locations are often industry secrets. But by using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel and Data Center Map, SourceMaterial compiled a map of 632 datacentres – either active or under development – owned by Amazon, Microsoft andGoogle. It shows that those companies’ plans involve a 78% increase in the number of datacentres they own worldwide as cloud computing and AI cause a surge in the world’s demand for storage, with construction planned in North America, South America,Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. In parts of the world where water is plentiful, datacentres’ high water usage is less problematic, but in 2023Microsoft saidthat 42% of its water came from “areas with water stress”, whileGoogle said15% of its water consumption was in areas with “high water scarcity”. Amazon did not report a figure. Now these companies plan to expand their activities in some of the world’s most arid regions, SourceMaterial and the Guardian’s analysis found. “It’s no coincidence they are building in dry areas,” as datacentres have to be built inland, where low humidity reduces the risk of metal corrosion, while seawater also causes corrosion if used for cooling, Jaume-Palasí said. Amazon’s three proposed new datacentres in the Aragon region of northernSpain– each next to an existing Amazon datacentre – are licensed to use an estimated 755,720 cubic metres of water a year, roughly enough to irrigate 233 hectares (576 acres) of corn, one of the region’s main crops. In practice, the water usage will be even higher as that figure doesn’t take into account water used to generate the electricity that will power the new installations, said Aaron Wemhoff, an energy efficiency specialist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. Between them, Amazon’s new datacentres in the Aragon region are predicted to use more electricity than the entire region currently consumes. Meanwhile, Amazon in Decemberaskedthe regional government for permission to increase water consumption at its three existing datacentres by 48%. Opponents have accused the company of being undemocratic by trying to rush through its application over the Christmas period. More water is needed because “climate change will lead to an increase in global temperatures and the frequency of extreme weather events, including heat waves”, Amazon wrote in its application. “They’re using too much water. They’re using too much energy,” said Aurora Gómez of the campaign group Tu Nube Seca Mi Río – Spanish for “Your cloud is drying my river” – which has called for a moratorium on new datacentres in Spain due to water scarcity. Spain hasseenrising numbers of heat-related deaths in extreme weather events linked by scientists to the climate crisis. Last month, Aragon’s government asked for EU aid to tackle its drought. Farmer Chechu Sánchez said he’s worried the datacentres will use up water he needs for his crops. “These datacentres use water that comes from northern Aragon, where I am,” he said. “They consume water – where do they take it from? They take it from you, of course.” With 75% of the country already at risk of desertification, the combination of the climate crisis and datacentre expansion is “bringing Spain to the verge of ecological collapse”, Jaume-Palasí said. Asked about the decision to approve more datacentres, a spokesperson for the Aragonese government said they would not compromise the region’s water resources because their impact is “imperceptible”. Amazon does not provide overall figures for the water its datacentres use worldwide. But it does claim that it will be “water positive” by 2030, offsetting its consumption by providing water to communities and ecosystems in areas of scarcity elsewhere. Amazon says it is currently offsetting 41% of its water usage in areas it deems unsustainable. But it’s an approach that has already caused controversy inside the company. “I raised the issue in all the right places that this is not ethical,” said Nathan Wangusi, a former water sustainability manager at Amazon. “I disagreed quite a lot with that principle coming from a pure sustainability background.” Microsoft and Google have also pledged to become “water positive” by 2030 through water offsetting, as well as finding ways to use water more efficiently. Water offsetting ca not work in the same way as carbon offsetting, where a tonne of pollutants removed from the atmosphere can cancel out a tonne emitted elsewhere, said Wemhoff, the Villanova University specialist. Improving access to water in one area does nothing to help the community that has lost access to it far away. “Carbon is a global problem – water is more localised,” he said. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion Amazon should pursue water accessibility projects “because it’s the right thing to do”, not to offset the company’s usage and make claims about being “water positive”, Wangusi said. In March, Amazon announced that it would use AI to help farmers in Aragon use water more efficiently. But that is “a deliberate strategy of obfuscation” that distracts from the company’s request to raise water consumption, said Gómez, the campaigner. Amazon said its approach shouldn’t be described as offsetting because the projects are in communities where the company operates. “We know that water is a precious resource, and we’re committed to doing our part to help solve this challenge,” said Harry Staight, an Amazon spokesperson. “It’s important to remember many of our facilities do not require the ongoing use of water to cool operations.” Amazon is by far the biggest owner of datacentres in the world by dint of its Amazon Web Services cloud division, but Google and Microsoft are catching up. In the US, which boasts the largest number of datacentres in the world, Google is the most likely to build in dry areas, SourceMaterial’s data shows. It has seven active datacentres in parts of the US facing water scarcity and is building six more. “We have to be very, very protective around the growth of large water users,” said Jenn Duff, a council member in Mesa,Arizona, a fast-growing datacentre hub. In January, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, opened a $1bn datacentre in the city, and Google is developing two more. The surrounding Maricopa county, where Microsoft also has two active datacentres, is facing “extreme drought”, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In June 2023, Arizona state officials revoked construction permits for some new homes there due to a lack of groundwater. Drought has not halted Google’s plans for a second Mesa datacentre, while its first centre has a permit to use 5.5m cubic metres of water a year – about the same quantity used by 23,000 ordinaryArizonans. “Is the increase in tax revenue and the relatively paltry number of jobs worth the water?” said Kathryn Sorensen, an Arizona State University professor and a former director of Mesa’s water department. “It is incumbent on city councils to think very carefully and examine the trade-offs.” Google said it won’t use the full amount of water in its Mesa permit as it plans to use an air cooling system. “Cooling systems are a hyperlocal decision – informed by our data-driven strategy called ‘climate-conscious cooling’ that balances the availability of carbon-free energy and responsibly sourced water to minimise climate impact both today and in the future,” said Google spokesperson Chris Mussett. In January at the White House, Trump announced “Project Stargate”, which he called “the largest AI infrastructure project in history”. Starting in Texas, the $500bn joint venture between OpenAI, the American software companyOracle, Japan-based SoftBank and Emirati investment firm MGX will finance datacentres across the US. The day before the Stargate announcement, Trump’s inauguration date, the Chinese companyDeepSeeklaunched its own AI model, claiming it had used far less computing power – and therefore less water – than its western rivals. More recently, Bloomberg hasreportedthat Microsoft is pulling back on some of its plans for new datacentres around the world. Microsoft has alsopublished plansfor a “zero water” datacentre, and Google has said it will incorporate air cooling to reduce water use – though it isn’t yet clear how its systems will work. “I’ll believe it when I see it,” said Jaume-Palasí. “Most datacentres right now are going from air cooling to water cooling because liquid is more efficient when you try to cool down high-density racks, which are the ones that are mostly being used for AI.” And while theTrump administrationhas pledged to fast-track new energy projects to power these new datacentres, it has so far said nothing about the water they could use up. “Neither people nor data can live without water,” said Gómez. “But human life is essential and data isn’t.” The locations of the datacentres were compiled using local news reports and industry sources Baxtel andData Center Map. Of the 632 datacentres analysed, we were unable to determine the “active” or “developing” status for 16. Areas with water scarcity were defined as places where water is 10 times as scarce as the world’s average, according to ametricdeveloped by academics for the United Nations.

    "title": "Hamas calls on UK government to remove it from list of banned terrorist groups",
    "article_text": "The Palestinian Islamist groupHamashas submitted a legal filing saying it should be removed from the UK government’s list of proscribed terrorist groups. Hamas, which carried out the7 October 2023 attackson southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken hostage, is arguing that it is not a terrorist group but “a Palestinian Islamic liberation and resistance movement whose goal is to liberate Palestine and confront the Zionist project”. The assertion is contained in a witness statement by Mousa Abu Marzouk, head of international relations for Hamas and the applicant for the claim to the UK home secretary, Yvette Cooper,published by Drop Site News. His statement continued: “The British government’s decision to proscribe Hamas is an unjust one that is symptomatic of its unwavering support for Zionism, apartheid, occupation and ethnic cleansing in Palestine for over a century. Hamas does not and never has posed a threat to Britain, despite the latter’s ongoing complicity in the genocide of our people.” The Home Office said it did not comment on proscription matters. Hamas’s military wing, Hamas IDQ, was proscribed by the UK in 2001. In 2021, its political wing which runs Gaza, was also proscribed, with the UK government describing the distinction between the two wings as “artificial” and labelling Hamas “a complex but single terrorist organisation”. If an organisation is proscribed as a terrorist organisation it is a criminal offence to, among other things, belong to it, show or express support for it, and wear clothing or carry or display articles in public which would arouse reasonable suspicion that the individual is a member or supporter of it. In a document provided to Drop Site summarising its legal arguments, Hamas’s legal team reportedly said it represented the group pro bono because it would be illegal to accept payment. It quotes the lawyers as saying: “Hamas does not deny that its actions fall within the wide definition of ‘terrorism’ under the Terrorism Act 2000. Instead, it notes that the definition also covers all groups and organisations around the world that use violence to achieve political objectives, including the Israeli armed forces, the Ukrainian army and indeed the British armed forces.” Terrorism is defined in the act as the use of or threat of action, including serious violence against a person or damage to property, where it is “designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and must be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause”. Hamas is represented by Riverway Law. The lawyers state: “Rather than allow freedom of speech, police have embarked on a campaign of political intimidation and persecution of journalists, academics, peace activists and students over their perceived support for Hamas. People in Britain must be free to speak about Hamas and its struggle to restore to the Palestinian people the right to self-determination.” They argue proscription is contrary to Britain’s obligations under international law to prevent genocide and crimes against humanity, and endIsrael’s illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories. It says Hamas is the “only effective military force resisting” such acts. Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “Hamas is an evil Iranian-backed terrorist organisation, which kidnaps, tortures and murders people, including British nationals. They pose an ongoing threat to our security and to the peace and stability of the Middle East and they have weapons and training facilities that put lives at risk and threaten our interests. They show no respect for human rights, life and dignity and have oppressed people living in Gaza for too long.”",

    "title": "Gaza City strike kills at least 23 as Israel reportedly plans to seize Rafah",
    "article_text": "At least 23 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a residential building in northern Gaza, as reports emerged that the Israeli military is preparing to seize the entire city of Rafah as part of a newly announced security corridor. Medics at al-Ahli hospital said that the bombing on Wednesday of a four-storey building in the Gaza City suburb of Shijaiyah had killed at least eight women and children, as rescue workers continued to search for survivors into the evening. The Israeli military said the strike targeted a seniorHamasmilitant. According to the UN, nearly 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes or shelters since Israel decided to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire with Hamas, cutting off aid, food and fuel on 2 March and resuming large-scale bombing two weeks later. A total of 1,500 people have been killed and 3,700 injured since then, according to the local health ministry. Earlier this week, Hamas fired its strongest volley of rockets into Israel since the ceasefire collapsed, aiming 10 projectiles toward the southern city of Ashkelon that injured 12 people. Israeli officials say the renewed military campaign is aimed at pressuring Hamas into releasing Israeli hostages. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued sweeping evacuation orders amid a vow from the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to “divide up” and seize large swathes of the territory. On Wednesday, the Israeli dailyHaaretzreported that the IDF was preparing to incorporate the entire city of Rafah and its surroundings – one-fifth of the entire Gaza Strip – into the new “Morag corridor” between Rafah and Khan Younis. Such a move would cut off Gaza from Egypt and turn the territory into an enclave completely surrounded by Israel. The report has renewed fears of permanent displacement for the strip’s 2.3 million residents and inflamed worries that Israel intends to establish permanent control of the Palestinian territory. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The war inGazawas triggered by Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, in which Israel says 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, were killed and a further 250 taken captive. Israel’s retaliatory military campaign has killed more than 50,000 people in Gaza, most of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry. Mediators have since attempted to bring the sides to a bridging agreement that would again pause the war, free hostages and open the door for talks on ending the conflict, but Netanyahu, under pressure from rightwing allies, says Israel will not agree to stop fighting until Hamas is defeated. Hamas wants the war to end before it frees the remaining 59 hostages it holds, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive. Netanyahu this week travelled to the US – Israel’s most important political and military ally – to meet Donald Trump, who has said he wants the war to end. He has suggested expelling Gaza’s population either voluntarily or by force. While Israel has embraced Trump’s vision, the rest of the Middle East and the international community have refused to entertain the idea. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you canread more of our Middle East coverage here The death toll from anIsraelistrike in theShujaiyaarea ofGaza Cityhas risen to 29Palestinians, Reuter reports. Local health authorities said the deaths included children. TheIsraelimilitary said in a statement it struck a seniorHamasmilitant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northernGaza, whom it did not identify. The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians. Local health authorities said nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday’s death toll to 38. It is approaching 5pm inGaza Cityand 6pm inTel Aviv. This blog will be closing shortly but you can follow the Guardian’s Middle East coveragehere. Here is a summary of the latest updates from today’s live blog: At least 29 Palestinians, including children, were killed on Wednesday from an Israeli strike in the Shujaiya area of Gaza City, local health authorities said.Medics said dozens of others were injured in the attack that hit a multi-floor residential building in the eastern suburb ofGazaCity. They said many were still believed to be missing and trapped under the ruins of the building. The strike damaged several other houses nearby. Local health authorities in Gaza added that nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday’s death toll to 38. The Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday that at least 1,482 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, taking the overall death toll since the start of the war to 50,846. The Israeli military said in a statement it struck a senior Hamas militant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northernGaza,whom it did not identify.The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians. Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto said on Wednesday that his country will offer temporary shelter to Palestinian medical evacuees and children orphaned by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.He said Indonesia is ready to evacuate a first group of about 1,000 victims, who will stay in the country until they have fully recovered from their injuries and Gaza is safe enough to return to. Subianto said the move was not for permanent resettlement. United Nations (UN) secretary general António Guterres said on Tuesday that Gaza had become “a killing field” because Israel has continued to block aid, an accusation an Israeli official quickly denied, saying there was “no shortage” of aid. “More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid intoGaza. No food. No fuel. No medicine. No commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have re-opened,” Guterres said in remarks to journalists. Six weeks since Israel completely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip, food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out.“All basic supplies are running out,” said Juliette Touma from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa). She said: “Every day without these basic supplies, Gaza inches closer towards very, very deep hunger.” Israel accuses the Hamas militants who have run Gaza of exploiting aid but Hamas deny this and accuses Israel of using starvation as a military tactic. The mother of an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that she fears that Israel’s renewed bombardment of the territory puts his life at even greater risk.“Our children are in danger,” Herut Nimrodi told AFP during an interview. Her son, Tamir, who turned 20 in captivity, is one of 24 hostages believed to be alive, though no proof of life has been sent since his abduction. Suspected US airstrikes pounded the area around Yemen’s Red Sea port city of Hodeida on Tuesday night, killing at least 10 people and injuring 16 others, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels said. The strikes hit around Hodeida’s al-Hawak district, the rebels said, and injured 16 people. President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday Iran has no objection to US investors doing business in the country but the country firmly opposes any attempts at regime change or foreign interference. “The leader has no objection to the presence of American investors in the country,” Pezeshkian said of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech broadcast on state television. “We oppose their flawed policies, such as conspiracies and attempts at regime change.” Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat is in Washington to lay the groundwork for US president Donald Trump’s upcoming visit, the first foreign trip of his second term, a Saudi government source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday. Last month, Trump said he may visit Saudi Arabia as early as April. The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said “developments inGaza, Yemen and Syria” were some of the topics on the agenda of the Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan. As calls for Lebanon’s Hezbollah to disarm gain momentum, a senior Hezbollah official told Reuters the group is ready to hold talks with the Lebanese president about its weapons if Israel withdraws from south Lebanon and stops its strikes.US-backed president Joseph Aoun, who vowed when he took office in January to establish a state monopoly on the control of arms, intends to open talks with Hezbollah over its arsenal soon, three Lebanese political sources told Reuters. The Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world’s poorest and most war-ravaged countries, officials said on Wednesday.Funding has been restored for programmes in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, according to the USAID official and one of the UN officials. Almost 40 MPs and peers in the UK have signed a letter organised by politician Jeremy Corbyn calling for an independent inquiry into the government’s role in the war in Gaza.In the letter, they say the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000 and that “Britain has played a highly influential role in Israel’s military operations, including the sale of weapons, the supply of intelligence and the use of Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in Cyprus”. They say an inquiry should establish what decisions were taken and what the consequences were. The US state department said on Tuesday it was aware of the killing by Israeli forces of a Palestinian American teenager in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was seeking more information about the incident. A state department spokesperson made the comments to reporters when asked about the killing of US citizen Omar Mohammad Rabea, 14, and the shooting of two other teenagers. The death toll from suspectedUSairstrikes that pounded the area aroundYemen’sRed Seaport city ofHodeida(see 9.44am BST) has risen to at least 10 people, according to theHouthis. The rebels also aired footage they said showed the debris left after shooting down yet-another American MQ-9 Reaper drone.The strikes on Tuesday night hit around Hodeida’sal-Hawakdistrict, the rebels said, and injured 16 people. Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat is inWashingtonto lay the groundwork forUSpresidentDonald Trump’s upcoming visit, the first foreign trip of his second term, a Saudi government source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Wednesday. Last month, Trump said he may visit Saudi Arabia as early as April in a reprisal of 2017, when the oil-rich, conservative kingdom was the first destination of his first term in office. Foreign ministerPrince Faisal bin Farhanarrived in Washington on Tuesday, aiming to “prepare for Trump’s visit to Riyadh”, the source close to the Saudi government told AFP. The source, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said “developments inGaza, Yemen and Syria” were also on Prince Faisal’s agenda. The official Saudi Press Agency said Prince Faisal was to meet his US counterpartMarco Rubioto discuss “key regional and international developments”. In January, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler,Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, promised to pile $600bn into US trade and investments. Trump later said Saudi Arabia had agreed to “spend close to a trillion dollars … in our American companies, which to me means jobs”. Trump forged close relations withRiyadhin his first term and is expected to push Saudi Arabia towards normalising ties withIsraelas a major foreign policy objective. TheUSstate department said on Tuesday it was aware of the killing byIsraeliforces of aPalestinian Americanteenager in theIsraeli-occupied West Bankand was seeking more information about the incident, reports Reuters. A state department spokesperson made the comments to reporters when asked about the killing of US citizenOmar Mohammad Rabea, 14, and the shooting of two other teenagers. “We are certainly aware of that dynamic,” the state department spokesperson said. “There is an investigation that is going on. We are aware of the reports from the IDF that this was a counter-terrorism act, we need to learn more about the nature of what happened on the ground.” The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the weekend incident as an “extra-judicial killing” by Israeli forces during a raid. A local mayor said Rabea was shot along with two other teenagers by an Israeli settler and that the Israeli army pronounced him dead after detaining him. The Israeli military said it shot a “terrorist” who endangered civilians by hurling rocks. “We don’t have the complete picture of what was going on on the ground,” the state department spokesperson added. The family of the teenager, who was aNew Jerseynative, said he was shot multiple times. Local community leaders gathered at thePalestinian American community centreinClifton, New Jersey, on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and demand justice. Six weeks sinceIsraelcompletely cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of theGaza Strip, food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out, while emergency meal distributions are ending, bakeries are closed and markets are empty, reports Reuters. Aid agencies that have been supplying emergency meals say they will have to stop within days unless they can bring in more food. TheWorld Food Programmeused to provide bread at 25 bakeries across theGazaStrip. All of those bakeries are now shut. It will soon have to halt distribution of food parcels at reduced rations. “All basic supplies are running out,” saidJuliette Toumafrom theUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa). She said: The prices of commodities have exponentially increased over the past one month plus since the Israeli authorities put the siege on the Gaza Strip. It means babies, children are going to bed hungry. Every day without these basic supplies, Gaza inches closer towards very, very deep hunger.” According to Reuters, a 25 kilo sack of flour that used to sell for $6 now costs ten times as much, while a litre of cooking oil – if it can be located – costs $10 instead of $1.50. “Food distributions have almost stopped altogether, with remaining stocks now diverted to keep hot meal distributions going for a few more days, but that will soon finish too,” saidGavin Kelleher, an access manager for theNorwegian Refugee CouncilinDeir al-Balah. Medical charityMédecins Sans Frontièressays it is encountering children and pregnant women with severe malnutrition, and lactating mothers are themselves too hungry to be able to breastfeed. Israel denies that Gaza is facing a hunger crisis. The military accuses theHamasmilitants who have runGazaof exploiting aid, and says it must keep all supplies out to prevent the fighters from getting it. “The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is acting in accordance with the directives of the political echelon. Israel is not transferring and will not transfer aid to the hands of terrorist organizations,” the military said. The ministry of foreign affairs said 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza in the 42 days of the ceasefire – before it shut the border at the start of March – and that Hamas had used the aid to rebuild its war machine. Hamas denies exploiting aid and accuses Israel of using starvation as a military tactic. The Trump administration has reversed sweeping cuts in emergency food aid to several nations while maintaining them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world’s poorest and most war-ravaged countries, officials said Wednesday. The United States had initially cut funding for projects in more than a dozen countries, part of a dramatic reduction of foreign aid led by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. Aid officials warned the cuts would deny food to millions of people and end health programs for women and children. The administration informed the World Food Program of its reversal on Tuesday, according to two UN officials. An official with the US Agency for International Development (USAID) confirmed that Jeremy Lewin, the Musk associate overseeing the dismantling of USAID, ordered the reversal of some of his weekend contract terminations after The Associated Press reported them. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, AP reported. The WFP said Monday it had been notified that USAID was cutting funding to the UN agency’s emergency food program in 14 countries. Funding has been restored for programs in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador, according to the USAID official and one of the UN officials. The status of funding for six other unidentified countries was not immediately clear. One of the UN officials said the decision to restore funding came after intense behind-the-scenes lobbying of members of Congress by senior UN officials. The cuts could prove disastrous for millions in Afghanistan and Yemen, reeling from decades of war and US-led campaigns against militants. The death toll from anIsraelistrike in theShujaiyaarea ofGaza Cityhas risen to 29Palestinians, Reuter reports. Local health authorities said the deaths included children. TheIsraelimilitary said in a statement it struck a seniorHamasmilitant responsible for planning and executing attacks from Shujaiya in northernGaza, whom it did not identify. The military said several steps were taken before the attack to mitigate harm to civilians. Local health authorities said nine other Palestinians were killed in separate Israeli military strikes in other parts of the territory, raising Wednesday’s death toll to 38. Here are some of the latest images that have been shared via the newswires: TheIsraelimilitary said it targeted a seniorHamasmilitant on Wednesday in a strike that local health authorities said had killed at least 26Palestinians, including children. When asked by Agence France-Presse (AFP) about the strike in the city’sShujaiyaneighbourhood, the military said it “struck a senior Hamas terrorist who was responsible for planning and executing terrorist attacks” from the area. It did not give the target’s name, reports AFP. Almost 40 MPs and peers in theUKhave signed a letter organised by politicianJeremy Corbyncalling for an independent inquiry into the government’s role in the war inGaza. In the letter, they say the death toll in Gaza has exceeded 61,000 and that “Britain has played a highly influential role in Israel’s military operations, including the sale of weapons, the supply of intelligence and the use of Royal Air Force (RAF) bases in Cyprus”. They say an inquiry should establish what decisions were taken and what the consequences were, and that ministers from the last Conservative government and the currentLabourone should cooperate fully. They add: Many people believe the government has taken decisions that have implicated officials in the gravest breaches of international law. These charges will not go away until there is a comprehensive, public, independent inquiry with the legal power to establish the truth. The letter has been signed by 37 MPs and peers, from the Labour party, Sinn Féin, the Greens, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, as well as independents. In a message on social media where he has posted the letter, Corbyn says: Last month, I wrote to the prime minister calling for an independent inquiry into the UK’s involvement in Israel’s assault on Gaza. Today, more than 30 MPs have supported that call. This is not going away. We will campaign for as long as it takes to establish the truth. All seven Sinn Féin MP have signed the letter. In a statement explaining why, the Sinn FéinChris Hazzardsaid: For 18 months now, the Israeli army has continually attacked the defenceless population of Gaza, while world leaders turn a blind eye to these barbaric and inhumane actions. Some members of the international community are complicit in the ongoing genocide, displacement and apartheid targeting the Palestine people. This letter calls for a public inquiry into the British government’s role in the war on Gaza, and how it has assisted Netanyahu’s reckless and out-of-control regime. While Israel must be held fully accountable for its flagrant breaches of international law, we also must establish what role successive British governments have played in this war. PresidentMasoud Pezeshkiansaid on WednesdayIranhas no objection toUSinvestors doing business in the country but the country firmly opposes any attempts at regime change or foreign interference, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “The leader has no objection to the presence of American investors in the country,” Pezeshkian said of supreme leaderAyatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech broadcast on state television. “We oppose their flawed policies, such as conspiracies and attempts at regime change.” Iran has had no diplomatic relations withWashingtonsince 1980, but is to hold nuclear talks with US officials inOmanon Saturday. The talks follow a letter sent by US presidentDonald Trumpon 7 March, urging Khamenei to resume nuclear negotiations and warning of possible military action if Iran refuses. Tehranresponded weeks later, saying it was open to indirect negotiations and dismissed the possibility of direct talks as long as the US maintains its “maximum pressure” policy. “The leader said that we are ready to negotiate, but not in direct negotiations because we do not trust them,” Pezeshkian said. The death toll from anIsraelistrike in theShujaiyaarea ofGaza Cityhas risen to 26Palestinians, local health authorities said, according to Reuters. The number includes children, local health authorities said on Wednesday. Medics said dozens of others were injured in the attack that hit a multi-floor residential building in the eastern suburb ofGazaCity. They said many were still believed to be missing and trapped under the ruins of the building. The strike damaged several other houses nearby, medics said. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli army.",

    "title": "Trump administration’s attack on university research accelerates",
    "article_text": "With billions in grants put on hold, targeted universities will see research crippled. Shortly after its inauguration, the Trump administration has made no secret that it isn't especially interested in funding research. Before January's end, major science agencies hadinstituted pauseson research funding, and grant funding has not beenrestored to previous levelssince. Many individual grants have been targeted on ideological grounds, and agencies like the National Science Foundation areexpected to see significant cuts. Since then, individual universities have been targeted, starting with an ongoing fightwith Columbia Universityover $400 million in research funding. This week, however, it appears that the targeting of university research has entered overdrive, with multiple announcements of funding freezes targeting several universities. Should these last for any considerable amount of time, they will likely cripple research at the targeted universities. On Wednesday, Science learned that the National Institutes of Healthhas frozenall of its research funding to Columbia, despite the university agreeing to steps previously demanded by the administration and the resignation of its acting president. In 2024, Columbia had received nearly $700 million in grants from the NIH, with the money largely going to the university's prestigious medical and public health schools. But the attack goes well beyond a single university. On Tuesday, the Trump administrationannounced a holdon all research funding to Northwestern University (nearly $800 million) and Cornell University ($1 billion). These involved money granted by multiple government agencies, including a significant amount from the Department of Defense in Cornell's case. Ostensibly, all of these actions were taken because of the university administrators' approach to protests about the conflict in Gaza, which the administration has characterized as allowing antisemitism. However, Princeton Universityended up being targeted this weekpurely due to the results of its research. The Department of Commerce, which houses the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), terminated $4 million in funding for climate research at Princeton. It accuses the research programs of fostering \"climate anxiety\" and, in a remarkable bit of candor, admitted that funding was being cut because it didn't produce results the administration liked: This cooperative agreement suggests that the Earth will have a significant fluctuation in its water availability as a result of global warming. Using federal funds to perpetuate these narratives does not align with the priorities of this Administration and such time and resources can be better utilized elsewhere. (Separately, the administration alsoended fundingfor the US Global Change Research Program, which produces a congressionally mandated climate assessment.) While the $4 million hit to Princeton won't precipitate a crisis, the remainder of these actions—all in the neighborhood of $700 million to $1 billion—will lead to a crisis that no amount of university endowment can fix. If they go on for any length of time, researchers will have to be laid off, facilities closed, and populations of research animals will likely need to be culled. It's a series of events that will make it difficult for any university to re-establish a research program any time soon.

    "title": "Here are the reasons SpaceX won nearly all recent military launch contracts",
    "article_text": "\"I expect that the government will follow all the rules and be fair and follow all the laws.\" In the last week, the US Space Forceawarded SpaceX a $5.9 billion dealto make Elon Musk's space company the Pentagon's leading launch provider, and then it assigned the vast majority of this year's most lucrative launch contracts to SpaceX. On top of these actions, the Space Forcereassigned the launch of a GPS navigation satellitefrom United Launch Alliance's long-delayed Vulcan rocket to fly on SpaceX's Falcon 9. ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, is SpaceX's chief US rival in the market for military satellite launches. Given the close relationship between Musk and President Donald Trump, it's not out of bounds to ask why SpaceX is racking up so many wins. Someplans floated by the Trump administrationinvolving SpaceX in recent months have raisedconcerns over conflicts of interest. Tory Bruno, ULA's president and CEO, doesn't seem too worried in his public statements. In a roundtable with reporters this week at the annual Space Symposium conference in Colorado, Bruno was asked about Musk's ties with Trump. \"We have not been impacted by our competitor's position advising the president, certainly not yet,\" Bruno said. \"I expect that the government will follow all the rules and be fair and follow all the laws, and so we're behaving that way.\" It's a separate concern whether the Pentagon should predominantly rely on a single provider for access to space, be it a launch company like SpaceX led by a billionaire government insider or a provider like ULA that, so far, hasn't proven its new Vulcan rocket can meet the Space Force's schedules. Military officials are unanimous in their answer to that question: \"No.\" That's why the Space Force is keen to add to the Pentagon's roster of launch providers. In the last 12 months, the Space Force has brought Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and Stoke Space to join SpaceX and ULA in the mix for national security launches. The reason Bruno can say Musk's involvement in the Trump administration so far hasn't affected ULA is simple. SpaceX is cheaper and has a ready-made line of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets available to launch the Pentagon's satellites. ULA's Vulcan rocket isnow certified to launch military payloads, but it reached this important milestone years behind schedule. The Pentagon announced Friday that SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin—Jeff Bezos' space company—won contracts worth $13.7 billion to share responsibilities for launching approximately 54 of the military's most critical space missions from 2027 through 2032. SpaceX received the lion's share of the missions with an award for 28 launches, while ULA got 19. Blue Origin, a national security launch business newcomer, will fly seven missions. This comes out to a 60-40 split between SpaceX and ULA, not counting Blue Origin's seven launches, which the Space Force set aside for a third contractor. It'sa reversal of the 60-40 sharing scheme in thelast big military launch competition in 2020, when ULA took the top award over SpaceX.Space Force officials anticipate Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket will be certified for national security missions next year, allowing it to begin winning launch task orders. Bruno said he wasn't surprised with the outcome of this year's launch competition, known as Phase 3 of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. \"We're happy to getit,\" he said Monday. \"I felt that winning 60 percent the first time was a little bit of an upset,\" Bruno said of the 2020 competition with SpaceX. \"I believe they expected to win 60 then ... Therefore, I believed this time around that they would compete that much harder, and that I was not going to price dive in order to guarantee a win.\" While we know roughly how many launches each company will get from the Space Force, the military hasn't determined which specific missions will fly with ULA, SpaceX, or Blue Origin. Once per year, the Space Force will convene a \"mission assignment board\" to divvy up individual task orders. Officials announced Monday that this year's assignment board awarded seven missions to SpaceX and two launches to ULA. The list includes six Space Force missions and three for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). SpaceX's seven wins are worth a combined $845.8 million, with an average price of $120.8 million per launch. Three will fly on Falcon 9 rockets, and four will launch on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy. The Space Force's two orders to ULA are valued at $427.6 million, averaging $213.8 million per mission. Both missions will launch from Florida, one with a GPS navigation satellite to medium-Earth orbit and another with a next-generation geosynchronous missile warning satellite named NGG-2. So, why did ULA only get 22 percent of this year's task orders instead of something closer to 40 percent? It turns out ULA was not eligible for two of these missions because the company's West Coast launch pad for the Vulcan rocket is still under construction at Vandenberg Space Force Base. The Space Force won't assign specific West Coast missions to ULA until the launch pad is finished and certified, according to Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, chief of the Space Force's \"Assured Access to Space\" office. Vandenberg, a military facility on the Southern California coast, has a wide range of open ocean to the south, perfect for rockets delivering payloads into polar orbits. Rockets flown out of Cape Canaveral typically fly to the east on trajectories useful for launching satellites into the GPS network or into geosynchronous orbit. \"A company can be certified for a subset of missions while it continues to work on meeting the certification criteria for the broader set of missions,\" Panzenhagen said. \"In this case, ULA was not certified for West Coast launches yet. They’re working on that.\" Because of this rule, SpaceX won task orders for the NROL-96 and NROL-157 missions by default. The Space Force's assignment of the USSF-15 mission to SpaceX makes some sense, too. Going forward, the Space Force wants to have Vulcan and Falcon Heavy as options for adding to the GPS network. This will be the first GPS payload to launch on Falcon Heavy, allowing SpaceX engineers to complete a raft of upfront analysis and integration work. Engineers won't have to repeat this work on future Falcon Heavy flights carrying identical GPS satellites. A decade ago, ULA was the sole launch provider to deploy the Pentagon's fleet of surveillance, communication, and navigation satellites. The Air Force certified SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket for national security missions in May 2015, opening the market for competition for the first time since Boeing and Lockheed Martin merged their rocket divisions to create ULA in 2006. ULA's monopoly, which Bruno acknowledged, has now eroded into making the company a niche player in the military launch market. \"A monopoly is not healthy,\" he said. \"We were one for a few years before I came to ULA, and that was because no one else had the capability, and there weren’t that many missions. There weren’t enough to support many providers. There are now, so this is better.\" There are at least a couple of important reasons the Space Force is flying more missions than 10 or 20 years ago. One is that Pentagon officials believe the United States is now in competition with a near-peer great power, China, with a rapidly growing presence in space. Military leaders say this requires more US hardware in orbit. Another is that the cost of launching something into space is lower than it was when ULA enjoyed its dominant position. SpaceX has led the charge in reducing the cost of accessing space, thanks to its success in pioneering reusable commercial rockets. Many of the new types of missions the Space Force plans to launch in the next few years will go to low-Earth orbit (LEO), a region of space a few hundred miles above the planet. There, the Space Force plans to deploy hundreds of satellites for a global missile detection, missile tracking, and data relay network. Eventually, the military may place hundreds or more space-based interceptors in LEO as part of the\"Golden Dome\" missile defense programpushed by the Trump administration. Traditionally, the military has operated missile tracking and communications satellites in much higher geosynchronous orbits some 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) over the equator. At that altitude, satellites revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the planet's rotation, allowing a spacecraft to maintain a constant vigil over the same location. The Space Force still has a few of those kinds of missions to launch, along with mobile, globe-trotting surveillance satellites and eavesdropping signals intelligence spy platforms for the National Reconnaissance Office. Bruno argues ULA's Vulcan rocket, despite being more expensive, is best suited for these bespoke missions. So far, the Space Force's awards seem to bear it out. \"Our rocket has a unique niche within this marketplace,\" Bruno said. \"There really are two kinds of missions from the rocket’s standpoint. There are ones where you drop off in LEO, and there are ones where you drop off in higher orbits. You design your rockets differently for that. It doesn’t mean we can’t drop off in LEO, it doesn’t mean [SpaceX] can’t drop off in a higher energy orbit, but we’re more efficient at those because we designed for that.\" There's some truth in that argument. The Vulcan rocket's upper stage, called the Centaur V, burns liquid hydrogen fuel with better fuel efficiency than the kerosene-fueled engine on SpaceX's upper stage. And SpaceX must use the more expensive Falcon Heavy rocket for the most demanding missions, expending the rocket's core booster to devote more propellant toward driving the payload into orbit. SpaceX has launched at a rate nearly 34 times higher than United Launch Alliance since the start of 2023, but ULA has more experience with high-energy missions, featuring more complex maneuvers to place military payloads directly into geosynchronous orbit, and sometimes releasing multiple payloads at different locations in the geosynchronous belt. This is one of the most challenging mission profiles for any rocket, requiring a high-endurance upper stage, like Vulcan's Centaur V, capable of cruising through space for eight or more hours. SpaceX has flown a long-duration version of its upper stage on several missions by adding an extended mission kit. This gives the rocket longer battery life and a custom band of thermal paint to help ensure its kerosene fuel does not freeze in the cold environment of space. On the other hand, the overwhelming majority of SpaceX's missions target low-Earth orbit, where Falcon 9 rockets deploy Starlink Internet satellites, send crews and cargo to the International Space Station, and regularly launch multi-payload rideshare missions. These launches maximize the Falcon 9's efficiencies with booster recovery and reuse. SpaceX is proficient and prolific with these missions, launching them every couple of days.Launch, land, repeat. \"They tend to be more efficient at the LEO drop-offs, I’ll be honest about that,\" Bruno said. \"That means there’s a competitive space in the middle, and then there’s kind of these end cases. So, we’ll keep winning when it’s way over in our space, they will win when it’s way over in theirs, and then in the middle it’s kind of a toss-up for any given mission.\" Recent history seems to support Bruno's hypothesis. Last year, SpaceX and ULA competed head-to-head for nine specific launch contracts, or task orders, in a different Space Force competition. The launches will place national security satellites into low-Earth orbit, and SpaceX won all nine of them. Since 2020, ULA has won more Space Force task orders than SpaceX for high-energy missions, although the inverse was true in this year's round of launch orders. The military's launch contracting strategy gives the Space Force flexibility to swap payloads between rockets, add more missions, or deviate from the 60-40 share to SpaceX and ULA. This has precedent. Between 2020 and 2024,ULA received 54 percent of military launches, short of the 60 percent anticipated in their original contract. This amounted to ULA winning three fewer task orders, or a lost value of about $350 million, because of delays in development of the Vulcan rocket. That's the cost of doing business with the Pentagon. Military officials don't want their satellites sitting on the ground. The national policy of assured access to space materialized after theChallengeraccident in 1986. NASA grounded the Space Shuttle for two-and-a-half years, and the military had no other way to put its largest satellites into orbit, leading the Pentagon to accelerate development of new versions of the Atlas, Delta, and Titan rockets dating back to the 1960s. Military and intelligence officials were again stung by a spate of failures with the Titan IV in the 1990s, when it was the only heavy-lift launcher in the Pentagon's inventory. Then, ULA's Delta IV Heavy rocket was the sole heavy-lifter available to the military for nearly two decades. Today, the Space Force has two heavy-lift options and may have a third soon with Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket. This all has the added benefit of bringing down costs, according to Col. Doug Pentecost, deputy director of the Space Force's Assured Access to Space directorate. \"If you bundle a bunch of missions together, you can get a better price point,\" he said. \"We awarded $13.7 billion. We thought this was going to cost us 15.5, so we saved $1.7 billion with this competition, showing that we have great industry out there trying to do good stuff for us.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Revolt brews against RFK Jr. as experts pen rally cries in top medical journal",
    "article_text": "\"If our usual approaches are not effective, other strategies must be used.\" Health experts took to one of the country's leading medical journals to pen searing rebukes ofRobert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first weeks as the country's top health official—and they called upon their colleagues to rise up to fight the misinformation and distrust they allege Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, is fomenting. Fromgutting federal health agenciesandknee-capping critical local public health programs, todelaying a significant vaccine advisory meeting,hiring a discredited anti-vaccine advocateto conduct a vaccine study,ousting the country's top vaccine regulator, andundermining the response to the mushrooming measles outbreakin Texas that stands to threaten the country'smeasles elimination status—the researchers had no shortage of complaints. In one article, pediatric infectious disease expert Kathryn Edwards of Vanderbilt University recounted the timeline of the measles outbreak, noting the missteps, missed opportunities, and controversial comments Kennedy made along the way. The rundown included his trivialization of the outbreak, failure to strongly advocate for vaccination, promotion of unproven treatments, like cod liver oil, and delayed responses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which Kennedy controls. The debacle indicates that researchers and health officials may no longer be able to rely on the CDC for timely guidance and evidence-based recommendations, she wrote. And if so, the medical and science communities need to step up and fill the void. \"The measles outbreak must be approached with scientifically based recommendations for immunization and infection control,\" Edwards concluded. \"If the usual government sources of information cannot be relied on, medical journals and specialty societies must fill that gap. If our usual approaches are not effective, other strategies must be used.\" In a more acerbicarticle, Vanderbilt researchers Jeremy Jacobs and Garrett Booth blasted Kennedy's appointment of infamous anti-vaccine advocate David Geier to lead a federal study on immunizations and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, were named in2010 by Nature magazineto be among the top science deniers. The duo is known for endlessly promoting the exhaustively debunked false claim that vaccines cause autism, which Kennedy also promotes. Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license over accusations he mistreated children with autism, and David Geier, who has no medical background, was fined for practicing medicine without a license. Jacobs and Booth argued that hiring David Geier compromises the integrity of the scientific process, erodes public trust, and provides a platform for unreliable information. It's a \"dangerous concession to pseudoscience,\" they wrote. \"Elevating figures known for spreading unreliable information threatens not only the integrity of individual research efforts but also the broader public confidence in science,\" they wrote. \"It sends a message that fringe views deserve equal standing with evidence-based consensus.\" The moves from Kennedy highlight escalating threats to science and medicine, the researchers wrote. Like Edwards, they called for researchers and health experts to stand up to defend evidence-based medicine. \"At this critical juncture, public institutions and academic leaders must demonstrate courage and clarity,\" they wrote. \"If science is to remain a trusted foundation for public health, its stewards must be selected not for their ability to generate controversy, but for their commitment to truth. That requires rejecting the normalization of unreliable information and reaffirming our collective responsibility to safeguard the integrity of public health.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google announces faster, more efficient Gemini AI model",
    "article_text": "Gemini 2.5 is starting to move beyond its experimental phase. Google made waves with therelease of Gemini 2.5last month, rocketing to the top of the AI leaderboard after previously struggling to keep up with the likes of OpenAI. That first experimental model was just the beginning. Google is deploying its improved AI in more places across its ecosystem, from the developer-centric Vertex AI to the consumer Gemini app. Gemini models have been dropping so quickly, it can be hard to grasp Google's intended lineup. Things are becoming clearer now that the company is beginning to move its products to the new branch. At the Google Cloud Next conference, ithas announcedinitial availability of Gemini 2.5 Flash. This model is based on the same code as Gemini 2.5 Pro, but it's faster and cheaper to run. You won't see Gemini 2.5 Flash in the Gemini app just yet—it's starting out in theVertex AI development platformand AI Studio. The experimental wide release of Pro helped Google gather data and see how people interacted with the new model, and that has helped inform the development of 2.5 Flash. The Flash versions of Gemini are smaller than the Pro versions, though Google doesn't like to talk about specific parameter counts. Flash models provide faster answers for simpler prompts, which has the side effect of reducing costs. We do know that 2.5 Pro (Experimental) was the first Gemini model to implement dynamic thinking, a technique that allows the model to modulate the amount of simulated reasoning that goes into an answer. 2.5 Flash is also a thinking model, but it's a bit more advanced. We recentlyspoke with Google's Tulsee Doshi, who noted that the 2.5 Pro (Experimental) release was still prone to \"overthinking\" its responses to simple queries. However, the plan was to further improve dynamic thinking for the final release, and the team also hoped to give developers more control over the feature. That appears to be happening with Gemini 2.5 Flash, which includes \"dynamic and controllable reasoning.\" The newest Gemini models will choose a \"thinking budget\" based on the complexity of the prompt. This helps reduce wait times and processing for 2.5 Flash. Developers even get granular control over the budget to lower costs and speed things along where appropriate. Gemini 2.5 models are also getting supervised tuning and context caching for Vertex AI in the coming weeks. In addition to the arrival of Gemini 2.5 Flash, the larger Pro model has picked up a new gig. Google's largest Gemini model is nowpowering its Deep Research tool, which was previously running Gemini 2.0 Pro. Deep Research lets you explore a topic in greater detail simply by entering a prompt. The agent then goes out into the Internet to collect data and synthesize a lengthy report. Credit:\n\n          \n          Google Google says that the move to Gemini 2.5 has boosted the accuracy and usefulness of Deep Research. The graphic above shows Google's alleged advantage compared to OpenAI's deep research tool. These stats are based on user evaluations (not synthetic benchmarks) and show a greater than 2-to-1 preference for Gemini 2.5 Pro reports. Deep Research is available for limited use on non-paid accounts, but you won't get the latest model. Deep Research with 2.5 Pro is currently limited to Gemini Advanced subscribers. However, we expect before long that all models in the Gemini app will move to the 2.5 branch. With dynamic reasoning and new TPUs, Google could begin lowering the sky-high costs that have thus far made generative AI unprofitable.

    "title": "NASA nominee asks why lunar return has taken so long, and why it costs so much",
    "article_text": "“My loyalty is to this nation, the space agency, and its world-changing mission.\" WASHINGTON, DC—Over the course of a nearly three-hour committee hearing Wednesday, the nominee to lead NASA for the Trump administration faced difficult questions from US senators who sought commitments to specific projects. However, maneuvering like a pilot with more than 7,000 hours in jets and ex-military aircraft, entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman dodged most of their questions and would not be pinned down. His basic message to members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation was that NASA is an exceptional agency that does the impossible, but that it also faces some challenges. NASA, he said, receives an “extraordinary” budget, and he vowed to put taxpayer dollars to efficient use in exploring the universe and retaining the nation’s lead on geopolitical competitors in space. “I have lived the American dream, and I owe this nation a great debt,” said Isaacman, who founded his first business at 16 in his parents' basement and would go on to found an online payments company, Shift4, that would make him a billionaire. Isaacman is also an avid pilot who self-funded and led two private missions to orbit on Crew Dragon. Leading NASA would be “the privilege of a lifetime,” he said. The hearing took place in the Russell Senate Office building next to the US Capitol on Wednesday morning, in an expansive room with marbled columns and three large chandeliers. There was plenty of spaceflight royalty on hand, including the four astronauts who will fly on the Artemis II mission, as well as the six private citizens who flew with Isaacman on his two Dragon missions. “This may be the most badass assemblage we’ve had at a Senate hearing,” said US Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, chair of the committee, commenting on the astronauts in the room. However, when the meeting got down to brass tacks, there were sharp questions for Isaacman. Cruz opened the hearing by stating his priorities for NASA clearly and explicitly: He is most focused on ensuring the United States does not cede any of its preeminence to China in space, and this starts with low-Earth orbit and the Moon. “Make no mistake, the Chinese Communist Party has been explicit in its desire to dominate space, putting a fully functional space station in low-Earth orbit and robotic rovers on the far side of the Moon,” he said. “We are not headed for the next space race; it is already here.” Cruz wanted Isaacman to commit to not just flying human missions to the Moon, but also to a sustained presence on the surface or in cislunar space. In response, Isaacman said he would see that NASA returns humans to the Moon as quickly as possible, beating China in the process. This includes flying Artemis II around the Moon in 2026, and then landing the Artemis III mission later this decade. The disagreement came over what to do after this. Isaacman, echoing the Trump administration, said the agency should also press onward, sending humans to Mars as soon as possible. Cruz, however, wanted Isaacman to say NASA would establish a sustained presence at the Moon. The committee has written authorizing legislation to mandate this, Cruz reminded Isaacman. “If that’s the law, then I am committed to it,” Isaacman said. Cruz also sought Isaacman’s commitment to flying the International Space Station through at least 2030, which is the space agency’s current date for retiring the orbital laboratory. Isaacman said that seemed reasonable and added that NASA should squeeze every possible bit of research out of it until then. However, when Cruz pressed Isaacman about the Lunar Gateway, a space station NASA is developing to fly in an elliptical orbit around the Moon, Isaacman would not be drawn in. He replied that he would work with Congress and space agency officials to determine which programs are working and which ones are not. The Gateway is a program championed by Cruz since it is managed by Johnson Space Center in Texas. Parochial interests aside, a lot of space community stakeholders question the value of the Gateway to NASA’s exploration plans. One of the most tense interactions came between Isaacman and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who wanted commitments from Isaacman that he would not close any of NASA’s 10 field centers, and also that the space agency would fly the Artemis II and Artemis III missions on the Space Launch System rocket. Regarding field centers, there has been discussion about making the space agency more efficient by closing some of them. This is a politically sensitive topic, and naturally, politicians from states where those centers are located are protective of them. At the same time, there is a general recognition that it would be more cost-effective for NASA to consolidate its operations as part of modernization. Isaacman did not answer Cantwell's question about field centers directly. Rather, he said he had not been fully briefed on the administration’s plans for NASA’s structure. “Senator, there’s only so much I can be briefed on in advance of a hearing,” he said. In response to further prodding, Isaacman said, “I fully expect to roll up my sleeves” when it came to ideas to restructure NASA. Cantwell and other Senators pressed Isaacman on plans to use NASA’s Space Launch System rocket as part of the overall plan to get astronauts to the lunar surface. Isaacman sounded as if he were on board with flying the Artemis II as envisioned—no surprise, then, that this crew was in the audience—and said he wanted to get a crew of Artemis III to the lunar surface as quickly as possible. But he questioned why it has taken NASA so long, and at such great expense, to get its deep space human exploration plans moving. He noted, correctly, that presidential administrations dating back to 1989 have been releasing plans for sending humans to the Moon or Mars, and that significantly more than $100 billion has been spent on various projects over nearly four decades. For all of that, Isaacman and his private Polaris Dawn crewmates remain the humans to have flown the farthest from Earth since the Apollo Program. They did so last year. “Why is it taking us so long, and why is it costing us so much to go to the Moon?” he asked. In one notable exchange, Isaacman said NASA’s current architecture for the Artemis lunar plans, based on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, is probably not the ideal “long-term” solution to NASA’s deep space transportation plans. The smart reading of this is that Isaacman may be willing to fly the Artemis II and Artemis III missions as conceived, given that much of the hardware is already built. But everything that comes after this, including SLS rocket upgrades and the Lunar Gateway, could be on the chopping block.Ars wrote moreabout why this is a reasonable path forward last September. Some of the most intelligent questions came from US Sen. Andy Kim, D-New Jersey. During his time allotment, Kim also pressed Isaacman on the question of a sustained presence on the Moon. Isaacman responded that it was critical for NASA to get astronauts on the Moon, along with robotic missions, to determine the “economic, scientific, and national security value” of the Moon. With this information, he said, NASA will be better positioned to determine whether and why it should have an enduring presence on the Moon. If this were so, Kim subsequently asked what the economic, scientific, and national security value of sending humans to Mars was. Not responding directly to this question, Isaacman reiterated that NASA should do both Moon and Mars exploration in parallel. NASA will need to become much more efficient to afford that, and some of the US Senators appeared skeptical. But Isaacman seems to truly believe this and wants to take a stab at making NASA more cost-effective and \"mission focused.\" Throughout the hearing, Isaacman appeared to win the approval of various senators with his repeated remarks that he was committed to NASA’s science programs and that he was eager to help NASA uphold its reputation for making the impossible possible. He also said it is a \"fundamental\" obligation of the space agency to inspire the next generation of scientists. A challenging moment came during questioning from Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who expressed his concern about Isaacman’s relationship to SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Isaacman was previously an investor in SpaceX and has paid for two Dragon missions.In a letter written in March, Isaacman explained how he would disentangle his \"actual and apparent\" conflicts of interest with SpaceX. However, Markey wanted to know if Isaacman would be pulling levers at NASA for Musk, and for the financial benefit of SpaceX. Markey pressed multiple times on whether Musk was in the room at Mar-A-Lago late last year when Trump offered Isaacman the position of NASA administrator. Isaacman declined to say, reiterating multiple times that his meeting was with Trump, not anyone else. Asked if he had discussed his plans for NASA with Musk, Isaacman said, “I have not.” Earlier in the hearing, Isaacman sought to make clear that he was not beholden to Musk in any way. “My loyalty is to this nation, the space agency, and its world-changing mission,” Isaacman said. Yes, he acknowledged he would talk to contractors for the space agency. It is important to draw on a broad range of perspectives, Isaacman said. But he wanted to make this clear: NASA works for the nation, and the contractors, he added, “work for us.” A full committee vote on Isaacman is expected later this month after April 15, and if successful, the nomination would pass to the full Senate. Isaacman could be confirmed late this month or in May. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "Dozens of hours worth of dystopian puzzle solving awaits. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I am prepared to break my own rules and impulse buy theOddworld bundlethat has just popped up on Fanatical. It includes every single Oddworld game—a series of lavishly animated 2D puzzle platformers starring a weird-looking green guy—for just one dollar, a price that compares extremely favourably to its usual $84.92. That dollar gets you six games (though one of them, New 'n' Tasty, is a remake of another, Abe's Oddysee) as well as a DLC level and costume for New 'n' Tasty. They are: The games are a mixed bag, but I reckon Abe's Oddysee is a must play. It debuted on the original PlayStation back in 1997 and broke the mould of that era by taking place on a 2D plane. That allowed a lot of headroom for character animations that looked absolutely gorgeous at the time, and while it feels a little clumsy in the hand by modern standards, it's still richly atmospheric and the right amount of bonkers. There are some other good Oddworlds, too. As I mentioned before, New 'n' Tasty is a remake of the first Oddworld and worth prioritizing if you don't have patience for antiquity. Exoddus is a direct sequel to the first and feels kinda the same, albeit on a grander scale. In my opinion—not one shared byour reviewer—the most recent Soulstorm is the best place to start: it's a completely modernised take on the original format. And who can forget Stranger's Wrath? It's the oddity of the bundle and I don't mean that in the sense that you should keep a wide berth. It takes the series into proper 3D environments, with third-person platforming and first-person shooting. It was very well-received back in 2005, and comes recommended if you miss the days when all games were brown. I'm not sure how long this bundle will last, but it'savailable now on Fanatical.

    "title": "Schedule 1 is the kind of instant Steam hit that was only ever going to come from a complete rando",
    "article_text": "The corporate mind cannot comprehend Schedule 1. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. More than two weeks after launch, Schedule 1 is still the top-selling paid Steam game. That means that the open world drug-dealing RPG is raking in more dough thanAssassin's Creed Shadowson Steam, which released only five days earlier. Its active player count is often over 300,000 (with a peak of over 450k), suggesting the $20 early access game has sold at least a million copies (or maybe a lot more). Besides the music and some graffiti art, Schedule 1 was entirely made by one guy in Australia named Tyler. Isn't it funny how it always happens this way? A modest game made by a solo dev or a very small team with zero pedigree bursts onto Steam with something so instantly compelling and undeniable that it overshadows the efforts of gigantic publishers with marketing budgets. You can chalk up some of that momentum to Steam's recommendation algorithm, which favors games that accrue lots of wishlists and positive reviews, but outliers like Schedule 1 or February's breakoutREPOonly show up on Valve's radar in the first place because the bigger studios just don't have it in them. I firmly believe a large group of people could not have made Schedule 1. It's too strange, specific, and well…about drugs. That'd be the first obstacle, right? If an established studio was hearing a pitch for an open world RPG about building a drug empire one baggie of kush at a time, at least one person would raise their hand and ask a question that budding solo devs never ask themselves: \"Can we even sell that on a PlayStation?\" Maybe? Obviously there are lots of console games with drugs in them, but you won't find dozens of dealing sims on the PlayStation Store like you can in the lawless lands of Steam. A quick search of the Xbox store rang up a handful (including the first Drug Dealing Simulator from Movie Games SA, thepublisher currently looking into whether Schedule 1 infringes its copyright), which was a little surprising. Even if you make it to the store, could you count on promotion from the platform? Nintendo would be a non-starter. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Assuming our theoretical big studio take on Schedule 1 got the green light from a major publisher, the first thing it'd do is fail to capture its charm by making everything look too real. A miles-wide city, globally-illuminated grow lights, windy grass—there's just no chance in hell that a fully-staffed art department would land on Schedule 1's lanky, goofball-shaped humans whose simple features make faces memorable and whose gigantic eyes reveal how baked they are from a block away. The EAs, Ubisofts, and Activisions of the world could not resist producing crystal meth textures so impressive that half of Steam's users can barely render them. I know that'd kill my interest pretty quick. Schedule 1's textureless world and cast who'd fit right into an Adult Swim animation was likely the practical consideration of a solo dev who is primarily a programmer, not an artist, but the game's softness lends a needed levity to an edgy premise. Without it, you get those Drug Dealer Simulator games I mentioned before, which look so generic that my eyes scroll right past them. The next thing a big studio would do is put its Schedule 1 in front of focus groups until everything unique about it was axed. All of thosegenuinely immersive step-by-step minigameswhere you buy seeds, plant them, water them, harvest them, individually package them, peddle them, and then eventually appreciate reaching the point where employees can automate some of it? Fat chance. Someone with a spreadsheet would decide that's too complicated and streamline it until it was as easy as growing wheat in Minecraft. That's not to say that big developers never do anything innovative or unexpected, but more often than not we see them taking inspiration from weird little indie games rather than the other way around, and when they do, they often sand down the edges. Starfield, for instance,backed away from punitive survival systemsthat would've made players consider atmospheric conditions, radiation levels, and what spacesuit you put on before stepping foot on an unexplored planet. Focus tests said that was too difficult, so instead, we got an oxygen meter that's just a glorified stamina bar. By the same token, a bigger studio wouldn't let its Schedule 1 be so perfectly imperfect. The real Schedule 1 is dense with systems that you rarely see attempted all in the same game, no matter the team size: a clockwork world full of named citizens with schedules, dynamic employee programming, melee combat, guns, interior decorating, skateboarding, time management, stealth, pickpocketing, smuggling, driving, real estate, bartering, gambling. I honestly don't think a bigger studio would have the guts to let some systems be sort of bad for a while I'd describe around half of those systems as \"rough to functional\" in their early access state, but they're good enough to coalesce into one majorly impressive simulation. I honestly don't think a bigger studio would have the guts to let some systems be sort of bad for a while, even if it meant the whole game was richer for it. It'd more likely choose a smaller number of things to do well. Paradox came close to putting out a super ambitious, likely quite janky early access life sim last year, but itpulled the plug on Life by Youand abandoned years of work because it didn't think the game could cut it. The struggling publisher might've been right, but we'll never know, and an indie team, if it could pursue such a big project, would've just released the thing and found out. The other thing a big studio can't replicate isn't the big studio's fault: PC gamers love to give small devs a chance. Two decades of Steam browsing have trained us to recognize potential in games that have room to grow, and Valve's formalized early access program helps calibrate expectations. No matter what version of Schedule 1 a billion-dollar publisher could put out, its involvement would immediately take grace off the table. We love to feel like we're getting in on the ground floor of the next Balatro, REPO, or BattleBit Remastered. That's because we know that the biggest games of the year are the ones you won't find on any calendar or website's radar. The year in gaming, and especially the year inPC gaming, is paved inweird little gamesthat come out of nowhere, and 2025 has already produced an all-timer weirdo in Schedule 1.

    "title": "Trump threatens Iran with military force",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he has a deadline in mind for reaching a deal with Tehran over its nuclear program, stating that he would“absolutely”consider military action if negotiations fail. The two countries are set to engage in talks in Oman on Saturday, initiated by Trump, to address concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The US president has claimed that the discussions will be direct, while Tehran insists they will remain indirect, saying Washington cannot be trusted. Asked whether he expects“something definitive”to emerge from the meeting, Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that he views the Oman talks as the beginning of a process, while confirming that he has a specific deadline in mind. “It’s a start. We have a little time, but we don’t have much time. Because we’re not going to let them have a nuclear weapon,”Trump said.“When you start talks, you know if they’re going along well or not. And I would say the conclusion would be when I think they’re not going along well. So that’s just a feeling.” Earlier this week, Trump warned it would“be a very bad day for Iran”if the negotiations collapse. Asked by reporters whether this means he is willing to use force, the president made his position clear. Oh, if necessary? Absolutely...With Iran, yeah, if it requires military, we’re going to have military… Israel will obviously be very much involved in that – they’ll be the leader of that. During his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) – a multinational agreement aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. Since returning to office in January, he has reinstated his ‘maximum pressure’ policy, accusing Tehran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon and imposing new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector. In early March, Trump revealed that he had sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing renewed negotiations. He warned that if Tehran rejected the offer, it could face military action“the likes of which it has never seen.” Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful and has denounced the US sanctions as illegal and unjustified. Iranian officials have said the country is prepared to respond to any aggression and has reportedly placed the military on high alert. Speaking at a National Nuclear Technology Day ceremony on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi would deliver Khamenei’s instructions during the Oman talks. “As the Supreme Leader has stated, the Islamic Republic is ready for engagement… but this engagement must be indirect, dignified, and accompanied by clear guarantees, because we still do not trust the other side,”a press release from the president’s office reads.",

Pezeshkian insisted Tehran’s commitments under the JCPOA, from which Washington unilaterally withdrew, had been fulfilled.“If they believe we have weakened and can be challenged, they are under a naïve illusion,”he said. Pezeshkian also rejected Western claims that Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, despite what he said were hundreds of inspections. “We are not pursuing nuclear weapons, and never have,”he said.International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said late last year that Iran had ramped up uranium enrichment to 60% purity, raising some concerns. Weapons-grade material requires enrichment of around 90%.",

    "title": "How Israel hunts and executes Palestinian medics",
    "article_text": "The Israeli army has executed 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza, buried them and lied about them being“terrorists.”For those paying attention, this barbarism is not new, only the latest war crime committed by Israel in a litany of war crimes over the decades. The combination of the medics being tied up, executed and buried in a mass grave was so horrific that even usually indifferent global media reported on it, albeit without the outrage that would have accompanied such reports were the perpetrator an enemy of the West. (Warning:disturbing video.) On March 31, Jonathan Whittall, the Head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OCHA)postedon X,“First responders should never be a target. Yet today@UNOCHAsupported@PalestineRCSand Civil Defense to retrieve colleagues from a mass grave in#Rafah#Gazathat was marked with the emergency light from one of their crushed ambulances.” His thread went onto detailhow a week prior, on March 23, contact was lost with ten Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and six Civil Defense first responders, in five ambulances and one fire truck, who’d been dispatched to collect injured people, noting,“For days, OCHA coordinated to reach the site but our access was only granted 5 days later.” When they finally accessed the site, they“recovered the buried bodies of 8 PRCS, 6 Civil Defense and 1 UN staff,”he wrote,noting,“They were killed in their uniforms. Driving their clearly marked vehicles. Wearing their gloves. On their way to save lives. This should never have happened.” Palestinian Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, separatelysaid,“One of the Civil Defense crews had his feet tied, another had his clothes removed from his upper body, another was beheaded. Among all the martyrs, the least harmed had 20 bullets fired at him, in his chest.” According tothe PRCS, a ninth EMT is missing and is believed to have been detained. The UN, The Red Cross, and OCHA have all issued statements of outrage and condemnation of these murders. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Secretary General Jagan Chapagainsaid:“They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked. They should have returned to their families; they did not. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.” According to Chapagain, 30 PRCS volunteers and staff have been killed since October 2023 alone. OCHA called the murders“a huge blow to us”and said,“these abhorrent acts require accountability.”According tothe UN,“408 aid workers including more than 280 UNRWA staff have been killed in Gaza since the war began on 7 October 2023.” Tom Fletcher, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator,wrote,“They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives. We demand answers & justice.” The GuardiancitesPRCS’ Dr. Bashar Murad, who spoke to one of the paramedics in the convoy: “He informed us that he was injured and requested assistance, and that another person was also injured. A few minutes later, during the call, we heard the sound of Israeli soldiers arriving at the location, speaking in Hebrew. ‘Gather them at the wall and bring some restraints to tie them.’ This indicated that a large number of the medical staff were still alive.” The Israeli army media spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, predictablydeniedIsraeli army wrong-doing and blamed Hamas, claiming the ambulances were“advancing suspiciously”toward Israeli forces. He declared the execution of the medics be an elimination of“a Hamas military operative, along with 8 other terrorists from Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.” Observers on XrebuffedShoshani, including pointing out the Israeli army has been attacking ambulances for a very long time. I can speak from personal experience. During the January 2009Israeli war on Gaza, I was among a handful of international volunteers riding in PRCS ambulances, to document their work and the victims they rescued. The first night of the Israeli land invasion, we werebased ina PRCS center in Ezbet abed Rabbo, east of Jabaliya, with Israeli shelling around us. By morning, we had to evacuate. By the end of the war, the center was nearly destroyed.But in terms of direct attacks on ambulances, and hospitals, I can attest they occurred against unarmed medics in ambulances not carrying any Palestinian resistance, but retrievingwoundedorkilledPalestinian civilians,including elderlyones. In one instance, an Israeli sniperfired at least 14 shotsat medics and the ambulance I was in,targeting the uniformed medicsduring supposed ceasefire hours, shooting one medic in the leg and damaging the vehicle. A week prior, a medic I had accompanied one dangerous evening in the northwest of Gazawas killed the next daywhen the Israeli army fired a flechette shell (dart bomb) directly at his ambulance, shredding him with the razor sharp darts, killing him. Survivors from the scene corroborated there were no resistance, only medics and wounded and killed civilians. A week later, the Israeli army repeatedly bombed al-Quds hospital, meaning medics had to evacuate to al-Shifa hospital, risking being shot by Israeli soldiers while doing so. I was with the medics andsaw the damageand resulting fire from the Israeli bombing of the hospital. I latertook testimoniesfrom other PRCS medics who had been targeted by the Israeli army, some multiple times over the years. Two medics told me how after getting permission from Israel, via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), toretrieve the wounded and the dead, three ambulances and an ICRC jeep came under Israeli fire repeatedly in northern Gaza. “We were driving to the area, speaking with the Israelis on the phone. They’d tell us which way to drive, what road to take. When we got near the wounded, Israeli soldiers started firing. I told them, ‘We have coordination’ and they said to wait. Then they began firing at us again.” According to thePalestinian Centre for Human Rights(PCHR), that same day, Israeli soldiers fired on a convoy of 11 ambulances led by a clearly marked ICRC vehicle in central Gaza, injuring an ICRC staff member and damaging the vehicle. Another medic was shot in the leg while on a mission for PRCS in May 2008, and was twice targeted by Israeli snipers during the 2009 war. He was also in a building that was being bombed while emergency workers tried to evacuate the victims. “I was with Dr. Issa Saleh coming down the stairs from the sixth floor of an apartment building in Jabaliya, evacuating a martyr, when the Israelis again shelled the building. They knew there were medics inside. They could see our uniforms and the ambulances outside.”Dr. Saleh was killed, decapitated by the bombing. The testimonies I took then included many more cases of medics going to save injured Palestinians and coming under Israeli fire, preventing them from reaching those who needed help. Reports at the time also spoke of ahandwritten orderin Hebrew found in Gaza, directing Israeli soldiers to“open fire also upon rescue.” In 2007, in the West Bank, during an Israeli invasion of Nablus,I saw Israeli soldiers takea Palestinian Medical Relief (PRM) volunteer (who had been part of a group escorting civilians to their old city homes) hostage, blindfold and handcuff him and use him as a human shield. Even back then, targeted arrest and detention of medics was common as a form of collective punishment for the volunteers providing essential emergency services to wounded Palestinians. When not arrested, medics and ambulances would still be routinely denied access to emergency areas, denying the wounded the attention they desperately needed. Fast forward to 2023 and 2024. The Israeli army repeatedly bombed hospitals throughout Gaza, invaded them, occupied and destroyed them, routinely killing medics, doctors and emergency workers. It is clear that for Israeli soldiers, killing medical workers is a policy, whether in ambulances or hospitals. It’s also clear that while words of condemnation will sometimes be uttered by Western powers, Israel is never held accountable for these crimes. In January, Iwrote aboutDr. Hussam Abu Safiya, a Palestinian doctor from northern Gaza abducted and imprisoned by the Israeli army last December. In that article I noted that three doctors from Gaza in Israeli prisons had already been tortured to death in the last year plus, and that there is grave concern for Dr. Abu Safiya’s life. Since then, other Palestinian hostages released from Israeli detention have confirmed Dr. Abu Safiya is being tortured. More recently, the Israeli Beersheba Court has issued a six-month administrative detention order for Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, administrative detention being the means Israel uses to imprison Palestinians without charge. The abduction and torture of Palestinian doctors is another aspect of Israel’s all-out attack on Gaza’s health system. It is part of Israel’s attacks on Palestinians themselves, depriving them of life-saving care, part of thedecades-long policy ofkilling Palestinians by every means possible, including by preventing the entry of medical equipment and food, starving Palestinians who escaped bombs and sniping. I will post the same rhetorical question I’ve posed ad nauseam: What would the international reaction be like if it were Russia point-blank assassinating uniformed, unarmed medics? It would be non-stop 24/7 howling in corporate media, victims faces and stories spoken of, demands for more sanctions... But Israel does this again and again over the decades and all Palestinians get are muted words of concern and calls for investigation, allowing Israel to continue slaughtering medics and emergency workers unabated. No justice.",

    "title": "Global financial system entering ‘unchartered territory’ – Deutsche Bank",
    "article_text": "The US-China tariff escalation is moving the global financial system into“unchartered territory,”and could cause“outright financial war,”George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank’s global head of foreign exchange research, has warned. Saravelos issued the warning in a note to clients on Wednesday, which was quoted by multiple media outlets. The analyst, who has repeatedly warned about a looming dollar crisis and a global loss of trust in the US currency, described the current situation as a“collapse”in markets. “We are witnessing a simultaneous collapse in the price of all US assets, including equities, the dollar versus alternative reserve FX and the bond market. We are entering unchartered territory in the global financial system,”he wrote. The global market is rapidly de-dollarizing faster than previously anticipated, and it remains unclear“how orderly this process can remain,”Saravelos warned. The current situation appears to be different from a“typical crisis environment,”when the market“would be hoarding dollar liquidity to secure funding for its underlying US asset base,”he noted. “Dynamics here seem to be very different: the market has lost faith in US assets, so that instead of closing the asset-liability mismatch by hoarding dollar liquidity it is actively selling down the US assets themselves,”Saravelos wrote, adding that the actions of the administration of US President Donald Trump have been“encouraging the sell-off in US Treasuries.” The US-China trade war may have serious implications for the global economy and risks devolving into an“outright financial war,”given that the extreme tariffs imposed by Trump have left little room“for an escalation on the trade front,”Saravelos warned. Beijing now“appears to be maintaining the optionality of weaponizing the currency while signaling a far more supportive domestic economic stance.” “The next phase risks being an outright financial war involving Chinese ownership of US assets, both on the official and private sector front. It is important to note there can be no winner to such a war: it will damage both the owner (China) and the producer (US) of those assets. The loser will be the global economy,”he wrote. China has become the central target of Trump’s purported effort to straighten out America’s trade balance, which involves the introduction of“retaliatory”tariffs on most of the world’s nations. In March, Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports, adding an additional 34% last week. Beijing responded in kind, introducing a 34% tariff on US goods – after which Trump slapped on another 50%, bringing the total to 104%. This week, China rolled an additional 50% on American imports, bringing the levy to a total of 84%. Trump responded by raising the tariffs to 125% on Wednesday before the latest Chinese measure even took effect.",

    "title": "Trump hikes China tariff to 125%",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has raised the tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% in response to retaliatory measures imposed by Beijing earlier on Wednesday. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote that“based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.” He expressed hope that Beijing would realize that“ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” The move came hours after China’s Finance Ministry announced a tariff hike of its own, which brought tariffs levied on American imports to a total of 84%, thus mirroring Washington’s previous increase by 50%. The continual tit-for-tat escalation of the trade war between the world’s two top economies was set in motion when Trump imposed a 20% tariff on all Chinese goods in March. Last week, he added an additional 34%, to which Beijing responded in kind. Writing on Truth Social, the US president also announced a 90-day pause and a“substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately”granted to the multitude of other nations that Washington has recently imposed sweeping tariffs on. Trump cited calls made by“more than 75 countries”to the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative. According to the president, these nations expressed willingness to discuss trade barriers, tariffs, currency manipulation, and non-monetary tariffs. Trump also pointed out that, unlike China,“these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States.”",

    "title": "Chinese companies could be removed from US stock markets – Treasury Secretary",
    "article_text": "Washington is considering delisting Chinese companies from US markets amid the escalating tariff war, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said. Speaking to Fox Business on Wednesday, Bessent described China’s latest move to raise its tariffs on American goods to a total of 84% as“unfortunate.”The measure was announced after US President Donald Trump increased the tariffs on all Chinese imports to 104% earlier this week. “I think it’s unfortunate that the Chinese actually don’t want to come and negotiate because they are the worst offenders in the international trading system,”Bessent claimed, suggesting that the US could end up imposing even higher tariffs. “If China starts devaluing, then that is a tax on the rest of the world, and everyone will have to keep raising their tariffs to offset the devaluation. So I would urge them not to do that and to come to the table,”he said. Asked whether Washington is considering delisting Chinese companies from US stock exchanges, Bessent stated that all options are on the table and that it’s up to the president to do so. Currently, 286 Chinese companies, including Alibaba, one of the world’s largest retailers and e-commerce operators, are listed on US stock exchanges.“That will be Trump’s decision,”he said. The new threats come after China introduced an additional 50% tariff – due to take effect on Thursday – on all American goods. The measure comes on top of the previously imposed 34% tariff, China’s Finance Ministry announced earlier on Wednesday. “The US’ practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,”the ministry said in a statement. Earlier this week, Beijing vowed to fight the trade war with the US“to the end”and“firmly defend its interests.”Apart from cranking up tariffs, China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US over its practices, as well as placing certain American businesses on its ‘unreliable entity’ list or subjecting them to export controls. The escalating trade war comes amid Trump’s efforts to straighten out America’s import-export balance, which involves the introduction of massive retaliatory tariffs on most countries. In March, Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports. Last week, he added an additional 34%, bringing the total to 54%. Beijing retaliated in kind, introducing a 34% tariff on US goods – after which Trump added another 50%, bringing the total to 104%.",

    "title": "Germany freezes major refugee program – media",
    "article_text": "Germany has temporarily suspended its participation in a UN refugee resettlement program, the DPA news agency has reported, citing the country’s Interior Ministry. Under the scheme, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) asks host countries to take in asylum seekers who are deemed in particular need of protection. The results of the snap general election in February suggest that anti-immigration sentiments in Germany appear to have grown, following a series of violent incidents perpetrated by foreign nationals in recent months. The center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which both advocate tougher migration policies, emerged as the most popular parties. In an article on Tuesday, the DPA reported that Berlin had attributed its decision to freeze new refugee admissions to ongoing coalition government negotiations between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD). According to the media outlet, exceptions will be made for asylum seekers whose proceedings are already well advanced. The two political parties have reportedly agreed to terminate existing voluntary refugee admission programs and not to commit to new programs. Germany has pledged to the UNHCR and the European Commission to host 13,100 asylum seekers in 2024 and 2025, DPA reported, adding that 5,061 of those individuals have already arrived in the country. Early last month, Der Spiegel, citing a study by the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA), alleged that Germany, which has for years been the top destination for asylum seekers in the EU, witnessed a considerable drop in new applications in 2024. The apparent downward trend coincided with the German government’s decision to expand border controls with EU neighbors, including Poland, Austria, and the Czech Republic. Ukrainians comprised nearly 20% of applicants rejected by German authorities, according to a RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) report in February, citing the federal government. According to government statistics released in September 2024, the total number of refugees living in Germany stood at nearly 3,5 million in June of that year.",

    "title": "USAID paid Czech groups to ‘wage war’ against Russia – former police chief",
    "article_text": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) financed a long-running anti-Russian campaign in the Czech Republic, former Czech police chief Stanislav Novotny has told RT. In an exclusive interview on Wednesday, Novotny said Washington’s primary channel for funding political projects abroad had played a major role in shaping Czech-Russian relations. According to the former police chief, who is now a lawyer and journalist, US billionaire George Soros has also had a significant influence on the deterioration of ties between Prague and Moscow through his Open Society Foundations. “A lot of money was poured into civil society organizations of political nature which were waging a war against Russia,”Novotny said.“Such organizations should simply be removed,”he added, accusing the Czech government of spending taxpayers’ money on stoking anti-Russian sentiment by contributing financially to the organizations. US President Donald Trump launched the process of dismantling USAID shortly after returning to office in January, citing high costs and limited benefits associated with its programs. He also started negotiations with Russia aimed at improving ties and resolving the Ukraine conflict. While commenting on the developments around USAID in early February, Novotny described the agency as“the monster that has taken over the world,”alleging it“orchestrated wars, organized mass migration, broke up national cohesion and destroyed indigenous cultures.” The Czech Republic was formed in 1993 after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Prior to those events it was part of communist Czechoslovakia, a key member of the Soviet Union-led Eastern Bloc. Prague has adopted a notably anti-Russian stance in recent years, particularly in response to the events in Ukraine, becoming one of Kiev’s staunchest supporters and labeling Russia a“terrorist state.” Hundreds of Soviet-era monuments have been removed or modified in the EU state since the 1990s, with a renewed wave of demolitions after the 2014 armed coup in Kiev, Crimea’s decision to join Russia, and the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The campaign to demolish the monuments was“among the policies that were aimed at provoking fear and hatred towards the Russians,”Novotny argued. Novotny, who founded the Independent Media Association in the Czech Republic, said he came to Moscow to give the RT interview because“talking to Russian journalists is practically prohibited.”RT and other Russian media have been banned in the EU since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has praised Russian ice hockey star Alexander Ovechkin, calling him a“great player”and“gentleman”after he broke the National Hockey League’s all-time scoring record. The 39-year-old Washington Capitals forward achieved the milestone during Sunday’s game against the New York Islanders, surpassing the long-standing record of 894 goals held by Canadian legend Wayne Gretzky. “Great hockey player, a great gentleman just broke the record of Wayne Gretzky. The great one is Wayne Gretzky, but we have another great one, huh? Just broke the record, it was great,”Trump said on Tuesday. Widely considered the greatest hockey player of all time, Gretzky scored 894 goals over 1,487 games. Ovechkin matched that mark in his 1,486th game and surpassed it with his 895th goal in his next game. The record-breaking moment came at 12:34 of the second period against the Islanders, when Ovechkin took a feed from Tom Wilson and fired a shot past fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin – Ovechkin’s first ever goal against the goaltender. Play stopped to honor the milestone, with Ovechkin receiving congratulations from NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and Gretzky himself. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Ovechkin on Monday for his“outstanding achievement.” “You have surpassed legendary players in the number of goals scored in regular-season NHL games,”Putin said. Beating Gretzky’s seemingly unbreakable record“has become not just a personal triumph, but a true celebration for fans in Russia and around the world,”the president added. Ovechkin is a three-time world champion with the Russian national team and won the 2018 Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals, the team he has spent his entire NHL career with. The Russian embassy in the US said earlier this week that“literally all of America”had rallied behind Ovechkin’s pursuit of Gretzky’s record. As a result, the embassy noted a soaring interest in organizing a match between Russian and North American teams. During a phone call on March 18, Putin and Trump discussed hockey and the possibility of organizing games between American and Russian players from the NHL and KHL. With Russia sidelined from many international competitions due to Ukraine-related sanctions, the NHL remains a rare platform where Russian players continue to showcase the strength of the nation’s hockey tradition.",

    "title": "White House ordered to reinstate AP",
    "article_text": "A federal judge has ordered the White House to restore access for the Associated Press to presidential events. The news agency was kicked out of the press pool for refusing to adopt the term“Gulf of America”for what has traditionally been known as the Gulf of Mexico. Reporters from AP, one of the world’s oldest, were barred from Air Force One and the Oval Office after in February the agency declined to use“Gulf of America,”the name designated by US President Donald Trump for the body of water bordering the southeastern coast of North America. It opted to stick with the traditional term Gulf of Mexico, arguing that it is well established and recognized across the globe. Trump himself has lashed out at the AP, branding it“a radical left organization.”In response to the ban, the agency filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the exclusion violated First Amendment protections of press freedom. White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich has argued that while the agency’s right to“dishonest reporting”is protected by law, it does not have a“privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces”where certain presidential events take place. On Tuesday, US District Judge Trevor McFadden ruled in favor of the AP, stating that the government cannot exclude journalists from presidential events based on their editorial decisions. The White House has until the end of the week to appeal the order. In his ruling, McFadden stressed that the court does not order the government to grant the AP permanent access to presidential events and“does not bestow special treatment”upon the agency. “The AP is not necessarily entitled to the ‘first in line every time’ permanent press pool access it enjoyed... But it cannot be treated worse than its peer wire service either,”he said, noting that the order does not impose any rules on government officials about who they give interviews to or whose questions to take. AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton welcomed the decision, noting that the ruling“affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation.”Meanwhile, AP Executive Editor Julie Pace wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that the lawsuit was much bigger than a dispute over a body of water.“It’s really about whether the government can control what you say,”she said.",

    "article_text": "The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has topped a major nationwide public support poll for the first time, outpacing Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz’s alliance. According to a new Ipsos survey released on Wednesday, the AfD has 25% of public support, while the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) bloc trails at 24%. Compared to the previous poll in early March, the AfD gained three points, while the conservatives dropped by five. Support for outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD) remained unchanged at 15%, while the Greens slipped to 11%, and are now tied with the Left Party, which gained two points to reach its highest level since December 2016. The survey polled 1,000 eligible voters on April 4-5. Das erste Mal in der noch jungen Geschichte der AfD sind wir stärkste Kraft in Deutschland. Danke für das große Vertrauen - der politische Wandel wird kommen!pic.twitter.com/yMPMRCeJIE AfDleaderAlice Weidel celebrated her party’s showing in a post on X:“For the first time in the AfD’s short history, we are the strongest party in Germany… Citizens want political change – not a ‘business as usual’ coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD!” In the federal election in February, the CDU/CSU won with 28.5% of the vote. CDU leader Merz, the presumed next chancellor, is now negotiating a coalition with the center-left SPD, which suffered a historic defeat, winning just 16.4%. According to German media reports, the two sides are working to finalize agreements on key issues such as migration, climate, and EU relations. One of the goals reportedly includes keeping the AfD out of power. Merz said last month that he aims to form the new government before Easter on April 20. A deal would give the coalition 328 seats in the Bundestag, comfortably above the 316 needed for a majority. Merz previously ruled out talks with the AfD, claiming that the party“stands against our Western orientation, the euro and NATO.” Analysts say the AfD’s rise in the polls reflects growing public frustration with mainstream parties and the delay in forming a coalition. “This survey clearly shows that people are becoming increasingly impatient, they want concrete negotiation results. They want to know what is coming their way,”political scientist Volker Kronenberg told Die Welt. The AfD secured second place in the election with 20.8% of the vote, doubling its 2021 result of 10.4%. Despite the gains, the party remains ‘firewalled’, with mainstream political parties refusing to work with them and labeling them ‘far-right’. The party has faced backlash over controversial remarks from current and former members about Germany’s Nazi past and has been under surveillance for suspected extremism. The AfD denies it is far-right and says it defends German interests with its position on immigration.",

    "article_text": "China has raised its tariffs on American goods to a total of 84%, the Finance Ministry has announced. The measure was introduced after US President Donald Trump increased the tariffs on all Chinese imports to a whopping 104% earlier this week. Beijing has slapped an additional 50% tariff – due to take effect at noon on Thursday – on American goods, mirroring Washington’s move. This comes on top of the previously imposed 34% tariff, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. “The US’ practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China’s legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,”the document reads. In addition to the tariff hike, China’s Ministry of Commerce filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US and placed six American companies on its ‘unreliable entity’ list. An additional 12 US businesses were subjected to export controls that bar Chinese companies from supplying them with dual-use items. In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry vowed that China would fight the trade war“to the end”and“firmly defend its interests.” In a separate statement on Wednesday, the Tariff Commission of the State Council urged the“US to immediately correct its wrong practices, cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, and properly resolve differences with China through equal dialogue on the basis of mutual respect.” In March, Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese imports.

While acknowledging the adverse effects of his policy, the president defended his approach, citing the need to address trade“abuses”and bolster domestic manufacturing.",

    "article_text": "Beijing has dismissed claims by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky that a significant number of Chinese nationals are fighting alongside Russian forces against Kiev. On Tuesday, Zelensky shared a brief video featuring an individual he claimed was a Chinese citizen captured during the conflict. Heallegedthat two such individuals are in Ukrainian custody, and that“significantly more”are currently serving with the Russian military. Responding on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian branded the claims“groundless,”reiterating that Beijing consistently advises its citizens against participating in foreign armed conflicts in any capacity. ”China’s stance on the Ukrainian crisis is clear and unambiguous, and it has been widely acknowledged by the international community,”the spokesperson added. Zelensky has further claimed that Russia is“involving China directly or indirectly”in the Ukraine conflict, and called for a swift response from the US and the EU. US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce described the situation as“disturbing”and labeled China“a major enabler of Russia”in the conflict, emphasizing the urgency of President Donald Trump’s calls for a negotiated peace. China has long denied Washington’s claims that its trade with Russia bolsters the latter’s military production, insisting that unlike Western nations it remains neutral in the conflict. Last year, the administration of then-President Joe Biden referenced claims that North Korean troops were assisting in repelling a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region to justify easing restrictions on the use of American-supplied weapons by Kiev. Moscow and Pyongyang have neither confirmed nor denied the reports. Ukrainian MP Aleksandr Dubinsky, a Zelensky critic who is facing accusations of treason, has suggested that Kiev may be repeating a tactic of fabricating evidence. He posted a clip showing that the video file shared by Zelensky was originally named“Korean_Soldier_2.mp4,”although it has since been renamed. Ukrainian diplomats will have to explain to Beijing“whether it was fake or just a naming failure,”the lawmaker remarked. Russian President Vladimir Putin last month agreed to Trump’s proposal for a 30-day moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure. According to Moscow, Kiev has violated the partial ceasefire on multiple occasions, which officials have described as proof of Zelensky’s lack of trustworthiness.",

    "article_text": "Ukrainian-born Republican Congresswoman Victoria Spartz has accused the Daily Telegraph of distorting her words on Kiev making territorial concessions to Russia. The UK newspaper may have accepted a payoff from Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky to paint her in a negative light, Spartz claimed. The Telegraph published an article on Monday in which Spartz suggested that Ukraine would have to accept Russian control over some of its former territories in order to survive. She also demanded that Zelensky step down. “I just don’t see how they can be positioned to demand to keep the land. If they [Ukraine] would be winning the war, that will be very different,”Spartz was quoted as saying. The congresswoman was referring to Crimea and four other former Ukrainian regions that overwhelmingly voted in public referendums to join Russia. However, Spartz lashed out at the paper on Tuesday, suggesting that the initial headline for the article –“‘Here’s why we should give land to Russia’”– had misquoted her as advocating for Ukraine to cede territory. The headline was later changed after intervention from Spartz’s team to“Zelensky must cede land to Russia,”without quotation marks, but still kept a misleading attribution colon, according to the congresswoman. The article was“conveniently used by the Zelensky propaganda machine to smear her and President [Donald] Trump and continue blaming the United States for Zelensky’s loss and betrayal of his country,”the statement from Spatz read. The congresswoman claimed that“it’s not surprising that the UK media is as dishonest as the US mainstream media,”insisting that she has dedicated significant effort to supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.“Unfortunately, if you have morons and crooks like Zelensky and his puppet parliament running your country, it’s a lost cause,”she alleged. According to Spartz,“Ukraine is not in the position to retake its territories, nor could they agree to give them up permanently.”“Only a temporary solution with the help of the United States can be achieved, which will give each side some time to regroup. The end result of that war will have to be decided later and not just on a battlefield,”she added. The initial version of the article caused a firestorm in Kiev, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman accusing Spartz of being out of touch with her homeland.“Unlike Victoria, all of our land has always been and will always remain Ukrainian,”he said. Spartz pushed back, saying she“would not be surprised that Zelensky is paying [the] Telegraph to fabricate false headlines to continue making money on the blood of the Ukrainian people.”She added that she remains proud of her Ukrainian descent – but not of“cowards in Zelensky mafia wiping out [Ukrainian] patriots”on the battlefield.",

    "title": "Trump claims countries ‘kissing my ass’ for tariff deals",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has claimed that dozens of countries are scrambling to negotiate trade deals with the US following his sweeping new tariffs, boasting that foreign leaders are begging for exemptions to avoid the full impact of the levies. Speaking at a National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) dinner on Tuesday night, Trump said his administration is“doing very well”in early negotiations with countries already hit with a baseline 10% tariff last week –and dozens more facing even steeper duties starting Wednesday. “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,”Trump said.“They are dying to make a deal: ‘Please, please sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything, I’ll do anything sir.’” The administration previously stated that nearly 70 countries have sought talks to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, as Trump pushes for customized agreements with individual nations.“I call them tailored deals, not off the rack,”he said earlier on Tuesday at an executive order signing event at the White House. Trump also claimed that the tariff strategy is working well and predicted it would boost the Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections – dismissing critics who say the levies are backfiring on American consumers and investors. He also took aim at GOP lawmakers who supported bipartisan efforts to curb his authority to impose tariffs beyond 60 days without congressional approval. “We’re going to win the midterm elections, and we’re going to have a tremendous, thundering landslide,”Trump told Republican lawmakers and donors.“And I really think we’re helped a lot by the tariff situation that’s going on, which is a good situation… it’s going to be legendary, you watch.” The president’s comments came just ahead of his administration’s rollout of higher import duties, including a steep 104% tariff on Chinese goods. The policy, which takes full effect Wednesday, is part of Trump’s broader“reciprocal”trade agenda, aimed at pressuring countries with large trade surpluses to offer better terms to the US. The White House has said the tariffs are intended to address long-standing trade imbalances and revive domestic manufacturing. Trump insists the measures are already benefiting the US economy, claiming the country is collecting $2 billion a day in tariff revenue.",

    "title": "Trump slaps ‘proud’ China with 104% tariffs",
    "article_text": "The US has hiked tariffs on all Chinese imports to a staggering 104%, escalating the ongoing trade conflict and wiping out another $1.5 trillion from US stock markets on Tuesday. China was originally set to face a 34% tariff increase on Wednesday, as part of President Donald Trump’s“reciprocal”measures targeting virtually all US trade partners. However, after Beijing responded with a proportional 34% duty of its own, the US president raised the blanket tariff to a total of 104%. “After all of the abuses they’ve perpetrated, China is attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs,”Trump said at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner in Washington on Tuesday. That’s why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place, effective midnight tonight at 104 percent. Until they make a deal with us, that’s what it’s going to be. The White House published anamendmentto the April 2 executive order in which Trump declared a national emergency over the US trade deficit and imposed a baseline tariff on all imports to the US. The administration said that nearly 70 countries had sought negotiations to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, as Trump pursues“tailored deals”with individual nations. The president went on to say that Beijing will have to“make a deal at some point,”claiming that“they just don’t know how to get it sorted because they’re proud people.”Until then, he added, China“will now pay a big number to our Treasury.” “Right now, China is paying a 104 percent tariff, think of it… Now, it sounds ridiculous, but they charged us for many items 100 percent, 125 percent,”Trump said.“They’ve ripped us off left and right. But now it’s our turn to do the ripping.” Beijing previously condemned the escalating trade war as a form of“blackmail”and“economic bullying.”A spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday that“China will fight till the end if the US side is bent on going down the wrong path.” The latest escalation has had a significant impact on US and global stock markets. Major indices such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq suffered further declines after a brief surge earlier this week, wiping out an estimated $1.5 trillion from US markets on Tuesday. Trump acknowledged that the fallout from his move was“somewhat explosive,”but defended his strategy, claiming that“sometimes you have to mix it up a little bit.”He insisted that the tariffs are necessary to address trade“abuses”and to promote domestic manufacturing, adding that the US is already generating $2 billion a day from the tariffs.",

    "title": "Washington unveils date and agenda of next Russia-US talks",
    "article_text": "The next round of talks aimed at improving US-Russia diplomatic ties will take place in Istanbul, Türkiye on Thursday, the US State Department has confirmed. Washington and Moscow have held several rounds of high-level meetings since US President Donald Trump took office, with the next round of negotiations expected in the coming days, the Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier on Tuesday. “On April 10, US and Russian delegations will meet for a second time in Istanbul to try to make progress on further stabilizing the operations of our bilateral missions,”State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruceconfirmedat a press briefing later in the day. The US official stressed that the upcoming talks are“solely focused on our embassy operations, not on normalizing a bilateral relationship overall, which can only happen, as we’ve noted, once there is peace between Russia and Ukraine.” “There are no political or security issues on the agenda, and Ukraine is not – absolutely not – on the agenda,”she added. In recent years, Russia and the US have cut diplomatic staff at each other’s missions, imposed banking restrictions, and seized diplomatic properties. The escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 further deepened tensions and led to additional measures. Trump, however, has moved away from many Biden-era policies, calling for a swift resolution to the Ukraine conflict and a reset in bilateral ties. The first meeting between high-level Russian and US delegations took place in Riyadh on February 18, focusing on restoring embassy operations and easing restrictions. A follow-up round in Istanbul on February 27 addressed diplomatic funding and Russia’s proposal to reinstate direct flights. According to Moscow, the venue, format, and participants of this week’s talks will remain unchanged. The Russian delegation will be led by the country’s new ambassador to Washington, Aleksandr Darchiev, while the US side will be headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Eurasian Affairs Sonata Coulter.",

    "title": "I Found Elite Paraboot Dupes for Half the Price",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. A couple of years ago,GQexplored thesurprising ascendance of Paraboot’s Michael derby, a thick-soled lace-up that’s helping a generation of guys weaned on sneakers fall in love with hard-bottom shoes again. In 2025, the Michael might be the most recognizable version of the Tyrolean derby—the distinct moc-toe silhouette named for the region of the Alps that birthed it—but it’s far from the only riff on the style. Enter the Kleman Padror. I first encountered the Padror on vacation in Paris, where I was busy contemplating spending $600 on its Paraboot counterpart. Kleman has been around since the '40s, but the brand introduced the Padror decades later, to outfit members of the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French national railway company. The second I saw it I was sold. If your sneakers are sparking less joy than they used to, you’re not the only one. Part and parcel of menswear’sreturn to eleganceis a renewed emphasis on hard-bottom shoes like loafers and derbies—and the Padror might just help you kick your kicks habit for good. Its gently-rounded moc toe and chunky lug sole syncs up equally well withjeansand tees as it doesblazersandgiant chinos, not unlike a grown-man version of Clarks’s legendary Wallabees. Kleman Percival Don’t let its high-low versatility confuse you, though: the Padror is a work shoe through and through. Over the years, Kleman perfected its signature Edito grip rubber sole, which is anti-slip, abrasion-resistant, and expectedly durable. The shock-absorbent insoles are great for laying railway tracks—and even better for hoofing it to Sweetgreen for lunch. I bought the Padrors in a European size 41 (when in Paris…) and they fit perfectly. It’s hard to overstate how comfortable they are, especially if you’re on the fence about lacing up a pair of real-deal shoes. To be honest, I never cared all that much about the comfort of my kicks, but at the ripe old age of 28, I’ve learned that squished toes and cardboard-like soles will turn me into a grump far beyond my years. Countless steps in, Kleman's Padror derby is still the most comfortable proper shoe I own. A close-up shot of that signature Edito grip rubber sole, no worse for the wear. The Padrors were so comfortable out of the box that I left the store wearing them, swapping out the loafers I had on in the process. It doesn’t sound like much of an ‘a-ha!’ moment, but the ability to adjust my shoes with actuallacesfelt kind of radical—especially if your feet are used to sliding around inOur Legacy’s Camion bootsorGucci’s horsebit loafers. According to my Health app, I cleared upwards of 16,000 steps that day, and my dogs barely whimpered. Under usual circumstances, leather shoes, no matter how well I think they fit me in the dressing room, tend to leave me with a blister near my Achilles or the side of my foot. But my feet didn’t throb once. That dreaded break-in period? Virtually nonexistent. Since guiding me through the streets of Paris, the Padrors have helped me navigate the stairs of Venice, the pebbly surfaces of the Boboli Gardens in Florence, and every kind of crosswalk imaginable in New York. The leather is soft and smooth, and it's held its shape and resisted creasing over months of wear. Not only is it a go-to when I know I'll be on my feet for hours at a time, it's genuinely the most comfortable capital-S Shoe I own. Kleman Percival Kleman Percival If you, like me, were thinking about buying the Michael, Kleman’s alternative isn’t just an affordable dupe—it’s as real as it gets. The brand has been in the Tyrolean business for nearly as long as its countrymate, and its cobbling bona fides are second to none. (For what it’s worth, I tried on a pair of Michaels on that same trip, and I struggle to imagine that they’re any more comfortable.) Close to $250 isn't quite a bargain, but when you factor in how damn good the Padror looks with everything I wear—and just how often I wear it—the menswear math more than checks out. Is the Kleman Padror worth it?Oui,a thousand timesoui.",

    "title": "Will ‘The White Lotus’ Season 4 Show Us Self-Involvement On the Ski Slopes?",
    "article_text": "The White Lotusseason 4 wasofficially announcedearlier this year, almost a month before this year's trip to Thailand hit your screen, with HBO programming executive Francesca Orsisuggesting that the next destinationwill likely be “somewhere in Europe.” A sojourn in France, perhaps? Or a return to Italy? Whatever the case, season four will present a unique creative challenge for writer Mike White. Fans are familiar enough with theWhite Lotusformula by this point to know, for the most part, what to expect from it—so how can he continue to subvert expectations, implement twists and keep us all on our toes, the cornerstones of any murder-mystery worth its weight in intrigue? Perhaps an entirely new location would prove fruitful. For what it's worth, White has said that he wants tomove away fromthe “crashing waves” aesthetic of the exotic, palm-decorated hotels the series has visited so far. How better else than to go somewhere with a ton of snow? It wouldn't exactly be a stretch for there to be a White Lotus Ski Resort somewhere in the Swiss Alps. It's not that the series requires total, top-to-bottom reinvention, but this season, for the first time in the show's history, it felt like fans online were onto Mike White's schemes from the beginning, and many of the finale's biggest twists were forecast by Twitter prognosticators in the weeks leading up to its air date. That's just one reason why the series may benefit from a zhuzh; it's just common logic that any media property which cautiously sticks to the blueprint will eventually become stale. Fortunately, season 4 also feels like a natural point to start reimagining what the show can look like, and what it can be. In retrospect, the first three seasons might be taken as a loosely-connected trilogy, conjoined at various points by the presence of Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) — both literally and in spirit — kindly spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), and her devious husband Greg (Jon Gries). Their story seems to conclude nicely in the finale: Belinda and son Zion (Nicholas Duvernay) get their $5 million hush-money payout and head home to enjoy being rich, while Greg is allowed to remain in Thailand as “Gary,” despite having more than likely killed his wife. It's a win-win that serves as a satisfying enough end to the Tanya arc—well, as satisfying as it can be, without Greg getting his deathly comeuppance. Will that happen in season four? We wouldn't write it off entirely. And if White does elect to bring back a different character from the first three seasons, Zion seems a decent candidate, now that he is newly rich and can serve as a living metaphor for how access to mega-bucks corrodes our sense of morality. Nevertheless, the series as a whole would be better served by a reset: leave the old characters behind, rethink the setting, and breathe some life intoThe White Lotusthat will keep it as appointment television for seasons to come. Our money is on David Duchovny hitting the slopes. Here's everything else we know aboutThe White Lotusseason four. No one has been confirmed for the cast of season four yet, but expect the internet to be flooded with theories anddream cast listsin the coming days. We've already offered our two cents on a returning character (Nicholas Duvernay's Zion) and an actor we'd like to join the cast (David Duchovny). Some others that just feelThe White Lotus? Let's pick from the cream of the crop of character actors:Steve Buscemiwould seem a go-to pick, and there's seldom a scene that Margot Martindale doesn't light up with her presence. AndPaul Giamattiwould kill it as one ofThe White Lotus' signature fuck-up dads. There isn't an itinerary at this point, but it'll be at least a year or two. You can always get yourself down to an IRL Four Seasons in the meantime. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

J.Crew’s been churning out quality menswear at approachable prices for decades now, a spinning plates act most brands struggle mightily to approximate—an oasis of dependable style nestled within your local mall.

    "title": "Why Is Timothée Chalamet Dressed for a 2003 Moshpit?",
    "article_text": "The year is 2025 and we may all be going to hell in a handbasket, but imagine, just for a moment, that it is instead the year 2003. You are about to seeSum 41and/or Taking Back Sunday perform at Warped Tour, and you’re dressed in a version of this outfitTimothée Chalametwore while buying a bagel in Los Angeles on Monday. Are you with me here? Let’s break it down. It’s hot out, so you’ve got on a thin, olive green tank top. Your keys—which may or may not be festooned with a Prada robot keychain like Chalamet’s—are hanging off your back belt loop. Your black cargo shorts—which are, at this point in time, a staple in your summer wardrobe, as they are for the actorhere in the present day—are further accessorized with a silver-studded belt. And on your feet are probably a pair of Converse-esque sneakers; in Chalamet’s case, this translates to wearing black Nike crew socks tucked into a pair ofRick OwensDrkshdw “Hollywood” high-tops, one of several unmistakable silhouettes to emerge from the dark prince of fashion’sabrasive footwear oeuvre. (Speaking from personal experience, I recently spotted several young sneakerheads sporting similar Rick Owens kicks ata rambunctious Nettspend concertin New York City.) And for those keeping track, Timmy has previously flexed his credentials as a member of the Rick “Tribe”—he’s gota few pairs of the sneakers, and he worea Rick turtleneckunder his Haider Ackermann tux jacket to the Met Gala in 2021. And maybe you’re wearing a ratty baseball hat, to ward off the unforgiving sun. Yours is ratty, no doubt, on account of all the sweating and moshing you’ve done in it. Timmy’s, meanwhile, came pre-distressed for $285 from Nahmias, the Los Angeles streetwear brand that produced several custom hoodies for hisA Complete Unknownpress tour. (The brand’s founder, Doni Nahmias, also happens to be dating Victoria Villarroel, a friend and former assistant of Chalamet’s girlfriend Kylie Jenner.) Chalamet is, after all, a Hollywood A-lister, and he’s not attending a pop-punk festival almost a quarter-century ago—he’s buying a $6 bagel in Beverly Hills. Such simpler times have never felt further away.",

    "title": "13 Best Running Jackets for Battling the Elements in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best running jackets solve all the outdoorrunningchallenges you'll face in the fall, winter, and spring. During these seasons, the weather can be wildly unpredictable, meaning it’s critical to have some outer layer on standby—either on your person or at the house—should conditions take a turn for the worse while you’re getting your miles in. As with allfitnessgear, the difference can quite literally make or break a run, as being toocoldcan make a session feel even more difficult than it’s supposed to feel. Running outerwear comes in two key but critically important distinctions:jackets for cold weatherand lighter shell jackets for transitional fall andspring weather. Cold-weather winter jackets aren’t dissimilar from puffers or fleece pieces you’d wear around town on a weekend, but do include more moisture-wicking and breathability-minded features in order to keep wearers from getting too overheated during a session. On the shell front, these are often engineered to block the wind and rain while adding as little bulk as possible. Both are important for any runner—seasoned or aspiring—to keep in their rotations so they’re prepared for the worst of the worst that Mother Nature will throw their way. We’ve done the research and the testing to determine the best of the best when it comes to all types of running jackets to ensure you and go out and focus on putting one foot in front of the other—see our favorites below. Bandit Bandit Materials:80% polyester, 20% recycled polyesterFeatures:Double zipper at front, two chest pockets, two hem pockets Why We Like It:Fleece is more than just a tremendously cozy (and, if styled right, trendy!) fabric—just ask any seasoned hiker. The fuzzy material is a longtime staple of the outdoor world because of its technical ability to wick moisture away from the body while keeping one nice and warm. That’s the case with Bandit Running’s aptly named Iceland fleece jacket, which is more than suitable for the most brutal of cold weather runs. But what stands out about this compared to other fleece jackets is the mesh back, which not only helps with breathability but also provides a sturdy structure. Plus, it doubles nicely as outwear on cold days coming and going to a track session. District Vision District Vision Material:Nylon, cottonFeatures:Water repellent, reflective detailing Why We Like It:We’re big fans ofDistrict Vision here atGQ, and this pullover half zip is the perfect exemplification of why. It's a stylish and modern update of a classic windbreaker: The highly water-resistant shell is made from a lightweight 155 gsm shell fabric and also features reflective detailing in the piping across the arms, chest, and sternum piping. The hardest thing to convey about this jacket, though, is howgreatit feels to wear it; it’s so comfortable and, for most runners, will hit all the boxes of what they’re looking for in a shell layer. Arc'teryx Arc'teryx Materials:88% nylon, 12% elastane, 100% Polyester synthetic insulationFeatures:DWR coating, stowaway hoodie, reflective elements, included flip-mitts in sleeves. Why We Like It:Arc’teryx’s insulated jacket is intended for winter mountain runs, but that shouldn’t stop you from wearing it on chilly days around town. In fact, the expertise with which this was created can be particularly beneficial for all kinds of runs. Super lightweight and warm, the Norvan uses some proprietary material to balance both weather resistance and breathability while still ensuring overall warmth. Case in point: I ran in this along the National Mall on a 30-degree day and got caught in some drizzle halfway through and still managed to stay pretty dry and warm for the remaining four miles or so I had left. Bonus: This is super packable, which means you can even roll it up and toss it in a travel bag if you’re headed to the mountains and you need another layer of warmth. Soar Running Soar Running Materials:DWR-coated Italian fabric, wool liningFeatures:Taped seams, chest and waist pockets, velcro cuffs Why We Like It:You know the saying: Rain, sleet, snow, or hail, Soar Running’s All Weather jacket is equipped to help you tackle it all—save for maybe that last one. The high-end running brand’s creme de la creme running jacket lives up to its name and kept me warm during brutal winds and cold temps and kept my body dry even in substantial rain. The texture of the All Weather is, candidly, kind of nuts. It’s nearly wool-like in feel, which may lead you to question how it’s still wind and waterproof, but the material is treated twice over with a DWR coating to eliminate the need for an interior coating. As a result, the jacket is supremely warm, and I found myself needing only a baselayer underneath it on most cold or freezing runs. While I wish it had a hoodie, the feel, and freedom of movement during wear more than make up for it. If you’re a hardcore runner looking to make an investment for now and years down the line, this is the jacket for you. Outdoor Research Outdoor Research Material:Nylon and spandex outerFeatures:Zipper chest pocket, side hand pockets Why We Like It:You shouldn’t have to spend an arm and/or a leg to get a nice winter running jacket, which is exactly the reason we love the Deviator Hoodie from Outdoor Research. The, well,outdoorbrand makes a ton of apparel that is well-suited to the elements, but the Deviator straddles the line between cost and value perfectly, offeringa lotfor its $229 tag. While it’s not treated with any sort of DWR coating, it is super breathable and very insulating, capable of handling most winter runs with relative ease. I found the sizing to be snug but not slim, which meant I could layer underneath it to give it an even warmer boost on cold days. Plus, the stretchy outer meant that it moved with me pretty well, even when I had the hood up, allowing a good range of movement when I was literally hitting my strides. If your winter gear needs an upgrade, start here. Ciele Ciele Materials:Recycled polyester, merino wool, silkFeatures:Back ventilation, reflective details, adjustable hood Why We Like It:Is the weather outside frightful? Reach for Ciele’s VLVInsulator jacket, which is easily the warmest jacket on this list. I tested at an early morning track run in DC with seven-degree temps where it felt even colder than that and felt as warm as I could given the circumstance of it all (listen, these PRs aren’t gonna set themselves). Thanks to the combination of Merino wool and recycled silk, the liner is toasty without adding much bulk before you get to a DWR-treated outer that includes reflective details and a bit of ventilation to keep you from totally overheating. But if you’re really overheating, the dual zippers can help to drop the top and cool things down. Satisfy Satisfy Material:NylonFeatures:Water, wind, and snowproof, packable, lightweight. Why We Love It:Satisfy makes some of the coolest and most tech-forward running gear around, as displayed by this Pertex rain jacket. Clad in a handful ofexcellentcolors, including a neon green that I tested for this piece, the Fly Rain Jacket is every kind of “-proof:” windproof, waterproof, and windproof—none of the elements are slowing you down. But it’s also highly breathable, super light (it’s the lightest shell in this roundup), and super packable. Basically, this is the shell you should spring for if you’re a runner racking up 15 to 20 miles a week, 52 weeks out of the year. While it does fit a little slim, the jacket still manages to move with you on a run and even includes a reinforced back to help ensure a cozy fit when you’re wearing the jacket over a hydration vest on longer runs. Oh, and it packs into itself, too. Everything you could want in a shell is present and accounted for here. Gorewear Gorewear The technical wizards behind Goretex have their own apparel line, and you’ve likely been sleeping on it. I certainly was, as evidenced by this R5 Windstopper jacket, which I reached for on some brutally windy and cold winter days in the DC winter. In fact, during one sub-32-degree run, I ended up feelingtoowarm, even with only a base layer on underneath it. The jacket’s made with specialized Polatec insulation, which feels, well,swooshy in the same way a pair of windbreaker pants from the early aughts might, but it's far, far warmer. Plus, the jacket is 8.8 oz, so it doesn’t add bulk or weight, allowing runners to move with ease. Lululemon Lululemon While not the warmest jacket on this list, the Cross Chill Jacket from Lululemon is a great option for cold but not freezing runs when you don’t want to layer a lot but still need warmth and protection from the wind or rain. The fleece-lined jacket gives a nice amount of warmth, while the waterproof and windproof four-way stretch exterior moves with you even in the midst of gnarly weather. It’s also well-suited for long runs where you may or may not need to strip down on accessories, offering a zippered back pocket for a watch cap or set of gloves. Oh, and should you need to keep your phone close by, there’s a dedicated phone sleeve to keep it from bouncing around in your pants. On On On’s Pace running jacket is a Goldilocks-like solution to most windbreaker-related running needs. It’s water-resistant, packs away into itself, has a hood for extra warmth, is super breathable, and lookssick. For most runners, this is a near all-in-one solution that can be tossed into a gym bag for an extra layer on a brisk day or in a travel bag if you’re training for an upcoming race and want to make sure you’re covered if the weather takes a turn. Lightweight and comfortable, you may find yourself reaching for this jacket time and time again as you head out to get some miles under your belt. 3Sixteen 3Sixteen 3Sixteen, a household name amongst real menswear enthusiasts, branched out into an active line recently, and the results are deeply impressive. The time, dedication, and attention to detail on their version of a pullover windbreaker, or what the brand calls its Trail Shirt, shows that they’re not a tourist. Reflective chest panels help provide great visibility at night. The blend of nylon and polyester ripstop does a great job of stopping the wind and giving the pullover some real warmth, especially if you use the drawstring cord at the hem to cinch it down. The result is a piece that meets both form and function, looking just as good on a run as it would hanging out in around town. Nike Nike Nike’s Storm-FIT ADV Running Jacket is perhaps a bit of a misnomer, as I learned the hard way that the jacket isn’t storm-ready, as a freak rain system popped up on me during one of my testing runs. But as long as you’re not going out in a torrential downpour, the jacket will easily cover all of your running needs, as I learned when it performed perfectly for me in a (much) lighter shower. The seam-sealed nature not only helps to keep you dry but also does a really excellent job of keeping in heat on colder runs. Plus, the sleeves have a slight taper to them so as to keep base layers tucked away from interfering with a watch and gloves. Add in some reflective detailing, including the Swoosh on the back, and you’ve got one hell of a statement piece to show off as you, well,stormyour way through your runs looking fly as hell. Goldwin Goldwin It’s hard to say that a brand as accomplished and offering products as technically innovative as Goldwin is underrated, and yet, that’s certainly the case with the Japanese outdoor brand. Goldwin’s dedication to the craft is present in the construction of all of their products, but their shells, in particular, are where a lot of the exciting innovation occurs. That’s the case with this pullover, which was made for the mountaineering side but is just as handy for running. The three-season jacket has plenty of ways to keep you warm, dry, and protected from the wind, but it also features zippers under the arms, at the hem, and at the neck to open things up when you get a little too warm. The chest pocket even has an internal mesh pocket to keep things safe and secure on the run or to pull it out and keep it on the outside as a holder for wet gloves or hats. If you’ve got the money to invest, you cannot go wrong with springing for something this technically wonderful. When considering cold weather jackets, it’s key to prioritize warmth, but you want to keep a few factors in mind. Synthetic insulation is here, especially since you’ll be sweating while wearing these, so you want something that’s easy to send through the wash. Additionally, breathable material and/or included ventilation options are helpful so things don’t get too heated. Finally, knowing your own body temperature is helpful if for no other reason than to keep sizing in mind. Are you someone who runs a little cold? It might be necessary to size up to better layer underneath the jacket, while if you run hot, you can probably just stick to something a little more true to size. When it comes to shells, resistant factors are most critical. You’ll ideally want a shell that can withstand the rain and wind, usually signified by the inclusion of sealed seams so that you’re not getting any water inside the shell. It’s also important to keep in mind your body temperature here as well so you can look at potentially layering (or not) underneath the jacket. Generally speaking, across both categories, you’ll also want to consider overall weight and material. You don’t want something too heavy so that it feels like you’re running with a weighted vest on, and you don’t want something that won’t move with you. Getting something that falls into either of these categories can feel like you’re running in a straightjacket. The only way to test these jackets is to, well, wear them. We wore each of these jackets throughout the winter in a variety of different conditions to test how effective they were against the elements. Were they warm enough? Waterproof enough? Wind-resistant enough? From there, we also evaluated any specialty materials and any features that warranted a higher price tag or other special considerations before landing on these selections.",

    "title": "The Rolex Submariner Buying Guide: How (and Where) to Get One in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The Rolex Submariner isn't exactly controversial. Asking a group of music, design, or fashion experts to name the most important album, building, or collection of the 20th century is a great way to start an argument. Ask a group of watch experts, though, and the answer will almost certainly be the same:the Rolex Submariner. Since its first production run in 1953, the Submariner (now known simply as the “Sub” by collectors) has evolved from a humblepiece of diving equipmentto the gold standard for luxury tool watches, and a quintessential desk diver. Equal parts capable diving tool (it was the first dive watch rated to 100 meters) and style statement (it’s been available in solid gold since 1969), the Submariner has more than earned its status as one of the world’s most-sought grails over the last 71 years. For one thing, the Submariner boasts a raft of top-shelf features, like a 904L stainless steel (a.k.a. Oystersteel) case, Chromalight lume, and a Cerachrom (like ceramic, only better) bezel. For another, it’s been embellished over the decades with a bunch of clever improvements, like the easily-adjustable Glidelock bracelet and a range of colorful dials and bezels, not to mention versions in gold and two-tone (a.k.a. Rolesor). But what really gets watch collectors worked up, and makes vintage Submariners some of the most enthusiastically collected watches on the planet, comes down to one thing: consistency. “Everybody made a diving watch in the ‘60s, but the Submariner is the biggest icon because it hasn’t really changed since,” saysSacha Davidoff, a Geneva-based vintage watch specialist. “It’s like the Porsche 911: it’s the same car, but what’s inside has changed.” Like the iconic German coupe, Davidoff explains, incremental changes to the Submariner over the years have made it more reliable and more robust than its forebears, but the essential form—the geometric hour markers, the “Mercedes” handset, the rotating bezel and Oyster bracelet—looks essentially the same as it did in 1960. “That’s why the Submariner is so important,” Davidoff says. Rolex has \"kept the DNA intact while improving the technology.” For anyone who’s considering joining the ranks of Submariner collectors, the first decision is whether you want a new Sub or a vintage one. If it’s the former, you can choose between the classic Submariner model in Oystersteel with no date or the Submariner Date, which includes more metal choices and colors, not to mention the inimitable Cyclops date window. But for anyone looking to dive into the world of vintage subs, things quickly get more complicated. With dozens of models (orreferences, in Rolex-speak) spanning decades, many of which are distinguished by details as subtle as the number of lines of text on the dial or the shape of the crown guards, the world of vintage Submariners can feel as deep as the Mariana trench and just as perilous (for your bank account, anyway). Whichever path you choose, there’s a whole world of Submariner jargon and lore to immerse yourself in along the way. Here are the references that collectors get the most excited about—along with a few places we trust where you can reliably find 'em. Looking for an approachable ticker to tide you over while you ogle the Subs below? Start here. The Best Watches Under $100|The Best Watches Under $200|The Best Watches Under $500|The Best Watches Under $1,000| The purist’s choice from the current catalog, with a 41mm Oystersteel case, a black time-only dial, and Rolex’s latest automatic movement. If you actually use your dive watch for diving, you can’t do much better than this. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel To celebrate the Submariner’s 50th anniversary in 2003, Rolex introduced a new model with a green bezel (the “LV” stands forlunette verte)that was eventually dubbed “Kermit” by fans, after The Muppets’ famous singing frog. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel After the Kermit was discontinued in 2010, Rolex turned up the fun by adding a green dial to the mix, earningthis steel Sub its “Hulk” nickname. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel This 2010 model brought in some big changes for the Submariner Date, including a ceramic bezel, Chromalight lume, a new movement, and—most notably—a beefier case with enlarged lugs and crown guards. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel This early Sub was produced from 1954-1959 and is recognizable by its oversized winding crown and lack of crown guards. More importantly, though, it was the watchworn by Sean Conneryonscreen in such box office bangers asDr. No, From Russia with Love,andGoldfinger,making it forever known as the “Bond Sub.” Rolex Shop at Craft and Tailored Rolex marked its 2008 centenary with the first Submariner to boast a case and bracelet made from 18k white gold. Fitted with a blue dial and matching bezel, this notorious (and since-discontinued) reference is now known as—what else?—the “Smurf.” Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel The so-called “Triple-Zero” was the first Sub with a case made from upgraded 904L steel, and marks the shift between vintage and modern Submariner designs. Because it was made for less than a year in the late 1980s, this is one of the more collectible Subs of the modern era. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel The advent of the first Submariner Date, the 1680, marked the Submariner’s shift from hardcore tool watch to quintessential desk diver. Made from the late 1960s until 1980, it was also the first Sub to be available in full gold and two-tone variants. Within this reference are also the so-called “Red Sub” versions, which are particularly sought after by collectors thanks to the Submariner name printed in red ink on the dial. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel For anyone looking to get into vintage Subs without spending a fortune, this reference, which was in production from 1962 until 1989, is a good place to start. Later examples can be found in the high four figures (which, unfortunately, is about as affordable as it gets for vintage Subs), and it also has the distinction of being worn by James Bond inOn Her Majesty's Secret Service,Live and Let Die, andThe Man with the Golden Gun. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel The French underwater engineering firm Compagnie Maritime d'Expertises isn’t a brand most of us would be familiar with if not for its prominent place in the history of the Submariner. From the 1970s through the 1990s, Rolex produced a half-dozen different Submariner references for COMEX divers, many of them with the COMEX logo prominently stamped on the dial. Did it improve the look of the watch? Debatable. Does it make these some of the most collectible (and priciest) Subs out there?It sure does. Rolex Shop at 41 Watch If you want to know the exact moment that the Sub came of age, many collectors will point to this historic reference produced from 1959-1979. The ref. 5512 was made in a whole whack of different variants during its life, but they’re all distinguished by a modern-sized 40mm case (up from 38mm previously) and guards on either side of the crown (Submariner collectors love to talk about crown guards). Oh, and it just so happened to beSteve McQueen’s Sub of choice. Rolex Menta Watches Rolex Tropical Watches",

    "title": "13 Best Cropped T-Shirts for Men 2025: Short and Oh-So-Stylish",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you already know for certain that you want one of the best cropped T-shirts in your closet, the good news is that you're on the front lines of style. The less good news is that unlike withclassic T-shirts, there's far been less scholarship done to determine the best ones on the market today. That's where we come in—and not a second too soon. That's because what started a few years ago onTikTok(CropTok, if you will) as a DIY experiment—dudes grabbing scissors and turning their old tees into something new—is now becoming mainstream. Hollywood hunks are swishing around Erewhon in theirs, and very few male musicians these days—Justin Bieberexcluded—dare to let their tees fall below their belts. The reason? The style is simply incredibly flattering, and very easy to wear. Unlike croptops, which truly expose the midriff, a cropped tee still retains the classic T-shirt elements—short sleeves, a crewneck, and a relaxed or boxy fit—but just finishes it all off with a higher hemline. This helps the tee work with any sweater, trucker jacket or blazer, because it'll never hang lower than whatever's layering on top of it. Having realized these strengths, plenty of brands are already shortening their hemlines for you. But before we get into our round-up of the 13 best right now, a quick note on styling: With thetiny top, baggy bottomsmovement still going strong, cropped tees pair easily withhigh-waisted pants,sweatpants,jeans, and yes, those never-ending-pocketedcargos. And to get a little more specific, a fitted cropped tee highlights the torso, creating a sharp balance with either looser bottoms or slim pants, while a boxy cropped tee softens the lines and leans into a more chill vibe, but requires some straight or loose bottoms to keep things proportioned. Merz b. Schwanen Nordstrom Gitta and Peter Plotnicki, partners in life and business, deserve a round of applause—if it weren’t for them, the historic German brand Merz b. Schwanen would be nothing more than, well, historic. Instead, after happening across a 90-year-old henley from the brand at a flea market, the Plotnickis reached out to the Merz family, who gave them the approval to restore its once-great name. Quickly, the Plotnickis tracked down one of the last textile manufacturers originally used by the brand, who blew them away by revealing 32 authentic loopwheelers dating from the 1880s to the 1960s—unused and covered in dust. While the now-successfully-revived brand's full-cotton loopwheeled T-shirts are the obvious staple, this cotton-hemp blend deserves just as much attention. An eco-friendly fabric, derived from renewable plant sources, it has a boxy fit, baseball stitching (that cool double-thread zigzag), and a slight crop. In short, it’s a modern classic with historic bona fides. Gap Gap If dressing like the relaxed best friend in a ‘90s indie film is the move right now, Gap basically styled the era—so it’s no surprise the brand is absolutely crushing some throwback looks today. From resurrecting theirgreatest hitsto accidently producing men'sknitwear goldin the women’s section, Gap is on a tear that feels straight out of their heyday. Take this cropped tee, for example. It’s got a high crewneck that stays put (no sad, droopy collars here), drop-shoulder sleeves for that effortless slouch, and a perfectly grungy faded black wash that looks like you swiped it from your older sibling in ‘97. Toss it over athermal, pair it with somebaggy jeans, and you’ve nailed the art of laid-back nostalgia. Because if Gap’s proving anything, it’s that dressing like the past is sometimes the best way to win the present. Levi's Levi's From their repros ofType II jacketsto their vintage-stylecrewneck sweatshirts, Levi’s Vintage Clothing (LVC) has a knack for making clothes that feel like they’ve been pulled straight from a time capsule. This 1950s-inspired sportswear T-shirt is no exception. It’s got a roomy fit in the body with a slight crop at the hem. The sleeves are snug, reminiscent of the ones Patrick Swayze rocked inThe Outsiders. And as a bonus, LVC really went deep in their vintage bag to bring back a smaller spade pocket. Not sure what that is? Exactly what it sounds like—a pocket shaped like a spade (yes, like the card suit), featuring a rounded bottom with pointed lower corners. Functional? Debatable. Stylish? Absolutely. Now all you need is a classic pair of501s, someConverse, and a dab ofpomadeto complete the look. Just try not to start any greaser vs. socs drama. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason has already dropped one of this year’s bestcollaborations, they’re cranking out super dialed-in clothes for thewage cage, and now they’ve unleashed one of the weightiest tees around. This bad boy boasts a ‘90s-inspired cut with longer sleeves and a flat hem that casually grazes your beltline—because sometimes, a little extra drape just hits right. But the best part? This tee isthick. We’re talking 310 GSM—basically the heft of a crewneck sweatshirt. It’s got a bound collar for extra durability (so it won’t stretch out after one wash) and a split-needle cover stitch on the shoulders and armholes to keep seams from busting under pressure. In short, this tee isn’t just another basic—it’s an instant classic. Fold it into your Buck Mason must-haves ASAP. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie & Fitch We’re currently flipping throughA&F’saction-packed sale section, and their heavyweight cropped tee made the cut. Aside from sidestepping middle-of-the-mall kiosks like Allen Iverson with Ty Lue—and maybe picking up a lukewarm cinnamon pretzel—Abercrombie has actually made mall trips feel a little less like a hostage situation with their latest collections. This tee, with its oversized fit and aggressively cropped cut, also shines in a more understated color like navy. Pair it withlight-washed denimandbootsfor that “just got papped leaving a coffee shop” A-lister vibe. Asket Asket Swedish label ASKET launched in 2015 with a full-transparency business model—just like a ton of other brands that year. But nearly a decade later, they’re still pulling back the curtain and letting you do more than just peek inside. From supply chain traceability to environmental impact and cost structure, ASKET lays it all out like a dinner party host who insists you see the receipt for the wine. The brand is all about perfecting the basics, and that obsessive attention to detail is apparent in their T-shirts. Cut from 100% organic cotton, featuring a ribbed neckline and twin-needle stitch hems (stronger than a single stitch—because high-stress areas deserve better), these tees are built to last. The fit is so dialed-in, you can practically customize it. Want a cropped tee? Go short. Prefer classic? Stick with regular. Need extra length? They’ve got you. With ASKET’s meticulous approach to fit, you might as well start setting aside a quarterly budget for the inevitable re-up. Mfpen SSENSE Mfpen has been quietly dominating the art of workwear-inspired tailoring, making some of the bestworkwear suitsand dress shirts around. And now? Honing in on some of the best-cropped T-shirts—because why not? Their latest offering is a brown tee that’s been garment-dyed to a rich, almost \"freshly stirred espresso\" shade of brown. It features a ribbed neckline, drop shoulders for that effortless drape, and a cropped hemline that lands just right—short enough for a stylish edge, but not so short you’ll be mistaken for a ‘90s boy band backup dancer. Bare Knuckles Bare Knuckles Portland-based brand Bare Knuckles is a menswear favorite, known for crafting some of the best basics in the game. Their cropped tee? Boxy, heavyweight (a sturdy 7.25 oz.), and proudly made in the USA. BDG Urban Outfitters Urban Outfitters clearly got the memo that Mocha Mousse is the Pantone Color of the Year. Its chocolate-hued tee nails the proportions—perfect hem, just-right sleeves. All that’s left now is for you to grab one in every other color, you know, for balance. Madewell Madewell A T-shirt for the present, but in an indigo shade that’ll age like fine denim, looking even better a year from now after countless washes. Madewell knows the game—this isn’t a sprint; it’s a style marathon, and they’re in it for the long haul. Our Legacy Our Legacy Our Legacy might now have a minority stake from LVMH, but the brand’s still doing its thing—uncompromised, unbothered, and undeniably putting out some of the best clothes in the game. Case in point: this little freaky ahh cropped tee, made from crepe fabric for that crinkly, drapey goodness. Lady White Co. Lady White Co. Lady White Co. is currently understood in menswear circles to be the GOAT—the Greatest of All Tees. Made entirely in L.A., these shirts come in colors so rare, you’d almost have better luck finding a unicorn in a denim jacket. Don’t fight it—just embrace the greatness. Flint and Tinder Huckberry Flint and Tinder, known for their reliable outerwear, are now branching out into T-shirts and slowly but surely giving your closet the overhaul it never knew it needed. Their latest creation, the Surplus Boxy Tee, is heavy, soft (thanks to that jersey fabric), and built for those days when you can’t decide if you want to wear it once...or a few times a week. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "9 Best Leather Duffel Bags of 2025 Are Built for First-Class Flyers",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you're a first-class flyer, the last thing you want is to lug a jankyduffelthrough the terminal. No, you'll want one of the best leather duffel bags, a clear indicator of your status in life (even if you are sitting in coach). Compared to their non-leather counterparts, leather duffel bags signal that you care about how the world views you, as someone who wearsrealpantsthrough TSA and not dingy oldsweats. A great duffel bag should still carry your clothes, kicks, chargers,toiletries, and everything else in the most space-efficient, easy-to-find way possible. A great duffel should outlast your passport—or better yet,you—despite years of being stuffed in an overhead bin and thrown in the trunk of your car. A great duffel should make everyone else in the TSA line jealous. We’ve toted dozens of leather duffel bags over years of travel, and none hauled our stuff as well as these. Ghurka Ghurka Material:Vegetable-tanned tumbled leatherDimensions:20.0 x 12.0 x 10.5\" If you're looking for a leather duffel bag, the Ghurka Cavalier is everything you'd want. This is the type of bag you'd see ‘90s-era Denzel lugging though the automatic doors of LAX because of its A-list status. It's quite literally the best damn leather duffel bag we’ve ever had the blessing of putting our grails into. With its beautifully supple vegetable tanned leather exterior, we can only imagine that this thing will get softer and more gorgeous with each toss into the overhead bin. Brass accents around the bag increase its durability, and we especially like the brass legs on the bottom to avoid premature wear. The interior plaid lining is a nice touch, and we found that because of its light color, it's easier to see inside the duffel—helpful for rummaging through your bag for your charger during your red eye flight. Monos Monos Material:Vegan leatherDimensions:20.0 × 12.0 × 10.4\" Not all faux leather is vegan leather, so don't assume that all vegan leather is just a cheap way to get a leather-looking bag. It's actually quite hard to make vegan leather, especially something that looks and feels like the real deal (and contains zero traces of animal byproducts). That's all to say that Monos makes one of the best vegan leather duffel bags we've tried, which has held up well compared to its real-deal leather brethren. The bag is especially well-designed, featuring alaptopsleeve that can accommodate laptops up to 14 inches, a water bottle sleeve, and a roomy zippered pocket. Either end of the bag also has a magnetic closure pouch, but we found that it's best for slimmer profile items like yourpassportor phone. Carl Friedrik Carl Friedrik Material:Full-grain leatherDimensions:20.0 × 12.0 × 10.4\" Too often leather bags are just flimsy and lose their shape if they don't have anything in there. Sure, that's great for some reasons, like if you need to cram an empty bag somewhere for storage. But, we're big fans of this Carl Frederik bag because it retains its shape and feels more like a hard-case suitcase than an insubstantial bag. Its main compartment is large enough to house twopacking cubes' worth of clothes, as well as a pair of shoes and laptop (up to 15 inches). An assortment of pockets, both inside and out, just make it that much easier to pack and be able to find your things. Plus, the little metal feet protect the base of the bag from damage. Away Away Material:LeatherDimensions:17.7 x 11 x 7.3\" You'll see Away's beloved suitcases occupying 90% of the space at baggage claim, but its duffels? Those deserve some love too. The Transit leather duffle carries on the brand's ethos of well-designed, under-the-radar travel goods that'll get you where you need to be—with all of your stuff in one piece (as long as the TSA doesn't lose your stuff). A plethora of pockets keep things neat and tidy, but we're especially big fans of the main compartment because the zipper goes all the way around so it's easier to access your items without blindly feeling for it. And because it's designed by a luggage brand, there's a pass-through loop so you can safely and securely connect it to your suitcase's handle. Bottega Veneta Bottega Veneta Material:Calfskin leatherDimensions:19.7 x 10.6 x 9.4\" Bottega Veneta's signature “Intrecciato” woven leather design was first introduced in the 1970s as a way to break away from the box-shaped, rigid bags of the era. Using glove leather that was lighter and more pliable than cow skins traditionally used at the time, the brand's craftspeople wove strips together to create a criss-cross pattern that achieved a lighter weight, more supple bag—that also stood out from the smooth-skin crowd. The artisanal infrastructure also means this bag holds its shape, whether it's stuffed with gear in the overhead bin or barely packed for a quick overnight trip. And if you really want to stand out from every other passenger in the airport, opt for this guy in an uncommon color like this brick red. Tecovas Tecovas What does a cowboy boot brand know about leather duffel bags? Considering Tecovas makes some impressiveleatherboots, we'd say the brand knows a lot. Its Bartlett is a supremely roomy bag that looks perfect for the ranch—or just sitting pretty up in first. Korchmar Korchmar For a bag that'll show its wear (in the best way possible), Korchmar's proudly wears its scars like its own version of stamps in a passport. It's spacious (even more so if you open up the ends), and it has interior zippered pockets—a huge plus for us. Shinola Shinola From watches to home goods, Shinola makes a great leather product. That applies to the Canfield classic holdall, which comes in a supple tumbled leather. We especially like the fabric shoulder strap, which adds a pop of intrigue for a bag that could otherwise fly under the radar. Quince Quince Quince's affordable duffle bag is made of full-grain leather, which is shocking considering the price tag. If you blew all your dough on the seat upgrade, let this be the bag you get to make up for the lack of funds. Type of Leather:There are varying degrees of leather quality that all have to do with what layer your leather's been cut from. Full-grain leather is the best of the best, but you'll pay a pretty penny, though it does feel the most luxurious and will last the longest. If price is stopping you from buying a leather duffle bag, try to look for something made from top-grain or split-grain leather, which aren't as high quality as full-grain leather but still durable and fairly premium. Vegan leather is also a great option for those who want the look and feel of a leather duffel bag but don't want to use anything made from animal byproducts. Do know this: Vegan leather doesn't necessarily mean it'll becheaperthan legit leather, so take that into consideration before your purchase. Price:Price will almost always directly correlate with the type of leather the duffel bag you're eyeing is made from. Full-grain leather duffel bags will be the most expensive, while lower-tier leather will help keep the cost down, though you'd be compromising on durability and overall feel as you opt for cheaper materials. What is the best leather duffel bag? In our testing, we found the Ghurka Cavalier II No. 97 to be the best leather bag. It's on the pricier side, but its construction and overall quality justified its price tag. What's the best type of leather for a duffel bag? The most premium leather for a duffel bag is full-grain leather, which is made from the entire animal hide. Other types of leather are built from various layers of the hide, which compromises their structure. We narrowed down the competition to the best leather duffel bags that our network of testers and trusted luggage nerds recommended. Whether it's because they enjoyed the construction or design, the leather bags we tested all came through our hands so we could evaluate their feel and structure. We packed, slung, and tossed as many as we could to figure out how much of a beating they could take—and that's how we narrowed down countless leather duffel bags into the top nine.",

    "title": "How to Bleach Your Hair, According to an Expert",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learning how to bleach yourhairis practically a rite of passage: I still remember bleaching my hair for the first time in college—deep in the punk rock phase but rocking aHatful of HollowT-shirt simultaneously. The initial shock of going full-bleached blonde threw me, but I quickly grew to love it, especially as my roots came in and gave it a lived-in vibe. These days, bleached hair isn’t just for the fringes; more guys are embracing it as a go-to style swerve. It’s a statement-making move for confident guys looking to shake things up, and it tends to look even cooler when dark roots start showing, adding some contrast to a platinum top. “Bleaching your hair is making a statement,” says master hair colorist and celebrity stylist Sarah Conner. “It’s bold, it’s strong, it’s attention-getting. It’s for the guy with an edge who isn’t afraid to rock something outside the box. Think David Beckham, Pharrell, Daniel Craig, Brad Pitt, Pete Davidson, or any musician or actor looking to add a little bad-boy flair.” But as Conner advises, \"Bleaching your hair is not a conditioning treatment—it's a chemical service.\" A lot can go wrong in the process, and getting it right—especially at home—can be tricky. Between the mixing, gloves, and precise application, it's a process, and when done incorrectly, it's not great for yourhair or look. \"Seeking out a skilled professional is best for an on-scalp lightening application, aka a bleach and tone, since it can be risky,\" Conner explains. \"However, it's possible to do it at home if you follow step-by-step instructions and consider your hair's condition at every stage.\" We consulted with Conner to help guide you through the complete process. Fair warning: Bleaching yourhairrequires patience and careful adherence, but if you're ready to take the platinum plunge, we're here to help you get that perfect bleached blonde finish—without the rookie mistakes. Before you begin, make sure you have the right tools andproducts. Essentials include: Bleach (Lightener):“This usually comes in powder or oil-based cream form,” Conner says. \"I like to use Redken Flash Lift (powder) or Framesi Decolor B Cream Plus (cream).” Redken Walmart Framesi Walmart Developer:The volume you’ll need—typically 20, 30, or 40—depends on yourhair’scurrent state. “It’s based on factors like whether your hair is virgin or previously colored, its natural color, length, texture, and overall health,” Conner says. “I use Salon Care developers, but the brand matters less than selecting the right volume—the higher the number, the more lift you’ll get.” Salon Care Amazon Salon Care Amazon Salon Care Amazon Gloves:Essential for protecting your hands during the process. Salon Care Amazon Barrier Cream:“Applied around your hairline to protect your skin. You can buy a specific product or just use Vaseline or Aquaphor.” Aquaphor Amazon Schwarzkopf Walmart Mixing Bowl & Brush:For application. Magic Collection Amazon Whisk:For properly blending the bleach and developer. Colortrak Amazon Heat Source:“Ablow dryerwill help speed up processing,” Conner explains. BaBylissPRO Amazon Proper Shampoo & Conditioner:“Salon-grade, hydrating, or reparative formulas designed for chemically treated hair are best,” Conner says. “My go-to brands are Milbon, Virtue Labs, and Davines.” Milbon Amazon Virtue Labs Virtue Labs Davines Sephora Purple Shampoo:Helps maintain cool tones. “Shimmer Lights or DpHue Cool Blonde Shampoo are my favorites,” Conner says. “It’s best used as needed—when your icy blonde starts turning yellow.” Clairol Amazon dpHUE dpHUE Coconut Oil or Bond-Building Treatment:“Olaplex is the gold standard for strengthening hair,” Conner explains. “It’s best used before bleaching to prep the hair and after to maintain its condition.” Olaplex Sephora OGX Amazon Shower Cap or Plastic Wrap:Traps heat to speed up the lifting process. Salon Care Amazon Toner:“This is key for refining your blonde,” Conner says. “Do you want a pale, melted butter blonde or a cool, icy tone? Maybe even silver? I love using Redken Shades EQ 09V, 09P, 09T, or Wella T-18 (aka ‘White Lady’) for that ultra-icy finish.” Redken Walmart Wella Professionals Sally Beauty Before you bleach, proper preparation is key to minimizing damage and ensuring the best results. “Make sure your hair isn’t freshly washed,” Conner says. “Natural oils help protect your scalp, so a few days of buildup is beneficial. It reduces irritation and that tingling, itchy feeling during processing.” Applying coconut oil beforehand can help prevent excess dryness and doing an Olaplex treatment for a few days (or even weeks) leading up to bleaching will strengthen your hair and improve its resilience. “A strand test is also crucial,” Conner advises. “It’ll show you how long your hair takes to lift and help you determine which developer volume is best for achieving your desired shade.” One more tip? Skip harsh skincare products like retinol a few days before bleaching. “These can make your scalp extra-sensitive during the process, leading to more discomfort,” Conner says. These steps will help prep and condition for a smooth, even lift. When mixing the bleach, following the brand’s specific instructions is essential. According to Conner, “Some lighteners require equal parts bleach and developer, while others call for a 2:1 ratio—meaning double the developer.” (We repeat:Read the instructions.) In general, the lighter your natural hair color, the lower the developer volume you’ll need; the darker your hair, the higher the developer required. For example, someone with sandy blonde, virgin hair might only need a 20-volume developer mixed in equal parts with bleach. However, if you’re a dark brunette or have permanent color on your hair, you’ll likely need a 40-volume developer. For those with a natural color between blonde and brunette, a 30-volume developer could be a good choice. “Just remember, the higher the developer volume, the more lift you’ll achieve,” Conner explains. The application technique will depend on your hair length and whether it’s virgin or previously colored. You can usually apply the bleach from roots to ends using the same developer for short hair. For long hair (3–4 inches or more), however, Conner recommends starting with the mid-lengths of the hair first, away from the scalp and ends. After that, go back and apply it to the roots and ends. “Hair near the scalp lifts faster because of your body heat,” she says. “Meanwhile, the mid-lengths and ends take longer to lift, which may require a stronger developer to achieve even results.” A strand test will help you determine if your hair lifts evenly. If you notice darker bands of yellow, Conner suggests “using a stronger developer on the darker areas and a lower-volume developer on the parts that have lifted to a lighter yellow.” Once the bleach has been applied to your hair, it’s crucial to cover it with a plastic processing cap or wrap (like Saran Wrap). This helps lock in heat and prevents the bleach from drying out, promoting even lifting. If your hair is lifting slowly, you can use a blow dryer on a low setting: Hold it about 6 inches away from your hair and move it in a circular motion. “Apply heat for only a few minutes at a time, checking your hair’s progress as you go,” Conner advises. Processing time varies depending on how dark or light your hair was to begin with, as well as the volume of developer used. You can typically expect 35 minutes to an hour for processing, but Conner recommends checking your hair every 15–20 minutes. “You’ll literally see your hair lifting before your eyes, changing through stages of color as it eventually turns blonde,” she explains. While your goal doesn’t need to be pure white, “lifting to a pale yellow (think melted butter) is a safe choice.” Toning will be the next step if you prefer a cooler, lighter blonde. “Don’t overlift your hair,” Conner warns, as it may lead to unnecessary damage. It’s normal for your scalp to feel a bit tight, itchy, or tingly, but Conner cautions, “If you feel burning or extreme discomfort, rinse the bleach off immediately.” After your hair has lifted to a pale blonde, the next step is to rinse thoroughly with warm (not hot) water. Towel dry and then apply the toner. “A cool-toned or silvery toner will help eliminate any remaining yellow hues,” Conner says. The longer you leave the toner on, the more intense the effect. A few minutes will soften the yellow and leaving it on for up to 20 minutes will deposit a more silvery or icy tone. “Blonde on men typically looks better with cooler tones,” she adds, “so don’t be afraid of the blonde having a silvery hue.” Remember that toners fade with time, so you can always reapply when necessary to refresh the color. Once the toner has done its job, rinse your hair and proceed with shampooing and conditioning using hydrating, color-safe products. \"Be gentle with your scalp,\" Conner advises. \"It's tender after bleaching, so avoid scrubbing it too vigorously.\" Choose moisturizingshampoosandconditionersto maintain your blonde and nourish your hair. \"Deep condition weekly to monthly, depending on how your hair feels post-bleach,\" says Conner. \"It's normal for your hair's texture to change after bleaching—it's just been through a chemical process. So, baby it a little.\" She recommends using lightweight leave-in conditioners and hair oils daily to help maintain moisture and prevent brittleness. \"Rōz St. Lucia Styling Oil or Rōz Milk Hair Serum are great options,\" she adds. Roz Sephora Roz Sephora To avoid stripping moisture, she advises sticking to sulfate-free shampoos. Heat styling should also be minimized, especially in the first week after bleaching. \"If you do use heat, always apply a heat protectant. I like Virtue Labs 6-in-1 Styler.\" Virtue Labs Virtue Labs For deeper repair, consider weekly bond-repair treatments. \"Olaplex No. 2 is a great at-home bond repair treatment,\" Conner says. \"Use it weekly if your hair feels fragile from the process or monthly if it is holding up well—it helps maintain the integrity of your strands.\" Olaplex Olaplex Bleached roots will need touch-ups every 4–6 weeks. \"Retouching too soon runs the risk of overlapping the bleach, which can lead to breakage, but waiting too long between sessions can result in uneven lifting,\" Conner explains. She also suggests using a purple shampoo once or twice weekly to keep brassiness at bay. Hydration is also key- regular use of leave-in conditioner or hair oil helps prevent breakage and keeps hair looking healthy. “If your hair is damaged from previous lightening or excessive styling, bleaching will only worsen it.” She recommends getting a good haircut to remove the most fragile ends beforehand. Another common mistake? Forgetting to tone. “Toning is the magical step that gives bleached hair its cool, polished look—no pun intended,” she says. “Without it, you'll end up with yellow hair that looks like a 'bleach and tone gone wrong.'” Orange hair, she warns, happens when hair hasn't been lifted enough. “You can't tone orange to pale blonde. If your hair turns orange, you must rework and repeat the process carefully.” Patience is also essential. “It might look perfect after one session,”she advises. Achieving the ideal blonde shade can take multiple rounds, especially if you start with darker hair. “Avoid excessive heat styling for at least a week,” Conner warns. “Heat can cause bleached hair to revert to a yellow tone more quickly, meaning you'll need to tone more often. Overall, aftercare is everything,” Conner emphasizes. “Bleached hair requires ongoing maintenance, but with the right routine, you can keep it strong, soft, and vibrant.” Sarah Conner Sarah Connerhas solidified her reputation as one of Los Angeles' top hair color experts, renowned for her mastery of balayage, foil highlighting, and natural-looking color.

    "title": "8 Best Asics Sneakers for 2025: From Gel-Kayano 14s to the GT-2160",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. For a long time, Asics sneakers were the sole preserve of extreme runners and style-agnostic dads. But over the last few years, slowly and then seemingly all at once, the Japanese sportswear juggernautcaught fire with another demographic entirely: style-pilled fellas less interested in logging miles than dressing like they could—y'know, the type of guys behind this very publication. Asics didn't explode in popularity overnight. The brand has been around in one form or another since 1949, and diehard sneakerheads will remind you that it wasn’t that long ago that the Gel-Lyte III was a bona fide collaborative grail. But the brand's status in 2025 as one of the biggest stories in sneakers boils down to an archive packed with right-now silhouettes fromthe not-too-distant past, an assortment that continues to influence the biggest, boldest names in menswear, and attract some of the most sought-after collaborators across the board, craftingentirely new silhouettes—and getting nods from the likes ofKendrick Lamar—in the process. In other words, there have never been more ways to add some tiger stripes to your rotation. To help you home in on the model worth your time, we went deep on 8 of the best Asics sneakers in the brand's catalog, each one ready and raring to anchorbaggy jeansandlight jackets—or just help you beat the rush en route to the sneaker store. In the spirit of Asics itself, scroll through the below, decide what you like, and then haul ass to get ‘em before they're gone. The Asics archive is brimming with retro bangers, but the top dog–the one that helped put aughts-era running shoes on the map—is the Gel-Kayano 14. The silhouette first hit shelves in 2008, but in the time since it's enjoyed a second life as asurprise fashion crowd favorite, even winning GQ'sSneaker of the Yearin the process. A slew of buzzy collaborations with the likes of A.P.C., JJJJound and Atmos might've supercharged its return, but even general-release versions can be tricky to snatch up, and for good reason. The Gel-Kayano 14 isn't just one of the most recognizable It shoes on the market—it remains every bit the performance shoe it was back in ‘08, and remains a no-brainer-pickup at your local sneaker pusher. Really, it's the silhouette that's near single-footedly responsible for Asics's current reign atop the charts. Asics Asics Asics SSENSE A quick FYI before we begin: This is the Asics sneaker on the rise. A couple of years ago, the top brass at Asics HQ began thinking about dusting off the GT-2160. The brand was already seeing a surge of interest in what it refers to as “vintage tech” models like the Gel-Kayano 14 above, and the GT-2160—an ultra-comfortable retro runner first released in the early 2010s—felt like the Kayano 14’s natural successor. Asics' marketing team knew exactly how to anoint it, quietly enlisting a roster of fashion-world collaborators to put their spin on the silhouette—the same approach that helped propel the Kayano 14 to the forefront of the menswear conversation. (In the case of the GT-2160, those names include Copenhagen-based designer Cecile Bahnsen, who swapped the shoe’s laces for floral velcro straps inone of the best interpretations; the ragtag skaters at Montreal’s Dime, who kitted out the style in dueling shades of ombre brown; and the Angelenos at Gallery Dept.,who left the silhouette all-but-untouchedsave for a signature splatter of paint by the toe box.) Those didn't last long, but that was only the beginning: Asics continues to do up the style in a wide range of approachable colors. Below, two of my current favorites. Asics Nordstrom Asics Asics If the Kayano-14 is the wholesome pick, the Gel-Kayano 20 is the dark horse of the Kayano family. The silhouette is touch more technical-looking, with its treated rubber sole and criss-crossed mesh outer, but somehow that all works together to give the shoe a sleeker, stealthier energy. Originally launched in 2013, the sneaker has long been recognized for its cushioning, but is increasingly getting credit for its good looks, too. Case in point: When longtime Asics collaborator Kiko Kostadinov was seeking his most recent model to rework, it was the Gel-Kayano 20 he eventually opted for. Asics SSENSE Asics SSENSE The aptly-named Gel-NYC first debuted in 2023 in collaboration with Queens native and Awake NY founder Angelo Baque. But its New York roots also manifest in the way it wraps disparate elements—in this case a trio of Asics models from three different decades—in an entirely new silhouette. The upper draws inspiration from the '90s-era Gel-MC Plus and the circa-2000s Gel Nimbus 3, while the sole is lifted from a pair of Gel Cumulus 16 shoes from 2014. The result of all of that remixing? A shoe that somehow looks like it’s been around forever and feels extremely right now. Asics Nordstrom Asics Nordstrom Now we come to the truly new styles. Another Kiko Kostadinov collaboration, this eye-catching model is inspired, according to Asics, by the “connection between nature and humanity.” What does that actually look like in translation? In this case, clashing natural and artificial colors, all making a fun amount of noise on top of a plush sole that includes the brand's rearfoot GEL technology. And despite the considerable hype that a new style from the brand, designed alongside Kostadinov, could have allowed Asics to charge for the shoe, sneakerheads are also appreciating that the style has been priced the same as the main line. Which makes it easier to use the shoe the way the brand intended: As a human recklessly roaming around in nature. Asics Asics Asics Asics Given all the hype surrounding Asics's retro models, it’s easy to forget that the brand makes some of thebest pure performance runners, too, and the Gel-Nimbus 27 is a great example of that. With those Tiger stripes, and exceptional comfort, it has strong ties to the Asics brand DNA, but looks a heckuva lot different to any of the other silhouettes on this list, a sign of the enormous strides Asics has made in the performance space over the last couple of decades. The Gel-Nimbus 27 exemplifies plush support at its best—let the soft, engineered Jacquard mesh seamlessly wrap around your foot, hit the streets, and know you were ten years early when fellas eventually start wearing 'em as archive classics. Asics Huckberry Asics Nordstrom Introduced in 2023, the Gel Quantum Kinetic is a newer option from Asics that shows the brand can do futuristic as well as they can do retro. If you're still reading here, it's likely you're curious about that funky sole, too. Fear not: It features the same Gel technology that brand is renowned for, just combined with a new “Scutoid” Gel technology, which improves coverage and shock absorption for those days when you're on out your feet for hours at a time. Couple that with the breathable, Kayano-esque mesh upper, and you're dealing with the true best of both eras. You time traveler, you. Asics Asics Asics Asics If you’re new here, the mule-ification of sneakers has been happening for a while now. Sneaker giants likeSalomonandNew Balancehave adapted their silhouettes into the clog style, and I'm here to tell you that Asics now has as well. Its eye-catching silhouette is called the Asics Gel-Styrax, and the sneaker references both the previous Mountain Clog and Transcend series from Asics, both of which were rooted in the idea of training in nature. For example, even though you might notplanto take these bad boys on a run, you truly could: The model is made with the brand's same beloved Gel sole unit, and is even complemented by what it calls “FF Blast Plus cushioning,” for extra impact absorption.

    "title": "How to Train Smarter, Not Harder, for Your First Hyrox",
    "article_text": "Hyrox—the high-octane hybrid race series that combines running withfunctional fitnessexercises—launched in 2017 and exploded post-Covid. Well over half a million people are expected to lace up for one of 83 events globally this year alone. (If you plan to be one of them, check out our list ofthe best shoes for Hyrox.) “I think nearly everybody who participates in some form of exercise can finish this race, which is awesome because you see this really wide demographic of people participating,” says Chicago-based trainer and performance coachJason Loebig. “I've seen someone in their teens race, and people in their 60s complete it. I think that accessibility is what's causing the sport to grow so fast.” Still, making it to the finish with a respectable time is no stroll through the park. With eight run sections and just as many workout stations (ranging from sled pushes to farmer’s carries), the race is a gauntlet that tests strength and cardio and requires equal parts physical and mental endurance. How do you train for something that’s unlike anything you’ve ever done before? Here’s what three top coaches—all Hyrox race winners, might I add—have to say about that, complete with insider tips and the advice they wish they’d been given before their first time. When you imagine a Hyrox race, your mind probably goes straight to the novel parts—the workout sections, like the sled stations and sandbag lunges. So, logically, you might expect these kinds of exercises to make up the bulk of your training. But more than anything, Hyrox is a running race. “On Instagram and everywhere else, you mostly just see the stations, because that's more fun to look at. But more than half of your time will be spent running,” saysBret Gornik, a personal trainer and Hyrox coach. “If I could go back in time, the main thing I would tell myself is to run more, that it's primarily a running race,” says Loebig. “I would have done more interval-based running. I would have done longerthreshold runsthat would match my race time.” Loebig and Gornik—co-founders ofLive Better, which hosts wellness retreats all over the world—are also a Hyrox-winning doubles team. Their best advice for building the aerobic capacity you’ll need to fly through the race?Train for a half-marathon. “I see it every time. I see somebody that looks like a bodybuilder come off the first station into the second run and they're already walking,\" says Gornik. “If you were like, ‘Oh, shit, I couldn't run a half marathon tomorrow,’ I'd be a little worried. You could still finish the race, like people who ‘run’ half marathons and walk for four miles. But if you’re shooting for a goal, I would be on a half-marathon running program.” For whatever reason—probably due to the variety of workout stations—a lot of people tend to compare Hyrox to CrossFit. But CrossFit and Hyrox are quite different, most notably because there are no surprises on Hyrox race day. “The beauty of Hyrox is that it's the same race every single time, unlike a CrossFit event where you don't know what's coming your way,” saysLaddersenior coach andAlpha Fit Clubfounder and CEOSam Tooley, whose footprints are all over the Hyrox podium. That means, no matter what, if you are competing in the men’s open division you’ll be pushing and pulling 152kg (335 lb) and 103kg (227 lb) on the sled, respectively, carrying two 24kg (53 lb) kettlebells for the farmer’s carry, lunging with a 20kg (44 lb) sandbag, and hitting 100 wall balls with a 6kg (13 lb) medicine ball. As for the distance-based stations, you can expect to cover 1,000m (3,280 ft) each on the SkiErg and rower, and 80m (262 ft) of burpee broad jumps. “You get to train very specifically, and you’ll quickly understand what you can handle and maybe what needs a little bit of work,” says Tooley, who admits to learning this lesson the hard way during his first Hyrox race. “As somebody who was an endurance athlete, I was so humbled by the sled. It was laughable; I couldn't freaking move the thing.” So, as you start to incorporate these exercises into your training, keep the official standards in mind, “so that when you get to race day, it's not a question of, ‘Can I do this?’” he says. Pushing a 335-pound sled is one thing. Pushing a 335-pound sled after blasting out 1,000 meters on the SkiErg and running two kilometers at race pace is quite something else. That’s why Gornik, Loebig, and Tooley all prescribe what they call “compromised running”—trainer-speak for peppering a training run with workout intervals. Run coaches often employ this technique to get clients used to the feeling of running while fatigued, to prepare them for the later stages of a race. In the case of Hyrox, it’s an even more direct application, allowing you to get a sense of what the various workout stations will feel like after running, and vice-versa. “People often think about doing each event in isolation, not linking them together,” says Loebig, who runs through a full Hyrox simulation once a week when training for a race. (\"It's not a particularly long race, so your body can handle that stress,\" he says, in comparison to simulating, say, a marathon, which would push your body past the point of positive adaptation.) It’s not something he necessarily recommends for all first-timers, but if you’re game, it’s probably the best way to get a handle on your overall readiness. Another option, which Gornik uses with his Hyrox clients, is a full, albeit scaled-down simulation. “Instead of 1,000 meters, our runs might be 500 meters,” he says. And depending on a person’s fitness level, the weights and reps might be pared back as well. “In a 12-week training block, I'll have people do that three or four times, just to get an idea of what this whole thing is going to feel like.” That said, if you don’t have access to all of the equipment needed for a full run-through (which most people surely do not), don’t stress. While incorporating the actual Hyrox exercises into your compromised running workouts can be a helpful gauge, it’s not essential. “Compromised running is about getting used to that feeling of moving from running to a strength-oriented movement, and you can replicate that feeling without replicating the exactness of the race,” says Tooley. “At the end of the day, you can run for four minutes, do a minute of burpees, repeat that for eight rounds, and that will simulate what a Hyrox experience might feel like. If twice per week you do some sort of compromised running in your training, those sessions will do you wonders.” While it is strongly recommended to get at least a few hands-on training sessions with the specific pieces of equipment you’ll encounter on race day, you could, technically speaking, get by without having them in your regular training. “If you just wanted to finish the race, you could do that without ever having touched a SkiErg or a sled,” says Loebig. Of course, that isn’t to say you don’t need to train for these stations. It just means there are other exercises you can do to achieve similar gains in fitness and strength. For example, hill repeats can help get you ready for the sled push, says Loebig. No hill? No problem. \"As somebody who has dealt withplantar fasciitisand Achilles tendonitis, I can't push the sled as much as I would like,\" says Tooley. \"It simply hurts me. So I lean into walking lunges, which, I find, prepare your lower body in the exact same way, or as close to it, as a sled.\" Similarly, dumbbell thrusters are a great substitute for wall balls if you don’t have access to a medicine ball. “That's the best thing you could do,” says Gornik. Ultimately, however, strength is just part of the equation, and there’s a degree of skill—or, at the very least, familiarity—involved in maximizing your performance on each station, says Gornik. “It’s kind of like, ‘Could you run a half marathon if you only bike in training?’ Yeah, you can get really conditioned on a bike, and your heart doesn't know the difference between running and biking, but running is a skill, and if you're not proficient in that skill over 13 miles, you will be way more deficient than somebody who ran.” Also, for something like the sled push, there are multiple techniques to choose from, and one might be a better fit for your physiology than others. Don’t wait until race day to figure it out. Taken individually, the various components of Hyrox can seem manageable or even, dare I say, easy. But holistically, it’s an all-out, full-body battering, thanks to the cumulative effects of fatigue as you progress from station to station. This is why pacing is so crucial during the race. \"Pacing is so important, especially in your first Hyrox,” says Gornik. “The first few minutes, you’re just so excited, and the lactic acid hasn't really built up yet. But once you get to that sled push, your legs are going to feel it. And if you haven’t paced yourself, the pain cave is going to just wreck you.\" While pacing yourself in a running race is as simple as, well, literally pacing yourself, Hyrox forces you to rely on your perceived rate of exertion. Gornik advises clients to work at 60 percent effort up until the burpee station—the halfway point of the race. “From there, you take a hard look in the proverbial mirror and you decide how much you have left,” he says. Tooley gets even more granular, breaking the race down into three parts. “The way that I encourage my athletes to race Hyrox, the first 25 percent should be done at roughly a seven out of 10 effort level, whatever that looks like for you. The middle 50 percent should feel like an eight out of 10. And then the last 25 percent, that’s a nine or a 10 out of 10,” he says. For the runs, the best way to train for this kind of progression is with negative splits—hitting each running interval at a faster pace than the one before it. And on the SkiErg and rower, you can see your 500m split time on the monitor, which is a handy way to quantify your output and adjust accordingly. “As long as you progress your intensity, your effort, and your output over the course of the race, chances are you're going to set yourself up to finish strong and feel good about that effort,” Tooley says. “So, really, being able to check in with yourself becomes a skill set. And the only way to build that skill set is to practice it in your training.”",

    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Looking for more Mephisto-like sneakers to up your step count? Check our guide tothe best walking shoeson the market right now. Sneakers have had a tough go of it lately. Menswear’s prolongedreturn to elegancemeans boom times forloafers,derbies, and all manner ofdainty black shoes. Classic canvas kicks? Not so much. I’ll never abandon sneakers entirely, but I genuinely haven’t bought a new pair in forever, and the situations that demand them seem to be dwindling by the day. Come spring, though, the masculine urge tolace up a pristine pairis simply too strong to ignore, and right now, I’m eyeing one silhouette and one silhouette only: Mephisto’s gloriously geriatric Match sneakers. If you’re unfamiliar with the Match by name, you might know it from one of two places: the closest retirement home in your neighborhood, or the countless Cool Guys who can’t stop plugging it online. So if you’re wondering why a whole bunch of young-gun menswear nerds seem to be obsessed with a walking shoe long favored by octogenarians, allow me to explain. For starters, each pair is expertly crafted in Portugal using supple-yet-substantial leather uppers and luxurious leather insoles, both of which sit atop a shock-absorbing Soft-Air midsole and a durable rubber outsole. Comfort, as you’ve probably figured out, is the primary selling point here, whether you’re rushing to make the early-bird dinner special or to flick yourself up before the sun sets. Mephisto Amazon Mephisto Mephisto Amazon Mephisto The Match is available in every shade of powerful neutral, but the tonal brown-on-brown colorway might just be the most potent. Wear it withwashed jeans,khakis, ordressed-down trousersand it becomes a style multiplier of incredible force—a classic kick with the look of a sneaker and the soul of a dress shoe, sans any of the downside typically involved in combining the two. “Now that I've finally bought mine, I'm not sure what took me so long,”GQcontributor Louis Cheslaw says. “They're incredibly comfortable—in a supportive, not-overly-cushy way—and they go with literally everything. They're neither too dainty nor too chunky—straight down the middle, and therefore beholden to no ‘moment.’” To be honest, I wasn’t sold on Mephisto's hero product when I first saw it years ago, either. They were expensive then (and they’re still expensive now), and I couldn’t quite make sense of ‘em in the context of the sportier sneakers in my rotation. So chalk it up to white-sneaker fatigue, exposure therapy, or y’know, getting older, but they might be the only sneakers I want to wear now that we’re back in the throes of the season. The king is dead; long live the king.",

    "title": "Tariffs Will Make Vintage Shopping More Expensive. Here’s Why.",
    "article_text": "A week after President Trump announcedmassive tariffs on imports from over 180 countries, the consequences of “Liberation Day” are starting to become clear. The stock markets are in free fall.Our neighbors to the north are pissed. So are thevery American manufacturersthese tariffs were supposedly meant to benefit. Prices are expected to go up on everything from the unreleasedNintendo Switch 2to shirts fromsmall menswear brands. In the past, shopping for secondhand clothing has offered a salve for the price conscious. But as menswear enthusiasts prepare for a world where major fast-fashion exporters like China and Vietnam will be levied with some of the US’s highest reciprocal tariff rates, they might be surprised to find that costs at theirlocal vintage storeshave also gone up. Dr. LaTanya Brown-Robertson, professor of economics at Howard University in Washington, DC, says Americans should expect to start having to pay more for used clothing in a post-tariff world. “If secondhand and vintage clothing is seen as a close substitute for imported apparel, this will boost consumer demand and lead to a rise in the market prices,” she said. Indeed, increased demand is one of the primary factors many secondhand sellers say has been driving up the prices of vintage for the last few years. Jaime Paoletti-Wong first openedRaggedy Threadsin Los Angeles in 2002, before expanding with aBrooklyn outpost in 2016. The cost of used goods has significantly increased since COVID, she says, mainly because there are now far more vintage sellers competing for potential inventory. Brian Davis—who has been operatingWooden Sleeperssince 2010, first as an online-only shop and currently out of a space in Tuckahoe, New York—has noticed the same thing. “The explosion and popularity of vintage has caused prices to skyrocket, making sourcing more difficult.” Even some of the more green vintage sellers have noticed great, affordable inventory has become harder to find. “We have definitely seen a price bump at the wholesale level,” said Adam Joseph Schnitzer ofStitches Vintagein Austin, Texas. He started his secondhand business with a stall at the Soco Makers Market five years ago and opened a brick-and-mortar store in 2023. “Everything is more expensive [now] and unfortunately, we have to put that cost on the customer at times,” he said. To stay solvent without immediately increasing prices, Paoletti-Wong and her partner made efforts to stay updated on sourcing. They also decided to close their LA location in 2024, which wasn’t performing as well as the one in New York. They stayed on top of expenses, noting with worry when the wholesale prices of one of the few new items they stock—socks from Japan—increased from $1 to $3 per pair over the past year. The tariffs, she says, threaten to upend these efforts. That’s because Paoletti-Wong and other vintage sellers often source their best homegrown wares from overseas—in countries like Mexico, Canada, Thailand, and Pakistan—where she says “a substantial amount of American-made clothing was shipped” both during and after World War II. “People often overlook that some of the more affordable items are actually from these countries, [and] then imported back into the US,” she said. Additionally, Paoletti-Wong is bracing for the European workwear she sources from France and Italy to get more expensive. But until she actually receives a shipment from either country, “it’s still uncertain.” Davis is also worried about the effect of the tariffs for his international customers. If more countries retaliate to US tariffs with some of their own, as China and Canada already have, he might lose potential business from people who don’t want to pay high-percentage customs fees. “[That] is going to impact my bottom line,” he said. Some vintage sellers are more optimistic. Kelly Callison, owner ofa2vintagein Ypsilanti, Michigan, told me she is anxious about the tariffs, but also hopeful that they will “push people to shop small and shop sustainable.” Callison started her business 15 years ago and opened a brick-and-mortar store 11 years ago, but still struggled to stay open through Covid. “Thankfully our community rallied and helped us to come back,” she said. Recently, she was able to move into a larger space. The experience gave her reason to believe that when people are forced to spend more on essential items and have less indiscriminate spending money, they’ll remember that small businesses help shape communities. “It’s shops like mine that donate to your kid’s sports teams or give away back-to-school supplies,” she said. Schnitzer, on the other hand, is more bleak about his fate. “[The tariffs] are ultimately going to make it harder for us to profit off the business,” he said. “But really, what choice do we have other than to keep moving ahead?”",

    "title": "11 Best Men's Dress Pants 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. This is your reminder that the best men's dress pants aren’t just fordressy occasions. While they’re right at home with a matchingsuit jacketanddress shoes,holed up in a cubicleorat a wedding, dress pants have emerged from their formal shells ready to live their fullest fashion lives. So break out of the old-fashioned mindset and wear them not only to your job interview or big meetings, and bust them out whenever and wherever you damn-well please. All you need to do is to treat them like every other pant in your closet, just another tool in your fashionable chest to build the hardest fits you can. But if you have no idea where to even begin, don’t worry. We’ve done the dirty work and surveyed the dress pant landscape, worn dozens and dozens of options, and came up with our favorite pairs across every price point and style. A whole world of proper trousers awaits you, and we’ve selected 11 of the finest men’s dress pants to get you started. J.Crew J.Crew Materials:Italian wool |Fit:classic rise, relaxed leg |Pleats:double reverse pleat |Hem:finished cuff If you want the simple answer, it’s this: J.Crew. They’ve been a stalwart for decades and, in its current era under fashion royalty Brendon Babenzien, continue to further cement its rightful place in the annals of menswear. The brand’s relaxed-fit trousers are the perfect all-around trousers for most people and have a slew of great details that prove why J.Crew remains a go-to. An after-dinner split back waist, curtain lining, extended tab, reverse pleats, and a vintage-leaning coin pocket make these a treat for the wearer and innocent bystanders. J.Crew’s great at a lot of things, but one of the most delightful things about the preppy American staple is its ability to score high-quality fabrics from storied mills. While the pair we tested was made from a luscious flannel from Italy’s Vitale Barberis Canonico mill, J.Crew makes other versions of the full-cut pants using fabric from Loro Piana and Baird McNutt. For just around $250 (and even less on sale), there’s almost no touching them. Berle Nordstrom Materials:Super 110s wool |Fit:Classic |Pleats:Double reverse pleat |Hem:Unfinished If you want a stand-up pair of dress pants without getting caught up in the minutiae of tailoring (and the price tags that can come with), you’d best look for something that maximizes on value and quality. Whether it’s your first pair of big boy pants or not, Berle’s line of straightforward trousers hits the mark in so many ways. The label has been slinging trou for more than 80 years and continue to provide a product as solid as it is affordable. Each pair uses quality wool spun into classic materials like gabardine and twill, with traditional details. They won’t cause any of the menswear snobs to swoon, but they also won’t draw negative attention. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Materials:100% wool, Italian gabardine |Fit:High-rise, wide-leg |Pleats:Double pleats |Hem:Finished Once you’ve graduated from your first pair of nice dress pants, the sky’s the limit. And though there are plenty of fine dress pants to add to your budding collection, we think Todd Snyder’s Wythe trousers are the most logical next step. They’re crafted from a four-ply wool Italian gabardine material that’s both airy yet dense, resulting in an incredibly handsome drape that would make Cary Grant swoon. The high rise is complemented by and extended tab and double reverse pleats, a generous thigh and straight leg. We love that they come in multiple inseam lengths for convenience. But if you want to get even more granular, you might still need to take them to the tailor. Buck Mason Buck Mason Materials:7.7 oz. Italian cotton twill |Fit:Classic, mid-rise, straight leg |Pleats:Flat front |Hem:Unfinished When the ask is a pair of dress pants that’ll work in as many situations as possible, there are several criteria it should meet: a timeless, versatile colorway; a classic silhouette; and a fabric that can be comfortably worn all year round. For that, we like Buck Mason’s Graduate Pants. The fabric is an Italian cotton twill that has a smooth hand and structured feel to it. The cut is a classic mid-rise with a straight leg and comes with an unfinished hem for easy tailoring. What we love about these trousers is that they can stand up to most dressy situations with a well-pressed crease and the proper accoutrements, but it can also be almost as relaxed as your daily pair of jeans if you embrace the inevitable wrinkles. That said, if you’re looking for some dress pants to wear for a certified black-tie situation, we wouldn’t recommend these. Mfpen Mr Porter Materials:100% wool |Fit:Mid-rise, wide-leg |Pleats:Single pleat |Hem:Finished Breaking into the officewear niche ain’t easy, especially when you’ve got a gang of OGs defending their posts. But Mfpen’s strolled into the corporate HQ with a fresh outlook on the stuffy suit—and have gained the approval of the menswear elite. The Copenhagen-based label’s billowy and slouchy suiting lies somewhere between ‘80s Armani and your big brother’s hand-me-downs in the best way possible. It’s the kind of suit you wear to skate by the office dress code while peeving your boss. And if you’re not ready to dive into the deep end of anti-corporate corporate wear, Mfpen’s Service trousers are a great place to test the waters. They’re made of a wonderful Barathea weave wool fabric whose elegant drape belies its airy feel, cut into a mid-rise, wide-leg fit. Drake's Drake's Materials:100% wool |Fit:mid-rise, straight leg |Pleats:single pleats |Hem:unfinished From the quality to the art direction, Drake’s has been the go-to label for menswear bros for years. With details like Italian merino wool twill, an after-dinner split, curtained waist, and French bearer button, it’s chock full of tasty little details that make tailoring nerds’ ears perk up. Saint Laurent Saint Laurent Materials:100% cashmere |Fit:Wide, wide leg |Pleats:Single pleat |Hem:finished cuff Sometimes, dress pants can be ultra-flashy—the kind of pants you wear to cut a rug at your local discotech or to strut your stuff down the red carpet (a common occurrence for so many of us, clearly). So if you’re looking for some swanky trousers to paint the town red or color your friends green with envy, Saint Laurent’s 90’s pants will fit the bill. They fit ultra high on the waist with sharp pleats, a relaxed top block and arrow-straight legs leading to a cuff. What you get is a pair of glossy, swaggering trousers that’ll have you feeling like David Bowie. All that’s left is to pair it with your glitziest shoes and your sexiest button-up. Banana Republic Banana Republic Spier & Mackay Spier & Mackay Rota The Armoury Thom Browne Nordstrom Ask any menswear nerd and they’ll agree that there’s an art to a well-made pair of dress pants. Of course, the main tenets come down to materials, construction, and fit. But dissecting the minute details can be a chore, especially if you don’t know what you’re looking for. For materials, seasonality is crucial to consider. Wool gabardines will be great options for three-season wear while cotton twills and linens are suited more for spring and summer. Going into winter, look for heavier fabrics like Donegal, flannel, and tweed. Respected and storied fabric mills are always an easy jumping off point. Some of these include Loro Piana, Vitale Barberis Canonico, and Harris Tweed. Derek Guy, fashion writer and founder ofDie, Workwear!, says to try and opt for the heaviest weight you can comfortable wear, regardless of the season. “Around 12–14 oz. is a good starting place. Lighter fabrics tend to lose their shape and don’t drape as cleanly, which can make the trousers look flimsy.” The web of microscopic details is easy to get caught up in, but Guy says there’s an easy way to check for quality. “But the real giveaway? Inlay—or more often, the lack of it.” The inlay is the extra fabric located at the seat and side seams of the pant and allows for easy alterations. “When companies are working with tight margins,” he says, “inlay is one of the first things they cut. High-end makers, on the other hand, leave generous inlay as a sign of quality—and as a practical gesture for alterations down the line.” The built-in leeway to alter a pair of dress pants is important in dialing in a proper fit. Of course, taking advantage of the inlay can only get you so far, but Guy says when you’re looking for the right fit, it’s not so complicated. “Fit refers to a narrow set of technical criteria, and the guiding principle is simple: the trousers should hang cleanly.” It helps to check yourself out in a three-way mirror, if possible. Guy says to look for any areas where the clean lines of the drape are disrupted—flaring at the pockets, ripples at the legs, or fabric catching at the calves. Flared pockets usually means there’s not enough room through the hips or across the lap. If the back rise is too long, that can cause ripples at the back of the legs. And if the fabric is catching at the back of the legs, that’s a sign that the pants are too slim. Tailors should be able to work within reason to alter a pair of dress pants to your taste, but “as a general rule,” Guy says, “the less you need to alter, the better the result will be.” Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Rami Malek Is Bringing Back ’90s Airport Style",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. The 1990s werethe golden age of jet-set fashion. That era was a sweet spot in which travelers had stopped fully suiting up for flights, but designer sweatpants hadn’t yet become the norm, leading to transit ensembles with real purpose and personality. And luckily for us (and a million Instagram mood boards), the paparazzi were there to capture it all: the ’90s airport fit was born and etched into the halls of menswear. ThinkDavid Lettermanin a double-breasted blazer and broken-in chinos,Christian Slaterdonning an overcoat with leather pants, orWesley Snipesand hisBeetlejuice-esque pants. While those halcyon days are sadly long behind us, every once in awhile a modern star still surprises us with a genuinely great airport fit. Case in point: Rami Malek arriving at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport this week to promote his new thrillerThe Amateur, dressed like he was stepping off at LAX in 1995. Malek’s look nailed the crucial element of an effortlessly chic airport fit: a pitch-perfect balance of comfort and style. He wore an aged leather jacket inthe cropped and boxy (and very ’90s) stylethat has surged in relevance in recent years. (It’s the same one he’s been wearing allweek.) Malek rounded out the look with sleek black pants andsome Maison Margiela derby shoesto add a pop of high-grade fashion. But most crucially, he mastered the dueling trademarks of true airport-celebrity style: layering and incognito accessories. Underneath the jacket were a brown hoodie, aknitted sweater, and astriped button-upwith a scarf draped over his shoulders. And like a true throwback movie star, Malek donnedsunglassesand abaseball cap, with a hood pulled over his head for good measure. All those layers looked cool, of course, but there was an extra touch of practicality baked in: Packing for a long trip is a breeze when your bulkiest pieces—like, say, a heavyweightleather jacket,beefy hoodie, andthick-soled derbies—are all on your person. If you must suffer through the indignity of today’s late-capitalism commercial travel, there is at least one thing you can control: your outfit. And when it comes to the sea of sweatpants that populate the modern airport, a little effort goes a long way. You’d do well to take a note from Rami Malek—chill and relaxed with just a jolt of clued-in fashion. In 2025, he’s managed to do the near impossible: deliver a contemporary and classic fit that holds its own in the annals of ’90s airport style.",

    "title": "‘The Pitt’'s Dr. Santos Did (Almost) Nothing Wrong",
    "article_text": "By now, if you've been watchingThe Pitt, you probably have a favoritePittdoctor. Many of them are easy to love, like Noah Wyle's Dr. Robby, an honorable man with major trauma and incrediblefacial hair, or Taylor Dearden's earnest Dr. Mel, who singsMegan Thee Stallion's “Savage” to herself as a mid-shift pump-up song. We even stan Gerran Howell's Whitaker, the poor little farm boy who keeps getting covered in bodily fluids and turns out to have a knack for rat-killing. But here's where I'll admit something controversial: I have a soft spot for Dr. Trinity Santos, played with gumption by Isa Briones. Look, I know what you're going to say: Santos is an asshole! She's a narc! She's too confident for her skill level! But here's what I say to you: She's learning, she's got the right mentality for this industry, and I want the best for her. But most importantly, every good TV show needs a great lovable bitch, and Santos provides that in spades. The Pitt, whose first-season finale airs tomorrow night, primes you to dislike Santos. She gives people nicknames without their consent—when Dr. Javadi (Shabana Azeez) faints during the first few hours of the show's nightmare shift, Santos nicknames her “Crash,” and later she starts calling Whitaker “Huckleberry,” just because. She also displays little concern for the emergency room's chain of command, particularly in the way she acts with Langdon (Patrick Ball), the senior resident with dark hair and a perfect dimple. Santos immediately distrusts Langdon, despite the fact that he's her attending and she's just an intern. This, of course, is a no-no, and a sign of her bad attitude. Hedoesknow more than her—and, frankly, if I were dying of a severe injury in the Pitt, I wouldn't want some arrogant youngster talking back to her superior when trying to treat me. At the same time: She's also sort ofrightabout Langdon. Santos correctly perceives that he's been ordering extra doses of drugs and then squirreling them away in his locker. When Santos reveals this to hotshot surgeon Garcia (Alexandra Metz), she tells Santos to keep the information to herself. Instead, Santos ends up telling Robby, who tells Langdon to get out. In the Langdon-Santos squabble, we're conditioned to side with Langdon, who returns to the Pitt to lend a hand after thePitt Festmass-casualty event. First off, he's a hottie. Second, it's pretty clear there's something that both we and Santos don't know about his situation. Yes, he's been secreting away some pills—but he's not actually acting incapacitated in any way. He's good at his job in a way Santos isn't, at least not quite yet; at one point, trying to perform an incision, she drops a scalpel into Garcia's foot. But of the newbies we've met this season, Santos also seems the most qualified for a long-term career in this field. ER doctors aresupposedto be cowboys—forging ahead when everything around them is a gruesome mess—and Santos conducts herself with situationally-appropriate swag. Yes, of course, it's a self-defense mechanism—she's protecting her own psyche against the stresses of an extreme work environment. Eventually, we get a glimpse of how she likely developed that tool, when it's revealed that she has her own history of trauma. When no one's looking, she accosts an intubated patient who is likely abusing his young daughter, threatening him while he's unable to respond. The fact that I like Santos despite her habitual line-stepping is also a credit to Briones' savvy performance, from the way her eyes light up when she's about to deliver a perfect comeback or perform a gnarly procedure to the moment she casually reveals to the gossipping Filipino nurses that she can understand what they're saying in Tagalog. (Briones is of Filipino-American descent, and the character's name was changed toreflect that heritageand the long history ofFilipino workers in the U.S. health-care system.) Briones understands that she's playing a likeable villain—the kind of character you love to hate, until you just unabashedly love them. You can see that in the way she bites a Kit Kat when taunting the bed ridden reporter who snuck into the hospital to get a story on the carnage and slipped on some blood. As we head into the final episode of the season, it's looking like Santos might actually try to get better at the whole empathy thing. But even if she doesn't, she's very fun to watch.",

    "title": "King Charles and Queen Camilla Meet With Pope Francis on Their 20-Year Anniversary",
    "article_text": "King CharlesandQueen Camilla’s 20thwedding anniversary was made even more special when the royals met withPope Francison Wednesday during their state visit to Italy. Buckingham Palace and the Vatican confirmed that the meeting, which was not included on the official itinerary, took place Wednesday afternoon. According to the palace, Charles and Camilla were “delighted” the pontiff was “well enough to host them–and to have had the opportunity to share their best wishes in person.” Pope Francis appears to the faithful at the end of a Mass celebrated by Monsignor Rino Fisichella (not pictured) on the occasion of the Jubilee of Sick in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, on April 06, 2025. A statement from the Vatican said Pope Francis shared his “best wishes” with the couple as they celebrate two decades of marriage. He also “reciprocated his wishes to His Majesty for a speedy recovery of his health,” it added. The 88-year-old pope was last seen before cheering crowds at the Vatican over the weekend after being discharged from the hospital two weeks ago, following a double bout of pneumonia. King Charles and Queen Camilla’s four-day visit to Italyhad originally included a visit to the Vaticanbut their schedule was changed after Pope Francis was hospitalized with pneumonia. Wednesday’s meeting at the Vatican took place on the penultimate day of the royal tour, which coincided with King Charles and Queen Camilla’s 20thwedding anniversary. The couple celebrated the milestone withthe release of a new photographand video on their social media channels. Sources at Buckingham Palace said the meeting was at the request of the Pope, lasted just 20 minutes, and took place after Charles addressed the Italian Parliament. The royals retired briefly at Villa Wolkonsky, the official residence of the British ambassador to Italy in Rome, to change outfits before being driven to the Vatican. While the Palace and the Vatican would not comment on what was discussed during the meeting, it is understood that the pope took the opportunity to wish Their Majesties a happy anniversary. It is also understood that discussions about Charles and Camilla making their official state visit to the Holy See are ongoing. So far, the tour has been a great success. King Charles had a private audience withItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, while the royal couple has visited a number of popular sites, including the Colosseum. Earlier Wednesday, Queen Camilla paid a touching tribute to her husband byrewearing her wedding day outfit, which was redesigned for her byAnna Valentine,for the couple’s engagement at the Italian Parliament. King Charles (L), flanked by Italian Senate's speaker Ignazio La Russa (L) and Chamber of Deputies' speaker Lorenzo Fontana (R), greets the audience during a joint session of the Chambers of the Italian parliament at the Chamber of Deputies in Rome, Italy, on April 09, 2025. During his historic address to the Italian Parliament, which he delivered in English and Italian, Charles spoke of his affection for Italy. “I am here today with one purpose: to reaffirm the deep friendship between the United Kingdom and Italy, and to pledge to do all in my power to strengthen that friendship even further in the time that is granted to me as king,” he said. King Charles and Queen Camilla are scheduled to attend a state banquet at the Palazzo Quirinale in Rome on Wednesday evening. The tour concludes tomorrow.

    "title": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump Are Finally (Maybe) Breaking Up",
    "article_text": "When protesters converged this past weekend across America, they seized on two central villains:Donald TrumpandElon Musk.On this episode, host andVanity Faireditor in chiefRadhika Jones,along with executive editorClaire Howorthand Hive editorMichael Calderone,discuss how perceptions of Musk have radically shifted from rocket-building billionaire to government hatchet man and right-wing troll. Contributing editorZoë Bernardjoins the show to discuss how Musk’s ethos reflects Silicon Valley and whether his more libertarian views on tariffs could hasten his exit from Washington. The first thing to know about Musk is that he was not always a pro-Trump flamethrower. Bernard traces hispolitical shiftto around 2020, when entrepreneurs in California were “knocking up against more and more regulation,” she says. “So I think it was a convergence of, you know, hating the media and seeing institutions like the media as this arm of liberalism and the Democratic Party, and then also bumping up against these regulations that made it increasingly difficult for him to innovate with Tesla.” His transformation accelerated during the pandemic, when he clashed with California health officials over the temporary shutdown of Tesla factories. Meanwhile, he didcontroversial spotsonJoe Rogan’s podcast, like one in2020where he pontificated about “anti-globalization and anti-globalists,” says Howorth. “Those are all very [right-wing] terms now, and I feel like that interview was a seed.” But what may have tipped Musk over the ideological edge, Calderone notes, was being “snubbed” byJoe Biden,who conspicuouslyleft him outof a 2021 electric vehicle summit: “He thought Tesla should be there and apparently they were not.” Fast forward a few years, and after acquiring the site formerly known as Twitter and throwing his financial weight behind Trump’s second presidential bid, Musk has reemerged as a very different political powerhouse. But, as Jones points out, “it’s only a matter of time before the bromance between Trump and Elon goes south, and it does seem like there are some cracks showing in his relationship with the Trump administration as recently as the last few days.” Take, for instance, thepartnershipthat Trump announced months ago withSam Altman’s OpenAI, a major competitor of Musk’s in the artificial intelligence space. Trumpreportedly toldthree Cabinet members last month that Musk would leave soon. More recently, there are also the tariffs Trump announced last week, which have brought abloodbathto Wall Street—and arealready eatinginto Musk’s own net worth. “It’s hard for me to imagine that any of these billionaires that supported Trump are happy right now,” says Bernard. “Elon Musk included, but I think I don’t know what he will do politically, given that he’s put all of his chips in the Trump corner at this point. So, I mean, he can’t go back to the liberal side.” “It’s actually kind of sad,” Howorth notes, “because his legacy could have been that of a climate change evangelist who made a beautiful, efficient, and relatively affordable vehicle and helped astronauts explore space and expanded medical understanding of the brain. And now he’s gonna go down as achainsawing maniac.” Aimee Lou Woodon the TragicWhite LotusFinale AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood Karen Read Returns to Trial: Here’sEverything You Need to Know DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Meghan Markle Might Be One of the Few Winners In Trump’s Tariff Wars",
    "article_text": "ThoughPresident Donald Trumphas been playing a game of “will they or won’t they” in his dalliance withpotentially catastrophic global tariffs,Meghan Markleisn’t too worried about the impact on her new lifestyle company, As Ever. In an interview withFortune,the Duchess of Sussex said “we don’t anticipate tariffs affecting us directly,” because As Ever’s products are made in America. Still, Meghan said she hoped the price point of her debut collection—eight of her nine initial products retailed for less than $15—would help ensure stability in the face of economic headwinds. “But as we look at the larger context of how this is going to affect the consumer day to day, I’m very grateful that in part of the conception of this brand, I wanted to create products that look more prestige, but are more accessible and affordable,” she added. “I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy.” At this point, the question is largely theoretical, because As Ever’sinitial product offerings sold out within an hourwhen they were released on April 2. According toFortune,the company says they sold through inventory of “tens of thousands.” The first slate of products included raspberry preserves, wildflower honey with honeycomb, three herbal teas, crepe mix, cookie mix, and flower petal “sprinkles,” some of which were featured in Meghan’s Netflix show,With Love, Meghan. Last month, Netflix announced that a second season had already been filmed and would air in the fall, and As Ever’s offerings are expected to expand seasonally alongside future episodes. Meghan haspreviously saidthat working alongside Netflix’s Consumer Products Group helped her expand her ambitions for her lifestyle brand. In her conversation withFortune,she added that sending her homemade jam to Netflix’s chief content officerBela Bajariaand co-CEOTed Sarandosas a holiday gift might have gottenWith Love, Meghanthe greenlight in the first place. “[Bajaria] said: ‘You need to teach people how to do this,’ and from that moment she was very excited about the possibility of a show,” said Meghan. “And I think because of how savvy my partners are, and certainly business-minded strategically, she said: ‘In addition to a show, you should talk to our consumer products division about a partnership.’” As Ever’s rollout faceda bit of initial confusionbecause the brand’s limited edition honey sold out in less than five minutes, leading some orders to be canceled after they were placed. Since that snafu was resolved,the roll out has continued smoothly, with a bevy of Meghan’s famous friends, includingKris Jenner, Chrissy Teigen, Zoe Saldaña,andMindy Kaling,posting their branded gift basketsto Instagram.

    "title": "Congratulations, Justin Baldoni: Harvey Weinstein Is Not on Your Side",
    "article_text": "Update, Thursday, April 10, 2:00 p.m. ET:Apologies toJustin Baldoni:Harvey Weinsteinis actuallynoton his side. According to a representative for Weinstein, the disgraced producer and convicted rapist is staying neutral in the legal dispute between Justin Baldoni andBlake Lively. \"Please note that Harvey is not taking sides in the Baldoni–Lively matter. He is not familiar with the details and has only ever had the kindest, warmest interactions with both Blake and Ryan,\" said the representative in a statement issued toVanity Fair.“His comments were solely related to The New YorkTimesand its handling of the story about him, specifically in reference to what Baldoni suggested regarding the piece involving him and Lively. That is the full extent of his involvement.” Glad we cleared that up. This original post continues below. Harvey Weinsteinhas weighed in onJustin BaldoniandBlake Lively’s legal battlefrom his prison cell on Rikers Island.Per TMZ, the disgraced producer and convicted rapist has thrown his support behind Baldoni, alleging thatThe New York Timestreated him the same way it treated the director ofIt Ends With Us. Baldoni and Lively are currently engaged in a sprawling legal entanglement that began whenLively sued Baldoni for sexual harassment and retaliationthat allegedly occurred both on the set of their movie,It Ends With Us,and the ensuing press tour. Baldoni countersued, claiming that Lively and her husband,Ryan Reynolds,waged a smear campaign against him. Healso suedThe New York Times,which broke the news of Lively’s claims, for allegedly cherry-picking details and altering key communications to “deliberately” mislead readers. Weinstein would have you believe that he has also been mistreated by theTimes.“Watching Justin Baldoni take legal action againstThe New YorkTimesand its reporters—accusing them of manipulating communications and ignoring evidence that countered Ms. Lively’s claims—hit me hard,” said Weinstein in a statement issued to TMZ. “It brought back everything I experienced when theTimesreported on me in 2017. They did the same thing: cherry-picked what fit their story and ignored critical context and facts that could have challenged the narrative.” Weinstein’s career was upended afterThe New YorkerandThe New York Timesinterviewed numerous women who accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and sexual assault, includingRose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow,andAngelina Jolie.The reports invigorated the #MeToo movement, and led to Weinstein ultimately beingconvicted of rapein New York in 2020. In 2022, Weinsteinwas convictedof three more sex crimes in a separate trial in Los Angeles. (Weinstein pleaded not guilty to all charges against him and has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.) In 2024, his first convictionwas overturnedafter an appeals court ruled that he had not received a fair trial.Weinstein’s retrialon the original New York charges, as well as some new accusations, is scheduledto begin jury selectionon April 15. Although he was found guilty in a court of law, Weinstein told TMZ that he “should have stood up and fought back” againstThe New York Times.“I should have had the courage to speak out against the way the truth was twisted,” his statement continues. “That failure still haunts me. I’ll be watching this case closely—it matters to anyone who’s ever been on the receiving end of a media takedown, and even more to someone who’s had to pay a high legal price.” New YorkTimesreporterMegan Twohey,who coauthored the originalTimesstory on Lively’s allegations against Baldoni, also reported on Weinstein’s alleged sexual assault and misconduct. TheTimeswon a Pulitzer Prize for Twohey and reporterJodi Kantor’s reporting on Weinstein;The New Yorkeralso won a Pulitzer for Ronan Farrow’s report on Weinstein. Twohey and Kantor’s book,She Said,was adapted into a film starringZoe Kazanand Golden Globe nomineeCarey Mulligan.Weinstein was not involved in the project. In a statement to TMZ, a spokesperson forThe New York Timessaid, “Our comprehensive investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against Mr. Weinstein was rigorously reported over many months and based on on-the-record interviews, legal settlements paid to accusers and other documents. None of the facts in our coverage are in dispute. Mr. Weinstein acknowledged his misconduct in astatementthat was published in full in theTimes.He’s since been criminally convicted of rape and sexual assault.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "article_text": "A former Facebook executive who recently published an explosive tell-all memoir about her time at the company is set totestifybefore Congress Wednesday about the risk she claims Meta poses to US national security. Sarah Wynn-Williams, Facebook’s former director of global public policy, sent Meta’s sizable public relations and legal apparatus intooverdrivein March when her book debuted, alleging that she had been terminated from the company after accusing its now chief global affairs officerJoel Kaplanof sexual harassment. Among other things, the book also charged the company with cozying up to China’s censorship regime in hopes of launching its services there—a topic that Wynn-Williams plans to focus on in her testimony, according to herprepared remarks, which were first reported on byNBC News. Meta previously toldVanity Fairthat the book included a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives.” A slew of former employees have also sincespoken out, testifying to Kaplan’s character and accusing Wynn-Williams of misrepresenting events. Meta went so far as to seek an emergencyhearingwith an arbitrator to enforce a non-disparagement agreement Wynn-Williams signed in exchange for severance when she was fired in 2017. The arbitrator barred Wynn-Williams from promoting the book or “amplifying or repeating” any “disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental comments.” But theStreisand Effectis a heckuva thing, andCareless Peoplenot only soared to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list, but it also caught the attention of Big Tech hawks like Republican SenatorJosh Hawley, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that Wynn-Williams will brief Wednesday. In her opening remarks, Wynn-Williams plans to accuse Meta of working “‘hand in glove’ with the Chinese Communist Party to construct and test custom-built censorship tools that silenced and censored their critics.” She also plans to accuse Meta of lying about its operations in China, including about its open-source AI model Llama. Reutersreportedlast year that Meta’s Llama has been used by researchers linked to China’s People’s Liberation Army, a use case Meta’s director of public policy told Reuters was “unauthorized and contrary to our acceptable use policy.” Meta spokespersonAndy Stonestatedon X that “the alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over [$1 trillion] to surpass the US technologically.” In her remarks, Wynn-Williams notes that advertisers in China remain a significant revenue stream for Meta. Indeed, the companybroughtin $18 billion from Chinese advertisers last year, according to its SEC reports. However, Meta argues that ad revenue is distinct from operating its platforms for users to join in China. “Sarah Wynn-Williams’ testimony is divorced from reality and riddled with false claims,” Meta spokespersonRyan DanielstoldVanity Fair. “WhileMark Zuckerberghimself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.” Wynn-Williams plans to acknowledge the arbitrator’s order that she refrain from badmouthing Meta. But, in her remarks, she writes that she is speaking to Congress “at considerable personal risk because you have the power and the authority to hold them accountable.” Meta has said the arbitrator’s order does not prohibit Wynn-Williams’ testimony. “We have no intention to interfere with Wynn-Williams’ legal rights,”Danielssaid.ecurity.

    "title": "Sean Ono Lennon on ‘One to One: John & Yoko,’ Sam Mendes’s Beatles Films, and Life at 49",
    "article_text": "In the nearly 45 years since John Lennon was killed outside The Dakota, he’s remained both a legend and a man—thanks in no small part toYoko OnoandSean Ono Lennon’s stewardship of his estate. (I’m going to wait a second for the haters who never shut up to leave the room.)Kevin Macdonald’s new documentary,One to One,is a captivating addition to the canon, with concert tracks produced by Sean himself. Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland, State of Play) makes John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s long-lost Madison Square Garden concerts from 1972 the documentary’s centerpiece. It’s a vibrant, often moving set, but the director is after even more. He captures the swirling larger context of the early ’70s, when John and Yoko were living in Greenwich Village and their anti-war activism landed John on Nixon’s deportation list. What makes the doc so inventive is how Macdonald intersperses the footage with vintage interviews, news reports, and even anesthetizing TV commercials from back in the day. Taken together, his collage beautifully conjures a divisive era that may look a little familiar. In advance ofOne to One’s theatrical run (it opens in IMAX theaters on April 11, before expanding) Sean Ono Lennon talked and emailed withVanity Fairabout the documentary, his parents, and what his life is like as he approaches 50. Vanity Fair:I interviewed you and your mom at The Dakota when you were 20, and the two of you were about to tour for the albumRising.She was worried that you’d be embarrassed to be in a rock band with your mother, but I remember you saying, “I’m just so psyched to bring Yoko to the people.” Sean Ono Lennon:Well, obviously parents are always embarrassing, but the thing that maybe people would expect me to be embarrassed by I was very proud of—which is I think her music is great. I was always inspired by her music. I grew up with her making records. Do you remember being in the studio with your parents as a little kid? Sure. I remember being in the studio duringDouble Fantasy,actually. I remember them recording my voice and me not realizing that they were. It kind of, I don’t know, made me uncomfortable. I hated the sound of my voice. I just have these very vague memories of napping on the couch and stuff. Now you must get people coming up to you and saying, “Gosh, the ‘Beautiful Boy’ is…” [Laughs] An ugly man. Oh, stop. [Sings to the tune of “Beautiful Boy”] Ugly, ugly, ugly, ug-a-ly man. What was it like to go back and listen to the live tracks when you produced them forOne to One? It was really fun for me because the tracks were kind of a mess, and I got to listen to the raw master tapes withPaul Hicks,who’s the engineer I work with. In terms of Mom, I mean, I think she was really amazing. She hadn’t been a rock star or a pop artist before—she was an avant-garde conceptual artist who did installations, and she did some experimental performances with John and Ornette Coleman. But for her to just walk onstage at Madison Square Garden to do two sold-out shows in a single day—to have that kind of confidence and just do it—is something that I don’t think I could do. I feel like I have memories of her telling me that she was influenced by avant-garde composers, and she tried to incorporate those kinds of tones into her chords. She wasn’t the most trained classical musician, but I think she was more than most rock musicians. She came to it from a pretty sophisticated place. So just as a music nerd, producing the music forOne to Onewas an interesting challenge? I hope you don’t mind me calling you a music nerd. I take that as a compliment. I really have enjoyed working on all my dad’s music and the stuff I’ve done with my mom, but I especially enjoyed this. I guess, as you say, from a music-nerd perspective, it’s really fun to have challenges and overcome them. Especially with modern mixing technology, there’s a lot more you can do. It makes me feel really good that I can honestly say to myself that we’re making the best version of these recordings that people have ever heard. That’s subjective, but at least I can say that to myself with a straight face. Your parents sing some powerful songs in the documentary. John does “Mother,” and Yoko does “Don’t Worry Kyoko,” about the agony of being forcibly separated from her first child.One to Oneis largely about an electric political moment in the ’70s, but I don’t see how anybody could watch it and not be moved by the personal pain they’re singing about. I think when you listen to those records, it’s harder for people to imagine. But when you are at the performance you see that my mom’s essentially doing a Jimi Hendrix feedback guitar solo—but with her voice. It’s a very energetic kind of wild rock-and-roll energy. I toured the world playing guitar in her band, and people you might not expect to enjoy that kind of thing really did actually wind up kind of grooving to it. Especially “Don’t Worry Kyoko.” That song is so heavy on so many levels because of what it’s about, and then she’s wailing and it’s uncomfortable for people. But the groove is just killer. And for this concert, the band is just killing it, and it’s kind of hypnotic. It’s wrenching to see your father sing “Mother.” What’s your relationship to that song these days? Obviously, it’s about his mom and dad both leaving him—in very different ways. Well, to be honest my first memory of that version of “Mother” is when he plays a wrong note and smiles guiltily. Even when I was young I found that to be especially charming. The whole JL POB album [John Lennon/the Plastic Ono Band] is a masterpiece in my view. I grew up listening to “God” and “Mother” (sister tunes to my ears), and was very moved by them even before I could understand them. You can hear the influence my mother had on his singing style as he screams at the end…. You can tell my father is putting the elaborate surrealism of his past away for a more brutalist and raw type of expression. The transformation in his style from Beatle to solo artist I think is unprecedented for someone of his stature. In short, it’s one of the best moments of the film and concert. For many years, your mother did an excellent job of keeping your father’s music alive in the world. I’m glad to hear you’re enjoying the work you’re doing now, because I’ve sometimes wondered if it’s hard for you to suddenly be a spokesperson for them. Well, I really love doing work that is meaningful to me personally. It has really enriched my life. I mean, it’s made my life more complicated, but I also think it’s a gift. And in terms of being a spokesperson—I don’t really want to be a spokesperson. I don’t think you can really speak for other people, especially John and Yoko. I feel that I am speaking for me, and I am their kid. I know a lot about them. I know a lot about their work and their intentions and where they were coming from—probably better than maybe anybody. But I don’t want to be considered a spokesperson. To be honest, my father’s not here, so it’s unfair to represent what he would think. And my mother certainly is not the kind of person who wishes me to speak for her. I wouldn’t say that I’m a spokesperson. I would say I’m a custodian, maybe. Your mother once told me that your dad worried the “business bastards” would have the two of you out on the street if he died. When he did die, your mom of course worried about what would happen to you ifshedied. When you were six, she brought you onstage at the Grammys partly to introduce you to the world so you’d be a little safer. Is that right? Well, yeah. I would say that going to the Grammys forDouble Fantasywas definitely a kind of a splash into cold water for me, in terms of the public at large. It was intense. Now you must be worried aboutbothJohn and Yoko and their legacies. What you were saying about my mom working very hard to keep my dad in the zeitgeist—I think she did an amazing job. And hopefully I learned a lot from that. But I think it’s almost harder than ever to keep an artist like my dad in the consciousness. There’s so much more art. There’s so much more music. There’s hundreds of thousands of albums coming out every year, and they’re all essentially free. And then on top of it, society is changing so much. So I do worry about people forgetting about John Lennon, because I don’t think society should—or can afford to—forget about people like my dad or my mom. She’s still present in the world and people are seeing her work all the time, whereas my dad hasn’t been around for a while. When I went to university, there was a core curriculum where you have to learn a certain number of masterpieces of music, a certain number of masterpieces of literature. I feel like society has shifted away from even believing in that kind of tradition, which I think is very dangerous. I really think that not only do we owe it to future generations to keep Shakespeare and Socrates alive, we also owe it to them to keep Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon alive. When I was growing up—and that was the ’80s and ’90s, even the early 2000s—you could argue people like Zeppelin and Hendrix and the Beatles and Stones were in the pantheon of these godlike figures. I don’t think it’s as true today, and I think that that’s unfortunate. The music they produce and the transformative ideas that they represented are really important. I don’t think we can afford to forget them, especially in the case of John and Yoko, because in that case, we’re talking about peace and love. And I think that message is sadly as important, if not more important than it’s ever been. One to Oneis experimental in the sense that you don’t know what’s going to come at you next—live music, news footage, interviews with John and Yoko, commercials from the ’70s. It’s a collage of many things, but it captures the era so vividly. It was a brilliant concept to tell the story of John and Yoko’s political years—their political activist years—through intermittently watching their concert, while also telling the story of the ’70s in America and the world. I thinkKevin Macdonald—he’s clearly a brilliant filmmaker. I mean, the film happens to be revolving around the central concert that happened, but it’s so much more than that. Tell me some music you love and listen to constantly. If you made me a playlist, what would be on it? Man, I would actually send you a playlist if you want. Yes, please. Despite my hatred of Spotify, I have to admit that I also use Spotify. I have hundreds of playlists. It’s ridiculous. I listen to so many different kinds of music, to be honest. I go through real phases. Maybe you do, maybe most people do—but I’ll listen to one record every day for weeks. Can you give me an example? [Here, Lennon—passionately and in too much detail to quote—recommends the indie band Warpaint, the British pianistTom Rogersonand his work withBrian Eno,the virtuosic Swedish duo Mats/Morgan Band, the longtime progressive-rock singerPeter Hammill,and the electronic music artist who goes by the name Aphex Twin.] You opened up Pandora’s box. I’m a very weird guy, and I sit and I just look through the internet to find people who were in bands of bands of bands. That’s honestly the best thing about the internet—researching music and cat videos. Those are the two reasons I still have a computer. You’ve always seemed to have good relationships with everybody in the Beatles family, including your half brother, Julian. Well, look, the idea that Julian and I were evernotclose is wrong. That’s something that the press made up. I think it’s because my mother and he had some disputes, and his version of that story he was very public about. That’s his right to do that. I tend to not want to talk about family things like that. Just my personal style—I think I inherited it from my mother. But Julian and I have always been close. He was my hero when I was young. He taught me to play guitar. He had a number one record when I was a tween, so he was literally one of the reasons I started playing music. And this idea that we were ever fighting is…it’s almost like the “Yoko broke up the Beatles” thing. No matter how many times I say it’s not true, no matter how many photos people see of us laughing and hanging out, they always say, “Oh, you should hang out with your brother.” I’m like, “We do. I love him.” It’s never been a problem. Ever. People want it to be some kind ofGame of Thronesthing, but it never has been with us. I always loved [Julian’s mom] Cynthia too. She was always very, very lovely to me. Frankly, even when Julian and my mom were fighting, they were still nice. They still loved each other. He still came into the house. He stayed in ‘71—my mom’s apartment. It is just like the BeatlesGet Backfilm: You watch it and you realize they weren’t fighting in the way that everyone imagined. There was some tension. That’s as far as you could say. I assume you have a good relationship with Paul McCartney too. Sure. He’s been very kind to me over the years, and he and [his wife]Nancyespecially have been very kind. And I’m very close with [Paul’s children]StellaandJames.James and I did a song together.MaryI love very much as well. Obviously in the ’80s, maybe, there was a bit of tension, but not with me. With me, he’s my hero, man. Can I ask you how your mom is doing these days? I know your family is private, but is there anything you can tell us? Well, I would say that she’s very healthy for a 92-year-old. It was wild to see the cast for the four Beatles movies that Sam Mendes is making. Did you get to talk to him or to Harris Dickinson, who will play your father? Are you excited or nervous or both? We are all in touch with Sam (the Beatles gang). I told him I am not interested in second-guessing his casting choices as a director. Would anyone have expectedChristian Baleto be a goodDick Cheney? I think that’s the filmmaker’s choice. My interest has more to do with the scripts, and how they intertwine. I have every confidence in Sam and Harris and the rest of the team. Okay, one last thing. I’m aware that this is weird, but I’d like to read you a few sentences I wrote about you after meeting you 30 years ago, and then have you tell me how it sounds to you. Can you stand this? Sure, go ahead. “In person, Lennonis phosphorescent with love and awe for his mother, whom he compares to Miles Davis. But he’s dismissive of his own gifts: ‘I suck, basically. Well, I’mokay.’ Lennon, who’s on leave from Columbia University, seems enormously sweet and jittery, insisting he’s introspective, neurotic, and intimidated by everything. ‘Life is frightening,’ he says. ‘You know what I mean?’” Does that sound like an accurate reflection of you at 20, and how does it sound to you now? Wow, that’s interesting. It sounds like exactly the inner voice that I have to this day. It is actually shocking how little I’ve changed. When I look back, I think of myself then as being a lot more arrogant. I didn’t realize how self-aware I was at the time. I guess I was self-aware. You definitely didn’t strike me as arrogant. Well, yeah, I wasn’t an arrogant person, but I had this kind of confidence. I remember making my first record—and makingRising—and just thinking everyone was going to love it. Now that I’m older, I’m more realistic about things. Before I let you go, tell me what you’re personally working on these days. Les Claypooland I are trying to finish up this thirdDeliriumalbum, which I’m very excited about. I feel very lucky in terms of the scope of projects I get to work on. I got to do this film,War Is Over!, which won an Oscar. It’s an animated CGI thing, which is a whole new medium for me. Then I got to do this box set for my dad that got a Grammy. And I still get to have my own bands and my own studio and make music. I feel very fortunate that I get to expose my brain to so many different things. I think I have a good chance of keeping my neurons working. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

    "title": "Netflix’s ‘Bad Influence’ Exposes the Unregulated, Allegedly Abusive Side of YouTube’s Kid Influencers",
    "article_text": "Just a year after the allegation-packedexposéQuiet on Setruined your fantasy of happy child actors on the Nickelodeon lot, a new Netflix series is ready to explain how the youngest YouTubers are miserable too. The new seriesBad Influence: The Dark Side of Kidfluencinglays bare the unregulated world of underageYouTube stars, using the controversial case of now-17-year-oldPiper Rockelleand her mother,Tiffany Smith,as a lens for the entire industry. “Our goal in this was to expose the real human cost behind this glossy façade of internet fame,” codirectorKief Davidsonsays. “If we don’t address these issues now, other kids are going to be taken advantage of in the future.” Born in 2007, Rockelle (who was born Piper Rockelle Smith) shot to fame at age nine via videos produced and posted to YouTube by her mom. By 2017, her online content had transitioned from the standard “little-kid day in the life” stuff to more clearly staged and scripted videos involving a group of youngsters referred to as the Squad, who acted out scenarios tweaked for maximum clicks. Though slickly packaged, the videos are corny and a little clunky, giving them a DIY and vaguely authentic feel—like the home movies many of us made with friends during the long days of summer. But unlike our home movies, Rockelle and the Squad’s short films were big business. At its peak, Rockelle’s videos of her and her friends’ filmed pranks, challenges, and scripted and staged romantic content (known as “crush,” “kiss,” or “boyfriend” videos) brought in an estimated half a million dollars per month,Bad Influenceclaims. But to get there, a mother of a Squad member claims, the production was run like a cult.Angela Sharbino,the mother of former Squad memberSawyer Sharbino,alleges inBad Influencethat Smith demanded complete loyalty from their child charges, penalized them for dissent, and ostracized those who pushed back or left the group. Sawyer was one of nearly a dozen plaintiffs ina 2022 lawsuitbrought by former Squad members against Smith and her boyfriendHunter Hillthat claimed Smith had created “an emotionally, physically and sometimes sexually abusive environment,” much of which is detailed in the series. Davidson agrees with Angela’s assessment. “The minute we started talking with the families and they started telling us their stories, what was really happening behind the scenes was a cult,” he says. “There’s always that question: How could you not recognize this?” It’s the same question raised byQuiet on Set,and byDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke—another docuseries involving powerful adults who allegedly exploited children for the sake of entertainment. In both of them, we also see parents who claim they didn’t realize what was allegedly happening to their children. “I think everyone’s a little different, and there’s different reasoning. But I think at the core they wanted their kids to be happy, and couldn’t see what was going on right in front of their faces,” Davidson says ofBad Influence’s adults. According to a parent of a Squad member who appears inBad Influence,kids wereworkinguntil 2 a.m. without breaks for meals. Other problematic situations appeared to happen outside of Squad parents’ view. According toBad Influence,parents didn’t know what was going on while their kids were filming social media content. Much of that content involved romantic scenarios or physical contact, with the lawsuit alleging that Squad members were instructed to touch and kiss other members for ongoing “crush” content. Bad InfluencecodirectorJenna Roshersays that Squad parents initially trusted Smith and let her run the show—and that the children didn’t always speak up when things started to feel wrong. “The kids didn’t want to leave their friends. I think they later would say to themselves, ‘Yeah, that was kind of weird, but at the time, I didn’t want to leave the group because it was fun and it was the only group of friends I had,’” Rosher says. “They just couldn’t put words to the things that they were witnessing.” Some of those claims formed the basis of their lawsuit, which wassettled in Octoberfor $1.85 million. The settlement did not include an admission of guilt, and Smith and Hill deny the allegations made against them. Via a written statement sent toVanity Fairby attorneyKen Ingber,Smith says, “Obviously, we didn’t do anything that was alleged. As I’ve said before, money is a powerful motivator for certain personalities—and now that includes Netflix.” While content starring kids like the Squad is a relatively recent invention, Rosher says the problem at its center is as old as the entertainment industry itself. Rosher is a descendant of child actor Joan Marsh, who rose to fame in the silent film era. Protections for actors were rare back then, and kids on set were essentially treated as small adults. TheCoogan Law, as well as other child-specific on-set labor regulations, has made lives for minors on Hollywood sets safer than they were (though, as suggested byQuiet on Set,the system remains imperfect). “I can only imagine what [Marsh] was exposed to back in the day. Sadly, [it was probably] similar to this industry now,” Rosher says of young online content creators. Neither Rosher nor Davidson have much hope that platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram will step in to regulate how content-creating kids are treated. “We reached out to YouTube…all of them. And not unexpectedly, there was no response, no comment. So I think they know what the problem is, and they either don’t know how to fix it, or they don’t want to fix it,” Davidson says. (Vanity Fairhas reached out to YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram for comment.) So as opposed to trying to solve the entire problem, the filmmakers focused on one person they hope they can still reach: Piper Rockelle. Over the course ofBad Influence’s three episodes, the tone goes from tween drama to cult narrative to deeply troubling claims of child sexualization, but its approach toward Rockelle remains the same. “It’s really important for the audience to know that Piper is the victim here,” Davidson says. “The issues we expose—child exploitation, the lack of these protections, the dangers that these influencers have—are happening in real time, and Piper’s an extreme example of this.” Rockelle, however, appears to disagree. In a written statement toVanity Fairthat was also sent by Ingber, she says this: “The Netflix thing makes me angry…because they know the claims were all fake. My mom didn’t do anything they said. I’ll stand behind her forever. Because if it wasn’t for my mom and my family, I’m not sure how I’d get through this.” Aimee Lou Woodon the TragicWhite LotusFinale AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood Karen Read Returns to Trial: Here’sEverything You Need to Know DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Trump Says He'd \"Love\" to Deport US Citizens to El Salvador Gulags if It's Legal",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration has alreadyadmittedin court that it deported a Maryland father to El Salvador in “error” and is currently fighting acourt orderto bring him back. Now, PresidentDonald Trumpisopenly flirtingwith the prospect of deporting American citizens to the same explicitlycruel and dehumanizingmega-prison, too. White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittconfirmed Tuesday that the president has “simply floated” the idea of deporting US citizens and could pursue that strategy “if there is a legal pathway to do that.” Her remarks came in response to Trump's own suggestion that he would “love” to deport citizens to El Salvador. \"If they can house these horrible criminals for a lot less money than it costs us, I'm all for it,\" hetoldreporters this week. Such a punishment, Leavitt clarified during a White House briefing, would apply only to “heinous, violent criminals who have broken our nation’s laws repeatedly.” Hm, where have we heard that one before? Over the last month, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to cast the 238 men it deported to El Salvador as terrorists and gang members affiliated with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Agua. But it’s presented little to no public evidence to back most of those accusations up. Meanwhile, a recent investigation by60 Minutesfoundthat 75% of the men appear to have no criminal records. Instead, the investigation found the Trump administration has presented evidence in court as flimsy as an old Facebook photo showing one man flashing a “rock on” hand symbol to justify his deportation. Now, the same administration would have us believe it would take great care before sending American citizens to an El Salvadoran gulag, too. Then there’s the whole “if it’s legal” thing. In the absolute most generous interpretation of recent events, this is an administration that is at least totally unafraid to test the limits of the law (More than a few courts havechargedthe White House withfloutingthe law entirely). To deport the Venezuelan men, for example, it relied on a 1798 statute known as the Alien Enemies Act that has only been invoked three times in history and never outside the context of a declared war. But even if the president does have the power to invoke a wartime law in peacetime—a question that has very muchnotbeen resolved in court, despite MAGA world's claims—the Supreme CourtruledTuesday that people being targeted for deportation are still “entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.” Yet the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last month had no such notice, and they received no such opportunity. And now that the White House says it can’t correct its own errors, those men may never get one. So, did the Trump administration, in that case, follow a “legal pathway”? Or did it do what it could get away with before anyone could act to enforce the law as written? In her opinion Tuesday in the case surrounding the Venezuelan deportations, liberal JusticeSonia Sotomayorwarned that the Trump administration was laying the groundwork for a far more expansive approach to deporting citizens and non-citizens alike. “The implication of the Government’s position is that not only noncitizens but also United States citizens could be taken off the streets, forced onto planes, and confined to foreign prisons with no opportunity for redress if judicial review is denied unlawfully before removal,” shewrote. Already reports of US citizens being detained by immigration are mounting. An attorneyrepresentinga University of Michigan student protester was recently questioned for 90 minutes at Detroit Metro Airport, where he was asked to give up his cell phone and contact list. A Chicago native wasdetainedby Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 10 hours in January, during which he had his phone and wallet confiscated. And, a 10-year-old US citizen with brain cancer was sent to detention with her undocumented parents, who were rushing her to the hospital when they were stopped by immigration officials. “The administration talks a lot about targeting criminals, but they’re just not,”Danny Woodward, a policy attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, which is representing the family, toldThe Washington Post. “This is what happens when you scale up immigration enforcement with no guardrails.” According to thePost, Woodward filed acomplaintwith the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties regarding the 10-year-old's case. The following week, thatofficewas shut down.

    "title": "Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy Onassis Were United by a Special Cartier Heirloom",
    "article_text": "Jackie Kennedy Onassiswas well-versed in story making and telling. A voracious reader of literature and history, she helped husband president John F. Kennedy withthe literary referencesin his speeches, artfully aligning his brief but vibrant tenure as commander in chief to King Arthur and his legendary Camelot, an idyll where nobility and chivalry reigned supreme. She became a book editor later in her life, perhaps a perfunctory position to those who knew Jackie, as she was always a formidable wielder of words. Her stellar life spawned countless stories during and after her time, some she allowed open for reading, others she did not. Jackie’s Cartier Petit Tank Normale fell under both categories: the story she allowed while she was alive and the story that evolved after her death. Now, visitors to the V&A South Kensington in London can see it for themselves as part ofthe museum’s new “Cartier” exhibition, which opens on Saturday, April 12. Jackie Kennedy Onassis pictured in 1975. “Canyoudo 50 miles?” was the question posed to Americans in 1963 by the president and onthe cover ofLifemagazine. President Kennedy’s bid to get America fit began with the Marine Corps, White House staff, and his family. His attorney general and brother, Robert Kennedy, had already finished the feat in less than 18 hours, and now his brother-in-law Prince Stanislaw “Stas” Radziwill, his friend Chuck Spalding, Secret Service agentClint Hill,andLifephotographer Mark Shaw began the trek in Palm Beach, Florida. According to Hill’s 2012 memoir,Mrs. Kennedy and Me,JFK, Jackie, and her sister Lee Radziwill joined the party intermittently, cheering and bringing the hikers refreshments like steak, freshly squeezed orange juice, and Champagne. The day was immortalized in Shaw’s photographs, Clint’s memoir, a small painting Jackie made of Stas and Chuck walking, captioned, “Jackie to Stas With Love and Admiration,” and an inscription on the back of Jackie’s Tank. “Stas to Jackie / 23 Feb. ’63 / 2:05 a.m. to 9:35 p.m.,” it read in Stas’s handwriting. A signed Cartier Tank model manufactured in 1962 belonging to Jackie Kennedy Onassis and an original painting by Jackie Kennedy Onassis are displayed at Christie's in New York on June 20, 2017. As a first ladywho was aware that her clothescould be political, Jackie might have needed a plausible justification for her new gift from Stas. She had, after all, become affiliated with the elite “Tank rank” of Andy Warhol, Muhammad Ali, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, all of whom sported the coveted timepiece. Its specs are vital: the 18k gold case measuring 18 by 28 mm, the Roman numeral dial, the sword-shaped hands, thechemin de fer(which translates to “railroad” and refers to the distinctive minute track), the blue sapphire cabochon crown, the 18k boucle déployante, the LeCoultre movements, and finally, the identifiable D closure. Jackie Kennedy Onassis's Cartier Tank watch. For Jackie, 1963 was a year marked by both joy and unimaginable sorrow. Nine months afterLifemagazine covered the jubilant “big walk,” a tragic scene later played out (and was filmed) in November for the world to witness: She would become a widowwhen JFK was assassinated. Afterward, dutifully fulfilling her makeshift role as the widow of America, she participated in memorials in her husband’s honor in cities including London and Boston. It was only in 1966, in Sun Valley, Idaho, that we see Jackie pictured with her daughterCaroline,smiling with a renewed ease, flecks of snow gently streaking the monochrome print of the photograph. She is wearing a perfectly fitted bouclé cardigan with ski goggles mounted atop her head, her hands (glove-free) tucked in the demi pockets of the textured pilled cuff of her cardigan, thinly disguising the sleek black lizard strap on her wrist, but then a sighting—the face of the Tank watch, its gold glint unmistakable. Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Caroline vacation in Sun Valley, Idaho on January 4, 1966. This image seems to mark a new chapter in Jackie’s life: We see her watch as she is riding in the car, walking on the beach, sailing with Aristotle Onassis, eating a peach in Capri, or alighting on her private plane.Eric Windof Wind Vintage recalls specific details of her watch, noting that “it was clear that it had been worn a lot and moisture had gotten in. That was kind of why the paint almost looked like it was blurring a bit,” perhaps marking a well-lived life. She wore the watch as the designer Louis Cartier intended: as a utilitarian, bejeweled, luxury timepiece. Spotting a military tank like the Renault FT-17 was commonplace during World War I, andbrancards(French for “stretchers”) inspired part of the watch’s 18k frame. In a bid to encourage men to ditch their pocket watches and follow the ladies’ suit of wearing wristwatches, he gave the watch the moniker “Le Tank” (a deliberate play on the French female form of the word “watch,”la montre). The narrative worked—the distinctly linear shape is masculine in form but perfectly balanced by the feminine sapphire crown and softened watch face. After Jackie died in 1994, the inevitable Sotheby’ssaleof her belongings did not include her watch. So whenChristie’s announced the sale of the watch some 20 years later, in 2017, the watch world and those interested in its tale were agog. The story of Jackie’s Tank was perfectly canonized with a detailed provenance (the seller,Carole Radizwill,spoke of the sale withher own version of the storyfor The Moth) and it was now ready for the public eye. An undisclosed bidder won the watch for $379,500. She was later revealed by TMZ:Kim Kardashianwas the new owner. As Radziwill says in her Moth story, she believes Kardashian never picked up the watch from the Christie’s vault, despite Kardashian tellingVoguein 2019 thatshe wore Jackie’s watchto give her some confidence while visiting then presidentDonald Trumpin the White House. (Christie’s declined to comment.) Kardashian also linked herself to the first lady in a photo shoot forInterviewmagazine, in which she dressed as Jackie for the magazine’s cover. At the time,she took to Instagram to thank photographerSteven Kleinfor “pushing me to do a shoot that was very different & powerful & allowed me to pay homage to the iconic Jackie Kennedy who I admire & respect.” Was buying the watch Kardashian’s attempt to redraft some of Jackie’s story into her own life? (A representative for Kardashian declined to comment.) Kim Kardashian leaves the West Wing of the White House, May 30, 2018 Some wondered why John Jr. or Caroline Kennedy hadn’t kept their mother’s watch. According to sources, they actually had. As a close family friend of John Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy confirmed to me for my bookCBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion,the interviewee’s tone dropping to an audible whisper, Carolyn also owned one of Jackie’s Tanks—that’s right,oneof them. Carolyn Bessette Kennedy walking her dog in New York City, 1996. The media was as fascinated by Carolyn Bessette Kennedy’s story as they were Jackie’s. Despite being the new Mrs. Kennedy and inheriting some of Jackie’s jewelry, Carolyn was never tempted to follow someone else’s script. As her friendPaul Rowlandput it, “No one owned Carolyn. She was clever with how she navigated through things.” Both women were vigilant gatekeepers of their life, style, and privacy, assets that many famous people today seem happy to part with in a bid to enhance their image. Carolyn was equally reticent with jewelry. Her friendBetsy Siegelsays, “She once told me the less she wore the less [the press] had to talk about.” Despite her overall affinity for minimalism, she did wear a Cartier Tank. There are several pictures of Carolyn wearing what family friends say is Jackie’s Tank with the same chic aplomb as her mother-in-law, but during fairly mundane activities like walking her dog. Siegel clearly recalls Carolyn taking off her Tank and telling her that it was Jackie’s, and at least two of Carolyn’s close family friends were nonplussed that Jackie owned multiple Tanks. Jackie’s sister, Lee, received one for her 16th birthday, so Jackie’s friends figured that if Lee had one, Jackie likely had one around that time as well. Knowing the power of her sartorial choices as many public figures do, Jackie would no doubt have raised an eyebrow or two had it been apparent that she owned more than one Tank. Inthe famous 1971 pictures of Jackie on Madison Avenue taken by Ron Galella, she is dressed in a tight rib-knit top and worn jeans, her rotund sunglasses on, her hair windswept; but in one frame, she is wearing the Tank, and in another, she appears to have taken it off—a possible scandal averted. Jackie Kennedy Onassis in New York City on October 7, 1971. Wind explained that historically, Cartier is not believed to have kept a totally comprehensive record of all the watches, including the Tank and its variations, across the world—it would be virtually impossible with the three Cartier brothers holding court in their respective kingdoms of New York, Paris, and London, and with watches being made in London, Paris, and Switzerland for their various branches. The only accountable mainstay was and is the design of the watch. What I can say is that we will finally get to see the publicized Tank watch in London, at the most comprehensive exhibition of Cartier pieces to date at the V&A, completing part of the story. As for the rest? Well, that remains with Jackie, which is exactly what she would have wanted.

    "title": "Inside the Largest-Ever Auction of Princess Diana’s Iconic Wardrobe",
    "article_text": "Almost 30 years after her tragic death,Princess Diana's ephemera continues to be a hot ticket item. On June 26, Julien’s Auctions will mount“Princess Diana’s Style and a Royal Collection”at the Peninsula Beverly Hills. With over 200 pieces ranging from handbags to couture, the auction features items and clothing belonging to Princess Diana,the Duke and Duchess of Windsor,Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother, and other royal treasures dating as far back as the 19th century. “People have a love affair with the royal family. They have a love affair with Princess Diana, especially. And we thought, this is what our audience is looking for,” saysMartin Nolan,cofounder and executive director of Julien’s Auctions. “They’re looking to own a piece of royal history.” These royals’ place in history has led to an uptick in bids from cultural institutions, not just wealthy individuals. “What’s really interesting is that a lot of our buyers are museums because the royal family are instantly recognized worldwide, especially Princess Diana,” Nolan says. Julien’s Auctions shattered records in 2023 whenDiana’s Jacques Azagury 1985 ballerina-length gown sold for $1.14 million. In 2024,a pair of her shoes went for $390,000 at auction. “We curated this auction, partly because of the world-record prices we’re getting for Princess Diana items and the royal family in general,” Nolan says. While many of the pieces for sale are new items from friends and colleagues, others were originally sold by Princess Diana at her famous 1997 Christie’s auction of 79 of her most iconic gowns. Diana saw the auction as a fresh start, a way to shed her royal past after her divorce (the auction was promoted in a July 1997Vanity Faircover story, “Diana Reborn”). A society event and rousing success, the auction raised $3.26 million for the AIDS Crisis Trust and the Royal Marsden Hospital’s Cancer Fund. “Some of the items Diana sold herself, in her own auction in 1997, for the various charities that she supported,” Nolan says. “There were dresses that were selling for $30,000 or $40,000 at the time…and now they’re coming back and selling for $800,000, $900,000, $1 million.” Nolan believes one reason Diana’s items continue to rise in value is her elegant and sophisticated style. “Diana did not want to be boxed into the Diana era, or the Elizabethan era, or the Charles, or the Georgian, whatever,” Nolan says. “She wanted [to be] timeless.” To that end, Dianacollaborated with designers like Catherine Walkerto create a striking, iconic wardrobe that stands the test of time. Her clothes were also thoughtfully planned out, with different uniforms for different aspects of her job as a working royal. A highlight of the collection is a 1989 Bellville Sassoon floral day dress dubbed the “caring dress” that Diana wore to multiple engagements. Diana, Princess of Wales outside the Town Hall in Seville with bodyguard Colin Trimming in May 1992. She is wearing a dress by Bellville Sassoon. “Diana and her sense of style—she knew how to dress, and when to dress, and she could read the room and know what would be appreciated most,” Nolan says. “She wore that dress on many occasions visiting sick children in hospitals, because they loved the colors, and it made her feel approachable and huggable. It wasn’t a very ostentatious gown. It was just a very beautiful, colorful, nicely fitted dress.” Another item for auction, a sexy cocktail dress, signified Diana’s new independence in the latter part of her life. “After the marriage fell apart, you see the dimples between the neckline, showing the arms, the dresses above the knee, starting with probably therevenge dress, which is world famous,” Nolan notes. The sale also includes personal items, such asnotesandcardsthat Diana sent religiously. “Diana was a very personable person; if someone wrote to her, she would write back,” Nolan says. “She was sending nice handwritten notes to people that surrounded her, her support staff, the people who worked with her. She treated everyone just so graciously, and with humility, and kindness, and it just shows that she cared.” Though Princess Diana headlines the auction, it also includes items owned by Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother, two style icons in their own right. “When you think about the Queen Mother and Queen Elizabeth, they always dressed in the beautiful bright colors,” he says. “They had their own dress makers, and...it was always the hat, and there was always the coat and dress…and then the handbag.” Also on offer are items owned by thescandalousand rebelliousDuke and Duchess of Windsor. The numerous treasures owned by the glamorous, fashion-forward Duke and Duchess have had a storied history since their deaths. In 1987, a Sotheby’s auction of the Duchess’s iconic jewelry collection in Geneva made history, raking in $50 million, with bidders including Elizabeth Taylor andJoan Collins. “She wasn’t necessarily the best-looking lady, but I would say that she was the best dressed,” Nolan says of the Duchess of Windsor. “She dressed really well, elegantly, classily, beautifully.” Items for auction will go on a mini-world tour before the main event. Starting May 1, the collection will be on view at theMuseum of Pop Culture in Seattle, before traveling to theMuseum of Style Icons in Newbridge, Ireland, and will also be shown in London. At these events, the general public will have the opportunity to view the collection items before they are sold to those lucky enough to afford a piece of royal history.

    "title": "Jessica Reed Kraus, RFK Jr. Fanblogger, Claims to Be “Official” Press. The White House Differs.",
    "article_text": "The recent shenanigans ofJessica Reed Kraus,better known by her Instagram handle @houseinhabit and her reputation as a die-hardRobert F. Kennedy Jr.fangirl turned MAGA faithful, provide a case study of just how screwed the Fourth Estate is under the secondDonald Trumppresidency. Kraus recently took big swings inside her own corner of the World Wide MAGA Web, first lashing outat fellow conservative voicesCandace OwensandTucker Carlson,in a sort of extended social media fit that she followed up by releasing personal information about her own friends and former employees. Since then, Kraus has set her1.3 million-follower Instagram accountto private for more than a week (she has since changed the settings back to public), published a lot of her$8/month newsletterbehind a paywall, returned to public view, and announced that she was“inducted into White House press.” On the last part, though, that’s only part true. A White House official toldVanity Fairthat there are currently 1,430 active hard passes, or permanent press passes with wide-ranging come-and-go access to the White House. Kraus, despite crowing in a social media caption about her “first official week inducted into White House press” and marveling at “what a ride it’s going to be,” was actually in the building on a temporary single-day press pass. As she ponders to followers whether she should shell out for an apartment in DC for her Very Important New Role, the White House clarifies that the pass she’s clutching is for those who do not regularly cover the White House on a full-time basis. Contacted byVanity Fair,Kraus did not answer whether she was in the building on temporary or permanent press credentials, nor whether her credential is tied to her Substack newsletter. She also did not answer whether she considers herself to be a journalist or member of the press. “My inclusion in the White House press circuit is part of the new media embrace Trump’s administration is ushering in,” she wrote in an email. “It is a great honor for any independent outlet or writer.” On Wednesday, on her Instagram Story, she wrote, “I show up wherever I’m invited. That’s always been my motto—how all reporters should operate.” The Trump administration has been consistently dismantling the free press, one norm at a time, ensuring hand-picked voices lobbing softballs are handed a megaphone, all the while touting itself as the most transparent presidency of all time. Karoline Leavitt,theyoungest press secretary in White Househistory, is making good on her promise to push whatshe called “left-wing stenographers”out of the White House pressroom. You know, like the Associated Press. Those hackscan’t call the Gulf of Mexico by a made-up name, so on February 11, out went the globally respected wire service. (On Tuesday evening, aTrump-appointed US district judge ruledthat it is a First Amendment violation to bar the AP from government events, and gave the White House a week to reinstate the wire service or appeal. Shortly after the ruling, an AP reporter and photographer were blocked from joining a pool covering a Trump motorcade.) Leavitt has announced that instead of the White House Correspondents’ Associationmanaging the press pool rotationthat accompanies the president to engagements, now the White House will. Then came theseating chart in the briefing room, another duty plucked out of the nonpartisan WHCA’s hands and dropped directly into the administration’s lap. The WHCA boardpublished a memo on March 31protesting the change in seating chart authority and explaining the implications for access and coverage it signifies, writing, “For the public to get the information it needs to understand and make decisions about the most powerful office in the world, it needs news produced by experienced, professional journalists who ask tough questions and produce fair coverage.” Ergo, Kraus, who wrote in comments on her (then private) Instagram post that she was too “scared” to go to a press briefing with that shiny new press pass, and in another blew off a negative commenter by saying she “worked hard for [Trump’s] campaign,” despite touting herself as independent media. She’s said that she didn’t vote in the 2024 presidential election, but her reasons vary: She was too busy, she was traveling, she wanted to “remain untethered” to political parties, despite those “We did it” posts and repeatedly referring to herself as working for both Kennedy and Trump’s campaigns. In fact, FEC documents show thatKraus has accepted paymentfrom one of Kennedy’s PACs, American Values 2024. In August 2024, the group’s receipts list a payment to House Inhabit, categorized under subscriptions. The amount—$1,140—is eyebrow-raising. Additionally, Kraus waspreviously listedas the “Director of Social Media” on the website of another pro-Kennedy PACFighting 4 One America—with her personal Gmail address included. Kraus has repeatedly claimed on her social accounts that she didn’t receive “one dollar” from any of the campaigns. There are guardrails meant to separate the press from the politicians they cover. ForHouse and Senate press-pass applications, for example, there are stringent guidelines about full-time employment by a news organization and rules around additional employment, especially as a consultant for a political group. TheState Departmenthas similar restrictions. “I have never received funding from any political PACs or campaigns,” Kraus toldVFin an email. If you needed another record of Kraus’s coziness with Kennedy and his campaign, look no further than the2024 First Amendment lawsuitin which Kraus and Kennedy were codefendants, attempting to sue Meta for censorship. Kraus (left, physically if not politically) exits the White House with her very own Epstein binder, wearing a hat reading “Trump Was Right About Everything.” Here’s a journalist who’s clearly ready to really hold the administration’s feet to the fire. She’s not even pretending to do the job well. Another (originally private) missive via Instagram Story detailed her claiming that she had been given the wrong address forOliver Stone’s testimony and being “forced” to remove her heels and dash across blocks around the Capitol to get to the right location. On her (again, then private) Instagram, she shared herthoughts on Stone’s sunglasses: “Iconic.”Groundbreaking. Onher Substack, she transcribed several quotes from the testimony, adding such journalistic flair as “Stone blinked.” What was that Leavitt was saying about stenographers? She recently misspelled the wordenemyin a text slide of her Stories, declaring that “Secrecy is the Enemey [sic] of Democracy” in très dramatique white-on-black. It’s giving, “One time, she asked me how to spell orange.” She posted a photo of herself at a briefing in her Stories, having apparently finally mustered up the courage to attend. A little white label with “NYT” typed in all-caps black is stuck to the spot, right next to the Easter egg-hued Instax camera she toted along with her to the briefing, which she didn’t write about. There she is, ensuring that the American people stay informed. The power of media, everyone! In hervery first press briefing back in January, Leavitt declared that “this White House believes strongly in the First Amendment,” then announced that credential applications for new media outlets would be opened up. TheURL she shared, whitehouse.gov/newmedia, redirectsto a simple, one-page web form. The fields for first and last name, email, phone number, and zip code are all required, but so is a link to the applicant’s primary social account. The single optional field on the form? “News Outlet (If Applicable).” Aimee Lou Woodon the TragicWhite LotusFinale AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood Karen Read Returns to Trial: Here’sEverything You Need to Know DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "article_text": "All 12 are fluent in Cantonese and English, with three already working in the city as authorities push to fill 80 vacancies Hong Kong health authorities have issued offers to 12 non-locally trained dentists, including three who started working in the city last month, with all of them fluent in Cantonese and English, amid the city’s efforts to ease a labour shortage. The Department of Health on Wednesday said the rest of the group was expected to have their limited registration approved by the Dental Council in the coming two months, adding that the candidates had met the requirements to be hired locally as dentists, such as being able to speak both languages fluently. Dr Kitty Hse Mei-yin, consultant in-charge for the department’s dental services, said authorities had embarked on a two-month global recruitment push last July. “At the end of September, we received a very enthusiastic response, with more than 90 applications,” she said. “Through a rigorous selection process, we chose 12 dentists who are non-locally trained. We have issued them offers to join the Department of Health.” The recruitment drive followed the Legislative Council’s approval of amendments to the Dentist Registration Ordinance, allowing non-locally trained dentists to work in the city without having to pass the city’s licensing exams.",
