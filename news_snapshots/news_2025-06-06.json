    "title": "Republican lawmakers stand firm against Musk's 'Kill the Bill' assault on Trump's agenda",
    "article_text": "Speaker Johnson said he tried to call musk to foam the political flames. The Big, Beautiful Bill became the big, throbbing migraine forCongressional Republicansthis week. That’s thanks to the big, ugly brawl betweenPresident Donald Trumpand Elon Musk. It started Tuesday with a hangup between Congressional Republicans andMuskover the Big, Beautiful Bill. Musk characterized it as a \"disgusting abomination.\" He then turned on all 215 House Republicans who voted yes on the bill last month. \"You know you did wrong,\" declared Musk. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., tried to call Musk to foam the political flames. MUSK SAYS TRUMP WOULD HAVE LOST 2024 ELECTION WITHOUT HIM AS 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' FEUD CONTINUES L-R: Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., and Elon Musk.(AP) \"I called Elon last night. He didn't answer. \"But I hope to talk to him today,\" said Johnson. Surely the world’s richest man would have the bandwidth for the Speaker of the House. But the hangup was only starting. Rather than returning the Speaker’s call, Musk returned political fire. Not by phone. But on his own communication platform. ELON MUSK WARPATH AGAINST TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' RATTLES HOUSE GOP On X, Musk posted an iconic picture of Uma Thurman in a yellow jumpsuit, wielding a sword from a Quentin Tarantino movie poster. \"KILL the Bill,\" read Musk’s caption. Reach out and touch someone? How about reach out and call your senator or representative? Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump meets South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.(AP/Evan Vucci) Musk’s influence – and rapid pivot – frightened Congressional Republicans. \"To say that it's a problem or that it has created a bigger challenge for us, is true,\" said House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington,\" R-Tex. \"He's got a big voice. He's got a big audience. And more importantly, it's a credible voice. But he's wrong on this issue.\" Still, Republicans weren’t budging as Musk demanded lawmakers craft a new piece of legislation. \"Elon, look,\" said an exasperated Johnson. \"We don't have time for a brand new bill.\" ELON MUSK POSTS ‘KILL BILL’ MEME IN LATEST PUSH TO NIX TRUMP’S BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL The Speaker added that Congressional Republicans \"can't go back to the drawing board and we shouldn't.\" The political contretemps started simmering as Republicans quickly became incensed with Musk. \"Give us some productive feedback that we can operate on. I can't operate on platitudes,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., of Musk’s vague criticism about the size of the legislation and deficit spending. Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, is one of the two House Republicans who voted no on the Big, Beautiful Bill last month.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., was the other House GOPer who voted nay. He says Musk learned how Congress operates the hard way. DAVID MARCUS: MUSK VS. MAGA ON BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL, BUT GOP NEEDS BOTH \"Trust was misplaced. And so I think he has a right to be upset with our leadership,\" said Massie. But Democrats suddenly made strange bedfellows with Musk. They viewed Musk’s opposition as an opportunity to help them sidetrack the legislation. \"He's not my cup of tea, to put it mildly. But Republicans are already listening to him,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of Musk. But at least one Democrat called out his colleagues for their inconsistency with Musk. \"We've been dumping all over Musk and vandalizing Teslas,\" said Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn. \"And now suddenly, now we might be more back into him.\" This all came as the Trump Administration asked Congress to chip away at spending. Budget Director Russ Vought sent lawmakers a $9.4 billion \"rescissions\" request. This measure asks that lawmakers claw back money it already allocated. President Donald Trump's nominee for Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought is sworn in during the Senate Banking Committee nomination hearing in the Dirksen Senate Building on January 22, 2025 in Washington, DC(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) \"$9.4 billion is a teardrop in the ocean,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. \"If we can't get this now, then God help us on getting the true deficit numbers down.\" The rescissions plan targeted foreign aid and public broadcasting. \"You've sent us a rescission package worth $9 billion that goes after Big Bird and Cookie Monster,\" lamented Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., at a hearing with Vought. WHITE HOUSE STANDS BY TAX BILL AFTER MUSK CALLS IT A 'DISGUSTING ABOMINATION' The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Big, Beautiful Bill found that it adds $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. But Republicans say those figures are wrong. The CBO also issued an analysis – specific to President Trump’s tariffs. The CBO projects a $3 trillion decrease in deficits over the next decade because of the tariffs. The CBO cannot evaluate the tariffs under the One Big, Beautiful Bill – because, well, they’re not part of the legislation. But, proponents of the One Big Beautiful Bill say that measure, coupled with the tariffs, decreases deficits by $500 billion over the next decade. Some Republicans believe that the CBO estimate about the deficit is what set off Musk. \"I think their assumptions are wrong. We have long complained about it,\" said Johnson. But remember, this is the CONGRESSIONAL Budget Office. And REPUBLICANS run Congress. \"Why are you not getting the numbers that you want?\" asked yours truly of the Speaker. \"They use a different scoring,\" replied Johnson. \"Would you consider a rescission for the CBO in the legislative branch appropriations bill?\" I followed up. \"I would,\" answered Johnson. But the CBO is the least of Johnson’s worries as the battle between the president and Musk went supernova on Thursday. \"What is the message you need to hear from him to make sure you are on the same page?\" I asked Johnson of Musk – who still hadn’t connected. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans celebrated passing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday.(Getty Images) \"I just want to answer any questions Elon has and make sure he fully understands this is not a spending program,\" said Johnson. \"Do you think he just misperceives this?\" I inquired. \"I do,\" said Johnson. Senate Republicans who are noes on the bill applauded Musk’s staunch opposition to the One Big, Beautiful Bill. \"We both seem to be on the same wavelength and that we're very, very skeptical,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. On Thursday afternoon, Musk argued that President Trump would have lost the White House and Democrats would control the House and Senate were it not for the $280 million he poured into the 2024 campaign. \"He obviously played a positive role,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., another no on the bill. \"He helped spend that much money. He attracted a lot of people.\" But Democrats weren’t so sure of Musk’s political rainmaking. \"It’s just crocodile tears that are being shed by Elon Musk,\" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. Democrats saw the breakup coming between the president and Musk. \"It's a divorce that was predictable, if not inevitable,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. Some Senate Republicans claimed they weren’t worried about Musk torching the bill – and even President Trump – on X. They believed the president wielded an inherent advantage over Musk in the ultimate \"Twitter\" cage match. \"President Trump has the biggest platform on Earth,\" said Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio. It’s too early to tell if Musk’s incineration of the One Big, Beautiful Bill will hamper efforts to pass the legislation – especially with tight vote margins in the House and Senate. \"It's not helpful,\" conceded Mike Johnson. \"But I don't think it's changed the trajectory in any way.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said Republicans stand at an unenviable crossroads. \"They have a choice of going against Trump or Musk,\" said Burchett.

    "title": "Woman dies of brain-eating amoeba after using tap water in nasal rinse device",
    "article_text": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier discusses a new study suggesting a rise in microplastics found in brains and offers tips for preserving brain health. A woman in Texas has died after contracting a fatalbrain amoebafrom contaminated water. The patient, 71, had used a nasal irrigation device filled with unboiled tap water from an RV’s water faucet, according to an alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The \"previously healthy\" woman was staying at a local campground at the time, the agency stated. DANGEROUS FUNGUS COULD SPREAD TO PARTS OF US, RESEARCHERS CLAIM Within four days of using the nasal rinse, the woman developed \"severe neurologic symptoms,\" including fever, headache and alteredmental status. The patient was treated for a potential infection of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare, deadlybrain infectioncaused by Naegleria fowleri, also known as the brain-eating amoeba. The woman was treated for a potential infection of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a rare, deadly brain infection caused by Naegleria fowleri, also known as the brain-eating amoeba.(iStock) Despite treatment, the woman began having seizures and died eight days after symptoms began. Testing of the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid confirmed she had contracted N. fowleri, according to the CDC. \"This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use ofnasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards,\" the health agency stated. \"Fewer than 10 people in the U.S. every year get infected — but unfortunately, most cases are fatal.\" Naegleria fowleri can also be a risk when swimming in fresh water. It is more prevalent duringhotter months, as the amoeba grows best in high air and water temperatures. Fox News Digital previously spoke with Tammy Lundstrom, chief medical officer and infectious disease specialist for Trinity Health in Michigan, about the risks of infection. The patient had used a nasal irrigation device (not pictured) filled with unboiled tap water from an RV’s water faucet.(iStock) \"The risk of brain-eating amoeba is very low,\" she said. \"Fewer than 10 people in the U.S. every year get infected — but unfortunately, most cases are fatal. There are only a handful of survivors of known cases.\" The death rate for Naegleria fowleri exceeds 97%, per the CDC. The initial symptoms of PAM usually begin about five days after exposure, but they can be noticed sooner. Early signs usuallyinclude headache, nausea, fever and/or vomiting, the CDC’s website states. As the infection progresses, people may experience confusion, stiff neck, disorientation, hallucinations, seizures and coma. DANGEROUS FUNGUS SPREADING IN US HOSPITALS HAS ‘RAPIDLY INCREASED' \"People usually start to feel ill one to 12 days after water exposure,\" Lundstrom said. \"Early symptoms should prompt a medical evaluation, as they are also signs ofbacterial meningitis.\" Death can occur anywhere between one and 18 days of infection, at an average of five days. To prevent contracting the fatal infection, the CDC recommends using \"distilled, sterile or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation,\" as \"improperly maintained\" municipal water and RV water systems carry the risk of disease. It is also best to avoid immersing your head in the water when swimming in summer, Lundstrom told Fox News Digital. Testing of the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid confirmed she had contracted N. fowleri, according to the CDC.(iStock) \"Infection occurs when water harboring the amoeba goes up a person’s nose, usually during swimming,\" she said. \"It is not known why some people get infected and others, even swimming companions, do not.\" Drinking contaminated water does not present a risk, and the infection does not spread from one person to another, Lundstrom added. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Because the amoeba is found in soil, the CDC also recommends avoiding stirring up the sediment at the bottom of lakes, ponds and rivers. When a patient has been diagnosed with a brain-eating amoeba, treatment usually includes a variety ofantifungal medications, as well as antibiotics like rifampin and azithromycin, according to Lundstrom. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Miltefosine, a newer antifungal drug, has been shown to kill Nagleria fowleri in laboratory tests and was used to treat some surviving patients, the CDC states on its website. \"However, the effect of all of these drugs on actual infected people is unknown due to the high fatality rate,\" Lundstrom noted. Naegleria fowleri can also be a risk when swimming in fresh water. It is more prevalent during hotter months, as the amoeba grows best in high air and water temperatures.(iStock) Those who experience sudden headache, fever, stiff neck or vomiting — especially if they have recently been swimming in warm freshwater — should seek immediatemedical attention, the CDC recommends. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Despite the infection’s high fatality rate, Lundstrom emphasized the rarity of cases. \"Millions of people enjoy swimming every summer, but only a few become infected,\" she said.

    "article_text": "NBA champion Eddie House joins Jason McIntyre to discuss the Indiana Pacers’ chances of upsetting the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals. TheIndiana Pacersare starting to look like a team of destiny, if they didn't look like one already. Trailing by 15 in the fourth quarter, the Pacers erased that deficit and pulled off a huge upset in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night against theOklahoma City Thunder. The 15-point lead early in the fourth quarter was OKC's largest of the game. But after the Pacers called a timeout, they went on a 15-4 run of their own to get back to within four. The Thunder wound up pulling away a bit to lead by nine, but they responded with another run, this one 10-2, to suddenly trail by one with 48.1 seconds left.

It was Indiana’s first lead of the entire game, as most of the game had been all Thunder. Indiana came in as double-digit underdogs, and that looked to cover for the majority of the contest. Instead, it's a 111-110 win for the Pacers, their first in the NBA Finals since 2000. In the final 9:27, the Pacers outscored the Thunder, 32-16, and it was a 12-2 run in the final 2:38.

JOHN'S RICK PITINO NOT INTERESTED IN KNICKS HC JOB It's yet another insane comeback for the Pacersthis postseason– in nearly 1,500 playoff games since 1997, only four times has a team come back to win after trailing by seven-plus points in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime – the Pacers have won three of those games this season alone. This one did not fit that criteria, but nonetheless, it's chalked up as an incredible comeback. \"It ain't over til it's over,\" Haliburton, doing his best Yogi Berra impression, said after the game. \"It ain't over until the clock hits zero.\" Amazingly enough, no Pacer had 20 points in the game, while MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a game-high 38 for the Thunder. But, six Pacers scored in double-digits, and five had at least 14.

    "article_text": "Recent Columbia graduate Jonas Du on President Donald Trump's push to suspend foreign enrollment at Harvard and antisemitic rhetoric from college students. A federal judge late Thursday blocked theTrump administration'sdecision to ban foreign students from attending Harvard University. The decision from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs came hours after the Ivy League filed an amended complaint in court, arguing that the administration's move was unconstitutional.Over 7,000 students at Harvardhold F-1 or J-1 visas. Without those certifications, they can’t study, teach, or conduct research in the U.S. The ban also affects their families and dependents. According to the university's lawsuit, the proclamation \"lacks any lawful basis\" and does not apply to any broad group of immigrants. \"Nonimmigrants may enter the country unabated, as long as they do not attend Harvard,\"the complaintstates.TRUMP IS DOWN BUT NOT OUT IN COURT BATTLE OVER HARVARD'S FOREIGN STUDENT VISAS Harvard sues the Trump administration over a visa ban it calls a political vendetta targeting foreign students and punishing the university’s refusal to comply.(RICK FRIEDMAN/AFP via Getty Images) Harvard argues the measure does not target a \"class of aliens,\" but instead singles out Harvard-bound students, calling it a \"government vendetta\" rather than a national security measure.In April, a federal task force led by the Trump administration sent the university a list of demands, including ideological screening of students and faculty, \"viewpoint diversity\" quotas in hiring and admissions, and punishment of student activist groups. The administration also demanded Harvard report foreign funding sources and allow government oversight of internal policies. When Harvard refused, thegovernment froze $2.2 billionin research funding. Trump later posted on Truth Social that Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status if it continued to \"push radical ideology.\" In another post, he accused the school of hiring \"woke, Radical Left, idiots\" and claimed it was no longer a great university.

The government claims Harvard failed to provide complete information on its international student population, but the university says it has submitted all records required by law and that the revocation is a pretext. \"There is no lawful justification for the government’s unprecedented actions,\" the university said in Thursday's filing. The amended complaint also reveals that Harvard is being represented by Robert Hur, the former special counsel who interviewedformer President Joe Biden. Harvard says the Trump administration is targeting the university specifically.(Getty Images) DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to the lawsuit by saying it \"seeks to kneecap the President’s constitutionally vested powers under Article II.

    "article_text": "The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, has opened \"Dead Sea Scrolls: The Exhibition,\" featuring a collection of ancient Jewish manuscripts along with 200 other artifacts. The Dead Sea Scrolls may be even older than researchers thought, according to a new study driven by anartificial intelligence (AI)model. A group of researchers from the Netherlands, Italy and Denmark recently published their findings in the journal PLOS One on June 4. The researchers said they developed an AI-based date-prediction model named Enoch, a nod tothe biblical patriarchof the same name. ANCIENT CHRISTIAN FIGURINES DISCOVERED IN 1,500-YEAR-OLD DESERT GRAVES Enoch \"was trained as a machine learning-based date-prediction model applying Bayesian ridge regression on established handwriting-style descriptors,\" according to the study. In order to date the scrolls, the model analyzed each one's handwriting style. Researchers also integrated radiocarbon dating methods — and found that most of the scrolls were at least a generation older than previously thought. Researchers believe that the Dead Sea Scrolls may be even older than was previously thought.(Getty Images) Previous estimates placed the scrolls between 150 and 50 B.C., but the model found that many of the scrolls date to around 200 B.C. \"There are no compelling paleographic or historical reasons that preclude these older dates as reliable time markers.\" \"Enoch’s style-based predictions are often older than traditionally assumed paleographic estimates, leading to a new chronology of the scrolls and the re-dating of ancient Jewish key texts that contribute to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins,\" the paper states.

So, we're going to sit him out this week. Obviously, he'll sit out for minicamp. We'll see when he comes back.

    "article_text": "Former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb told Fox News Digital he believes his team firing coach Andy Reid after the 2012 season was a bigger mistake than the New York Giants losing running back Saquon Barkley in 2024. Saquon Barkley is the firstPhiladelphia Eagleto appear on the cover of the Madden NFL video game since former quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2005. Unlike McNabb, Barkley is not a homegrown Eagle drafted and brought up by the organization. To some, Barkley is a defector, as a former member of the rivalNew York Giants. The decision by the Giants to let Barkley leave the organization has been criticized as one of the worst mistakes in recent history after the running back led the Eagles to the Super Bowl and broke the franchise rushing record. \"They made a real big mistake, and I think it's going to cost them a little bit,\" McNabb told Fox News Digital of the Giants. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley (26) runs with the ball against the Carolina Panthers during the first quarter at Lincoln Financial Field.(Bill Streicher/Imagn Images) To McNabb, the Giants' decision to let Barkley go may not be as bad a decision made by the Eagles over a decade earlier. McNabb, who played his entire Eagles career under former Philadelphia head coach and current Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid, believes his former team made a mistake by firing Reid after the 2012 season. The Eagles traded McNabb to the rivalWashington Redskins(now the Commanders) three years before that. \"There's a couple mistakes they made. I was first and Andy followed,\" McNabb said. \"Now you sit back, and you start to watch, and you see how [Reid's] career has gone to a different level.\" Reid has won three Super Bowls with the Chiefs and gone to two more after reaching one and losing it with the Eagles. Reid is also credited with drafting and developing Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes. To McNabb, the \"mistake\" of the Eagles firing Reid was bigger than that of the Giants letting go of Barkley. \"To be honest with you, I'll say the Eagles losing Andy,\" McNabb said when asked the bigger mistake between the two.

But I go back years ago with the success that I had with Andy, and I'd say, after I left, things were a little up and down. It wasn't as consistent as it was, and he was to blame for it. And you look at what Andy has done now and what possibly he could have done if he was still in Philadelphia. I'd think that Andy would rank first in that decision that they made.\" Despite a successful 14-year coaching career in Philadelphia, Reid has already accomplished more since taking over the Chiefs in 2013. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reid led the Eagles to a 130-93 (.583) record in Philadelphia with a 10-9 (.526) record in the playoffs but never won a Super Bowl there.

They're playing really smart. They're playing the Rick Tocchet defense. They've got that forward in the middle,\"Gretzky saidduring the second intermission. \"They've given them the outside.

    "article_text": "The political maverick questioned Democrats' sudden support for the billionaire after 'dumping all over him.' Maverick Democratic Sen.John Fettermandissed members of his own party Thursday for suddenly backing Elon Musk during his feud with President Donald Trump. Democrats have found anunlikely ally in Muskthis week, given his public rejection of Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and a subsequent call for Trump's impeachment. The president has championed the legislation as fulfilling his key campaign promises, including border security, American energy production and tax cuts. The megabill is under consideration by both a Republican-led White House and Congress. But it has faced hiccups in the Senate this week as Republicans, including some who helped pass the bill through the House, have indicated they do not support the bill in its current form. Every House Democrat voted against the bill. ELON MUSK WARPATH AGAINST TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' RATTLES HOUSE GOP Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., (left) said Democrats should make up their minds about Elon Musk.(Reuters; Getty Images) The national debt is at$36,214,501,400,213.64as of June 5, according to the latest numbers published by the Treasury Department. GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT Amid the setbacks, Musk has thrown a wrench into the Republican's reconciliation process through a series of fiery posts on X, the platform he bought in 2022. And Democrats were quick tocoalesce behind Musk's rejection of the bill, seizing on the GOP's intraparty conflict despite their outright rejection of Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) this year. In the first of several posts targeting the bill, and then Trump directly,Musk said, \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\" Fetterman, who has built a reputation for bucking his own party on issues like immigration and support for Israel, was quick to call out the inconsistency of his fellow Democrats Thursday.

Democrats began staging protests at Tesla dealerships early into Trump's second term. Tesla vehicles and dealerships have also been targeted this year in a string of violent attacks against the company, another business owned by Musk. Trump's Justice Department labeled the attacks \"domestic terrorism.\" And while the Pennsylvania Democrat said Musk is right for rejecting Trump's megabill, Fetterman said Thursday Democrats have to decide what they think of Musk and stick with it.

Mexican drug cartels are getting help from the Chinese to build their drug empire that feeds off American consumers. Border patrol officials intercepted 50,000 kilos of precursor chemicals this week used in the process of manufacturingmethamphetamines,sent from China and intended for members of the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. In addition to providing the cartels with the chemicals needed to make illicit drugs, Chinese entities are also one of the foremost actors in helping them launder their proceeds, according to the Treasury Department. \"For far too long, the Mexican drug cartels have raked in billions of dollars at the expense of our local communities leaving nothing but addiction, death and despair in their wake,\" said Chad Plantz, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge in Houston. \"This initiative provides HSI with a game-changing method to stay one step ahead of the cartels by disrupting the flow of chemicals that they depend on to produce illicit narcotics.\" 'COMING FOR US': EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM ON CCP'S MISSION TO 'KILL AMERICANS' AFTER FBI MAKES SHOCKING ARRESTS This images shows the Chinese flag next to a bag of the illicit drug known as fentanyl.

Immigration officials' bust comes amid news of a spate of other incidents involving Chinese nationals or individuals working for China who have engaged in espionage efforts, ranging from agroterroism and selling military secrets, to infiltrating U.S. universities and utilizing American-based products to sow political divisions online. In the latest incident, two Chinese nationals were charged with allegedly smuggling a \"dangerous biological pathogen\" into the U.S. to study at a University of Michigan laboratory.

    "article_text": "UnitedHealthcare CEO murder suspect Luigi Mangione appeared in a Blair County, Pennsylvania, courtroom Thursday morning for a hearing regarding his extradition back to New York City, where he allegedly committed the crime. UnitedHealthcare is suing British newspaper The Guardian for defamation, alleging that the outlet falsely accused them of enticing nursing homes to enroll in a special program that works to restrict medical expenses for elderly patients. \"The Guardian knowingly published false and misleading claims about our Institutional Special Needs Program, forcing us to take action to protect the clinician-patient relationship that is crucial for delivering high-quality care. The Guardian refused to engage with the truth and chose instead to print its predetermined narrative,\" UnitedHealthcare toldFox News Digitalin a statement. The Guardian article, published May 21, claimed that UnitedHealthcare is pursuing cost-cutting tactics that jeopardize the health of nursing home patients. The article claims that thehealth insurance giantprovides what amounts to secret bonuses to enroll in a program that stations medical staff that reports directly to UnitedHealthcare, and in practice works to reduce hospitalizations for patients, some of whom allegedly may urgently need the care. UnitedHealthcare is suing The Guardian for defamation.(Reuters) UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO MURDER SUSPECT LUIGI MANGIONE INDICTED IN NEW YORK The article also claims UnitedHealthcare financially entices nursing homes to join their \"Institutional Special Needs\" program, and allegedly illegally had nursing homes share confidential patient data with the insurer so that it could skirt federal law and market programs to patients – some of whom lack the capacity to make financial decisions on their own – and families. The Guardian also alleged that UnitedHealthcare leaned on nursing home staff to convince patients to sign DNR’s, even if they had expressed a desire for all medical options to be used to save their life. \"A recent article published byThe Guardianpresents a narrative built largely on anecdotes rather than facts. It is unfortunate that the article misrepresents a program that, in reality, improves health outcomes for seniors through on-site clinical care, personalized treatment plans, and enhanced coordination among caregivers. We stand firmly behind the integrity of our programs, which consistently receive high satisfaction ratings from our members,\" UnitedHealthcare said in a statement in response to the article in May. The lawsuit alleged that The Guardian used a \"heavily cropped screenshot\" of an internal UnitedHealthcare email which they claim, when seen in full, contradicts their reporting. The suit also accuses The Guardian of \"gratuitously\" linking its report to theassassination of their former CEO Brian Thompson. The Guardian told Fox News Digital they stand by their reporting.(Reuters) UNITEDHEALTH SHARES SLIDE AS CRIMINAL PROBE REPORT ADDS TO INVESTOR FEARS \"The Guardian knew these accusations were false, but published them anyway,\" the lawsuit stated. The Guardian told Fox News Digital it stood by its reporting. \"The Guardian stands by its deeply-sourced, independent reporting, which is based on thousands of corporate and patient records, publicly filed lawsuits, declarations submitted to federal and state agencies, and interviews with more than 20 current and former UnitedHealth employees – as well as statements and information provided by UnitedHealth itself over several weeks. It’s outrageous that in response to factual reporting on the practice of secretly paying nursing homes to reduce hospitalizations for vulnerable patients, UnitedHealth is resorting to wildly misleading claims and intimidation tactics via the courts,\" a representative from The Guardian said. UnitedHealthcare accused The Guardian of \"gratuitously\" trying to link their report to their former CEO's shocking murder, the lawsuit stated.(Curtis Means/Pool) CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When asked by Fox News Digital for clarification regarding the \"heavily cropped screenshot,\" a representative for The Guardian said the image was in fact a \"visual illustration\" and the so-called missing information was provided \"in an on-record comment and a denial from UnitedHealth\" in the proceeding paragraph.

    "title": "Why Zia Yusuf's resignation matters for Reform UK",
    "article_text": "The resignation of Zia Yusuf as Reform UK's chairman matters because he was a central character in the stand out trend in British politics since the general election – the rise and rise of Nigel Farage's party. I first met this thirty something Muslim son of Sri Lankan immigrants, a former Conservative, when he was unveiled by Reform almost exactly a year ago, as a donor who had just handed the party £200,000. Yusuf is a self-made multi millionaire after setting up and then selling Velocity Black, a luxury concierge service. Not long after his donation to Reform, he was offered and accepted the job of party chairman. And he wouldn't just be someone behind the scenes, he would be a public figure too. So how can we measure how important this moment is? I reckon there are three things worth examining as we assess Zia Yusuf's contribution to Reform UK. Firstly, money. Yusuf is a rich man, and giving away £200,000 is generous by any one's book. But Reform UK received £2.8m in donations last year, so the party isn't reliant on his money. Secondly, Yusuf's heritage and ethnicity. To expand in popularity, let alone win a general election, Reform needs to widen its appeal. Having a minority-ethnic man in his thirties as one of its figureheads helped temper the criticism from rival parties that Reform, or at least some of its members or supporters, were racist. And thirdly, his organisational abilities. Yusuf is credited with building much of the infrastructure up to now that Reform is attempting to assemble at lightning speed, to turn them from an insurgency into general election winners in just a handful of years. And now he is gone. The party has soared during his tenure, but it is also true that the now former chairman put rather a lot of noses out of joint within Reform. \"Were his interpersonal skills at the top of his list of attributes? No,\" Nigel Farage told GB News. Staff shown the door would joke that they had been \"Goldman sacked\" – a reference to Zia Yusuf's former employer, the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Plenty tell me the grumbles about his approach to running the party ran well beyond the gripes you can find in any workplace about the bosses. Nigel Farage and the parties he has led – the UK Independence Party, the Brexit Party and Reform UK – haveone heck of a track recordof bust ups, fall outs, sackings and resignations. Douglas Carswell, Diane James, Patrick O'Flynn, Godfrey Bloom, Suzanne Evans, Ben Habib, Rupert Lowe, the list goes on and on. And now Zia Yusuf. The big reason why this latest departure really matters is it is a stark reminder that a central ingredient in the rapid scaling up of Reform UK is going to be the hiring of staff who stick around long enough to help turn it into a potentially election winning machine. The party is attempting something utterly unprecedented and while the force of Nigel Farage's personality has and can take them a long way, bringing in a range and depth of expertise at least some of whom can last the course will be central too. Nigel Farage has never managed that before. And right now, he has to find himself a new chairman. The result in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election came as a surprise to many pundits. The ballot was held following the death of local MSP and government minister Christina McKelvie. Zia Yusuf says he no longer believes working to get a Reform government \"is a good use of my time\". The ballot is being held following the death of local MSP and government minister Christina McKelvie. Dame Andrea Jenkyns has been taking questions from BBC Radio Humberside listeners.",

    "title": "Cowboy Beyoncé dazzles nearly sold-out stadium",
    "article_text": "Beyoncé signed off the first night of her London residency by telling fans she was \"blessed\" to get to do what she loves by performing on stage. She stormed through a seven-act set at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, treating the audience to a spectacle that lasted just shy of three hours. But despite this being the first opportunity for fans to enjoy the singer's country era in person, slow ticket sales and high prices have been the hot topic around the tour. Promoters slashed some ticket prices in the run-up to shows in a bid to fill the stadium, prompting some of those who bought seats in advance to feel short-changed. Beyoncé's rodeo rumbled into London, bringing with it every country cliché you could think of - cowboy hats, horseshoes, tassels and even a gold mechanical bull. The 40-song setlist relied heavily on tracks from 2024's Cowboy Carter, which was met with critical acclaim, including taking the top album prize at this year's Grammy Awards. Every element of the performance was flawless, from the 43-year-old superstar's stunning array of costume changes (each one featuring more rhinestones than the last) to the seamless transitions between songs and musical themes. Much of the talk around the US leg of this tour, which took place in April and May, was the inclusion of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's 13-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, who reportedly begged her parents to dance on the Renaissance tour in 2023, but was denied the opportunity. She made several appearances throughout the show, earning thunderous applause whilst dancing to an instrumental performance of her mum's 2006 hit Deja Vu. The teenager certainly seemed to enjoy her moment in the spotlight, unlike her younger sister, Rumi, who came on stage during Protector, shyly mouthing the words whilst being held by Beyoncé. The show, which is called The Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour as a way of referencing black performers that were segregated from the country scene, often paid homage in its interludes to these artists. Beyoncé herself previously hinted about beingrejected from the country musicworld in the past and throughout the performance it felt like she was wrestling with this idea. She blended some of her biggest hits into Cowboy Carter tracks, such as Freedom and Diva, almost to prove that she belonged in this space. Thursday night's performance certainly showed she is more than qualified to be a country singer, but perhaps that a 60,000 seater stadium is not the best arena for it. As the night drew darker, Beyoncé delivered an act comprised of tracks from her house-inspired album Renaissance, which immediately lifted the crowd into a party mood. LED wristbands lit up in array of colours as she belted out Alien Superstar and I'm That Girl - which certainly got the best reaction from fans of the night. Similarly a section of old classics such as Crazy In Love and Irreplaceable had the crowd singing every word, proving perhaps that a few more classics wouldn't have gone amiss. With crowds on their feet, it was difficult to see how sold out the stadium actually was, but with just hours to go until the show there were still thousands of tickets available for sale online. Despite the tour only stopping in two European cities - London and Paris - the remaining eight dates are not sold out. Beyoncé's tour hasthe highest top-priced ticketof any artist visiting the UK in 2025 at £950, with the cheapest costing £71. Some seats that were sold in the Beyhive fan presale for £620 excluding fees are next to seats that were available this week for £141.60 without fees. Zulkarnain Sadali flew from Singapore to London to watch Beyoncé perform live and bought a ticket in the pre-sale, which he said cost him \"more than £700\". \"A couple of weeks ago I checked my ticket and then curiosity got the best of me and I checked the same ticket, or same category, and the price was around £300,\" he told the BBC. \"I'm really excited for [the show] but I will say the dynamic pricing really left a sour taste in my mouth.\" Another fan, Holly Whiteman, said she \"panic bought\" Beyoncé tickets in a fan pre-sale on Ticketmaster, which were \"way up in the nosebleeds\" and cost £170 each, when she had initially set a budget of £100. \"Fast forward a few days later, the tickets went on general sale through Tottenham Hotspur and I found tickets for the same show in both the same row and the same section for a much cheaper price,\" she told the BBC. \"I believe they were at least £50-£70 cheaper per ticket.\" Sadali said that despite feeling short-changed, it had not dented his excitement for the tour. \"It's really about the Beyoncé experience, you're not gonna get it anywhere else and I know this sounds like a contradiction, it's worth every cent,\" he said. Whiteman said the process had left her a bit \"disappointed\", but she was still looking forward to the tour. A Ticketmaster spokesperson told the BBC they do \"not use surge pricing or dynamic algorithms to adjust ticket prices\", adding that event organisers are responsible for the pricing structures. \"Since tickets typically go on sale at least 3-6 months before the event, organisers may review prices at key points leading up to the show, but they make any adjustments, not an algorithm,\" they also added. The BBC also contacted tour promoter Live Nation for comment. Ticketing expert Reg Walker put the lack of sold-out shows down to several factors, including \"overexposure\" after her last UK stadium tour, which played five nights at the same venue in 2023. And the ticket prices are \"eye-watering\", he told the BBC. \"You might be able to afford to go to one of her concerts where you're effectively paying, in some categories, the same amount of money as a small holiday, but you can't do that on consecutive years. \"The pricing strategy on tickets was clearly far too high,\" he added. Walker said there were a lot of \"affordably priced\" tours coming up - but with so many artists visiting the UK this summer, fans may be picking and choosing who they pay to go and see. Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey, Dua Lipa, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are all embarking on stadium tours over the coming months, with Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Chapell Roan and Drake headlining festivals. The star says he is focusing on acting after parting ways with his record company. How much attention did you pay to what's being going on in the world this week? Beyoncé kicks off the first of several highly anticipated Cowboy Carter concerts in Tottenham. The annual event kicks off on Thursday and runs until the end of June. Cally Rhodes from Shrewsbury says being selected to perform with Murs at Ludlow Castle is \"unreal\".",

    "title": "Handwritten notes reveal Churchill's penicillin concern ahead of D-Day",
    "article_text": "Winston Churchill's push to obtain penicillin in time to treat casualties expected from D-Day has come to light in documents seen by BBC News. Official papers unearthed by the National Archives reveal the prime minister's frustration and concern over slow progress securing supplies of what was then seen to be a brand new \"wonder drug\". The BBC was shown the papers ahead of the anniversary of the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944. Even months after D-Day, the wartime prime minister called efforts \"very disappointing\" and bemoaned the fact the US was \"so far ahead\" despite the drug being a \"British discovery\". Penicillin was discovered in London by Professor Alexander Fleming in 1928. Despite attempts to produce a usable medicine from the bacteria-killing mould, this had not been achieved by the start of World War Two. But an Oxford team of scientists, led by Howard Florey, carried out the first successful trials. With large-scale production difficult in the UK, they took their research to the United States, where drug companies expanded output. Before the development of penicillin, blood poisoning could follow even minor wounds with no cure available. So with the anticipation of the huge military effort ahead, supplies of the drug were seen as essential. Early in 1944, the prime minister was complaining to his ministers about Britain's inability to produce it at scale. He scrawled in red ink on a Ministry of Supply report that said the Americans were producing greater quantities: \"I am sorry we can't produce more\". Later in the year, in response to explanations from officials, he said: \"Your report on penicillin showing that we are only to get about one-tenth of the expected output this year, is very disappointing.\" On another report, he instructs: \"Let me have proposals for a more abundant supply from Great Britain\". Less than a fortnight before D-Day, health officials could report that sufficient supplies had been obtained, most from the US, but only for battle casualties. Dr Jessamy Carlson, modern records specialist at The National Archives, said: \"The files give a glimpse into the extraordinary levels of preparation undertaken in advance of the D-Day landings. \"Only six weeks before, penicillin is just reaching our shores in quantities which will allow it to play a major role in improving the outcomes for service personnel wounded in action.\" But what's now seen as the first true antibiotic would not be fully available to the general public till 1946. A telegram in the same files shows a doctor from Cornwall, who was treating a 10-year-old child in 1944, pleading with the authorities for the medicine: \"No hope without penicillin\". The plea was rejected, with supplies said to be only available for military use. With antibiotics now part of everyday life (and arguably too widely used), the documents seen by the BBC shed new light on the urgent efforts by Churchill and others to secure enough of one such drug for the first time to save lives during the struggle to liberate northern Europe. 'The Roaring Lion' - one of the 20th century's most iconic images - was stolen from a hotel in Ottawa. A special event remembering Londonderry's vital wartime role is taking place in the city on Saturday. The carriage, which also hosted US President Dwight Eisenhower, is at the South Devon Railway. The surrender of the German U-boats is remembered by a Derry man who was there 80 years ago. A tank that was quickly designed during World War Two goes in display in the town where it was made.",

    "title": "Growing number of MPs changing their mind on assisted dying",
    "article_text": "Opposition to a bill which would legalise assisted dying in England and Wales is growing among MPs, the BBC has found. The Assisted Dying Bill wassupported by 330 MPs last year, passing its first major vote in the House of Commons with a majority of 55 MPs from a wide range of political parties. But at least a dozen MPs who backed it or abstained in November have now said they are likely to vote against it. The bill would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die Supporters remain confident it will eventually become law but it faces further parliamentary tests. The bill is a private members' bill, sponsored by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. MPs have been given a free vote on it, meaning they can decide based on their conscience rather than having to follow a party line. They have spent the past few months examining it in detail, with more than 500 amendments tabled. Some of these changes will be voted on by MPs next Friday - and a final Commons vote will take place in the summer, before it heads to the House of Lords for further scrutiny. Markus Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Penrith and Solway, is one of those who has said he's now likely to vote against the bill after previously supporting it. He said he still considers himself \"a supporter of assisted dying\" but believes the current bill crosses \"red lines for protecting the vulnerable\". \"I want to see safeguards that will ensure that assisted dying is not overextended to include those in situations where there are alternative ways to improve the quality of their lives,\" said Campbell-Savours. \"I would also be very concerned if legislation produced a situation where people who considered themselves a burden on their families and friends felt pressured to end their life.\" Fellow Labour MP Josh Fenton-Glynn also plans to vote no, having previously abstained. \"If you'd asked me at any point in my life what I thought of assisted dying, I'd have always said in favour,\" he told the BBC. He has suggested a number of amendments to the bill, and claims he is \"still open to supporting\" the plans, but doubts it will change after Leadbeater blocked previous similar attempts. \"We see quite a few of the amendments which are specifically aimed at stopping coercion being opposed by the supporters of the bill,\" he said, adding: \"I don't think chances to make the bill safer have been taken.\" The two MPs have added their names to a growing list of their colleagues who have suggested they will switch sides including: Tory former minister George Freeman, Tory MPs Mike Wood and Andrew Snowden, Lib Dem Brian Matthew, Labour's Jonathan Hinder, Reform UK chief whip Lee Anderson and ex-Reform MP Rupert Lowe. Labour MP Debbie Abrahams and Tory MP Charlie Dewhirst, who abstained previously, will vote against. Labour's Karl Turner, who voted in favour at second reading, is now abstaining. Tory MP David Davis has not announced how he plans to cast his next vote, but has publicly backed a number of amendments that would make sweeping changes to the bill. Some MPs have also changed their stance, by supporting the bill. Minister Chris Bryant is understood to be backing it, having abstained in November. Labour MP Jack Abbott, who voted against last November, is also now likely to vote in favour. Others who were hesitantly supportive are now more firmly in favour. Liz Saville Roberts, the leader of Plaid Cymru at Westminster, said she was initially concerned but supported the principle of assisted dying. \"I think the safeguards have got stronger,\" she said. \"They have been improved through the bill committee and through the evidence that we heard.\" One of the changes made as the bill was scrutinised was allowing Senedd members a vote on whether it will apply in Wales. Despite opposition, supporters expect the bill to clear the Commons and go on to the House of Lords. Campaigners backing the bill do not expect many MPs to reverse their views - but with such tight margins, efforts to shore up support are in full swing. One major threat, for supporters of the bill, is MPs deciding to return home to their constituencies instead of voting. Due to a quirk of the parliamentary system, private members' bills are normally debated on Fridays - a day when MPs are normally in their constituencies. There is also growing concern that the government cannot afford to keep giving it parliamentary time. One Labour source told the BBC: \"Given the huge amount of difficult issues the government face, from winter fuel payments and Personal Independence Payment to defence and special educational needs and disabilities spending, a tight vote on assisted dying becomes a real problem. \"Lots of MPs think No 10 would be unwise to expend political capital continuing with this very divisive issue rather than choosing to fix the stuff we got elected to sort.\" Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.",

    "title": "Should you be eating food products with fewer ingredients?",
    "article_text": "For gluten-free, citrus-free and tomato-free Kerry Clayton, shopping and cooking is a challenge. As well as her own food requirements, her 10-year-old son is dairy and wheat-free. The family shops at multiple stores each week to get the best free-from options, cooks adaptable meals like jacket potatoes and pasta, and makes cakes and cookies from scratch. She spends about an hour a week baking, on top of running two online jewellery businesses and parenting another child. When M&S launched its Only range in March, with products featuring six or fewer ingredients, Ms Clayton described it as \"a dream\". That was despite higher prices - its one-ingredient corn flakes cost £2.50 for a 325g box, compared with 90p for 500g of the standard kind. \"For standard shoppers, it seems a lot, but for us with allergies, it's about normal,\" says Kent-based Ms Clayton. \"It's hard to find enjoyable things we can all eat. If you're used to the luxury of standard cereal, you might not enjoy alternatives, or understand the extra cost - but for those of us that need low ingredient food, it's perfect.\" Life might just be about to get a lot easier for Ms Clayton. More retailers and food brands are taking M&S's lead to offer more items containing fewer ingredients, prompted by the concern around ultra-processed food (UPF) that has been growing since Dr Chris Van Tulleken released his book, \"Ultra-Processed People\", in 2023. Less processed is growing in popularity. Matthew Hopkins, founder of IND!E, a platform which helps small food and drink brands get into big retailers, says he's seen a 40% increase in retailer enquiries over the past year about products with fewer ingredients. He is taking bigger orders specifically from Ocado, Selfridges and John Lewis. \"Retailers are responding to growing consumer demand for simpler, more recognisable ingredient lists,\" says Harrogate-based Mr Hopkins. Feeling the need to offer a less-processed product, plant-based brand THIS, which makes meat-free sausages, burgers, chicken and bacon, has recently launched a new Super Superfoods range. It's designed to be the protein component of a meal, and features natural ingredients, like beans, seeds and mushrooms. THIS is also responding to surveys indicating that shoppers areavoiding meat replacement products, due to their processed nature and the presence of artificial additives. Luke Byrne, innovation and sustainability director at THIS is concerned about \"consumer confusion and hesitation\". \"We understand we are classified as a UPF, however, that has little bearing on whether our products are healthy, because their nutritional properties are extremely good. Our products are high in protein, high in fibre, low in saturated fat and low in sugar,\" says London-based Mr Byrne. \"It has been frustrating in many ways as it has shifted the focus away from the most important thing about food, which is the nutrition aspect.\" So has the public been misled that all ultra-processed food is bad, and all unprocessed food is good? Nutritionist Dr Laura Wyness thinks so, expressing disappointment that the M&S Only range puts \"hype over health\". \"It may be that consumers are looking for products with shorter ingredient lists, but to leave out fortified nutrients is a backwards step for public health nutrition. We should be encouraging more nutrient dense foods in the diet, and fortifying products such as plant milk and dairy alternatives and breakfast cereals,\" says Edinburgh-based Dr Wyness. \"This seems like one occasion that the customer is not always right - mainly due to the misinformation that is informing their food choices.\" Dr Jibin He says UPF as a term is not a helpful indicator of whether something is healthy or unhealthy, as the concept, and how it is explained to the public, is flawed. Processed food, Dr He notes, will remain an essential part of feeding a large and growing human population, as processing ensures food safety, extends shelf life, and reduces waste. \"Take tofu as an example. It is a great source of protein, low in fat and considered as a healthy alternative to meats, particularly red meat. It is also more environmentally friendly. However, tofu would be considered as a UPF whereas red meat would be an unprocessed food,\" says Dr He, who is head of science and a chartered food scientist at Teesside University. He has also collaborated with food manufacturers and food technology companies to improve processing technologies. For food brands wanting to create less processed products, Dr He advises that it can be done by simplifying the formulas of existing products, and looking at new processing and packaging technologies that mean fewer ingredients can be used. \"Many food products have extremely complex formulas, and a manufacturer may not fully understand the functions of each listed ingredient in their formula. \"I would advise food manufacturers to closely examine their formulas and identify which ingredients are absolutely necessary and which they can do without,\" Dr He recommends. \"Novel food processing technologies can also help produce products with higher nutritional retention and longer shelf life without significantly altering the physical structure and chemical composition of the food.\" Dr He is also expecting a rise in marketing to push the virtues of less processed food products, as well as to justify their higher price points. Premium porridge brand 3Bears, for example, recently launched its own range of low ingredient breakfast cereals, in partnership with footballer Harry Kane. Mr Kane appears in product promotion, and is also a company shareholder. 3Bears' oat cinnamon loops, containing seven ingredients, are priced at £3.99 for 250g. That's compared with Only multigrain hoops from M&S, containing five ingredients, at £2.50 for 300 grams, while Waitrose Essential multigrain hoops are £1.25 for 375 grams, and contain 22 ingredients. \"With our oat flakes it was really hard to get the texture and crunchiness right – as we only wanted to use three ingredients, and oats are very different to process than other grains. With the costs of creating products with fewer ingredients higher and the process harder, the price points are reflective of this,\" explains 3Bears co-founder Caroline Nichols. For some foods, the debate over UPF, seems less of a problem. The UK confectionery marketcontinues to grow steadily, and is worth about £14.8bn, despite it having a high proportion of UPF products. Ice cream ball brand Little Moons might list over 30 ingredients on some of its flavours, but it now exports from the UK to 35 countries, and supermarkets have copied it with own-brand versions. Ross Farquhar, the company's marketing, innovation and sustainability director, is confident that treat food brands can ride out the UPF storm, so he isn't in a hurry to slash Little Moon's ingredient list. \"The reality of a category like ice cream is that certain ingredients are needed to keep the product stable through the food supply chain, like emulsifiers and stabilisers. So unless we're all going to start making ice cream at home regularly then off-the-shelf ice cream still has a role to play,\" says London-based Mr Farquhar. \"I'm sure the M&S 'Only' chocolate bars are delicious, but they're speaking to a very specific audience, and I doubt the big confectionery brands are going to be willing to compromise the core product attributes consumers love.\" Workers at Reaction Engines felt they were close to completing a revolutionary jet engine. Billions of dollars of US federal funding for green energy projects hangs in the balance. Indian start-ups are using local materials and innovative ideas to make useful and affordable products. The vigilance needed in the military can be an asset in the cybersecurity industry. Cooling systems that avoid the use of polluting refrigerants are being launched.",

    "title": "N Korea launches warship after earlier failed attempt",
    "article_text": "North Korea has launched a warship two weeks after it wasdamaged during an earlier launch attempt, in an incident that drew harsh criticism from the country's leader Kim Jong Un. The 5,000-tonne destroyer, which was restored to balance earlier this week, was launched on Thursday and is now moored at a pier, state-run news agency KCNA said. The ship is expected to be fully restored before a ruling party meeting sometime this month, KCNA added. Kim, who witnessed the warship tipping over during the first launch attempt, criticised the incident as a \"criminal act\" that \"severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride\". It was the result of \"absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism\", he said. At least four officialsincluding Ri Hyong-son,the deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, have been arrested over the incident. Mr Ri is part of the party's Central Military Commission, which commands the Korean People's Army and is responsible for developing and implementing North Korea's military policies. It is not clear what punishment the officials might face, but the authoritarian state has been known to sentence officials it finds guilty of wrongdoing toforced labour and even death. The effort to right the ship was a manual process, according to researchers from 38 North, a website run by the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in the US. Satellite imagery shows workers on the quay pulling tethers and using barrage balloons to bring the vessel back to balance, they said, adding that some of the balloons appeared to still be attached to the vessel. Some analysts saw Kim's swift and severe response to the earlier failed launch as a signal that Pyongyang would continue to advance its military capabilities. The regime is \"deeply invested in the image of a rising military power\" and the failure may harden their resolve to push that forward, says Jihoon Yu, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. Kim's \"unusually severe\" response to the failure is aimed at protecting the leader's image and reasserting his authority, he adds. Michael Madden, a North Korea expert from the Stimson Center in Washington, sees Kim's response as a sign of the \"high priority\" his regime is putting into developing warships. Just weeks before the botched launch, Pyongyang had unveiled a similar warship in another part of the country. Kim called that warship a \"breakthrough\" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year. \"We will never be silenced,\" says Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who started the protest dance. The exercise, which was supposed to be held in 2021, has been delayed several times. Eleven people were killed and dozens injured in a crush outside a cricket stadium in India's Bengaluru. The auction house Bonhams says this is \"thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for\". The elephant helped himself to nine bags of sweet rice crackers, a sandwich and some bananas, shopkeepers say.",

    "title": "Australian mushroom lunch cook tells trial meal was 'special'",
    "article_text": "An Australian woman accused of intentionally cooking a fatal mushroom lunch has told her trial she had wanted the beef Wellington meal to be \"special\". Erin Patterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering three people and attempting to kill another at her home in regional Victoria in July 2023. The 50-year-old says it was a tragic accident, and that she never intended to hurt family members she loved. But prosecutors argue Ms Patterson put poisonous fungi into their food in a carefully crafted plot to kill them. On Friday, the court heard it was \"unusual\" for Ms Patterson to host such an event at her house, and she was quizzed about her relationships with her guests. Ms Patterson's in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, along with Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson, 66, all fell ill and died days after the lunch. Heather's husband, local pastor Ian Wilkinson, was also hospitalised but recovered after coming out of a weeks-long induced coma. Simon Patterson, the accused's estranged spouse, had been invited too, but pulled out the day before. More than 50 prosecution witnesses have given evidence at the trial, which began six weeks ago, but Ms Patterson became the first for the defence when she took to the stand on Monday. On her second day of cross-examination on Friday, Ms Patterson told the court she accepted that invites to her house were rare, but said she'd arranged the occasion to discuss a health issue and wanted to make a nice meal for her relatives to thank them for their support. \"I wanted it to be special,\" Ms Patterson said. She has previously admitted she misled her guests into believing she may need cancer treatment, telling the jury she did so as a cover for weight-loss surgery she was planning to have but was too embarrassed to disclose. Prosecutor Nanette Rogers, however, put to her that there was no health issue to discuss, and that she had invited Simon and his relatives over to kill them. She had even prepared a spare toxic meal in case Mr Patterson changed his mind and came over, Dr Rogers suggested. Over and over this week, Ms Patterson has denied these allegations, often becoming emotional as she told the court she loved the lunch guestslike her own family. She has also repeatedly told the court that she realised, in the days after the lunch, that the beef Wellington may have accidentally included dried mushrooms she had foraged, which were kept in a container with store-bought ones. Lies to the police and health authorities about the source of the mushrooms and her decision to dispose of a food dehydrator were both because she was scared of being blamed for the guests' dire illnesses, she said. \"Surely if you had loved them, then you would have immediately notified the medical authorities?\" Dr Rogers asked. Ms Patterson said she didn't tell doctors about the possibility that wild mushrooms had been unintentionally included because the lunch guests were already getting treatment for death cap mushroom poisoning. \"Even after you were discharged from hospital you did not tell a single person that there may have been foraged mushroom used in the meal,\" Dr Rogers said. \"Instead you got up, you drove your children to school... and drove home. And then you got rid of the dehydrator.\" \"Correct,\" Ms Patterson said. The court heard there'd been conflict between Ms Patterson and her husband, and Dr Rogers suggested the accused was still angry at her in-laws for taking their son's side. \"You had two faces,\" Dr Rogers said, after making Ms Patterson read aloud messages in which she is critical of both Simon Patterson and his parents. There was her \"public face\" of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail, Dr Rogers said, and a \"private face\" which she showed in the messages. \"How you truly felt about Don and Gail was how you expressed it [there],\" she said. \"And that is how you really felt about Simon Patterson... you did not regard him as being a decent human being at his core, correct or incorrect?\" That was \"incorrect\", Ms Patterson replied, her head shaking and voice faltering. Ms Patterson's use of the iNaturalist website - which listed locations of death cap mushrooms in areas close to her home - was also scrutinised, with the accused repeatedly saying she couldn't clearly recall ever using the site. She will resume being cross examined next week. The trial, initially expected to take six weeks, is now expected to run for at least another fortnight, the judge has told the court.",

    "title": "Zia Yusuf resigns as Reform UK chairman",
    "article_text": "Zia Yusuf has resigned as the chairman of Reform UK, saying working to get the party elected was no longer \"a good use of my time\". In a post on social media, Yusuf did not expand further on his reasons for stepping down. However, it comes afterhe said it was \"dumb\" for the party's newest MP to call on Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka. Reform leader Nigel Farage said he was \"genuinely sorry\" Yusuf was resigning, describing him as \"enormously talented\". Farage said Yusuf was \"a huge factor\" inthe party's success in last month's elections, when Reform won a by-election, two mayoral races and gained 677 new councillors. However, he told GB News he believed Yusuf had \"had enough\" of politics, which can be \"totally unrelenting\". Farage said he had \"suspicions\" Yusuf might quit after he seemed \"very disengaged\" when the pair spoke on Wednesday morning but was only given a \"10-minute warning\" his resignation was coming. Asked about reports that some in the party found Yusuf difficult to deal with, Farage said \"not everyone got on with him\". He added: \"Were his interpersonal skills at the top of his list of attributes? No. But I always found him, with me, very polite.\" In a post on X, Yusuf wrote: \"11 months ago I became chairman of Reform. I've worked full time as a volunteer to take the party from 14 to 30% [in national polls], quadrupled its membership and delivered historic electoral results. \"I no longer believe working to get a Reform government elected is a good use of my time, and hereby resign the office.\" Earlier, Yusuf had criticised Sarah Pochin - who won last month's Runcorn and Helsby by-election - for urging Sir Keir Starmer to ban the burka \"in the interests of public safety\" during her Prime Minister's Questions debut on Wednesday. He said it was \"dumb for a party to ask the PM if they would do something the party itself wouldn't do\". Pochin's call appeared to go down well with Reform's other MPs, although a party spokesman said it was \"not party policy\". The party's deputy leader, Richard Tice, said there should be a \"national debate\" about a possible ban. However he declined to state what his position would be in such a debate. In response to Yusuf quitting, Pochin said he had been \"a great friend and colleague\", adding that \"the professionalisation he brought to Reform UK will have a lasting legacy\". Yusuf, who was previously a member of the Conservative Party, became Reform UK's chairman shortly after last year's general election. A former banker who sold his tech start-up company for more than £200m, Yusuf has described himself as a \"proud British Muslim patriot\". He donated £200,000 to Reform during the general election campaign and as chairman he was given the job of professionalising the party, wooing donors and increasing Reform UK's activist base. Yusuf was seen as central to Reform's operation and had been spearheading the party'sso-called Doge teamsto cut wasteful spending in the councils it now controls. The acronym refers to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in the US. Tech entrepreneur Nathaniel Fried, who was brought in to lead the Doge unit, said he was stepping down with Yusuf. \"I have a huge amount of respect for the work that the councils are doing to save taxpayer money, and reduce wastage,\" he wrote on X. But he added that Yusuf \"got me in and I believe it is appropriate for me to leave with him\". Yusuf's unexpected resignation came after he had spent recent days trumpeting the Doge initiative, which was only formally launched this week. He has previously hailed Farage as the UK's \"next prime minister\" who \"will return Britain to greatness\". Prominent Reform supporter Tim Montgomerie said he was \"a big fan\" of Yusuf but added: \"He was a young man in a hurry - he upset quite a lot of people who didn't want the party to professionalise, to modernise. \"He faced a lot of prejudice, not necessarily from inside the party but on social media, I think that affected him. \"I think the row over the burka question that the new MP asked yesterday may have been the last straw for him.\" He said Reform was \"looking like a party with too many internal tensions, but there is time to put that right\". Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"By sacking himself, Zia Yusuf seems to be leading the 'UK Doge' by example. You have to admire his commitment to the cause. \"It's already clear Reform UK cannot deliver for the communities they are elected to stand up for. Instead, they have copied the Conservative playbook of fighting like rats in a sack.\" A Labour Party spokesperson said: \"If Nigel Farage can't manage a handful of politicians, how on earth could he run a country? \"He has fallen out with everyone he has ever worked with. Reform are just not serious.\" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"Reform is not a political party. It is a fan club.\" Reform has seen its support in national polls grow since last year's general election, when the party won 14.3% of the vote share and secured five MPs. However, it has been dogged by infighting which culminated in Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe being expelled from the party. It came after he was accused of harassing staff members and threatening \"physical violence\" against Yusuf. Lowe denied the claims and last monththe Crown Prosecution Service said he would not face criminal chargesin relation to the allegation of threats, after he was referred to the police by the party. Responding to Yusuf's resignation, Lowe said: \"The question is - how did a man with no political experience be given such vast power within Reform?\"",

    "article_text": "Lululemon shares have plunged by more than 20% after it cut its annual profit forecast, as the company navigates tariffs and fears about the US economy slowing. \"We experienced lower store traffic in the Americas, partially reflective of economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, lower consumer confidence, and changes in discretionary spending,\" Lululemon said in astatement. The athleisure brand joins a growing list of big companies to warn about the impact of US President Donald Trump's trade policies. The Trump administration's approach to tariffs has triggered concerns over rising prices and a weakening economy. \"We are planning to take strategic price increases... on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,\" Lululemon's finance chief Meghan Frank said. The company also said it will cut costs and negotiate with its vendors. Last year, 40% of its products were made in Vietnam, and 28% of its fabrics came from mainland China. Clothing and footwear brands are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they make goods in Asian countries, which have faced steep levies from the US. In April, sportswear giantAdidas warned that import taxes imposed by Trump will lead to higher pricesin the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba. \"Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,\" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said. Also in April, footwear makerSkechers withdrew its annual results forecast, citing economic uncertainty. \"The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,\" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Last month,Nike said it would raise priceson some trainers and clothing in the US from early June. The sportswear giant did not name US tariffs explicitly as a reason for the increase, saying it regularly made \"price adjustments\". Trump's proposed 3.5% tax on remittances by foreign workers could seriously impact top recipient India. The company says a challenging market and uncertainty about tariffs are having an effect. American purchases of Canadian goods in April fell to the lowest level since 2021. The retailer has opened a store at the former Smith Street post office in St Peter Port. Trump doubles down on his tariffs, while sparing the UK from the latest duties.",

    "title": "Endangered sharks being killed at alarming levels in Pacific, Greenpeace claims, after cutting 20km of vessel’s longline",
    "article_text": "Endangered sharks are being killed at alarming levels in the Pacific and industrial fishing is putting marine biodiversity at increasing risk,Greenpeacehas claimed, after its activists disrupted a Spanish vessel operating north of New Zealand. The campaign group said activists on the Rainbow Warrior this week observed a longline fishing operation by the Playa Zahara in the South Fiji Basin. Georgia Whitaker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, was on board during the operation. She claimed the activists watched as the vessel hauled in and killed three endangered mako sharks in half an hour. She said a small crew, including a trained shark handler, boarded a support boat to approach the Spanish vessel after releasing 14 animals caught on its line – among them eight near-threatened blue sharks, four swordfish and an endangered longfin mako shark. The activists also removed more than 210 hooks and 20km of longline. “It was devastating seeing these beautiful creatures being caught, often on their gills, in their mouth, by huge baited hooks,” Whitaker said. “They were fighting for their lives and then minutes later you’d see blood spilling over the side of the boat.” Whitaker said the vessel’s crew told Greenpeace they were acting legally and primarily targeting swordfish. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email According to the European Union’s reporting to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the Playa Zahara caught more than600,000kg of blue sharkin 2023 in thePacific Southwest. Patricia Rodríguez, a spokesperson for Viverdreams Fish, the company that owns Playa Zahara, said in a statement the boat acted in accordance with international law and capturing species such as the mako shark and blue shark was not prohibited. “The species mentioned by Greenpeace are within the quotas and limits allowed by the competent authorities, and the capture, handling and unloading procedures are controlled and documented, by all the systems established by the EU and Spanish authorities,” Rodríguez said. The statement accused Greenpeace of “a campaign of disinformation”, violating maritime laws, stealing the fishing gear and posing risks to crews on both vessels by its intervention. “Our company is strongly committed to the sustainability of marine resources and regularly collaborates with scientists, independent observers and fisheries authorities to ensure compliance with conservation standards,” she said. AGreenpeace analysishas estimated that almost half a million blue sharks were caught as bycatch in the Pacific Ocean last year – the highest number recorded since 1991. The same report found nearly 70% of EU longline catches in the region in 2023 were blue sharks. World leaders will meet in Nice next week for the UN ocean conference to discuss thehigh seas biodiversity treaty, which Australia signed in 2023 but is yet to ratify. Greenpeace has urged the government to ratify the treaty within the first 100 days of its second term. The treaty requires 60 countries to ratify it before it comes into force, but as yetonly 32 have done so. Shark fishing is a lucrative global trade, worth an estimated$1bn annually. Global demand for shark meathas doubled in the past two decades. Dr Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the level of exploitation was alarming, given more thanone-third of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction globally. “Sharks are important in the ecosystem, they typically occupy the top of marine food webs,” he said. “Steep population declines will cause food webs to potentially become unstable and ultimately collapse, there is a clear impact their loss could have on food security for a lot of nations.” Guida said the creation of no-take marine sanctuaries was essential – to preserve marine life and to understand how ecosystems respond to the combined pressures of overfishing and the climate crisis. “These sanctuaries act as controls,” he said. “They help us compare areas impacted by fishing with those that are not, which is critical to building resilience in ocean wildlife and managing our fisheries in a rapidly changing world, such that we reduce our impact on different species.”",

In an interview for Guardian Australia’s Australian Politics podcast, Boele said Labor should consider implementing a price on carbon or other decisive policy settings to supercharge renewables investment. She said: This Labor government, so far, is still walking both sides of the fence and it’s confusing as hell for the private sector in terms of investing their money. If we just had some certainty – some long, loud and legal signs from the government about a direction and pace of travel on climate – we could have literally tens, if not hundreds of billions of [dollars of] investment from superannuation, private wealth, flowing into those solutions in large-scale wind, and solar, and storage and batteries, and energy efficiency, and all of those things.

An official saidLeannedra KangandTakahiro Toya, both in their 20s, were believed to be visiting the St Helens/Scamander area recently. The pair were scheduled to leave Tasmania and fly home to Brisbane from Launceston on Wednesday, 4 June, but never boarded their flight or returned their rental car. Police said they may be travelling in the car, a white Toyota Corolla, with registration L67GW. Police included a note in a media release: Leannedra and Takahiro if you see this, you’re not in any trouble, please phone police or family to let them know you’re OK.

Endangered sharks being killed at alarming levels in the Pacific, Greenpeace claims Endangered sharks are being killed at alarming levels in the Pacific and industrial fishing is putting marine biodiversity at increasing risk,Greenpeaceclaims, after its activists disrupted a Spanish vessel operating north of New Zealand. The campaign group said activists on the Rainbow Warrior this week observed a longline fishing operation by the Playa Zahara in the South Fiji Basin. Georgia Whitaker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, was on board during the operation. She claimed the activists watched as the vessel hauled in and killed three endangered mako sharks in half an hour. Whitaker said: It was devastating seeing these beautiful creatures being caught, often on their gills, in their mouth, by huge baited hooks. They were fighting for their lives and then minutes later you’d see blood spilling over the side of the boat.

These are the same standards that Australian beef exporters adhere to in order to sell beef into the US. Cattle Australia added the US “needs to be able to demonstrate it can either trace cattle born in Mexico and Canada, or has systems that are equivalent to Australia’s traceability, before imports of meat could occur from non-US cattle”. The group says it is in contact with the Albanese government to stress “the vital importance that our science-based biosecurity system is not compromised as part of trade discussions with any country”. Cold, wintry forecast for south-east Australia over long weekend, BoM says TheBoMis forecasting a cold, windy and wet long weekend for much of south-eastern Australia, although it may be good news for skiers going into the official first day of ski season tomorrow. Jonathan How, a forecaster and senior meteorologist for the agency, said many people across NSW and Victoria will feel a wind chill coming through from Saturday as two cold fronts push across the region. For many people Sunday will be the coldest day of the year. How said the forecast showed the possibility for the most significant amount of snow in the south-east of the country so far this year. In good news for ski resorts, some parts of the alpine mountains could see “very high accumulations” between 30cm and up to 70cm. On Sunday, there may be snow across central parts of NSW, including the Blue Mountains and Oberon, although the cold conditions bring the risk of black ice across parts of Victoria and NSW. Victoria police and the Australian federal police executed “a number” of search warrants in Melbourne this morning as officials investigatean arson attackon a synagogue last year. Police have been investigating the fire at the Adass Israel synagogue on 6 December 2024 as a terrorist attack, and say they are still seeking to speak with anyone “who observed any suspicious activity in the area either in the lead up to or following the fire”. TheAFP saidlast month investigators had combed through hundreds of hours of CCTV footage. The agency released video of three people dressed in hoodies and masks who allegedly drove to the synagogue in a blue VW Golf before using an axe to damage the entrance to the building. Footage then shows the individuals allegedly pouring the contents of red jerry cans inside, which they then ignited. The building was heavily damaged in the incident. Virgin Australiahas confirmed its intention to proceed with an initial public offering (IPO) and re-list on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), five years after it left the stock market as part of its pandemic-induced restructure. In a heavily anticipated development, the airline confirmed on Friday it had lodged a prospectus with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and filed with the ASX, as its owners Bain Capital move ahead with a $685m initial public offering. The IPO is comprised of an offer of 236.2 million fully paid ordinary shares at an offer price of A$2.90 a share. On completion, investors participating in the offer are expected to hold 30.2% of shares in the airline. It’s expected trading of shares on the ASX will begin on 24 June. The Virgin Australia chair,Peter Warne, said: We believe it is now appropriate for the business to transition to a publicly listed company. This provides an opportunity for new investors to share in the success of Virgin Australia as the airline enters its next phase. The Nationals leader,David Littleproud,said Australia should not “be trading its beef industry away” and urged the Albanese government to look elsewhere to negotiate aroundDonald Trump’s tariffs. The health minister,Mark Butler, confirmed earlier today the government is reviewing a ban on imports of American beef into Australia, saying the restrictions had been under review “for some time”. The remarks come just a week before the PM heads to the G7 meeting in Canada, where he is expected to advocate for an easing of Trump’s punishing tariffs. The beef restrictions could be a bargaining chip in those talks. Littleproud said Australia should remain focused on its biosecurity: The United States uses cattle from Mexico and Canada in their supply chain that poses a potential risk to our industry and ignoring those risks would be dangerous. Rather than jeopardise our beef industry, Australia should be leveraging off our strong historical ties and areas such as critical minerals and Aukus, using real leadership to obtain a fair deal. Albanese stressed earlier today he had no plans to ease biosecurity rules, calling them his “first priority”: If things can be sorted out in a way that protects our biosecurity, of course we don’t just say no. Apple warns against Australia’s proposed changes to boost competition on digital platforms Australians could lose more money to fraudsters, miss out on cutting-edge tech features, and fail to see lower prices under changes proposed to boost competition on digital platforms, Apple has warned. The US tech giant issued the warnings today, urging the government not to “follow a handful of untested laws” from other countries in its submission to aDigital Competition Regimeconsultation. But experts say consumers could benefit from greater competition, with the pushback coming as Apple fights regulatory changes in Europe and the US that could force it to allow third-party payments without taking commissions. Changes were proposed to rules governing digital platforms after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s Digital Platforms inquiry, with consultation on regulations closing in February. Australian businesses and consumers needed greater rights on digital platforms and upfront rules to govern their conduct, the consultation paper said, as a concentration of power could lead to “higher prices, reduced choice and lower innovation”. Apple rejected these outcomes in its submission and, in a separate statement, insisted the company’s ecosystem helped developers and security features protected consumers from fraud and scams. Australian Associated Press Ian Thorpereported an alleged robbery to NSW Police yesterday after watches, jewellery and some personal items were taken from his home. James Erskine, Thorpe’s manager, confirmed the incident to 2GB’s Ben Fordham: He has had some things stolen from his house, watches jewellery some personal items. He called up his insurers, they said you have to go make a police report. … That’s all I know. He hasn’t lost Olympic medals or things like that, but you know it’s not very nice. Erskine could not speak to the value of the items taken, but Fordham reported the figure could be around $150,000. I wouldn’t imagine he’d have cheap watches, but I have no idea the value. NSW Police confirmed a 42-year-old man reported an alleged theft incident on Thursday at Paddington police station. Officials have opened an investigation into the incident.",

    "title": "Sussan Ley says name spelling change was due to ‘punk phase’ – not numerology",
    "article_text": "The opposition leader,Sussan Ley, has walked back claims that an interest in numerology was the reason she added extra “s” in her name, claiming her comment she made to a journalist in 2015 was a “flippant remark” and not correct. Ley told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday that the name change came during her “punk phase” as a teenager, shooting down a long-running story that she had added the extra letter because of a belief it would make her life more exciting. The Liberal leader has also conceded women were “disappointed” with the opposition’s policies at last month’s election, promising theCoalitionwould “modernise” and offer new ideas on housing, especially for young people, as well as childcare and aged care. In a 2015 profile with the Australian newspaper, Ley was quoted as saying: “I read about this numerology theory that if you add the numbers that match the letters in your name you can change your personality. “I worked out that if you added an ‘s’ I would have an incredibly exciting, interesting life and nothing would ever be boring. It’s that simple … And once I’d added the ‘s’ it was really hard to take it away.” Asked about the quote on 3AW on Friday, Ley claimed it was a “flippant remark” and numerology was “actually not the reason”. “It was something I did during my rebel teenage years and, you know, I went through a punk phase in those years and added the extra ‘s’. People have been fascinated by the numerology angle, but it’s actually not correct,” Ley said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email It is not the first time Ley has walked back the 2015 claim, seeking to explain her earlier quote in several media interviews when asked in recent years. In mid-May, shortly after being elected Liberal leader, Ley told Kyle and Jackie O’s Kiis FM program that the original quote was “an offhand remark to a journalist, which sort of took off”. “The real reason is I was rather rebellious in my youth. That’s been covered in my punk rock past, and so I just added the extra ‘s’ and annoyed my family members. At that time, by the way, I certainly didn’t think I would end up being leader of the opposition or even a politician,” she said. In the 3AW interview, Ley also said the Liberals “we must listen, we must change, we must develop a fresh approach”. “That listening is very important in what we do next. We will modernise. We will rebuild,” she said. The Coalitionwill be left with just 43 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Labor government holding a large majority with 94 seats. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion “We’ve got to have a party that respects modern Australia, reflects modern Australia, and represents modern Australia. And we’ve got to meet modern Australia communities, the people who listen to your program, where they are,” Ley said. “I stood on the pre-poll in the last fortnight [of the election] all around the country, including Melbourne, and I talked to women and I saw the look of disappointment on many of their faces, and I asked them what they were thinking, and they didn’t feel that we had a policy offering that was relevant to them.” Leywas this week critical of former Liberal president Alan Stockdale, who reportedly claimed women had become “so assertive” that the party might need to consider extra support for men. The Liberal leader admitted that housing was a key issue the opposition had to work on, especially to win the votes of younger Australians. She also nominated childcare, aged care and policies on students as priority issues. “They [young people] are worried about work. Of course, they’re worried about studying, but they’re worried about housing too, and if we can’t find a pathway, or articulate a pathway into housing for young people, then they’re not going to support our political party,” she said. “We had some policies at the last election. We’ll review those. I’m always very frustrated by what state governments are not doing when it comes to supporting young people in housing. But I’m not saying that it’s only in their court. There are things the federal government can do as well.”",

    "title": "Families of children killed in Hillcrest jumping castle incident ‘shattered’ after not guilty verdict",
    "article_text": "The families of the six children killed in a primary school jumping castle incident are angry after the operator who set up the castle was found not guilty of a workplace safety charge. Chace Harrison, Jalailah Jayne-Maree Jones, Zane Mellor, Addison Stewart, Jye Sheehan and Peter Dodt died after the incident at Hillcrest primary school in Devonport in December 2021. They were enjoying end-of-year celebrations on the Tasmanian school’s oval when a wind gust lifted the castle into the air. Three other children were seriously injured. Rosemary Gamble, owner of Taz-Zorb which set up the equipment, pleaded not guilty to failing to comply with a workplace health and safety duty. She was accused of failing to anchor the castle properly. She was found not guilty by magistrate Robert Webster in Devonport magistrates court on Friday. In delivering his decision, Webster said Gamble “in some respects” failed to comply with her health and safety duties. “However, I am not satisfied, pursuant to [the charge] those failures were a substantial or significant cause of the children being exposed to the risk of serious injury or death,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Webster said the incident occurred due to an unprecedented weather system, namely a dust devil which was “impossible to predict”. “Ms Gamble could have done more or taken further steps,” Webster wrote in his written decision. “However, given the effects of the unforeseen and unforeseeable dust devil, had she done so, that would sadly have made no difference to the ultimate outcome.” Webster told the court the charge was dismissed and Gamble was “free to go”. Zane’s mother, Georgie Burt, yelled at Gamble inside the courtroom after the decision was handed down. “I hope you see them every time I miss a birthday, miss a Christmas,” she said. A representative of Gamble read a statement on her behalf outside court, saying she recognised the scars of the incident would likely remain forever. “I never meant for something like this to happen. And I am just so sorry that it did,” the statement said. “I am a mother. I can only imagine the pain that other parents are living with each and every day because of this terrible thing that happened.

Her lawyer, Chris Dockray, argued Gamble had been left out to dry by the castle’s Chinese manufacturer. East Inflatables didn’t provide instructions to Gamble upon purchase and only supplied four pegs, Dockray told the court. Gamble instead downloaded a two-page manual from the company’s website, he said, which resulted in an interpretation that four pegs were sufficient. According to court documents, seven students were on the castle when a significant weather event dislodged it. They fell from the castle, while a blower attached to the castle to keep it inflated struck a nearby student. Preparations for an inquest had been paused due to the criminal proceedings, while a class action has also been launched against Gamble, as well as the state of Tasmania.",

    "title": "Australia mushroom trial live: Erin Patterson cannot recall accessing website on death cap sightings, court hears",
    "article_text": "This blog has now closed Another URL shows a death cap mushroom sighting in Melbourne posted on the iNaturalist website. Patterson says it’s “possible” she looked at the site. “I don’t know,” she says. Asked if her child accessed these sites on the computer, Patterson says, “I don’t know.” “I suggest you had an interest in death cap mushrooms on 28 May 2022,” Rogers says. “Depends what you mean by an interest,” Patterson replies. Here’s a recap of what the jury heard today during Patterson’s cross-examination: Erin Pattersonsaid she could not recall accessing posts about death cap mushroom sightings on the citizen science website iNaturalist in May 2022. The court was shown a report from data extracted from a computer that police seized from Patterson’s house a week after the lunch. It showed the Bing search engine was used to look up the citizen science website iNaturalist in May 2022. Patterson said on 1 August 2023 – three days after the lunch – that she realised foraged mushrooms may have been in a plastic container storing store-bought mushrooms that were used in the beef wellingtons. This occurred after her estranged husband,Simon,asked if she used a dehydrator to poison his parents, Patterson said. She agreed she did not tell anyone about this realisation. Patterson denied that the “purpose” of the fateful lunch on 29 July 2023 was to discuss advice about a medical issue she had. Patterson acknowledged she told Simon about “some medical stuff” when she invited him to the lunch about two weeks prior. Patterson said the medical issues referred to gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, which she was planning to have. She said she had a pre-surgery appointment booked. Patterson said she felt “ashamed” about a message she sent to her Facebook friends in December 2022 where she wrote “fuck em” in relation to her in-laws, Don and Gail. She rejected the prosecution’s suggestion that messages in a group Facebook chat reflected her true feelings towards Don and Gail. Court adjourns The court has adjourned for the long weekend. Justice Christopher Bealereminds the jury not to speak to anyone about the trial apart from their fellow jurors in the jury room. Patterson’s cross-examination will continue on Tuesday from 10.30am. Another URL shows a death cap mushroom sighting in Melbourne posted on the iNaturalist website. Patterson says it’s “possible” she looked at the site. “I don’t know,” she says. Asked if her child accessed these sites on the computer, Patterson says, “I don’t know.” “I suggest you had an interest in death cap mushrooms on 28 May 2022,” Rogers says. “Depends what you mean by an interest,” Patterson replies. Patterson asked about death cap mushroom sightings posted to iNaturalist Rogers asks about evidence from Patterson’s Facebook friend that she was regarded as a good researcher. Patterson agrees she can be a good researcher, but says other people can also find information quickly. Rogers says the trial has heard evidence about data found on the Cooler Master computer police seized from Patterson’s house. The court is shown a digital analysis report, which shows the Bing search engine was used to look up the citizen science website iNaturalist in May 2022. It also lists URLs about death cap mushroom sightings on the website. Rogers suggests Patterson did the browsing on Bing. Patterson replies: “I don’t remember doing it. It’s possible it was me.” Rogers puts to Patterson: “I suggest you knew what website you were looking for.” “I can’t say that because I don’t remember this,” Patterson says. She says at “one point” she wanted to find out if death cap mushrooms grew in South Gippsland. She says she found out they did not. Patterson tearfully says she wanted to thank the Wilkinsons ‘for being good to me over the years’ Rogers turns to Patterson’s relationship with Simon’s maternal aunt,Heather Wilkinsonand her husband,Ian Wilkinson. Rogers takes the court through Ian’s evidence. He described his relationship with Patterson as “more like acquaintances” and said they did not see each other frequently. Patterson agrees and says they mainly saw each other at church. Asked about Ian’s evidence that Heather and Patterson were not close, she says “that’s probably fair”. Patterson agrees Heather and Ian had not been to her house before as a couple. She says Heather had been to her house before. Rogers asks why she invited Heather and Ian to the fateful lunch on 29 July 2023. Patterson says there were a “few reasons”: Ian had been my pastor for years and years and I would see and speak with Ian and Heather a lot after church and I really liked them ... I wanted to have a stronger relationship with them. She recalls Gail telling her, while at Patterson’s Leongatha home in June, that Heather would love to see her garden. She says: And I thought, oh it’s a great opportunity to invite Heather and Ian the next time I have Don and Gail for lunch. Patterson becomes teary as she says she wanted to “say thank you for being good to me over the years”. She continues: Heather helped me a lot when [my daughter] was little... I was shy and I didn’t really know many people. Heather would sit with me ... Patterson reaches for a tissue. Patterson rejects suggestion she did not ask how unwell Don and Gail Wilkinson were in phone call on 30 July Rogers asks about Simon’s evidence about a phone call with Patterson the day after the lunch – 30 July 2023. Patterson rejects Rogers’ suggestion that she never asked how unwell Don and Gail were at this point. Rogers says she suggests Patterson didn’t love Don and Gail and that they took Simon’s side in their child support dispute. “That’s not true,” Patterson says. Rogers says those feelings continued. “Incorrect,” Patterson says. Rogers says Patterson had “two faces”. She says Patterson had a “public face of appearing to have a good relationship with Don and Gail” which she showed to people like Simon and his siblings. Patterson says: “I had a good relationship with Don and Gail.” Rogers says: “I suggest your private face was the one you showed in your Facebook messenger use. Correct or incorrect?” “Incorrect,” Patterson replies. Rogers presses further: “And how you truly felt about Don and Gail was how you expressed it in your Facebook messages ...” “Incorrect,” Patterson says. A visibly upset Patterson is biting her lower lip. Patterson agrees it was ‘unusual’ to have lunch guests Rogers says Cripps testified that Patterson told her she had a good relationship with Don and Gail but felt “isolated” from her in-laws recently. Patterson says it is likely she said this. She says she told Cripps they treated her like a “daughter”, not a “daughter-in-law”. Rogers takes Patterson to the evidence ofProf Rhonda Stuart, a doctor at Monash hospital. Stuart testified that while in hospital Patterson told her having lunch with Simon’s relatives was not “unusual”. Rogers asks if it was “unusual” for Patterson to invite people to her house for lunch at this time. “Yes, that’s probably true,” Patterson says. Rogers says the fateful lunch was a “special” meal. Patterson agrees she wanted it to be a special meal. Patterson says she has no memory of having a conversation with Stuart. Patterson says she cannot remember telling child protection worker about not being invited to family events Rogers says child protection workerKatrina Crippsgave evidence on 1 August 2023 Patterson said she “loved Don and Gail” and had a good relationship with her in-laws until recently. Patterson agrees. Cripps said Patterson also told her that since the relationship with Simon had changed she thought he was isolating her from his family. Patterson says she “probably did tell her that”. Cripps said Patterson told her she was no longer invited to the family events she would normally attend. Patterson says she “thinks” Cripps is wrong as she cannot specifically remember saying this. Rogers takes Patterson to a discussion she and Simon had on 1 August 2023 while at Monash hospital. Patterson said Simon asked her if she had used a dehydrator to poison his parents. Patterson told the court earlier this week this conversation caused her to reflect on “what might have happened”. Patterson agrees on this date she realised foraged mushrooms may have been in a Tupperware container storing store-bought mushrooms and used in the beef wellingtons. Rogers says she never told a medical professional or anyone else that foraged mushrooms may have been used in the meal. Patterson agrees. Rogers says Patterson’s realisation on 1 August 2023 was days before anyone had died. Patterson agrees she did not tell anyone about her realisation after this date. Rogers says after her realisation, Patterson disposed of the dehydrator. Patterson agrees. Regarding the lunch invitation, Patterson says: My memory is I said to him [Simon] something like: there’s some medical stuff I’ll talk to you about then. Patterson says she did not tell Simon she needed advice on how to break it to the children. Rogers takes Patterson back to the message she sent Simon the day before the lunch, saying that she would not be able to host a “lunch like this again for some time”. Patterson agrees this phrase was a reference to medical issues. Rogers says Patterson lied to Simon on 16 July 2023 when she said she had some medical issues to discuss. “No, that wasn’t a lie,” Patterson says. Patterson says she was planning to have gastric bypass surgery for weight loss. Patterson says she had a pre-surgery appointment booked for this at the Enrich clinic in Melbourne. She says she does not remember the date of this appointment. Rogers says she will return to this topic later. Rogers says Patterson did not want her children to be present at the lunch so they would not eat the meal she was planning to serve her lunch guests. “No, that’s not true,” Patterson says. Rogers shows the court a message Simon sent on 28 July 2023 – the day prior to the lunch. In it, Simon says he feels “too uncomfortable” to attend the lunch but is happy to discuss Patterson’s “health” and the “implications” of it. Rogers says Simon’s reference to Patterson’s health is a direct reference to her telling him on 16 July 2023 that she had important medical news. “I disagree,” Patterson replies. In Patterson’s reply, she said Simon declining the lunch invite was disappointing. She said she may not be able to host a lunch like this “for a long time”. Rogers says Patterson wrote those words to make it seem like the “medical issue was the reason”. She says Patterson was “purporting” to refer to the medical issues she told him about on 16 July 2023. Patterson says she did tell Simon on 16 July 2023 that she wanted to discuss medical things at the lunch. Patterson says in her earlier evidence, she was rejecting that the medical issue was “important” and that she needed advice on how to break it to the children. “I wasn’t after advice,” she says. Patterson says she did want to discuss medical advice but it was not the “purpose” of the lunch. She says: I can’t remember the precise words but all I can tell you is it was not why I was inviting him.",

    "article_text": "Police allege Pheobe Bishop’s housemates moved her body twice after murdering her, with investigations indicating the missing 17-year-old is in a national park. The housemates allegedly murdered the missing teenager before moving her body from a national park, police say. James Wood, 34, and Tanika Bromley, 33, will remain behind bars after their matters appeared in Bundaberg Magistrates Court in southernQueensland. They have been charged with murder and two counts each of interfering with a corpse. They have been remanded in custody ahead of their next court appearance on 11 August. The arrests came three weeks to the day after Pheobe missed a flight and vanished. Pheobe’s remains were yet to be located, police said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email A police search will focus on locating Pheobe’s remains after resuming on Friday, with investigations indicating she may be in a national park near Bundaberg. “Whilst we always hoped to find Pheobe alive, our investigation ... quite clearly showed us that that was not going to be a viable outcome,” Detective Inspector Craig Mansfield said. Police allege Wood and Bromley drove Pheobe in a grey Hyundai ix35 to Airport Drive in Bundaberg but no one exited the car. Pheobe was allegedly murdered and her body was moved more than once from the Good Night Scrub national park, an hour’s drive from Bundaberg airport. Police had searched the park extensively during their investigation into Pheobe’s disappearance, saying evidence may have been moved from the national park before officers arrived. Items were seized during the search for forensic information. Pheobe’s remains are yet to be located but police suspect they are in the national park, Mansfield told reporters on Friday. “We’re back to a particular area where we are suspecting that we may locate Pheobe, but again, it is a broad, unforgiving, large area,” he said. Telephone data led police to focus on the national park with search operations restarting on Friday after efforts were scaled back on Wednesday. “We hope that we’ll have a resolution over the coming days,” Mansfield said. Police also believe they understand the motive for Pheobe’s murder. “We do have information that would suggest some form of motivation,” Mansfield said. Wood’s SUV was seized by police for forensic examination on Thursday night. He has been living in the vehicle after the Gin Gin property he shared with Bromley and Pheobe was declared a crime scene after the teenager’s disappearance. “There is a vehicle that we believe Pheobe was transported in, but I will not disclose that at this point in time,” Mansfield said. Mansfield said he shared the devastation Pheobe’s mother, Kylie Johnson, was experiencing. “Whilst we always hoped to find Pheobe alive, our investigation as it progressed quite clearly showed us that that was not going to be a viable outcome,” he said. Wood had previously been taken into custody on Wednesday but was released several hours later without charge. Wood and Bromley had earlier been charged with unrelated weapons offences. Police allegedly found a shortened firearm, ammunition and two replica handguns during a search of Bromley’s grey Hyundai ix35 and further ammunition in the pair’s Gin Gin home. Mansfield said he could not speculate until Pheobe’s body was found on whether the weapons located were used in her murder. Johnson said on Thursday night her family had been “shattered”. Johnson had been posting on social media almost every day since her daughter’s “suspicious” disappearance, pleading for information. “Our world has just been shattered into the most horrific place I’ve ever been,” she wrote on Thursday night. “I need my baby home to put her to rest! I’m absolutely begging anyone that knows anything to come forward. “We need to put her to rest, we need to put her to peace.” Wood and Bromley were due to appear in Bundaberg magistrates court on Friday.",

    "title": "Russia mounts deadly barrage of Kyiv after vowing revenge for Ukraine attack on bomber fleet",
    "article_text": "Russia mounted an intense and sustained barrage of Kyiv overnight, with missiles and drones targeting the Ukrainian capital where there was a succession of large explosions, Reuters reporters in the city said. By daybreak on Friday, authorities in Kyiv reported that four people were killed and 20 people had been wounded, of whom 16 had been hospitalised. “Four people have been confirmed dead in the capital. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at several locations,” mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram. Operation of the city’s metro transport system was disrupted because a Russian strike had hit and damaged a train between stations, the city’s military administration said. The air attack also triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city, authorities said. The attack came after Russiavowed to take revengeon Ukraineafter a drone attack on the country’s bomber fleet. Earlier in the night, as the attacks came in, Reuters reporters could hear the sound of Russian kamikaze drones buzzing in the sky, accompanied by the sounds of outgoing fire from Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. Reuters witnesses reported a series of booming explosions powerful enough to rattle windows far from the impact site, and at least one large fire at the site of a drone hit. Ukraine’s air force said the city had been targeted with drones and Kalibr cruise missiles. Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city, where he said emergency power cuts were possible. One unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze. Tkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. He said drone fragments had been spotted in three districts. In one of the most audacious attacks of the war between Ukraine and Russia, Ukrainian spies last weekend destroyed some of Russia’s strategic bomber aircraft on the ground using quadrocopter drones hidden in wooden sheds. US President Donald Trump said after a phone conversation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that the Kremlin was planning an unspecified response to the Ukrainian attack on Russian airbases. On Thursday, Trump said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia“fight for a while”rather than pursue peace immediately. Trump voiced doubts about the potential success of peace talks, saying “sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart”. The US president said he had toldPutinthat the two countries were like “two young children fighting like crazy in a park” when the two spoke by phone on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Russia attacks Ukraine with missiles and drones – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed See all our Ukraine war coverage We’re about to wrap up this live coverage for now – thanks for reading. Here’s a recap of what happened this morning. Russia attacked Ukraine with Russian ballistic missiles and dronesduring a nighttime attack early on Friday, wounding at least three people, officials said. Multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv,the capital, and falling debris triggered fires across several districts as air defence systems tried to intercept incoming targets, said the Kyiv city administration’s head, Tymur Tkachenko. Authorities reported damage in several districtsand rescue workers were responding at multiple locations. Officials urged residents to seek shelter. The attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorismover its drone operationstriking Russian heavy bomber planesat air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it would respond as and when its military saw fit. In Friday’s Russian attacks a fire broke out in a 16-story residential building in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi districtand emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment. Rescue operations were continuing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse. A Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, shattering windows and doors, the regional military administration chief said. Explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the city’s outskirts, Dmytro Bryzhynskyi added. US president Donald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliatingbut fully expected Moscow to strike back over Ukraine’s assault on Russian heavy bomber planes. And in otherUkrainedevelopments: The UN nuclear safety watchdog’s team at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfirethat appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site’s training centre, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said. German chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Trump in an Oval Office meeting to increase pressure on Russiato end the war. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to “unconditionally support” Russiain the war at a meeting with top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu, Pyongyang state media reported.With agencies Looking back at the lead-up to Russia’s assault on Ukraine this morning, Moscow had vowed to respond to Ukraine’sdrone operation“how and when” it saw fit, amid reports thatVladimir Putinhad toldDonald TrumpthatMoscow was obliged to retaliate. Ukraine had been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials,Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer have reported. The Kremlin spokesperson,Dmitry Peskov, was asked on Thursday what Moscow’s response would be and said: How and when our military deems it appropriate. Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him during their unannounced call on Wednesday thatRussiawould respond to the recent attacks on its airfields. The US embassy inUkrainewarned of a continuing risk of “significant airstrikes” and advised its citizens to exercise caution. Hours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine, killing at least five people in the northern city of Pryluky. Ballistics missiles are also involved in Russia’s ongoing attack on Kyiv and at least three people have been wounded, officials say. “Our air defense crews are doing everything possible,”Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city administration, said on Telegram. “But we must protect one another — stay safe.” Authorities reported damage in several districts and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations, the Associated Press reports. Local officials urged residents to seek shelter. In Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse. In northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chiefDmytro Bryzhynskyi. He added that explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the outskirts of the city. Images have started arriving of people taking shelter in Kyiv amid the Russian drone assault on the capital. Russian drones approached Kyiv in waves and air defence units were attempting to repel them, the head of the city’s military administration said. Tymur Tkachenkolater warned of a risk of ballistic missiles being deployed against the capital, Reuters reports. He said Russia’s drone attack on Kyiv early on Friday triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city Tkachenko said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city, where he said emergency power cuts were possible.

Drone fragments had been spotted in three districts, he said. Welcome to today’s live coverage of the war inUkraine, where the capital is under attack from Russian drones early and authorities say drone fragments have fallen in different parts of the city. Witnesses reported a series of explosions in Kyiv, with one of them reporting a large fire at a site where one drone had fallen. “Enemy drones are approaching one after the other on approaches to the capital from different directions and in the city’s airspace,”Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. The attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism over its daring drone operationstriking Russian heavy bomber planesat air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it it would respond as and when its military saw fit. Donald Trumpsaid that during a call withVladimir Putinon Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating, but fully expected Moscow to strike back. “It’s probably not going to be pretty. I don’t like it,” said Trump, who described what he called “great hatred” between Putin and Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyy. Tkachenko said on Friday that in Kyiv drone fragments had been spotted in three districts on opposite sides of the Dnipro River that bisects the city. One drone had fallen on a building, he said, and details on damage and possible casualties were being collated. In other key developments: The IAEA’s team at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfirethat appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site’s training centre, the head of the UN’s nuclear safety watchdog said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said. Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukrainehours after Trump and Putin spoke on Wednesday. At least five people – including a one-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother – were killed when a drone struck a residential building in the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky.

    "title": "The Swiss village buried by a glacier collapse – podcast",
    "article_text": "The Swiss village of Blatten was wiped out in seconds. A glacier collapsed above the village on 28 May, triggering a landslide. The 300 residents had been evacuated a week earlier, but a 64-year-old man who is believed to have stayed is missing. Tess McClure, the Guardian’s commissioning editor for theAge of Extinction, reported on the aftermath. “The Birch glacier, which sits above Blatten, is this ancient slab of ice,” she tellsHelen Pidd. “It had been loaded up with rocks and debris from the mountain above and just gave way and crumbled. “The millions of tonnes of rock, enormous chunks of ice, all of the mud and trees and debris that it had swept up along the way, all of that just fell down the mountain on to Blatten village.” It will take time for scientists to determine the role that the climate crisis may have played in the collapse, but Tess explains why global heating will make events like this more common. “What we can say is, basically, climate change is affecting all of the ingredients for a disaster like this. So we’re seeing glaciers around the world melt at an incredible rate. They’re shrinking, they’re cracking, they’re growing more unstable. “We’re also seeing permafrost and ice, which in an environment like this is just the glue that holds parts of the earth, parts of the mountain, is kind of holding it all together, that permafrost is also melting. “And we also know that climate change, higher temperatures and mountains are linked, from scientific studies, to higher rates of rockfall and higher rates of that kind of disintegration. So we can’t sort of say yes, the Birch glacier was climate change and climate change alone, but we can look at all of these factors, and all of them are related to global heating.” Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod",

    "title": "Trump travel ban comes as little surprise amid barrage of draconian restrictions",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s first travel ban in 2017 had an immediate, explosive impact – spawning chaos at airports nationwide. This time around, thepanic and chaoswas already widespread by the time the president signed his proclamation Wednesday to fully or partially restrict foreign nationals from 19 countries from entering the United States. Since being sworn in for his second term, Trump has unleashed a barrage of draconian immigration restrictions. Within hours of taking office, the president suspended the asylum system at the southern border as part of hiswide-ranging immigration crackdown. His administration has ended temporary legal residency for 211,000 Haitians, 117,000 Venezuelans and 110,000 Cubans, and moved to revoke temporary protected status for several groups of immigrants. It has moved to restrict student visas and root out scholars who have come to the US legally. “It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” said Faisal Al-Juburi of the Texas-based legal non-profit Raices, which was among several immigrants’ rights groups that challenged Trump’s first travel ban. “And that’s kind of the point. It’s creating layers and layers of restrictions.” Trump’s first travel ban in January 2017, issued days after he took office, targeted the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. The order came as a shock – including to many administration officials. Customs and Border Protection officials were initially given little guidance on how to enact the ban. Lawyers and protesters rushed to international airports where travellers were stuck in limbo. Confusion spread through colleges and tech companies in the US, and refugee camps across the world. This time, Trump’s travel ban came as no surprise. He had cued up the proclamation in anexecutive ordersigned on 20 January, his first day back in the White House, instructing his administration to submit a list of candidates for a ban by 21 March. Though he finally signed a proclamation enacting the ban on Wednesday, it will not take effect until 9 June – allowing border patrol officers and travellers a few days to prepare. The ban includes several exemptions, including for people with visas who are already in the United States, green-card holders, dual citizens and athletes or coaches traveling to the US for major sporting events such as the World Cup or the Olympics. It also exempts Afghans eligible for thespecial immigrant visa programfor those who helped the US during the war in Afghanistan. But the policy, which is likely to face legal challenges, will undoubtedly once again separate families and disproportionately affect people seeking refuge from humanitarian crises. “This is horrible, to be clear … and it’s still something that reeks of arbitrary racism and xenophobia,” Al-Juburi said. “But this does not yield the type of chaos that January 2017 yielded, because immigration overall has been upended to such a degree that the practice of immigration laws is in a state of chaos.” In his second term, Trump has taken unprecedented steps to tear down legal immigration. He has eliminated the legal status of thousands of international students and instructed US embassies worldwide to stop scheduling visa interviews as it prepares to ramp up social media vetting for international scholars. The administration has arrested people at immigration check-ins, exiled asylum seekers to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, and detained scholars and travellers at airports without reason. Although Trump’s travel ban excludes green-card holders, his Department of Homeland Security has made clear that it can and will revoke green cards as it sees fit – including in the cases of student activists Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “The first Muslim ban was very targeted, it was brutal, it was immediate, and it was massive,” said Nihad Awad, the executive director at the Council on American–Islamic Relations. “Now, the administration is not only targeting nations with certain religious affiliations, but also people of color overall, people who criticise the US government for its funding of the genocide in Gaza.” And this new travel ban comes as many families are still reeling and recovering from Trump’s first ban. “We’re looking at, essentially, a ban being in place potentially for eight out of 12 years,” said Ryan Costello, policy director at the National Iranian American Council. “And even in that period where the Biden administration lifted the ban, it was still very hard for Iranians to get a visa.” Iranian Americans who came to the US fleeing political persecution back home, who couldn’t return to Iran, have in some cases been unable to see their parents, siblings or other loved ones for years. “You want your parents to be able to come for the birth of a child, or to come to your wedding,” Costello said. “So this is a really hard moment for so many families. And I think unfortunately, there’s much more staying power for this ban.” Experts say the new ban is more likely to stand up to legal challenges as his first ban. It also doesn’t appear to have registered the same intense shock and outrage, culturally. “The first time, we saw this immediate backlash, protests at airports,” said Costello. “Now, over time, Trump has normalized this.”",

    "title": "Noblewoman may have ordered brazen murder of priest outside St Paul’s in 1337",
    "article_text": "Almost 700 years ago, in a busy London street in the shadow of St Paul’s Cathedral, a priest called John Ford wasbrazenly stabbed to deathin a crime notable both for its public nature and its ferocity. It was early evening, just after vespers on 4 May 1337, and the street in Westcheap would have been bustling with passersby. In full view of them all, one man sliced Ford’s throat with an anelace, a foot-long dagger, while two others used long knives to stab him in the belly. Was someone trying to make a very public example of the victim? An investigation quickly named the killers and the person who ordered the slaying – a wealthy noblewoman called Ela FitzPayne, whose husband had appointed the dead priest to his village parish in Dorset. No explanation was offered, however, and only one man, a former servant of FitzPayne’s, was ever convicted of the crime. Seven centuries later, documents unearthed by a leading Cambridge university academic have pointed to what he believes is a likely motive. According toProf Manuel Eisner, director of the university’s Institute of Criminology, the records suggest the murder was a revenge killing ordered by the noblewoman on the man who had once been her lover and her collaborator in an earlier violent raid on a Benedictine priory. A letter found by the academic shows that FitzPayne had been denounced to the archbishop of Canterbury for multiple acts of adultery, including with Ford, and ordered to perform years of humiliating penance – an instruction she flagrantly ignored. Eisner believes the document implies Ford was the informant – and the murder was her revenge. “The record suggests a tale of shakedowns, sex and vengeance that expose tensions between the church and England’s elites,” says Eisner. The murder, he believes, was “a mafia-style assassination of a fallen man of God by a gang of medieval hitmen” that FitzPayne may have intended as a brutal show of strength against both Ford and the clerical establishment. The Ford case is one of hundreds of 14th-century murders in London, York and Oxford that have been collated by Eisner into an online resource calledMedieval Murder Maps. A new paper, co-authored by Eisner and published on Friday in the journalCriminal Law Forum, highlights the crime hotspots of the three medieval cities. For the academic, who also works on present-day crime prevention strategies, there are similarities to modern crime patterns and important differences. “Violent hotspots tend to concentrate around the crossroads and arteries of public activities, both in medieval cities 700 years ago and in modern cities. Where there are lots of people in taverns or bars, there is lots of potential for conflict.” That hasn’t changed, he says, but one thing has. While modern crime hotspots are disproportionately found in disadvantaged neighbourhoods, in medieval times it was the richer neighbourhoods where violent crime was more likely to happen. In some cases, Eisner says, the prestige of the address itself appears to have been central to the crime’s purpose. “These are theatrical acts, where the revenge isn’t just [a crime] against the individual victim. The revenge is something that people are intended to see. And I think that’s exactly what is happening in the case of Ela FitzPayne.” As a medieval woman who raided priories, openly defied the clerical authorities and ordered the assassination of a priest, “Ela FitzPayne appears to have been many things, including an extraordinary person,” he said.",

    "title": "EHRC commissioner calls for trans people to accept reduced rights after years of ‘lies’",
    "article_text": "Transgender people must accept a reduction in their rights after the supreme court decision on gender because they “have been lied to over many years” about what their rights actually were, one of the commissioners drawing up the official post-ruling guidance has said. Speakingat a debateabout the repercussions of April’sruling that “woman” in the Equality Act refers only to a biological woman, Akua Reindorf said trans people had been misled about their rights and there “has to be a period of correction”. Reindorf, a barrister who is one ofeight commissionersat the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), who was speaking in a personal capacity, said she believes the fault lay with trans lobbyists. However, the human rights campaign groups Liberty and Amnesty called on the EHRC to make sure the rights of trans people were properly considered when it draws up guidance for public bodies on how to implement the changed legal landscape. A director of the trans campaign group TransActual said Reindorf’s remarks were profoundly unhelpful. Speaking at the event, organised by the London School of Economics law school, Reindorf argued that the impact of the ruling was very clear, condemning what she called “this huge farce with organisations up and down the country wringing their hands and creating working groups and so on, and people in society worrying that they will have nowhere to go to the toilet”. Asked by an audience member about worries the ruling could reduce the rights of trans people, another panellist, the barrister Naomi Cunningham, said trans people “will have to give way”, adding: “It can’t be helped, I’m afraid.” Reindorf, speaking next, agreed: “Unfortunately, young people and trans people have been lied to over many years about what their rights are. It’s like Naomi said – I just can’t say it in a more diplomatic way than that. They have been lied to, and there has to be a period of correction, because other people have rights.” Reindorf said her comments reflected the fact that before the ruling, the law had been commonly misunderstood because pressure groups argued that trans people who self-identified should be treated as their identified sex, when this was in fact just the case for people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC). The supreme court decided that this mix of different rights made the Equality Act unworkable, said Reindorf, speaking in a personal capacity. She called this “the catalyst for many to catch up, belatedly, with the fact that the law never permitted self-ID in the first place”. “The fact is that, until now, trans people without GRCs were being grievously misled about their legal rights,” she said. “The correction of self-ID policies and practices will inevitably feel like a loss of rights for trans people. This unfortunate position is overwhelmingly a product of the misinformation which was systematically disseminated over a long period by lobby groups and activists.” In April, the EHRC releasedinterim, non-statutory adviceabout how to interpret the ruling, which set out that transgender people should not be allowed to use toilets of the gender they live as, and that in some cases they cannot use toilets of their birth sex. A number of critics have called the advice oversimplistic. Chiara Capraro, head of gender justice at Amnesty International UK, said: “The EHRC has the duty to uphold the rights of everyone, including all with protected characteristics. We are concerned that it is failing to do so and is unhelpfully pitting the rights of women and trans people against each other.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Akiko Hart, Liberty’s director, said: “Any updated guidance from the EHRC must respect and uphold the rights of everyone in society. The supreme court’s judgment was very narrow, and there are a lot of very legitimate questions about how it’s implemented that must be carefully considered.” A director of the trans campaign group TransActual,jane fae, rejected Reindorf’s argument: “The characterisation of what was previously a widely held view both by the EHRC as well as by civil servants and lawyers working in the field of equality as ‘lying’ is profoundly unhelpful. “Prior to the ruling of the supreme court in April, trans people just wanted to live their lives within the framework as it was understood. ‘Activism’ has only really come into being over the last few years in response to a never-ending campaign designed to deprive trans people of rights.” A spokesperson for the EHRC said: “Akua Reindorf KC spoke at this event in a personal capacity. This was made clear at the event and in the video recording published online. “As Britain’s equality regulator, the Equality and Human Rights Commission upholds and enforces the Equality Act 2010 to ensure everyone is treated fairly, consistent with the act. “Our board come from all walks of life and bring with them a breadth of skills and experience. This helps us take impartial decisions, which are always based on evidence and the law.”",

    "title": "Sports Direct pricing practices ‘may be breaking the law’, Which? says",
    "article_text": "Sports Direct could be breaking the law by misleading shoppers into thinking they are getting a good deal, a consumer body has claimed, after it looked at prices of items ranging from trainers to hoodies. Which? said it had reported the retailer to the Competition and Markets Authority after uncovering what it claimed were “some questionable and dodgy pricing tactics” on its website. The organisation said it had found products being sold on SportsDirect.com with recommended retail prices (RRPs) “that appear to be misleading”, as its researchers could not find the products sold at that RRP price anywhere else online. It meant people may be being misled “into thinking they are getting a better deal than they really are”. A spokesperson said it believed the practices it had uncovered “may be breaking the law”. Which? said that after being alerted to “suspicious” RRPs by some readers, it examined the pricing of 160 products on the website of the firm, which is part ofFrasers Group, the retail empire controlled by Mike Ashley. The group has a large portfolio of brands under its umbrella, including Jack Wills, Slazenger, Karrimor, Everlast and Lonsdale. Frasers Group also owns several retailers, including USC, Studio and Get the Label, which sometimes appeared to be the only sellers of these particular brands, said the consumer body. According to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), shoppers understand the RRP to be the price an item is generally sold at. This meant shoppers might think the Sports Direct price was “a great deal” compared with the “normal” price across the market, said Which? It added that it found examples of products where the researchers could not find any other online retailer selling them at or above the Sports Direct reference price, “leading researchers to question if these were in fact genuine”. For example, a Jack Wills hoodie was selling for £24 and had a “manufacturer suggested retail price” (MSRP) of £54.99. Which? said MSRP was an obscure term that it believed could be interpreted as being the same as RRP. Jack Wills is part of Frasers Group, and the researchers could not find that particular hoodie sold or supplied by anyone other than Frasers Group retailers, said Which?. It was £40 on Amazon – supplied by Sports Direct – but all the other retailers were selling it for £24. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Another example involved a pair of Slazenger men’s tennis shoes selling on SportsDirect.com for £32.99 – nearly half the MSRP of £64.99. Slazenger is also owned by the parent group. Which? said it found the trainers for sale on eight other websites, “but the owner or seller was always part of the parent company”. Seven retailers sold them for either £32.99 or £33. Only one retailer, Slazenger itself, sold them at the MSRP. ASA rules state that “if a marketer is the only seller of a product, and so has set the price themselves, it is unlikely to be acceptable to refer to the price as an RRP”. However, Which? said it was unclear whether that applied where the only sellers were members of the same group. Sports Direct was approached by the Guardian for comment. Which? said the company did not provide it with a comment for publication.",

    "title": "‘Stress crisis’ in UK as 5m struggle with financial, health and housing insecurity",
    "article_text": "More than 5 million UK adults are experiencing a triple whammy of financial, health and housing insecurity as British households hit levels of “multi-stress” not seen since the global economic crash well over a decade ago, research shows. One in 10 working-age adults are juggling low income and debt, insecure tenancies and high rents, and problems accessingNHScare. They are at least twice as likely as the rest of the population to report mental stress, sleeplessness and isolation. Researchers said the explosion in multiple insecurity amounted to a “national stress crisis”, with those affected experiencing heightened volatility and uncertainty in their lives and profound feelings of powerlessness and lack of control. The analysis highlights the rise in the number of people experiencing a combination of three separate categories of insecurity to map the extent to which people have the capacity to enjoy a good quality of life, materially and psychologically. Becky Tunstall, a co-author of the research and LSE visiting professor, said the findings represented a challenge to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to help millions of people who struggle to pay bills and access public services, and who feel their lives are on hold. Tunstall said there was very likely to be a link between the rise in multiple insecurities and the increase in voter dissatisfaction with mainstream politicians and support for populist parties such as Reform. “The last time people were under this much pressure was at the peak of the global financial crisis. Now we’re having a national stress crisis. People in all walks of life need urgent and substantial change to take some pressure off,” Tunstall said. “Over 5 million people are under stress from financial problems, housing problems and health problems all at the same time. Three million of them feel constantly under strain; two and a half million are having problems sleeping.” Reeves has previously talked of an“age of insecurity”and has propounded a philosophy of “securonomics”, which involves policies designed to deliver growth through delivering good jobs, strong public services and an end to rising prices. A year into government, Labour has struggled to meet many voters’ expectations of rapid change after years of austerity cuts and falling living standards, despite plans tobuild more housing,cut NHS waiting lists, invest inpublic transportandtackle child poverty. The research says while economic growth is a priority it must be paired with measures to reduce “volatility and uncertainty” in people’s lives, through policies such as scrapping the two-child limit on benefits, investing in public services and expanding Citizens Advice-style support services. The research, which was commissioned under the previous government as part of its levelling up policy, analysed the latestUnderstanding Societyhousehold research data alongside in-depth interviews with people in Sheffield, Milton Keynes and Lincolnshire. One interviewee told researchers: “I would love to be in a place where I could feel safe and feel just content that I don’t have to worry about paying the rent or buying food and we could live a healthy lifestyle in a safe place.” For many research participants, multiple insecurity brought a heightened sense of “life put on hold”, often triggered by long waits for NHS appointments orhome repairs, and a sense of powerlessness in dealings with remote and hard-to-navigate public service bureaucracies. Although 9% of UK working-age adults as a whole experienced combined financial, health and housing insecurities, some groups had much higher rates, such as 32% for people with a disability or long-term illness. People from minority ethnic groups were also more likely to be multiply insecure. While employment offered some protection against insecurity and stress, 41% of people in work were financially insecure, 31% were health insecure and 30% housing insecure. Seven per cent of people in work experienced a combination of all three. A government spokesperson said it was committed to driving up living standards and had increased the national minimum wage and uprated benefits. “We are also reforming the NHS to get it back on its feet and cutting waiting lists by delivering an extra 3m appointments since July and have committed to the biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation,” they said.",

    "title": "Scottish Labour win pivotal Holyrood byelection, beating incumbent SNP and surging Reform UK",
    "article_text": "Scottish Labour is celebrating an “incredible” win in a pivotal Holyrood byelection, beating the incumbent SNP and fighting off Reform UK’s “racist” campaigning, in a result that confounded predictions and will boost the party ahead of next year’s Scottish parliamentary elections. Voters in the central Scotland seat of Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse rallied round the popular local candidate Davy Russell after a toxic campaign that saw Nigel Farage launch an unprecedented series of personal attacks on Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, labelled racist by SNP leaderJohn Swinney. In his acceptance speech, Russell told jubilant supporters: “This community has sent a message to Farage and his mob: the poison of Reform isn’t us, it isn’tScotlandand we don’t want your division here.” The Nationalists had been the clear favourites to hold the seat after a fiercely contested campaign called after the sudden death of popular SNP MSP Christina McKelvie from breast cancer, but were beaten into second place, with Reform UK following closely in third. As Reform UK seemingly gained ground from both the SNP and ScottishLabourin recent weeks, speculation grew that they might push Sarwar’s party into third place. But in the end, with a reasonably high turnout for a byelection of 44.2%, Scottish Labour reaped the rewards of their highly targeted campaigning and well organised get-out-the-vote operation to pull off an unexpected victory, winning with 8,559 votes. The SNP’s Katy Loudon came second with 7957 votes, only narrowly beating Reform UK’s Ross Lambie on 7888. The Scottish Conservatives were left trailing on 1621 votes. A buoyant Sarwar said it was “an incredible night” having proven the pundits, pollsters and bookies wrong. He told reporters that voters had sent three strong messages: “First, people want a UK Labour government to go further and faster in improving their lives and I think that’s a clear message to them”. “Secondly, they’ve had enough of this SNP government: after 18 years they’ve let communities around the country down.” “Third, they’ve rejected the politics Nigel Farage and Reform and today the people and Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse have laid the first stone in the pathway to a Scottish Labour government next year.” Asked about the increasingly personal attacks he endured during the campaign, Sarwar said “Nigel Farage looks at someone like me and it goes against his values and it makes him angry. What the vast majority of people in Scotland see is someone who is one of their own, is a Scot and is working hard to change the country”. Reform UK’s Richard Tice, who attended the count, insisted that his party was “thrilled to bits” with the result, and that third place still represented “a massive boost” for the party, which has gained momentum in Scotland since the general election. The SNP contingent left the count speedily after the results announcement, with party leader and first minister John Swinney later applauding Loudon for her “superb campaign” on X, adding “We have made progress since the election last year but not enough. We still have work to do and we will do it.” In 2021, McKelvie won with a majority of 4,582, with Labour winning the corresponding Westminster seat with ease in last year’s general election, but on the doorstep voters voiced discontent with both the SNP government at Holyrood and the Labour government at Westminster. Scottish Labour canvassers worked hard throughout the campaign to counter the major dissatisfaction with UK Labour policies they encountered. “Winter fuel payment comes up on every door,” said one senior figure mid-campaign. But speaking to the Guardian in the final phase of the campaign, senior Labour sources said that – while their canvassing showed more people were saying they would vote Reform than ever before – they remained confident in their strong ground operation with targeted leaflets and targeted ads on Facebook and YouTube. Some voters have been visited four times by Labour canvassers as well as Westminster and Holyrood politicians who visited the constituency throughout the campaign.“I think we have the better field operation and we’ve been around people’s doors. We’re hungry for the votes and people see that,” they said. Sarwar’s decision to directly accuse Farage of racism – following a Reform UK advert that incorrectly claimed he had promised to prioritise Pakistani communities and is nowsubject to formal complaints to Meta from Scottish Labour and the SNP– was because he was “really, really angry”, they added.",

President Trump’s signature ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ has precipitated an epic fallout between the US president and one of his once closest allies, tech billionaireElon Musk. The vindictive blowupplayed out publiclyon social media, with both men using their respective platforms, X and Truth Social, to exchange criticisms. Here is a summary of how the rift unfolded. Donald Trump kicked things off during an Oval Office meeting with German chancellor Friedrich Merz.Asked about Elon Musk’s criticism of his “Big, Beautiful Bill”, the US president told reporters: “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more.” Trump also told reporters he was “very disappointed in Elon”, telling them: “He knew every aspect of this bill.

The president followed up by threatening to terminate Musk’s governmentsubsidies and contracts, prompting a return threat from the Space X boss to decommission theDragon spacecraft(which brought homeastronauts stuck on the ISS for months), potentially throwing US space programmes into turmoil.Hours later Musk rescinded the threat. Musk also suggested Trump should be impeached and that JD Vance should replace Trump, warning that Trump’s global tariffs would “cause a recession in the second half of this year” and claimed Trump was in theJeffrey Epstein files. The White House described the Epstein assertions as an “unfortunate episode”,in a statement to CNN. Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, a longtimeTrumpally and Elon Musk critic, suggested therewere grounds to deport the tech billionaire, who has US citizenship.Bannon told the New York Times: “They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately.” The spectacular blowout between Trump and Musk sent Tesla shares into freefall.Theydropped by about 14.2% on Thursday at market close, wiping roughly $152bn off the value of the compan7.The decline in Tesla’s share price on Thursday knocked about $8.73bn off Musk’s total net worth,according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The reported $152bndropalso decreased the value of the company to roughly $900bn. BillionaireElon Musksaid on Thursday that his rocket companySpaceX will not decommission its Dragon spacecraft, just hours after stating that the company would begin decommissioning amid his escalating feud with US PresidentDonald Trump. A short potted history of the Trump-Musk ‘big, beautiful’ breakup: Many now say it was all inevitable. But as AFP writes, for a few brief months US PresidentDonald Trumpand tech tycoon Elon Musk were inseparable. Here are some key moments compiled by AFP before their relationship publicly imploded over Musk’s criticisms of Trump’s “big, beautiful” signature bill. Jumping on stage The world’s richest man literally jumped for joy when he first stumped for Republican candidate Trump on the campaign trail on 5 October, 2024.The South African-born Musk leapt in the air like one of his Space X rockets as he joined Trump on stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump escaped an assassination attempt three months earlier. “As you can see, I’m not just MAGA, I’m dark MAGA,” Trump told the crowd, tipping his all-black “Make America Great Again” hat. He would go on to become the campaign’s biggest donor, spending nearly $300 million. ‘Lil’ X’ Trump sprung a surprise on reporters when he brought Musk into the Oval Office for his first appearance before the media since his arrival in Washington. Even more surprising was that Musk brought his young son, named X Æ A-Xii but more widely known as “Lil’ X” - later putting him on his shoulders. “This is X and he’s a great guy,” said Trump, as the boy picked his nose while his father boasted about his cost-cutting exploits with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Tensions? What tensions? There were already rumors of tensions between the hard-charging Musk and other members of Trump’s administration when the tycoon attended his first cabinet meeting in February. But Trump moved to squish any suggestions of trouble in paradise. “Anybody unhappy with Elon? If they are, we’ll throw ’em out of here,” said Trump, jumping in after AFP asked Musk whether the reports of strains were true. Sleepovers The president and the tech magnate seemed to spend most of their time together in the first feverish weeks of Trump’s return to power. They traveled together on Air Force One and his Marine One helicopter. Musk slept over at the White House, where he boasted of once eating a whole tub of ice cream. In a display of macho bonding, they also attended mixed martial arts fights together. Tesla showroom Musk’s Tesla car company took a major hit from his bromance with Trump. Trump, knowing that a threat to Musk’s businesses could drive him out of his role, decided to help out. The president turned the White House South Portico into a pop-up Tesla showroom for Musk, with a Cybertruck and a Model S parked outside. Trump even said he had purchased one. Amid speculation about how Musk’s businesses could suffer from the devolving relationship with Trump, NASA press secretary Bethany Stevens declined to comment on SpaceX. But she did say:“We will continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the president’s objectives in space are met.” As Reuters reports, Musk and Trump’s tussle ruptured an unprecedented relationship between a US president and industry titan that had yielded some key favors for SpaceX:a proposed overhaul of NASA’s moon program into a Mars program, a planned effort to build a gigantic missile defense shield in space, and the naming of an Air Force leader who favored SpaceX in a contract award. During the online rift, Musk said he would begin “decommissioning” SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Under a roughly $5 billion contract, the craft has been the agency’s only US vessel capable of carrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station, making Musk’s company a critical element of the US space program. Taking Dragon out of service would likely disrupt the ISS program, which involves dozens of countries under a two-decade-old international agreement. But it was unclear how quickly such a decommissioning would occur. NASA uses Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft as a secondary ride for its astronauts to the ISS. Vice president JD Vance has chimed in on the online spat between President Trump and Musk,posting a picture on Xwith the comedian and podcaster Theo Von and asking: “Slow news day, what are we even going to talk about?” White House press secretaryKaroline Leavitt has given a statement to CNN, describing Elon Musk’s claim that President Donald Trumpis “in the Epstein files”as an “unfortunate episode”. “This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted. The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again,” Leavitt told CNN in a statement. The risk US transportation, environmental, communications and other regulators will take aim at Elon Musk’s many businesses is real, reports Reuters. Below is a quick list of regulators that oversee Musk’s companies. Federal Communications CommissionThe Federal Communications Commission in April voted to open a review of the decades-old spectrum sharing regime between satellite systems sought by SpaceX. SpaceX wants access to new spectrum from the FCC in the coming years to speed deployment of satellite-based internet service. Food and Drug AdministrationThe FDA oversees the clinical trials for Neuralink, Musk’s brain implant company, deciding whether such trials can take place and whether Neuralink can eventually sell its device to consumers. Environmental Protection AgencySpaceX faces environmental regulations from the EPA, which oversees the company’s wastewater discharges at its operating site in Texas. The company’s operations are also subject to environmental reviews. National Highway Traffic Safety AdministrationTesla faces ongoing oversight from US auto safety investigators about the safety of its vehicles especially when using advanced driver assistance systems. Federal Aviation AdministrationIn September, the FAA proposed a $633,000 fine against SpaceX for failing to follow license requirements in 2023 before two launches. That investigation remains open. Federal Trade CommissionThe FTC is a consumer protection agency that ensures social media companies like Musk’s platform X protect children’s privacy and safeguard Americans’ data. The FTC, which also enforces antitrust law, recently opened a probe into coordination between media watchdog groups, some of whom Musk has accused of orchestrating an illegal group advertiser boycott against his social media site. “If you paid attention during physics class you will remember the third law of ego-dynamics. Namely: when two egos of equal mass occupy the same orbit, the system will eventually become unstable, resulting in an explosive separation and some very nasty tweets.” So reads the op-ed by our columnistArwa Mahdawi. Read the full piece below on the “big, beautiful break up”. For Trump, the fight withElon Muskis the first major rift he has had with a top adviser since taking office for a second time, after his first term was marked by numerous blow-ups. Trump parted ways with multiple chiefs of staff, national security advisers and political strategists during his 2017-2021 White House tenure. A few, like Steve Bannon, remained in his good graces, while many others, like Ambassador John Bolton, became loud and vocal critics. Anthony Scaramucci’s tenure in Donald Trump’s White House lasted just 11 days. On Thursday, Scaramucci, who hostsThe Rest Is Politicspodcast with Katty Kay, ran his own take on theTrump-Musk break upon YouTube. “You know I’m a gloater,” he said, “So let’s just get right into it, because I love gloating.” Donald TrumpandElon Muskescalated their disagreement about the US budget bill into a big public argument on social media. Here’s a roundup of key moments so far: Donald Trump kicked things off during an Oval Office meeting with German chancellor Friedrich Merz.Asked about Elon Musk’s criticism of his “Big, Beautiful Bill”, the US president told reporters: “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more.” Trump also told reporters he was “very disappointed in Elon”, telling them: “He knew every aspect of this bill.

The reported $152bndropalso decreased the value of the company to roughly $900bn. The spectacular blowout between Trump and Musk has sent Tesla shares into free-fall. The carmaker’s shares ended the day down 14%, wiping off $150bn in market value on a day absent other news about the company. Investors have watched the unfolding drama with growing concern about what the fracas could mean for Musk’s business empire. Openly feuding with Trump could pose multiple hurdles for Tesla and the rest of Musk’s sprawling business empire, writes Reuters. The US transportation department regulates vehicle design standards and would have a big say in whether Tesla can mass-produce robotaxis without pedals and steering wheels. The agency is also investigating Tesla’s driver-assistance software, known as “Full Self-Driving”, following a fatal crash. “Elon’s politics continue to harm the stock. First he aligned himself with Trump, which upset many potential Democratic buyers. Now he has turned on theTrump administration,” said Tesla shareholder Dennis Dick, chief strategist at Stock Trader Network. It’s just days since the world’s richest person,Elon Musk, officially departed from the White House, but relations withDonald Trumphave radically devolved since. The online war of words between the two men has seen Musk, who has a huge online following, use his influence to run a poll to his 220 million followers on X. “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” he asked. A prolonged feud between Trump and Musk could make it more difficult for Republicans to keep control of Congress in next year’s midterm elections, reports Reuters. In addition to his campaign spending, Musk helped connect Trump to parts of Silicon Valley and wealthy donors. The tech billionaire had already said he planned to curtail his political spending in the future. In an interview with the New York Times, Steve Bannon, a longtimeDonald Trumpally and Elon Musk critic, said about the tech billionaire: They should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien, and he should be deported from the country immediately. While Elon Musk andDonald Trumppubliclytrade barbs, a reminder that this started with a disagreement over Trump’s budget bill. Here’s a quick roundup of some of the key facts on that bill: It would blow the US’s national debt up by $2.4tn over the next decade, according to a congressional budget office analysis Extend tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term Money for mass deportations and a border wall An array of new tax write-offs – but only while Trump is president A potentially potent restriction on federal courts Transformed social safety net programs More benefits for the rich than the poor The end of Biden’s green energy incentives For the full details, click here: In response to a tweetabout howDonald Trumpshould be impeached and that JD Vance should replace Trump, Elon Musk wrote: Yes. Musk also warned that Trump’s global tariffs will “cause a recession in the second half of this year”. The growing divide between Trump and his once closest confidante appears to have no sign of slowing down as the two men continue to take jabs at each other on their respective social media platforms. As Elon Musk andDonald Trumpcontinue to sling accusations at each other on their social media platforms, Jonathan Freedland speaks to Susan Glasser of the New Yorker about what caused it to all fall apart: Donald Trumpwrote on Truth Socialthat Elon Musk should have turned on him “months ago”. The president added: I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!",

    "title": "Eyes on Senate Republicans as Trump and Musk feud over tax and spend bill",
    "article_text": "As the simmering tensions between Donald Trump and his once top adviser, the billionaire Elon Musk,erupted into public view on Thursday, eyes turned to the Republican lawmakers still weighing whether to pass the president’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill”. It was approved by just a single vote in theHouse of Representativeswith no Democratic support last month, and nonpartisan analysts have found the sweeping legislation couldadd a whopping $2.4tn-$5tn to the $36.2tn US national debtand make deep cuts to Medicaid and food-assistance programs. Seen as an outline of Trump’s “America first” agenda, the bill would also extend tax cuts, fund beefed-up immigration enforcement and impose new work requirements for enrollees of federal safety net programs. In a barrage of tweets over its cost, which Musk warned would undo Doge’s efforts to save the government money by cancelling programs and pushing federal workers out of their jobs, the billionaire called on conservatives to withdraw their support for the bill. Along with personal barbs aimed at Trump – including trumpeting support for his impeachment and signaling the president’s ties to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – Musk spent Thursday afternoon re-posting years-old quotes from the House speakerMike Johnsonand the Senate leader John Thune, when the Republican lawmakers spoke critically of federal debt. Musk’s intense withdrawal of support for the administration has magnified a rift in the Republican party that was already threatening the bill’s passage in the Senate. While the Senate’s Republican leaders have shown no indication that they share Musk’s concerns, they are eyeing changes to some aspects of the measure that were the result of hard-fought negotiations in the House, and could throw its prospects into jeopardy. One issue that has reappeared is the deductibility of state and local tax (Salt) payments, which the tax bill passed under Trump in 2017 limited to $10,000 per household. HouseRepublicansrepresenting districts in Democratic-run states that have higher tax burdens managed to get a provision increasing the deduction to $40,000 into the One, Big Beautiful Bill act. But there are almost no Republican senators representing blue states. After meeting with Trump on Wednesday, Thune indicated his lawmakers were not inclined to keep that provision as they negotiate the bill. “We also start from a position that there really isn’t a single Republican senator who cares much about the Salt issue,” he said. “It’s just not an issue that plays.” That could upset the balance of power in the House, where Republicans can lose no more than three votes on any bill that passes along party lines. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, spent weeks negotiating with his fractious Republican majority to get the bill passed narrowly through his chamber, and on Wednesday said he had been trying to speak with Musk about his concerns. In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Thursday, he called the Tesla CEO “a good friend” and said the two had exchanged text messages ahead of a call he expected to take place that morning. “I just want to make sure that he understands what I think everybody on Capitol Hill understands. This is not a spending bill, my friends, this is a budget reconciliation bill. And what we’re doing here is delivering the America first agenda,” Johnson said. “He seems pretty dug in right now, and I can’t quite understand the motivation behind it,” the speaker added. Later in the day, Johnson told reporters at the Capitol that the call did not take place, but that the disagreement “isn’t personal”. On X, Muskpublicly questionedJohnson’s resolve to cut government spending, prompting the speakerto replythat he “has always been a lifelong fiscal hawk”. While the Tesla CEO has focused his complaints on the price tag of the bill, Trump accused him of turning against it because of provisions revoking incentives for consumers to purchase electric vehicles. The president began by saying he was “very disappointed” by the former adviser’s opposition to his top legislative priority, but the online insults escalated after Musk fired back that Trump would not have won election without his financial support. “I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot,” Trump said, adding that “he knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left.” “Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more,” the president said. The falling-out came days after Musk had stepped down as head of Trump’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and then pivoted to attacking the One Big, Beautiful Bill. Musk responded almost immediately on X, saying that the president’s comment was “false”, and “this bill was never shown to me even once”. He then pivoted to personal attacks on Trump, afterpraising him just days earlierin an Oval Office appearance to mark the end of his time leading Doge. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he said, responding to a video of Trump’s remarks. “Such ingratitude.” Gabrielle Canon contributed reporting",

    "title": "UN warns of surge in acute malnutrition among Gaza’s young children",
    "article_text": "More than 2,700 children below the age of five in Gaza have been diagnosed with acutemalnutrition, marking a steep increase in the number of children suffering from the serious medical condition since screening in February, the United Nations reports. Of almost 47,000 under-fives screened for malnutrition in the second half of May, 5.8 percent (or 2,733 children) were found to be suffering from acute malnutrition, “almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition” three months earlier, the UN said on Thursday. The number of children with severe acute malnutrition requiring admission to hospital also increased by around double in May compared with earlier months, according to the report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). According to data from the Nutrition Cluster cited by OCHA, more than 16,500 children below the age of five have been detected and treated for severe acute malnutrition in Gaza since January, including 141 children with complications requiring hospitalisation. Despite the increase in children suffering serious malnutrition and requiring hospitalisation, “there are currently only four stabilisation centres for the treatment of [severe acute malnutrition] with medical complications in the Gaza Strip,” the OCHA report states. “Stabilisation centres in North Gaza and Rafah have been forced to suspend operations, leaving children in these areas without access to lifesaving treatment,” it adds. The UN’s latest warning on the health of young children in Gaza comes as the Palestinian territory’s entire population deals with starvation, and the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the enclave’s “health system is collapsing”. Issuing an appeal for the “urgent protection” of two of Gaza’s last remaining hospitals, the WHO said the “Nasser Medical Complex, the most important referral hospital left in Gaza, and Al-Amal Hospital are at risk of becoming non-functional”. “The relentless and systematic decimation of hospitals in Gaza has been going on for too long.

    "title": "Tech giants see emissions surge 150 percent in 3 years amid AI boom: UN",
    "article_text": "The United Nations’ digital agency says that operational carbon emissions for the world’s top tech companies rose an average of 150 percent between 2020 and 2023 as investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres drove up global electricity demand. Operational emissions for Amazon grew 182 percent in 2023 against 2020 levels, while emissions for Microsoft grew 155 percent, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta grew 145 percent, and Google parent company Alphabet grew 138 percent over the same period, according to the UN’s International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The figures include the emissions directly created by the companies’ operations as well as those from purchased energy consumption. They were included in a new report from ITU assessing the greenhouse gas emissions of the world’s top 200 digital companies between 2020 and 2023. The UN agency linked the sharp uptick to recent breakthroughs in AI and the demand for digital services like cloud computing. “Advances in digital innovation – especially AI – are driving up energy consumption and global emissions,” said Doreen Bogdan-Martin, who heads the ITU. While these innovations mark dramatic technological breakthroughs, left unchecked, emissions from top-emitting AI systems could soon hit 102.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, the agency said. “Currently, there are no standards or legislative requirements for companies to disclose their AI emissions or energy consumption, which makes understanding the impact of AI on company-level energy use less straightforward,” the report said. “However, data from company reports show an increasing trend in operational emissions for companies with a high level of AI adoption.” The AI and cloud computing boom has led to a similar spike in electricity demand from data centres, which help power digital services. Electricity consumption by data centres has grown 12 percent year-on-year since 2017, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Data centres alone consumed 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity – or 1.5 percent of global power demand. If the demand for data centres continues to grow at this pace, it will hit 945 TWh by 2030, surpassing Japan’s annual electricity consumption, according to the IEA. Power-hungry digital companies, meanwhile, consumed an estimated 581 TWh of electricity in 2024, or roughly 2.1 percent of global demand, according to the report, although demand was highly concentrated among top firms. According to data supplied by 164 out of 200 companies in the report, just 10 generated 51.9 percent of their electricity demand in 2023, the report said. They were China Mobile, Amazon, Samsung Electronics, China Telecom, Alphabet, Microsoft, TSMC, China Unicom, SK Hynix and Meta. Publicly available emissions data for 166 out of the 200 companies revealed that they emitted 297 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in 2023, the same as the combined emissions of Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.",

    "title": "Japanese firm declares lunar mission a failure after crash landing",
    "article_text": "A Japanese-made private lunar lander has crashed while attempting to touch down on the moon, with its makers officially declaring the mission a failure. Tokyo-based company ispace said on Friday that its lander, named Resilience, dropped out of lunar orbit as planned and that the mission appeared to be going well. But flight controllers lost contact with Resilience, which was carrying a mini rover, moments before its scheduled touchdown on the surface of the moon following an hourlong descent. Ground support was met with silence as they attempted to regain contact with the lander and after several hours declared the mission a failure. The company’s livestream of the attempted landing then came to an abrupt end. “We have to take seriously what happened,” ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada said after the failed mission, as he apologised to everyone who contributed. This is the firm’s second failed attempt to soft land on the lunar surface, coming two years after the Japanese start-up’s first attempt to reach the moon ended in a crash landing. Launched in December 2022, the firm’s Hakuto-R Mission 1 reached lunar orbit but crashed during its final descent after an error caused the lander to believe it was lower than it actually was. That mission’s successor, Resilience, was launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey. It shared a ride on a SpaceX rocket with Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost, which, uponreaching the moon first in Marchthis year, made the US firm the first private entity to make a “fully successful” soft landing there. The 2.3-metre (7.5-foot) Resilience lander was targeting the top of the moon, where the ispace team had chosen a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold, to land. Resilience was expected to beam back pictures within hours of landing, before ispace’s European-built rover – named Tenacious – would have been lowered onto the lunar surface this weekend. The rover, made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic and sporting a high-definition camera, would then have scouted out the area and scooped up lunar dirt for NASA. Resilience was also carrying a toy-sized red house created by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg. Moonhouse, as the model Swedish-style cottage was called, was intended to be the moon’s first “building”, in a nod to Hakamada’s vision of humans living and working there as early as the 2040s. But ispace’s now second failed landing has left the Japanese entrepreneur’s vision in doubt. The aerospace company’s next, much bigger lander is scheduled to launch by 2027 with NASA’s involvement. Prior to Friday’s failed mission, the Japanese firm’s chief financial officer, Jumpei Nozaki, promised to continue its lunar quest regardless of the outcome. But Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace’s US subsidiary, said at a conference last month that the firm does not have “infinite funds” and cannot afford repeated failures. Company officials said this latest failed mission cost less than the first one – which exceeded $100m – but declined to provide an exact figure.",

    "title": "North Korea raises capsized warship after botched launch: Report",
    "article_text": "North Korea has raiseda capsized warshipand moored it at a port in the country’s northeast for repair, after the vessel was damaged during a failed inaugural launch in May, the country’s state news media reports. KCNA reported that “after restoring the balance of the destroyer early in June, the team moored it at the pier” in the city of Chongjin on Thursday. The report on Friday aligns with South Korea’s military assessments and recent commercial satellite images, which indicated that the 5,000-tonne destroyer has been restored to an upright position following the “serious accident” on May 21, when it suffered damage to its hull after a transport cradle detached prematurely during a launch ceremony. The failed side-launch of the ship, which was witnessed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, also left the vessel partially capsized in a port. Kim described the incident as a“criminal act caused by absolute carelessness”. As part of a probe into the accident, four officials were arrested and accused of tarnishing North Korea’s national dignity, according to KCNA. Experts will now examine the warship’s hull for the next stage of restorations, to be carried out at Rajin Dockyard over the coming week to 10 days, KCNA said. The ship’s full restoration is expected to be completed before a ruling party meeting later this month. Jo Chun Ryong, a senior official from North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party, was quoted by KCNA as saying that the “perfect restoration of the destroyer will be completed without fail” before the deadline set by the country’s ruler, Kim. The damaged warship is North Korea’s second known destroyer and is seen as a crucial asset in Kim’s goal of modernising his country’s naval forces. The South Korean military estimates, based on its size and scale, that the new warship is similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea also unveiled last month. Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the “most powerful weapons”, and that it would “enter into operation early next year”. South Korea’s military said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian assistance, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of soldiers to help Moscow fight Ukraine. Kim has framed the modernisation of his military as a response tothreats from the US and South Korea,who are key allies and regularly conduct military drills together. The North Korean leader has also said that the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be the next step in strengthening his country’s navy. On Wednesday, Kim met with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang in the latest sign of the countries’ deepening ties, which were elevated when they signed a mutual defence pact in June last year that obliges them to provide immediate military assistance to each other using “all means” necessary if either faces “aggression”.",

    "title": "Trump-Musk feud escalates: What happened? And what comes next?",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –The ties between United States President Donald Trump and billionaireElon Muskhave seen highs and lows throughout the years. But it all came crashing down on Thursday after months of what appeared to be an unshakable alliance in the White House. A disagreement over Trump’smassive tax billhas escalated over the past few days, with Musk going so far as tosuggestthat the US president should be impeached. In a series of social media posts, Musk launched personal attacks against Trump, culminating in aclaim, made without evidence, that Trump is in the “Epstein files”. Those documents relate to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and include travel logs and guest lists related to him and his associates. Part of theEpstein filesremain secret, sparking curiosity and conspiracy theories about who might be mentioned. Trump, meanwhile, responded with a social media fusillade of his own. Heclaimedhe asked Musk to leave his White House role andsuggestedcutting the government subsidies and contracts awarded to the billionaire’s companies. So how did the partnership between Musk and Trump collapse? And what may come next for the two men often described as the world’s richest and the world’s most powerful, respectively? A few months before the war of words between Musk and Trump erupted, the two seemed like an inseparable political force. Musk had spent nearly $200m to elect Trump to a second term in 2024. Days after his successful election, Trump responded by appointing Musk to lead a newly created government cutting agency, called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Even the name of the department reflected the leeway that the billionaire investor had in Trump’s administration. The word “doge” refers to an internet meme of a dog, favoured by Musk, that became popular in 2010. In the early weeks of Trump’s second term, Musk became one of the most prominent figures in the administration – and a lightning rod for public criticism. Under his leadership, DOGE sacked thousands of federal employees and gutted various agencies, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Musk appeared so powerful that some Democrats started to refer to him as “President Elon” to get under Trump’s skin. But Trump and Musk presented a united front. During a Fox News interview in February, the US president and his then-adviser appeared side by side and heaped praise on one another. “He gets it done. He’s a leader,” Trump said of Musk. “I love the president. I just want to be clear about that,” Musk said of Trump. Musk, who is originally from South Africa, started espousing right-wing views over the past few years and grew vocally critical of Democrats and progressives. Those views became more prominent after he bought thesocial media platform Twitter, now X, in 2022. As he started to tilt rightward, he used the platform to bash irregular migration and efforts he believed aimed to police free speech, particularly with regards to identity politics and the COVID-19 pandemic. Even during Musk’s political realignment, however, he and Trump exchanged stern criticism. For example, in July 2022, Muskpostedthat Trump was getting to be “too old to be chief executive of anything”, much less the presidency. He also initially backed Trump’s Republican rival in the 2024 presidential race, Ron DeSantis, even hosting the Florida governor’s campaign launch on X. But the failedassassination attemptagainst Trump would cement Musk’s shift in allegiance. After a bullet grazed Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024, Muskannouncedhe would “fully endorse” the Republican leader. He even joined Trump for a return to Butler in September of last year. The cliche in politics is that there are no permanent enemies or permanent allies, only permanent interests. That appears to be the case for Trump, who has a history of firing advisers and disavowing former friends. Musk is only the latest high-profile rupture – and one that might not come as a surprise to political observers. The unravelling of Trump’s “bromance” with Musk comes at the tail end of a rocky few months, as rumours swirled about closed-door clashes between the billionaire and the president’s inner circle. In April, Musk announced that he would be spendingless timeat DOGE. By that time, his role appeared to be diminishing, with the billionaire no longer dominating headlines or regularly appearing in the Oval Office. Late in May,Musk criticisedthe White House-backed tax and budget proposal, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told the TV programme CBS Sunday Morning. The bill cuts electric vehicle (EV) subsidies that boost Musk’s Tesla car company. But Musk has maintained his opposition to the bill lies in its increases to the national debt and its byzantine provisions: The bill clocks in at more than 1,000 pages. The notoriously confrontational Trump, who had pinned his vision for the economy on the bill, kept his cool amid Musk’s early criticisms. He even acknowledged to reporters, “I’m not happy about certain aspects of [the bill].” The two men made a public appearance together afterwards in the Oval Office, where Trumpcelebratedthe end of Musk’s role as a special government employee. Even then, Trump insisted that Musk was “not really leaving” his team. Once out of the government, though, Musk not only voiced discontent with the budget bill; he appeared to be lobbying against it. The bill had narrowly passed in the House of Representatives, only to face similarly steep odds in the Senate. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk wrote on X on Monday. “Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” The US president shot back on Thursday, starting with an appearance in the Oval Office with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “ I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here,” Trump said. “ He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem.” Trump told the assembled reporters that Musk’s reaction was a backlash to his EV policies. He also speculated that Musk would have preferred to stay in the White House. “ I’ll be honest, I think he misses the place,” Trump said. “ It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome. We have it with others, too. They leave, and they wake up in the morning, and the glamour’s gone. The whole world is different, and they become hostile.” Afterwards, Trump took his criticisms to his social media platform, Truth Social. “Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trumpwrotein a social media post. All the while, Musk had been posting on social media, criticising Trump’s bill and taking credit for his re-election campaign. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Muskwrote. “Such ingratitude.” What happens next remains unclear. Although Musk has gained popularity within the Republican base, his political rise was partly due to his association with Trump. He may now find himself loathed by both Democrats and Trump loyalists. The US president, on the other hand, has a track record of surviving public scandals, includingcriminal charges. Trump has also shown apparent willingness to use the government’s power against his rivals, most recentlyordering an investigationinto the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. Already, Trump has warned of risks to Musk’s businesses, including the rocket company SpaceX and the communications firm Starlink. “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote. Still, Musk can also hurt Trump’s agenda. In his inauguration speech, Trump envisioned planting a US flag on Mars, but on Thursday, Musksaidhe plans todecommission a SpaceX rocketthat the US uses to reach the International Space Station, as retaliation for Trump’s words. Musk could also align with fiscally conservative lawmakers to block Trump’s signature tax bill in the Senate. Despite Musk going on the offensive against Trump on Thursday, the US president used one of his later social media posts to shift the focus to his One Big Beautiful Bill. “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given,” Trumpwroteon Truth Social. “If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that.”",

    "title": "Judge blocks new Trump bid to deny US entry for Harvard’s foreign students",
    "article_text": "A judge in Massachusetts has blocked United States President Donald Trump’s latest executive order banning Harvard University’s international students from entering the country. The temporary restraining order issued late on Thursday by US District Judge Allison Burroughs came just hours after the prestigious Ivy League school asked the court to extend an earlier order to include Trump’s latest move against foreign students. Burroughs’s order states that Harvard would “sustain immediate and irreparable injury” due to Trump’s directive prohibiting foreign nationals from entering the US to study at the university, before the courts have a chance to review the case. It temporarily restricts the government from “implementing, instituting, maintaining, enforcing, or giving force or effect” to Trump’s proclamation, according to US media reports. Harvard had previously obtained an emergency restraining order in May from the same judge to stop the Department of Homeland Security from implementing Trump’s earlier decision to revoke the university’s access to a system registering international students holding US visas. On Wednesday, Trump published anexecutive orderclaiming that his new order was “necessary to restrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally” to attend Harvard. He called Harvard’s international students a “class of aliens” whose arrival “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States”. As a result, he said that he had the right under the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny them entry into the country. But in Thursday’s court filing, Harvard dismissed that argument as just the latest attempt by Trump to harm the school. “The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the school’s amended complaint says. The complaint called on the court to extend the earlier temporary restraining order to include Trump’s latest attack. “Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders – and their dependents – have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote. Trump began his campaign against Harvard and other prominent schools earlier this year, after taking office for a second term as president. He blamed the universities for failing to take sterner action against the Palestinian solidarity protests that cropped up on their campuses in the wake of Israel’s war on Gaza. The president called the demonstrations anti-Semitic and pledged to remove foreign students who participated from the US. Protest organisers, meanwhile, have argued that their aims were nonviolent and that the actions of a few have been used to tar the movement overall. Critics have also accused Trump of using the protests as leverage to exert greater control over the country’s universities, including private schools like Harvard and its fellow Ivy League school, Columbia University. In early March, Columbia – whose protest encampments were emulated at campuses across the country – saw $400m in federal funding stripped from its budget. The school lateragreedto a list of demands issued by the Trump administration, including changes to its disciplinary policies and a review of its Middle East studies programme. Harvard University was also given a list of demands to comply with. But unlike Columbia,it refused, citing concerns that the restrictions would limit its academic freedom. Trump also threatened to revoke the school’s tax-exempt status and barred it from receivingfuture federal research grants. In May, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedit would revoke Harvard’s access to a system, the Student Exchange Visitor Program, where it is required to log information about its foreign students. That would have forced currently enrolled Harvard students to transfer to another school if they were in the country on a student visa. It would have also prevented Harvard from accepting any further international students. But Harvardsued the Trump administration, calling its actions “retaliatory” and “unlawful”. On May 23, Judge Burroughs granted Harvard’s emergency petition for a restraining order to stop the restriction from taking effect.",

    "title": "The best earbuds we’ve tested for 2025",
    "article_text": "The best from Apple, Bose, Samsung, Sony, Beats, Google, and more. The best from Apple, Bose, Samsung, Sony, Beats, Google, and more. byChris Welch If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts. Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on. Sony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit. With dynamic, rich sound and the best ANC available, the QC Ultra Earbuds are a terrific pick if you want to listen to your music in peace. Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms. No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other. Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs. What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings. Most earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with. Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life. 8 Verge Score Smaller, more comfortable designUpgrades to ANC and sound qualityMuch clearer voice call performance Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from caseSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitorsPotential battery longevity concerns Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:8 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IPX4 /Bluetooth codecs:LDAC, AAC, SBC /Multipoint:Yes /Works best with:Android, iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Foam (XS, S, M, L) Just like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on. Some people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box. On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time. It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.

But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app. 8 Verge Score Most powerful ANC you’ll find in earbudsLively, rich soundStabilizer fins are easier to apply Immersive Audio drains batteryStill no multipoint in 2023Wireless charging requires $49 case Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:6 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IPX4 /Bluetooth codecs:AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive /Multipoint:Yes /Works best with:Android, iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (S, M, L) Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job at offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life and putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts. The QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’sQC Earbuds IIin terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio. 8 Verge Score Huzzah!

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller. The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that theycan’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipmentwhen paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users. The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout. If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. 8 Verge Score Much better noise cancellationImproved sound quality and clarityUnrivaled hearing health features Unchanged designSound is better but not top tier Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:6 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IPX4 /Bluetooth codecs:AAC, SBC /Multipoint:No /Works best with:iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (XS, S, M, L) For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, thesecond-gen AirPods Probring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option. The AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you. Where the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem. In the fall,Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health featuresfor the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss. 8 Verge Score Terrific sound qualityCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough modeVoice commands are simple and so usefulGood voice calls Uninspired designMidtier noise cancellation performanceNo true multipoint Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:6 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IP57 /Bluetooth codecs:Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC /Multipoint:No /Works best with:Android, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (S, M, L) Samsung’sGalaxy Buds 3 Proditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint. The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens. But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it. 9 Verge Score Smaller and lighter design is supremely comfortableMore powerful noise cancellationCrystal-clear transparency modeVery pleasant and detailed sound quality ANC can’t quite match BoseGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelityGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:8 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IP54 /Bluetooth codecs:AAC, SBC /Multipoint:Yes /Works best with:Android, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (XS, S, M, L) With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise. Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors. Got a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package. 8 Verge Score Better sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio BudsStandout translucent case optionImproved voice call performance ANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods ProDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricksNo wireless charging or in-ear detection Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:6 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IPX4 /Bluetooth codecs:AAC, SBC /Multipoint:No /Works best with:Android, iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort. What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using. The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t getallthe usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price. 8 Verge Score Fantastic sound qualityImproved day-to-day reliabilityAuracast-enabled Too pricey for someNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything specialLong-term durability remains to be seen Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:7.5 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IP54 /Bluetooth codecs:AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC /Multipoint:Yes /Works best with:Android, iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (XS, S, M, L) Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest. These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread. 7 Verge Score Upgraded sound qualityVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarityDeep Apple ecosystem integration No wireless chargingNo built-in speaker on the caseNo proper multipoint Noise cancellation:Optional /Battery life:5 hours /Water resistance:IP54 /Bluetooth codecs:AAC, SBC /Multipoint:No /Works best with:iOS, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:None Apple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity. On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with. Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes... there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port. The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking. 8 Verge Score Terrific sound qualityCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough modeVoice commands are simple and so usefulGood voice calls Uninspired designMidtier noise cancellation performanceNo true multipoint Noise cancellation:Yes /Battery life:6 hours (ANC on) /Water resistance:IP57 /Bluetooth codecs:Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC /Multipoint:No /Works best with:Android, Windows, macOS /Ear tips:Silicone (S, M, L) Sony’s unconventionalLinkBudswere our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear. The Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 12:02 AM EDT/ CBS Chicago A security guard was shot and wounded Thursday night during a struggle in the emergency room of a hospital in the city of Evanston, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, officials said. The shooting occurred in the ER of Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, located at 2650 Ridge Ave. At 7:26 p.m. Central time, the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston, or C.A.R.E. team — which provides non-police response to certain low-risk service calls — approached a man near the downtown Evanston Taco Bell at 1737 Sherman Ave., according to Evanston police Cmdr. Scott Sophier. The man seemed to be suffering a mental health affliction. He agreed to be checked out by Evanston Fire Department paramedics and taken to Evanston Hospital for treatment, Sophier said. Evanston police were not involved in this initial chain of events, Sophier said. The Evanston Fire Department arrived at the scene with the man at 7:45 p.m. While inside a room during the intake process at the ER, the man became agitated toward hospital personnel, Sophier said. Hospital security entered the room to assist other staff, Sophier said. At 7:57 p.m., the man lunged toward his own belongings inside the room, Sophier said. A security officer saw a weapon, and a struggle ensued, Sophier said. An unknown number of shots were fired inside the ER. One Evanston Hospital officer was struck and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Sophier said. Another hospital employee assisted security in placing the patient in handcuffs until Evanston police arrived, Sophier said. A handgun was recovered at the scene, and the 28-year-old man was taken into police custody. Spencer Walrath, a spokesperson for the hospital, told CBS News, \"The safety of our patients and team members is our top priority.\" \"There is no active threat,\" Walrath said. \"The safety of our patients and team members is our top priority.\" Nurses were seen swiftly leaving the hospital around 8 p.m. A visitor to the hospital was alarmed. \"Yeah, I'm scared because I came to see my baby, and then I was thinking this is happening at a hospital,\" said David Kostal, \"so it's a bit surprising.\" The emergency room was put on lockdown following the shooting, and remained on lockdown as of 10 p.m. Central time. \"We are very grateful for the fast-acting response of Evanston Hospital personnel,\" Sophier said.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 12:00 AM EDT/ CBS News The trailer for Pharrell Williams'upcoming biopic\"Piece By Piece\" has dropped like it's hot —   and it doesn't look the way you might expect. The iconic producer will be voicing himself in animated LEGO form, accompanied by some A-list collaborators from his chart-topping career. Gwen Stefani, Justin Timberlake,Jay-Zand Snoop Dogg are some of the guest stars from Williams' 30-year career that will feature in \"Piece by Piece,\" with the trailer depicting a LEGO-ized version of Williams, Hugo and Snoop Dogg devising \"Drop it Like it's Hot.\" The trailer also revealed the film would include new music from Williams. Announced in Januaryby Focus Features, the film was directed by Morgan Neville, who said in a statement that Williams had approached his five years ago with the idea for the biopic. \"When I had this crazy vision to tell this story through LEGO bricks, I couldn't have imagined a better partner than Morgan. He is a legend,\" Williams said in a statement. \"Who would've thought that playing with these toys as a kid would evolve into a movie about my life? It's proof that anyone else can do it too.\" Neville is primarily a documentary filmmaker who won an Oscar for his 2014 feature \"20 Feet From Stardom,\" exploring the careers and lives of backup singers. As half of the foundational production duo The Neptunes, Williams has set the backdrop for some of music's greatest hits. Formed in Virginia Beach in 1992 by childhood friends Williams and Chad Hugo, The Neptunes quickly rose to prominence, writing and producing for artists including Teddy Riley, The Clipse,Usher, Nelly and Britney Spears. Pharrell'siconic four-countinstrumental opening tags chart-toppers from Kelis' \"Milkshake\" toKendrick Lamar's\"Alright\" to Williams' own \"Happy.\" \"Piece by Piece\" will be released in theaters on October 11.

    "title": "Timeline: How Trump and Musk went from rivals to allies — and now foes again",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 5, 2025 / 11:14 PM EDT/ CBS News The alliance between President Trump and Elon Muskwent up in flamesThursday, days after the world's richest man left the administration and tried to wield his influence to kill a massive budget bill that is central to enacting the president's top legislative priorities. Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government. Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here: The Tesla CEO praised Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies as \"the right ones\" in an interviewwithCNBC before the 2016 election. \"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy,\" Musk said of Mr. Trump at the time. \"He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\" \"I don't think this is the finest moment in our democracy,\" Musk added. Shortly after Mr. Trump's first term began, Muskjoineda handful of White House advisory boards, including Mr. Trump's \"manufacturing jobs council.\" But Musk left those roles just months later, citing Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musktweetedin June 2017. Musk continued to have a close relationship with the federal government, however, as hisrocket company SpaceXhas billions in contracts with NASA and other agencies. Mr. TrumppraisedMusk at a 2020 SpaceX launch in Florida,saying at one point: \"I speak to him all the time. Great guy. He's one of our great brains. We like great brains. And Elon has done a fantastic job.\" In May 2022, Musk said he was ending his support for Democrats because \"they have become the party of division & hate.\" \"So I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" Musktweeted, lateraddingthat he voted for Clinton in 2016 and former President Joe Biden in 2020. But just two months later, Musk suggested he didn't support Mr. Trump launching another run for the White House amid a public spat with the then-former president over the course of several days in July 2022. Mr. Trumpcalledthe Tesla CEO a \"b---s--- artist\" at a rally andsaidhis companies would be \"worthless\" without federal backing, while Musk tweeted Mr. Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\" Later in 2022, Musk purchased Twitter, now known as X, and quicklyreinstatedMr. Trump's account, which had been suspended since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The reinstatement came four days after Mr. Trump announced his third run for the presidency after losing to Biden. In the Republican presidential primary, Muskinitially threw his supportbehind one of Mr. Trump's rivals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In May 2023, the billionaire and the Floridian appeared together on aglitchyTwitter livestream to launch DeSantis' campaign. The tech billionaire formally endorsed Mr. Trump on July 13, 2024, moments after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Muskwrotealongside video of the bloodied presidential candidate raising his fist in the air as he was surrounded by Secret Service agents. Musk joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail andspent roughly $277 millionto help elect him and other Republican candidates, mostly through a Musk-backed super PAC called America PAC, campaign finance records show. Mr. Trump shouted Musk out during his election night victory speech: \"A star is born,\" Mr. Trumpsaid. \"He's an amazing guy.\" Before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for a second term, Musk used his political influence inDecember 2024to whip up outrage against a bipartisan spending bill and torpedo it days before a potential government shutdown. Mr. Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency,or DOGE, which was tasked with cutting federal government spending, but fell far short of Musk's $1 trillion goal. Musk quickly became a member of Mr. Trump's inner circle, participating in Cabinet meetings and traveling on Air Force One with his young son. Less than a month into his government service, Muskprofessedon X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\" DOGE quickly gained vast influence within the Trump administration, slashing government staff andnearly dismantling some federal agencies. Musk and Mr. Trumpappeared togetherin the Oval Office in February — with Musk's son in tow — and jointly answered questions from the press. Mr. Trump stood by Musk as some of his efforts drew backlash. In late February, a DOGE-backed email telling federal employees to report what they had accomplished in the preceding week sparkedconfusionin some agencies. During a Cabinet meeting days later, Mr. Trump called Musk \"tremendously successful\" and said people were \"thrilled\" with his performance — and said federal workers who haven't responded to the emails are \"on the bubble.\" When Tesla faced protests from Trump opponents, the president boosted Musk, climbing into a Tesla on the White House South Lawn in March and calling the car \"beautiful.\" Days prior, Mr. Trump said onTruth Socialhe would \"buy a brand new Tesla\" as a show of support for Musk, who the president said was \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB.\" Musk clashed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in April over Mr. Trump's tariff strategy. Musk called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro said Tesla relies on \"cheap foreign parts.\" Mr. Trump's White Housedidn't take sides: \"Boys will be boys,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. In a late April Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump praised and thanked Musk — butsuggestedhis time in government could end soon. \"You're invited to stay as long as you want. At some point, he wants to get back home to his cars,\" Mr. Trump said, as he and his Cabinet led a round of applause for the billionaire. President Trump to@elonmusk: \"We just want to thank you very much. And, you know, you're invited to stay as long as you want. At some point, he wants to get back home to his cars.\"pic.twitter.com/izglwMebKM Days before wrapping up his work for the federal government, Musk began criticizing a massive piece of legislation aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Musk told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" in the price tag of the package, whichwould extendMr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back clean energy tax credits. Musk left his position in the administration on May 30 after reaching the maximum number of days he could serve as a special government employee. Musk, who had a black eye, stood next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president praised the billionaire's government work and called him \"one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.\" \"Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling,\" Mr. Trump said. Musk said he would continue to serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president. In the following days, Musk escalated his criticism of the legislation Mr. Trump has dubbed a \"big, beautiful bill,\" calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" in a lengthy early June tirade on his social media platform. The insults continued through the week,reaching a climaxon June 5 with Mr. Trump threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him. Musk said he would shut down a SpaceX program that NASA relies on to transport astronauts — before later backtracking — andseemed to endorse an X postcalling for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Musk also warnedRepublican lawmakers: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\" During the back-and-forth, Mr. Trump claimed that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with a provision in the budget bill that would end tax credits for electric vehicles. \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" the presidentwrote. Musk then alleged that Mr. Trump's name appeared in thefiles related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Muskwrote. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\" In response to the spat, Leavitt called it an \"unfortunate episode from Elon.\" Caitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

    "article_text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine was under an ongoing Russian ballistic missile and drone attack early Friday that wounded at least three people, officials said. Multiple explosions were heard in the capital, Kyiv, where falling debris sparked fires across several districts as air defense systems attempted to intercept incoming targets, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration. Three people were wounded, local officials said. They urged residents to seek shelter. \"Our air defense crews are doing everything possible. But we must protect one another — stay safe,\" Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. Authorities reported damage in several districts, and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations. In Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment, and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse. Tymchenko said the metro tracks between two stations in Kyiv were damaged in the attack, but no fire or injuries occurred. In northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chief Dmytro Bryzhynskyi. He added that explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the outskirts of the city. The nighttime attack came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia \"fight for a while\" before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, in comments that were a remarkable detour from Trump's often-stated appeals to stop the three-year war. Trump spoke as he met with Germany's new chancellor, who appealed to him as the \"key person in the world\" who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump’s proclamationWednesday restricting entry into the United Statesfor nationals from a patchwork of 19 countries revives one of his most controversial policies from his first term and targets many of the same countries. Beginning Monday, the directive bans entry for nationals from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also institutes partial bans and visa restrictions for Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Trump instituted similar travel restrictions during his first term and even targeted several of the same countries, including Iran, Libya and Venezuela. About 139,000 visas were issued for visitors from the 19 countries during the 2023 fiscal year, data from the State Department shows. Visitors from Venezuela received the most visas. Across all of the countries, tourism and business visas were issued most commonly. Trump’s proclamation cited security and terrorism risks as the reason behind some of the restrictions, and it specifically accused visitors from several of the countriesof staying past their visas’ expiration dates. But data from the Department of Homeland Security shows that while several of the countries had high overstay rates during the 2023 fiscal year, the actual numbers of people were low. Eritrea, for instance, had the second-highest overstay rate, but the total was just over 200, a small fraction of the number of overstayers from Mexico, India or Brazil.",

Phoenix trailed 76-68 with 4:04 remaining. Held put the Mercury ahead 77-76 with 1:11 remaining on a deep 3-pointer. After Golden State went 1 for 2 at the free-throw line, Sabally rebounded her own miss and put it in while being fouled. Sabally made the free throw for a three-point play and an 80-77 advantage with 33.3 left. Golden State guard Veronica Burton missed a wide-open layup at the other end and Sabally was fouled before making two free throws for a five-point lead. The Valkyries turned it over on their next two inbound plays, and the Mercury made four straight free throws to seal it. Held was 7 for 15 from the field, including 4 for 9 behind the arc, and 6 for 6 at the free-throw line for the best scoring output by a rookie this season, passing Paige Bueckers’ mark of 21. Phoenix (6-3) improved to 5-1 at home — a franchise best to begin a season.

    "title": "Private lunar lander from Japan crashes into moon in failed mission",
    "article_text": "A privatelunar landerfromJapancrashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon. The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission. Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft’s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well. CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace. Two years ago, the company’s first moonshotended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name “Resilience” for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist’s toy-size red house for placement on the moon’s dusty surface. Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions. “This is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,” Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions. A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. “Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,” the company said in a written statement. Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way. Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride withFirefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March. Another U.S. company,Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon’s south pole and was declared dead within hours. Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side’s northern tier. Plans had called for the 7.5-foot Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend. Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace’s European-built rover — named Tenacious — sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA. The rover, weighing just 11 pounds, was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight. Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch. The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface. Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. “Engineers did everything they possibly could” to ensure success this time, he said. He considered the latest moonshot “merely a steppingstone” to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement. Ispace, like other businesses, does not have “infinite funds” and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace’s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month. While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it’s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million. Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year’s end:Jeff Bezos‘ Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic’s first lunar landermissed the moon altogetherin 2024 and came crashing back through Earth’s atmosphere.",

The trooper saw a Mercedes-Benz E300 traveling at excessive speed on  I-91 south near Cromwell  and tried to initiate a traffic stop with lights and sirens. The driver accelerated away, making unsafe lane changes and weaving in and out of traffic, the trooper's report said. Because of the hazard being created, the trooper stopped the pursuit. State Police contacted the registered owner of the vehicle, who said that a family member had it. Troopers obtained a phone number for the man, who admitted he had been driving and said he didn't stop because he was late for a job interview. He then agreed to meet Troopers at Troop H office in Hartford, where he  was arrested. He faces nine charges: reckless driving; disobeying signal of an officer; failure to maintain lane; passing on the right; improper turn; passing at an unsafe distance; engaging police in a pursuit; interfering with an officer; and reckless endangerment in the first degree. He was released on a $2,500 bond and  is scheduled to appear in Middletown Superior Court on June 17.",

After feeling fatigue and other symptoms, Redstone sought medical help about two months ago and was diagnosed with thyroid cancer the next day.

She and her family are grateful that her prognosis is excellent,” Redstone‘s spokesperson Molly Morse said. Redstone kept her diagnosis private, sharing it  with only a tight circle of relatives, close friends, and advisers including David Ellison, the Skydance head and tech heir, whose company is set to purchase Paramount and the Redstone family’s stake, NYT added. The diagnosis comes against the backdrop of Paramount preparing for an $8.4 billionmergerwith Skydance Media, which still requires U.S. FCC approval.

    "title": "Senate Republicans open the door to cutting Medicare 'waste' in Trump agenda bill",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Looking at new ways to pay for theirsprawling billfor President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, Republicans are exploring ideas to slash “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicare, several senators said Thursday. And President Donald Trump has blessed the pursuit, they said. “I think anything that can be — that’s waste, fraud and abuse are open to, obviously, discussions,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters. He said that Republicans have primarily looked at Medicaid to find savings but that they’re open to looking at other programs, too. “The focus, as you know, has been on addressing waste, fraud, abuse within Medicaid and, but right now, we’re open to suggestions that people have them about other areas where there is, you know, clearly, waste, fraud and abuse that can be rooted out in any government program,” Thune said. Medicare has historically been seen as political third rail, a program members of both parties have been wary of touching in fear of backlash from older voters. But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said they shouldn’t be afraid of cutting waste in Medicare. “Why don’t we go after that? I think we should,” Cramer said. “Some people are afraid of the topics; I’m not,” he added, noting that they would focus on waste, fraud and abuse. “In my view, this is our moment as Republicans in control of all three branches, and we ought to be going after more fiscal responsibility. And some people are making that case. Other people are wringing their hands.” Senate Republicans said that they discussed the issue during a closed-door meeting and that it also came up with Trump when Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee met with him Wednesday. “What the president made clear is [he] does not want to see any cuts to beneficiaries. But to go after, he repeated over again — the waste, fraud and abuse, the waste, fraud and abuse,” Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said. White House spokesman Kush Desai echoed that point. “The president has been clear — no cuts to Medicare, Social Security, or Medicaid.  This bill addresses waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending,” Desai said in an email. The discussions open up a policy debate that could have explosive political ramifications. Medicare is a highly popular program that provides health insurance to people over 65 years old, and Democrats are already launching attacks on the new GOP discussions about making changes to the program. “A program that 66 million Americans rely on is not waste, fraud, or abuse — it’s lifesaving for the constituents of Republicans pushing to gut Medicare,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement Thursday. “Let’s be crystal clear: Donald Trump gave Republicans the green light to gut access to lifesaving medication and rip away health insurance to fund tax handouts for billionaires. These dangerous attacks are as disgraceful as they are unpopular — and will cost Republicans their seats come the midterms.” GOP leaders are searching for ways to lower the cost of the bill passed by the House, which the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Officeprojects would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. It includes Medicaid and health spending cuts that Republicans describe as “waste, fraud and abuse,” which the CBO estimates would result in 10.9 million fewer people having insurance. Still, some conservative senators insist on mitigating the red ink to vote for the bill. And it’s unclear how narrowly or broadly Senate Republicans would define “waste, fraud and abuse” when it comes to Medicare. There is skepticism in the GOP about pursuing that path. “What a terrible idea. We should not be touching Medicare,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said, recalling that trying to cut retirement spending has burned the Republican Party in the past. “In 2004 President Bush got re-elected and promptly tried to privatize Social Security, and Republicans didn’t win the popular vote for 20 years,” Hawley said. “So if you don’t ever want to win an election again, just go fiddle around with people’s Medicare that they’ve worked hard for, paid into.” Hawley launched similar criticisms when Republicans began going after Medicaid for savings, but he said he supports most of the spending cuts in the House-passed bill, including the work requirements and eligibility rules. The talks about Medicare came as news to some Republicans. “I haven’t heard any discussion of cutting Medicare. That’s a vital program that people have earned their benefits for, and I’m not going to say never, because maybe there’s some waste, fraud, abuse, kind of language, but I certainly would not support cutting Medicare benefits,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters. A potential option senators mentioned is a bipartisan bill that would “improve the way Medicare Advantage plans assess patients’ health risks and reduce overpayments for care,” according to a description of the legislation. The bill, calledthe \"No UPCODE Act,\"is co-sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. A recentCBO reportsaid the policies in the bill could save $124 billion over 10 years. “To say it has bipartisan support is an underestimate,” Cassidy told NBC News. “I think that would be a reasonable way to protect it, don’t cut benefits, you’re taking care of patients, but you’re trying to rescue the program.”",

    "article_text": "By Caitlin Thompson Juvenile detention systems often deny young offenders credit for the time they spend waiting behind bars. This adds months to the duration that kids are confined away from their families.Connie Hanzhang Jin/NPRhide caption The first time L.J. was sent to the juvenile detention center outside of Philadelphia, he'd been caught hanging out with friends in an abandoned building. After that, he went in and out of custody for minor offenses throughout his teenage years. Detention was a challenging place to grow up. \"It's like a little jungle,\" he said. \"Everybody wants to be tough. Everybody wants to fight. It's a lot to go through.\" One particularly long stint lasted about six months before he was sent to a state facility in southern Pennsylvania for boys in the delinquency system. But more than half of the 11 months he spent locked up didn't count toward any kind of sentence. It was \"dead time.\" In the adult system, people awaiting trial get credit for \"time served,\" with any months that they spend in jail awaiting trial factored into their ultimate prison sentence. Not so in the youth system, an NPR investigation found. In about two dozen states, there's no such thing as time credit in juvenile delinquency cases. Unlike for adults, the time kids spend in detention often doesn't count toward any incarceration that they may face at the conclusion of their court case. This adds months to the duration that kids are confined away from their families at enormous expense to the taxpayer and to the detriment of young people, NPR found. Loading... \"It is just time that they are essentially being warehoused,\" said Amy Borror, a policy strategist at the Gault Center, a national advocacy group working on juvenile justice issues. \"It really is a waste. It's a waste of their time. It's a waste of a lot of resources that the city or state are putting into the detention facility. Time that kids spend locked up has an extraordinarily negative impact on them.\" L.J. is 23 now, but because he was underage when these events occurred, NPR agreed not to use his name. To him, the months he spent in detention without credit didn't make any sense. \"Damn, where was I at five Christmases ago, five Thanksgivings ago?\" he said. \"Time where I should have been with my family and out with my friends for birthdays and stuff like that, I'm still here because of time that they didn't count.\" The juvenile justice system is, in theory, markedly different from the adult one. When a minor breaks the law, it's a delinquent act, not a crime. Youth aren't found guilty; they're adjudicated delinquent. They aren't sentenced to prison; they're committed to the state's custody or to a secure facility, often for an indeterminate period while they receive services meant to help turn their life around. If the adult system is meant to be punitive, the juvenile system is supposed to be rehabilitative. \"The juvenile legal system is quasi-criminal, quasi-civil. It's intentionally separate from the criminal system, which is, at least in theory, a good thing. We don't want to be criminalizing children,\" said Borror. But policy experts and juvenile defense attorneys argue it has also led to a lopsided application of fundamental rights, created disparities between how young people are treated in different states and allowed kids to languish in detention without access to services or proper education. Detention isn't without a purpose. Often, when a kid is detained pre-adjudication, it's because the court has decided they are a risk to the community, explained Sam Abed, the director of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services in Washington, D.C. \"We need to remember that a young person was assessed by a justice agency as being a public safety risk and deemed that we need to hold you there because of the risk that you pose to the community safety,\" he said. Each state handles credit for that time in juvenile detention differently, according to conversations with youth defense attorneys and a review of laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Most states don't give kids credit for time spent in detention, either by law or practice, NPR found. More than half of states, plus D.C., have no laws requiring that time in detention count toward their incarceration. In these cases, it's often up to the judge's discretion. A few states, like Maine and Utah, only count time in detention for kids given short sentences, but not for those committed to longer, indeterminate sentences. In the 13 states that do have laws giving kids the right to time credit regardless of the type of sentence, attorneys say it rarely makes a meaningful difference. For instance, in California and Florida, time spent in detention is taken off the maximum sentence an adult would get for the same crime. However, since most kids are held for a short time before completing a rehabilitative program or aging out, this time credit doesn't have much of an impact. Only a few states, such as New Jersey, Georgia, and Kansas, treat juvenile time credit more like the adult system, where the clock starts at arrest. \"People might think that kids are more likely to be more protected and to potentially spend less time incarcerated. And it's actually the opposite,\" said Borror. \"It's one of those weird negative impacts of the fact that we don't consider the juvenile legal system to be punishment. It is only quasi-criminal, quasi-civil. Because of that, kids don't have the same level of constitutional protections that adults do in the criminal system.\" Ironically, the reason kids in many states don't get credit for the time they spend in detention traces back to something that was intended to benefit them. Recognizing the science behind adolescent brain development and rational decision making, the focus is on rehabilitation, not punishment. In Washington, D.C., for example, the law says the juvenile justice system is meant to \"treat children as children,\" \"place a premium on the rehabilitation of children\" and \"hold the government accountable for the provision of reasonable rehabilitative services.\" \"It's supposed to provide the services and support that a particular young person needs in order to reduce the risk that they're going to re-offend and increase the likelihood that they're going to become productive citizens,\" said Eduardo Ferrer, an attorney who leads the Juvenile Justice Initiative and the Juvenile Law Clinic at Georgetown University. As a result, minors in many states aren't sentenced to a set amount of time. Instead, they're in custody until they're deemed ready for release. Typically, this means completing a program. This is the case in D.C. where young people who break the law are committed to the custody of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services. For kids who the agency determines need to receive services at a secure facility, they work toward their release by progressing through a program at that institution. They can't do that in the city's detention center, argues Abed, the director of DYRS. \"Credit for time served is incompatible with a system that is focused on rehabilitation because the whole idea about your length of stay is that it's tied to you achieving your goals. It's not an arbitrary, hey, you're going to be here for two years and go serve your time,\" he said. In most places around the country, detention centers don't offer the types of programs youth need to complete to earn a ticket home. The facilities are only designed to be a temporary stop while a young person's case is in court or while they wait to be transferred somewhere else. \" The detention facility, by definition, is not a treatment and rehabilitation facility. We are responsible for young people while they go through the court process,\" said Gary Williams, the deputy commissioner of Juvenile Justice Services, which oversees the Philadelphia juvenile detention center. \"We're not responsible for the treatment and rehabilitation.\" Because young people aren't receiving extensive services in detention, those weeks, months or even years aren't contributing to their rehabilitation, in the eyes of the system. So the time doesn't count. \"I think the time that kids are spending in detention is almost worthless. They're not really getting any benefit from it,\" said Anne Marie Ambrose, who oversaw the juvenile justice agencies in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and now works on alternatives to detention. \"They're languishing in detention because they're getting the same thing over and over and over and over again.\" That's what it felt like to L.J. During the six months that he was sitting at the detention center in Philadelphia, sometimes he'd ask the staff when he'd be leaving. He knew there was a list of kids who were about to get transferred out. \"When I'd go see my counselor I'd remember telling them, what's up with the list? They'd be like you not on it,\" he said. \"So you just waiting.\" Back to his unit and his cell, back to the same rote day. He knew none of the time counted and that even when he got out of the detention center, he still had months of incarceration ahead of him. \"Sitting in the youth [detention center] gonna make you so mad cause you just there,\" he said. \"It's stressful. You don't know when you're going to come home because you still have to factor all this time … just waiting here.\" Tyler McDaniels spent 16 months locked up, and a quarter of it was dead time. \"It felt like I was just existing,\" said McDaniels, who was 17 when he was arrested about four years ago for charges including gun possession. \"No backwards, no forward, I'm just here.\" Spending so much time in detention that didn't count made him feel \"like a battery getting used,\" he said. \"Like [they're] draining us. They drain all our energy by putting us inside a cell or inside the jails, period.\" The number of minors in detention has been steadily declining around the country for years. But in some places, those who remain are spending long stretches and collecting extensive dead time, according to records and data reviewed by NPR. For kids in more than half of states around the country, NPR found that dead time extends their stay behind bars, sometimes by months or even years. Loading... \"Where the system doesn't give kids credit for the time they've been incarcerated in a local facility, it can have an incredible impact on the amount of time they ultimately are incarcerated,\" said Borror. This became a crisis in Philadelphia in the wake of the pandemic, driven by long waitlists for beds in state facilities for kids adjudicated delinquent. Most of the private centers in Pennsylvania that offer rehabilitative programs closed, while staffing shortages meant state-run lockups weren't operating at full capacity. Young people on time-specific sentences took longer to go through programs, leading to slower turnover of spaces. The result was a backlog of kids waiting to be moved out of detention and into their rehabilitative program, leaving them languishing in dead time after their court case concluded. At the peak, records obtained by NPR show that nearly 90 youth — 40 percent of the detention center's population — were just waiting for a bed at a state facility. Some sat for six to nine months, according to public documents from Philadelphia Department of Human Services, which oversees juvenile justice. The problem was even more severe for minors who were originally charged as adults. It can take more than a year for a case to be transferred to juvenile court. In the adult system, that time would be subtracted from their sentence. This was the situation for Mario Torres. When a judge brought his case back down to the juvenile court, it meant his sentence would be shorter. But it also meant that the nearly year and a half he was held in detention didn't count. To Torres, it didn't make sense that just because he was a minor, he didn't get credit for time served. \" That's still a question mark to me. I really honestly don't know. And I feel like that's not fair, though,\" he said. Overcrowding at the Philadelphia detention center became so severe that in 2022, Philadelphia sued the state, imploring the Department of Human Services to pick up the kids the court ruled should be in its custody. Court records show that dozens of kids slept on mattresses on the floor of the admissions area and the gym. They couldn't go to school or receive non-urgent medical care because there wasn't enough staff. Juvenile detention is supposed to be a short-term place, so kids told NPR there isn't much to do. They said they spend a lot of their time out of their cells playing cards to pass the time.Connie Hanzhang Jin/NPRhide caption As the amount of dead time kids collected went up in Philadelphia, so did the cost, NPR found. Detention is the most expensive option for dealing with youth who break the law. Records show it costs around $600 to $800 per night to keep one kid in the city detention center. \"It's incredibly expensive. We invest way more in locking kids up than we do in educating them. I often wonder if we made different policy choices, how much better off kids and society as a whole would be,\" said Ambrose, the former director of the juvenile justice agencies in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. \"I really think that detention is an outdated form of punishment. We know better. We should be doing better.\" The price tag for McDaniels' four months of dead time was around $80,000. To him, it felt like a waste. \"I'm getting all this time taken away from me and I'm not benefiting from it,\" he said. \"I put myself inside the predicament, but y'all supposed to be here to help me.\" With no rehabilitative programming and no sense of when he would start working toward his release, McDaniels said he started acting out. \"I went in there, and I got worse,\" he said. \"I started getting madder fast. I start getting exposed to all these other different types of personalities on top of dealing with my own stuff, so it's like I'm taking in streets.\" Research shows that detention has a negative impact on young people. Kids who spend time in detention are less likely to graduate high school and less likely to participate in the labor force. It pulls young people further into the justice system and increases the likelihood that they'll reoffend, according to research by theJustice Policy Institute, a nonprofit working to reduce incarceration. The people in charge know it's not working. \"If the status quo approach to juvenile justice in Philadelphia measures success by the system's ability to prevent future arrests, said system is succeeding in less than half of all instances, and spending large amounts of money to achieve said outcome,\" a study commissioned by the District Attorney's office stated. The crisis appears to be easing in Philadelphia. Kimberly Ali, the commissioner of the Philadelphia Department of Human Services, which oversees juvenile justice, said young people are transferred more quickly now. In response to longer stays, Ali said they added more services at the detention center, including vocational training, anger management and grief counseling. \" We had to learn to adjust to the young people that we were servicing. As their needs grew, we had to pivot to make sure that we met their needs,\" said Ali. D.C. is in the middle of a similar crisis. The district's goal is to move kids out of detention and into a rehabilitative program within 30 days of their disposition in court. The juvenile justice agency failed to meet this target in more than half of cases in 2023, according to data obtained by NPR from the Office of Independent Juvenile Justice Facilities Oversight. Loading... About one in five youth were held at the detention center for more than three months after their court case had finished, according to data from the first half of last year. Six were there for more than four months. Abed says his team at DYRS works hard to find the program that will be the best fit for a young person's needs, but it takes time to complete the required assessments and find a spot at a compatible facility. \"We want to place them as quickly as possible. No two kids are going to be the same. It's not a cookie cutter approach,\" he said. \"It can be frustrating for a young person to await placement for a long period of time. But that's why we've prioritized it, and the length of stay has declined and we will continue to push it down.\" The problem is improving slightly. At a council hearing last September, Abed told lawmakers that the average length of time youth waited to be transferred to start their rehabilitative program had decreased from a peak of 102 days that May to 63 days last August. But in the last three months of 2024, the wait time had increased slightly to 71 days, according to DYRS. Some states have found a way to deal with kids languishing in detention after the conclusion of their court case while they wait to go elsewhere for treatment. Several years ago, Utah passed a law that requires kids to be transferred within 72 hours. Maryland created specialized units for youth who are waiting to be transferred to the facility where they'll serve out their commitment, so they can start working toward their release. Abed says that DYRS has created a unit where kids who are waiting to be transferred can receive additional services, but that time still doesn't count because kids go to different facilities, each with their own program. \"We can't start a treatment program at a detention center that doesn't match up with what they're doing at the treatment program they're going to eventually do,\" he said. \"It's not going to be something that's compatible.\" When Eduardo Ferrer talks to the kids he represents in D.C., the impact of extended stays in detention is clear. \"Time in detention is not just dead time. It's harmful time,\" said Ferrer. \"It's dead time because the young person's making no progress. They're not building the skills that they need in order to be rehabilitated, to not re-offend. But it's also causing a lot of harm because it's taking them away from positive, productive, pro-social relationships and services that they could be getting in other programs around the community.\" Ferrer says that for an adult, a couple months more in jail may not feel like a significant amount of time in the grand scheme of their life. But for a kid, it does. \"One of my clients said it best when we were talking one time about his sentencing. He said, when do I get to be a kid? And that's really what is at stake,\" said Ferrer. It wasn't until the 1960s that theSupreme Courtrecognized kids are entitled to due process, the protection of an individual's liberty that encompasses everything from the right to a fair trial to the right to an attorney. Still, children have a diminished right to liberty compared to adults. There is, for example, no right to bail or a jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings in many states. \"I think this is one of the big failings of the juvenile court over time. As the Supreme Court said in the sixties, it really has evolved to be the worst of both worlds. Young people get neither the rehabilitation that they're promised nor actual protections and due process rights that they would if they were in the adult system,\" said Ferrer. Public defenders in D.C. filed alawsuitin October alleging that the district is violating kids' due process by detaining them in the city's Youth Services Center for long periods without credit or access to rehabilitative services. \"Forcing children to languish for needless months in YSC subjects them to unconstitutional punishment by extending the overall time they must spend in secure detention settings,\" reads the complaint. The court in D.C. is currently examining the constitutionality of keeping kids in detention for long stretches after their court case has concluded. Abed, the director of DYRS, would not address the lawsuit, but he explained the agency's perspective on the question of whether the lack of time credit is an issue of fundamental rights. \"Your constitutional rights have already been reviewed by the court that made the decision to detain you. There's no constitutional violation at all because there isn't a concept of credit for time served,\" said Abed. Not everyone agrees. \"It is a huge due process question, compounded by the fact that we know young people at YSC are not receiving services,\" said Zachary Parker, a member of the D.C. Council who chairs the committee that oversees DYRS. \"It's not a matter of legality alone. It is also a question around humanity. It's inhumane to keep a young person that may be 12 years old in a cell for months on end without services with no real plan or concern for their future.\" Parker says his committee will look at whether the law needs to change regarding time credit. In December, the D.C. Council passed a bill spearheaded by the attorney general's office that is intended to help expedite moving kids out of detention and into rehabilitative programming. But the new law doesn't address the fact that any time in detention is dead time. States have struggled to fix the time credit problem. Massachusetts, for example, tried to pass a law in 2023 that would require the department to factor in the time in detention awaiting trial when determining how long the child will be confined. It failed. Lawmakers are considering a similar proposal this year. Even when the law requires that time in detention count, attorneys told NPR they often have to push for it to be applied properly. Public defenders in Ohio had to file a lawsuit to ensure that was happening. Still, in Ohio, sentences are indeterminate, which means the Department of Youth Services has the ability to keep kids incarcerated until age 21. This means the law requiring time credit isn't going to benefit every kid, according to Brooke Burns, the chief counsel in the juvenile department at the Ohio public defender's office. \" It's frustrating because the credit, at the end of the day, is essentially not that helpful if DYS can just hold you for a lot of different reasons,\" said Burns. Burns said judges also don't always correctly calculate time credit. She crunched the numbers and found that between July 2016 and June 2024, judges had not counted about 16,000 days that should have been subtracted from the sentences given to youth her office represented. She estimated it would have saved the state more than $9 million. To Ambrose, the former director of the juvenile justice agencies in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, keeping kids in detention without services and without credit is about more than just due process. \"It is not fair,\" she said. \"It's not just. And even though we say that the system is for treatment, rehabilitation and supervision, it's not going to feel like that for a kid.\" Research shows that kids often age out of delinquent behavior. The young men who spoke with NPR said they're turning their lives around despite their time in detention, not because of it. McDaniels is finishing high school. He spoke with the governor about his experiences and says he wants to start a community center for kids in his neighborhood. Torres, who graduated high school while locked up, is working toward a college degree in IT. He has become a mentor for the other kids at a state facility in southern Pennsylvania, where he's being held. L.J. is working in construction and pursuing his commercial truck driver's license. But that doesn't mean his time locked up felt rehabilitative, especially when the stay in detention didn't count for anything, he said. \"I really did not know it wasn't a punishment, I thought like, you did what you did, this is what comes with it,\" he said. \"I really thought that's just how it was. It's news to me that it's not.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The Galaxy S25+ Is so Cheap on Amazon (New All-Time Low) That Samsung Blocks Its Price From Public View",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. If you’ve recently searched for theSamsung Galaxy S25+ 512GB on Amazon, you might have come across something peculiar: the price is not visible. Rather it states“price hidden”until you put it in your cart. This is because of a very special trade agreement with Samsung: The manufacturer is wanting to keep price drops like this a secret – especially as it was released just a few months ago. On Amazon, the Galaxy S25+ 512GB is on sale at its lowest point to date for a limited time only: The512GB model can be purchased for $869 which is 22% off the original list price of $1119. It’s obviously also a lot cheaper than if you get it from the official Samsung’s store. Make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock! See at Amazon Launched at the start of 2025, the Galaxy S25+ is a more powerful phone than the regular S25 with extra features to match. Both phones have the same basics: unlocked Android, smart AI cameras, and Samsungâs latest ProScaler display. But the S25+ adds more upgrades, which makes the higher price so much worthwhile. On top of that, with the current discount, le S25+ is more affordable than the standard S25. If you’re looking for differences, the Galaxy S25 has a smaller 6.2-inch FHD+ display and starts with 128GB or 256GB of storage while the S25+ offers a larger 6.7-inch QHD+ screen and storage options of 256GB or 512GB (which is the one on sale right now). The S25+ also benefits from a higher pixel density, which makes images and text appear sharper. Beyond display and storage, the Galaxy S25+ stands out with a bigger battery (4,900mAh compared to the S25âs 4,000mAh) for longer battery life for heavy users. The S25+ also supports ultra-wideband connectivity which is not available on the standard Galaxy S25 and enables features like precise device tracking and secure digital car keys. The best part of this Amazon deal is that the Galaxy S25+ 512GB now costs less than many standard S25 models, thanks to Amazonâs limited-time sale. Itâs hard to find a better price for a top phone with all the newest features. The S25+ is unlocked, so you can use it with any carrier, and it comes with a one-year warranty for extra peace of mind. Just keep in mind thatyou will need to add it to your cart to see the real price: Samsung is not allowing Amazon to disclose the full discount of the price in public.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Powerful laptops (for business and leisure) typically cost a lot of money, and a top-tier configuration easily pushes the price above $2,000. This is why this Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen 64GB RAM / 2TB SSD storage laptop price is begging attention with its breathtaking…72% discount on Amazon for $999, down from an original list price of $3,599 ($2,600 off and it’s not even Black Friday!). Besides that incredible price, this all-in-one package also includes Windows 11 Pro for a more secure Windows experience, Microsoft Office Pro with a lifetime license, an external CD/DVD drive, and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity right out of the box. This is definitely one of our favorite laptop deals of 2025 so far. See at Amazon See at Amazon The basic engine for the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 is a 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U processor which has 10 cores (2 performance + 8 efficiency) and 12 threads, supporting turbo speeds up to 5.0 GHz with a 12 MB cache. This processor was designed for efficiency and performance to run multiple applications at the same time including demanding business software. The integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics provide smooth visuals suitable for professional and multimedia tasks. The 64GB of DDR4 RAM is a standout feature (especially at this price point) and it allows users to run multiple applications simultaneously without a hint of slowdown. Within this class of laptops, most are capped at 16GB or 32GB, so to find a new machine with a 64GB configuration (such as this Inspiron model) is pretty rare and highly valuable. See at Amazon See at Amazon In terms of storage, this model exceeds expectations and what you can expect from the market: The 2TB PCIe NVMe SSD allows for speedy boot times and fast file access to handle large projects and media libraries with ease which is impressive by any standard. The inclusion of an external CD/DVD drive is a nice bonus for those who still rely on optical media. The touchscreen is also responsive (Dell is really good at this) and the keyboard allows the user to type comfortably with limited effort for extended periods of time. The range of ports should also please most users as it has 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C, 1x USB 2.0, 1x SD Card Reader, 1x HDMI 1.4, and 1x Headset Jack. The connectivity is great too, bringing Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth to guarantee speedy quality in connections. The 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen is a treat for both work and play, and you’ll absolutely love it. With a 1920×1080 resolution, anti-glare coating and narrow bezels, you’ll see exceptional vibrant colors and well-defined details and the added convenience in touch functionality is extremely useful for presentations. The OS is a huge premium here too, being a certified copy of Windows 11 Pro for advanced security, integrated Microsoft services support, great interactivity, and a great interface that is optimized for productivity. The preinstalled Office Pro Suite with a lifetime license for latest versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and countless other productivity and business tools is a great feature. As a bonus for the office worker/collaborator, the Microsoft Copilot AI is a great new integration tool. As an AI-assisted workflow tool, it is great for accelerating productivity by automating repetitive tasks and making intelligent suggestions for later on and keeping the user organized as a task planner to support productivity. Copilot is implemented to simplify the job and make it both less intimidating and less time-consuming. If youâve been waiting for a sign to upgrade your tech, this might just be it.

    "title": "‘Predator: Killer of Killers’ Just Rules",
    "article_text": "After twodivisiveÂ and ultimatelyfailedattempts to revitalize thePredatorfranchise in the 2010s, 20th Century Studios found its stride with 2022âsPrey. While sadly locked to Hulu as a result of the Disney-Fox merger, that film was met with such a strong reception that it gave the sci-fi horror franchise the boost itâd been needing. Now, the studio is keeping that momentum going with two projects in 2025:Predator: Badlandsin November, and this week’s animatedKiller of Killers.Â Beyond their being linked by returningPreydirector Dan Trachtenberg (co-directing here with Josh Wassung, and working off a script by Micho Robert Rutale from a story by Rutale and Trachtenberg), this future trilogy seems to have been made with the intent of bringing a specific set of ideas and concepts for thePredatorfranchise to fruition. On its own, that’s not surprising, as the franchise tried this before with its 2018 film, and its sibling seriesAlienÂalso recently made this same play with 2024’sAlien: Romulus. What makes all the difference is how much Trachtenberg, Wassung, and Rutare make an earnest effort to letKiller of Killersfunction as its own work that’s informed by, but not reliant on, its predecessor, even as the two can’t help but be in conversation with one another. And as withPrey,Âthe end result is a project that succeeds at nearly everything it sets out to do, so much that it’s a shame it can’t getthe full, theatrical rollout something as fun and sublime as this almost definitely deserves. Like prior films,Killerfocuses on a cast of humans enacting violence on their fellow man just before a technologically superior alien from another world suddenly arrives looking to shed some blood. WhereasPreytook its time showing how Naru and its Predator both moved through the space of the 1719 Great Plains,Killeris more fast-paced. This is a movie that prioritizes action and gore over tension, but thatâs not as much of a betrayal as it sounds. That action can often be tense, both in how viscerally violent it is and in how relentless the Predators are in pursuit of their targets. It helps that co-directors Trachtenberg and Wassunghave brought over a key part of what made that previous film such a delight: the continuously shifting power dynamics between the hunters and the poor souls theyâve set their sights on.Â Â Each of the three storiesâ841 AD’s “The Shield;” “The Sword,” set in 1629 Japan; and “The Bullet,” set in WWII’s North Pacificârun 20 minutes and play out more or less as youâd expect based on their setting. That predictability and narrative slightness ends up working inKiller of Killersâfavor, since main characters Ursa (Lindsay LaVanchy), ninja Kenji (Louis Ozawa), and pilot John Torres (Rick Gonzalez) get just enough backstory to inform their personal plights and make them compelling even before their respective Predators enter the picture. Ursa and Kenjiâs tales are more somber, not entirely unlike Naruâs inPrey. Conversely, Torres is a considerably chattier character, and his story has more humorous beats. That has the potential to feeling like too sharp a contrast, but by the time his story comes, the film’s earned enough goodwill that it doesn’t undermine things, and the eventual payoff for what everything has built up to is satisfying and fun in its own right. What unites the trio thematically is their ability to outwit the aliens looking to add some new spines to their collections.Predatormovies have always been considered slashers where the victims are just as capable as they are helpless, and that through line continues inKillers. The film takes full advantage of its individual settings to show how the humans come to understand and quickly adapt to the Predatorsâ bag of tricks, and the solutions they each come up with to turn the tide of battle (or even just to get a breather) are pretty clever. The Predators themselves are a nice, diverse bunch, and while not as characterized asPreyâsFeral hunter, they have a similar curiosity and mean streak that imbues them with just enough personality. Visually,KillerÂis a pretty nice movie to look at, made more impressive by this being the series’ first full foray into animation. The CG/3D art style is reminiscent ofArcane,Âbut animated at a frame rate similar toNinja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Âgiving individual movements a particular weight. For a movie with a lot of action, 20th Century Animation and Third Floor have come up with several impressive battle scenes that’ll feel familiar but are pulled off with an impressive amount of flourish and gore that it won’t matter. (A long take involving Ursa and her raiders is just one of several fist-pumping highlights throughout.) And when it’s not showing off how bloody fights with the Predator can be, the film is showing off impressive vistas and providing such scale that it’s again a shame this can’t ever come to the big screen. The strength of its individual stories would makeKiller of Killersworthwhile on its own, but its final act brings things home with one fun beat after another that feels like the team wanted to get everything they could into this project. By the time itâs laid down all the cards and revealed what everythingâs all been building up to and where it could go next, itâs easy to come away impressed at how self-assured and confident it carries itself the entire time. Live-action franchises can stumble when they take exotic vacations to the world of animation, but that’s not the case hereâthis film’s more than got the goods and is a fine addition to the Predatorâs recent resurgence.

    "title": "How Mike Flanagan Will Make ‘Carrie’ Feel Like a New Story",
    "article_text": "Horror and literature fans alike will be excited to hear that seasoned Stephen King cinematic universe storytellerMike Flanaganhas something new planned for hisCarrieadaptation. The eight episode mini-series proposed by Amazon was an idea Flanagan initially balked at. He toldVariety, “I initially thought, ‘Why? Itâs been done.â You can’t blame him for hesitating; the book has already been adapted several times. But after giving it considerable thought, he said, âI found an answer to that question, and it made me very excited.” He then turned to someone who obviously needed to be part of the discussion: famed horror author Stephen King, who Flanagan has had a fruitful working relationship withâincluding on his current featureThe Life of Chuck. “But when I went to Steve, his answer was ‘Why?’ His first response was, ‘Leave her alone. Sheâs been through enough.’ But itâs that thing where the more information I could share, and sending him the bible and the plan for the show, he could see the thing we were trying to do that was new.” Flanagan explained. “Then he said without giving away too much, ‘Ohh, now Iâm interested, just as a fan. Iâm excited to see where this goes.’ Once he said yes, then we were off, because if Steve had said no, I wouldnât do it. So the relationship has evolved, but heâs always remained incredibly respectful of separating the book and the movie.” TheDoctor Sleepfilmmaker seeks to modernize the narrative we know about Carrie’s struggle to fit in, not just at school but at home. How that would transform in the digital age informed his take. “The thing I would say is the original story is half a century old and itâs wonderful. Its themes were about youth and bullying and the consequences of that. I believe that in todayâs modern world, the power of what it means to be a bully, the breadth of that and the impact of bullying, have changed a lot,” he said. “The central tenets are still the same, but itâs about much more than Carrie White,” Flanagan teased, hinting that while other on-screen adaptations centered on Carrie, he plans on deeper explorations of the other characters and world around her as well. “I canât really talk about what weâre doing, I can only really talk about what weâre not doing. Weâre not retelling the story as itâs been told, and weâre not making a show about telekinesis. Itâs in there, but thatâs not what itâs about,” he said, ruling out about leaning too much into Carrie’s supernatural inclinations. “Thereâs a version of it where Carrie White carries a tragic superhero origin story that goes horribly wrong. I feel like theyâve done that, too.” This new version of the story will seemingly tie into how social structures have become more toxic, in the age of online platforms becoming places of radicalization even when kids leave schools. “Weâre focused way more on the destruction of a community through these very modern tools. What happens in a world where the internet has created an environment of perceived anonymity? Carrie White in the locker room in every iteration is a horrifying scene,” he said. “Carrie White in the locker room when people have phones in their hands is a whole different thing.” That definitely brings to mind contemporary youth-centered dramas such asAdolescencebut by way of Stephen King Horrorâand we can’t wait to see what Flanagan comes up with.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Keep scrolling down our page and you'll soon bump into ourWordletips, designed to help you find fresh insight on your daily game, as well as a freshly written clue for the June 6 (1448) puzzle and, as ever, today's Wordle answer too. Whether you need a little or a lot of help, we've got your game covered. Talk about a fight. I don't think I've seen such a stubborn Wordle. What looked like a helpful smattering of early yellows soon turned into a mini nightmare, the pair refusing to turn green no matter where I tried to place them. This puzzle didn't just take me all six rows, I really had to stop and think for a bit if I wanted to rescue my win streak. Something (or someone, if you're lucky) who can teach or instruct in a way that feels not just helpful, but truly enlightening, could be called this. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. One more win—congrats. The answer to the June 6 (1448) Wordle isEDIFY. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty.

    "title": "Luma Labs' new Modify Video tool can reimagine scenes without reshooting",
    "article_text": "Turn flailing on the floor into floating in space When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Luma Labs is known for producing AI videos from scratch, but the company has a new feature for its Dream Machine that can utterly transform real video footage in subtle or blatant ways, even if it's just an old home movie. The new Modify Video feature does for videos something like the bestPhotoshoptools do for images. It can change a scene's setting, style, even whole characters, all without reshooting, reanimating, or even standing up. The company boasts that the AI video editing preserves everything that matters to you from the original recording, such as actor movement, framing, timing, and other key details, while altering anything else you want. The outfit you're wearing, which you've decided wasn't you, is suddenly an entirely different set of clothing. That blanket fort is now a ship sailing a stormy sea, and your friend flailing on the ground is actually an astronaut in space, all without the use of green screens or editing bays. Luma’s combination of advanced motion and performance capture, AI styling, and what it calls structured presets makes it possible to offer the full range of reimagined videos. All you need to do is upload a video of up to 10 seconds in length to get started. Then pick from the Adhere, Flex, or Reimagine presets. Adhere is the most subtle option; it focuses on minimal changes, such as the clothing adjustment below or different textures on furniture. Flex does that but can also adjust the style of the video, the lighting, and other, more obvious details. Reimagine, as the name suggests, can completely remake everything about the video, taking it to another world or remaking people into cartoon animals or sending someone standing on a flat board into a cyberpunk hoverboard race. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It all depends on not just prompts, but reference images and frame selections from your video if you choose. As a result, the process is much more user-friendly and flexible. Although AI video modification is hardly unique to Luma, the company claims it outperforms rivals like Runway and Pika due to its performance fidelity. The altered videos keep an actor’s body language, facial expressions, and lip sync. The final results appear as an organic whole, not just stitched-together bits. Of course, the Modify Video tools have limitations. These are still capped at 10 seconds per clip for now, which keeps things manageable in terms of wait times. However, if you want a longer film, you need to plan and work out how to artistically incorporate different shots into one film. Still, features like the ability to isolate elements within a shot are a big deal. Sometimes you have a performance you're very happy with, but it's supposed to be a different kind of character in a different setting. Well, you can keep the performance intact and swap a garage for the sea and your actor's legs for a fish tail. It is genuinely impressive how quickly and thoroughly the AI tools can rework a bit of footage. These tools aren't just a gimmick; the AI models are aware of performances and timelines in a way that feels closer to human than any I've seen. The AI models don't actually understand pacing, continuity, or structure, but they are very good at mimicking these aspects. While the technical and ethical limitations will prevent Luma Labs from recreating the entire cinema at this point, these tools will be tempting for many amateur or independent video producers. And while I don't see it becoming as widely used as common photo filters, there are some fun ideas in Luma's demos that you might want to try.

    "article_text": "SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has claimed that his company“will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,”after President Donald Trump threatened to terminate all US government subsidies and contracts with Musk’s firms. Trump and Musk engaged in a dramatic exchange on social media on Thursday over the US president’s“Big and Beautiful”federal tax and spending bill, which the former White House government efficiency czar had blasted as a“pork-filled, disgusting abomination”that would push the US into“debt slavery.” “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,”Trump stated on Truth Social, arguing that the only reason the Tesla CEO“went CRAZY”about the legislation was because it would cut tax credits for purchasers of his electric vehicles. “In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,”Musk responded in a post on X just minutes later. In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts,@SpaceXwill begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediatelypic.twitter.com/NG9sijjkgW Hours later, the billionaire appeared to walk back the threat, after one X user urged Musk to“cool off and take a step back for a couple days,”noting that both he and Trump were“better than this.” “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon,”Musk replied in a follow-up post. However, unlike his original statement, the reversal was not visible on his public timeline. Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon. It remains unclear whether Musk seriously intended to halt operations of the spacecraft, a move that would significantly disrupt the US space program. SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is the only US spacecraft currently certified and capable of sending American astronauts to space. NASA has relied on it to deliver cargo and crew to the International Space Station since 2020, following a long hiatus after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Boeing’s competing Starliner project suffered years of delays and technical malfunctions. Its first crewed flight last June – originally scheduled for 2017 – ended with two NASA astronauts stranded aboard the ISS, after the spacecraft was deemed unsafe for return. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams safely returned to Earth only in March, aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, after Trump urged Musk to help rescue the duo, while criticizing his predecessor Joe Biden for leaving them“stranded.” Earlier this year, NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos extended their seat-sharing agreement, which allows Americans to travel to the ISS aboard Soyuz spacecraft, through 2027. SpaceX has secured more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the US Air Force, and other government agencies since 2008, making it one of the country’s largest federal contractors. Trump has yet to clarify whether the US government will cancel any contracts with Musk and his companies.",

Spokespersons for the team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. On Wednesday, Bengaluru were celebrating their win the previous day over Punjab Kings in the final of the IPL's 18th edition, the world's richest T20 cricket league.

The White Wolves claimed their spot at the expanded 48-team 2026 finals on Thursday with a 0-0 draw in the United Arab Emirates, which guaranteed Kapadze's side a top-two finish in Group A, alongside already-qualified Iran.

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) was among the higher education institutions in the city thatstepped up efforts to accommodate studentsaffected by the US government’s ban. At least two other local universities have also received inquiries from affected students. On Wednesday (Jun 4) night, US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation “suspending the entry of foreign nationals” seeking to study at Harvard, citing its failure to address national security risks on campus.

A special team and an email hotline were set up for the transition. At least five universities in Hong Kong have invited affected students to apply for admission. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) said on Thursday that it had recently received inquiries from international students at US institutions. “If they applied to transfer to CUHK, the university will actively consider their application and immediately inform relevant departments to follow up,” it said. Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) also said it had received dozens of inquiries from students. City University of Hong Kong earlier extended support to students facing academic disruption. Hong Kong Baptist University previously emphasised its dedication to recruiting outstanding non-local students. PolyU had also encouraged students with admission offers from Harvard or who were currently enrolled there or at other top US universities to consider Hong Kong for their studies. The Trump administration citednational security concerns as the reason for the ban, alleging Harvard’s ties to foreign adversaries, including China. The US Department of Homeland Security has stated that international students currently at Harvard must either transfer or leave the country. Harvard hosts more than 10,000 international students, who make up roughly 30 per cent of its student body, including about 2,000 from China. The stand-off with Harvard is also part of Trump’s broader campaign against elite academic institutions, which began straight after his inauguration in January.

    "title": "More than half of affected Cordlife customers accept refund offer over mishandling of cord blood units",
    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Some customers are, however, continuing their legal action against the company over the mishandling of cord blood units. The cryogenic storage laboratory at Cordlife on Sep 17, 2024. (Photo: CNA/Ili Nadhirah Mansor) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: About 56 per cent of affected Cordlife customers have accepted the refund offers made by the company after itsmishandling of cord blood units. In a regulatory update on Friday (Jun 6), the private cord blood bank gave an update on the number of clients who have accepted its offers that were made in February and April 2024. The offers comprised a refund of the annual fees paid by affected clients from the onset of the \"temperature excursion\". For those affected, Cordlife had also offered to continue storing the cord blood units until their child reaches the age of 21 and to waive all future fees. Whenpreviously contacted by CNAin May last year, Cordlife declined to give the exact figure for the number of clients who had accepted the refunds. Its mishandling of cord blood units was first made public on Nov 30, 2023, when the Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that investigations were ongoing. Seven tanks storing cord blood units were exposed to temperatures above acceptable limits. About2,200 cord blood units were found damaged in one of the tanks, affecting at least 2,150 clients. In April last year, it was announced that another 5,300 cord blood units in a second tank and dry shipper weredeemed \"non-viable\". Some customers are, however, continuing their legal action against the company. In a bourse update on the matter on Apr 1, the company said it had received on Mar 28 two letters of demand from lawyers acting for two groups of affected clients. One group is claiming for damages for breach of contract and negligence, while the other group is requesting for compensation for costs, among other warranties and undertakings from Cordlife. The company received itsfirst letter of demandin May last year, while two other announcements were made in Aug 15, 2024 and Mar 1 on the same matter. In January, MOH renewed Cordlife's cord blood and human tissue banking service licences for a year, more than four months after it wasallowed to resume its cord blood banking servicesin a limited manner. The company said on Friday it intends to host a series of townhall sessions - both in-person and online - to continue engaging customers to address their concerns. In amedia invite last September, Cordlife talked up its new laboratory monitoring system to keep track of storage tank temperatures remotely and how it had hired more experienced laboratory staff and technicians to \"elevate standards further\". Cordlife added on Friday that it is also working closely with the Association for the Advancement of Blood & Biotherapies (AABB) and the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy (FACT) to restore both accreditations for its Singapore operations. In December 2023, itlost its cellular therapy accreditationwith FACT. The suspension will last indefinitely, \"at a minimum until FACT’s investigations are completed and issues are resolved\", Cordlife then said. AABBfollowed suit in August last year, with the international blood bank body withdrawing Cordlife's accreditation for the collection, processing, storage and distribution of cord blood. The company also provided an update on its Singapore operations, which were given the go-ahead by authorities to fully resume in January. \"While collection rates remain below the company’s pre-incident average, the full resumption of its Singapore operations represents an encouraging step forward in restoring client confidence and rebuilding operational momentum,\" it said. \"The company has also strengthened and renewed its relationships with the medical community, particularly in Singapore. It has been proactively engaging hospitals, doctors, nurses and other stakeholders within the medical community to ensure they are fully informed on the company’s rectification efforts and improved procedures,\" Cordlife added. Cordlife said it would continue to expand its outreach initiatives with the aim of returning to \"pre-incident levels of performance\" and would continue to update shareholders when there are material developments. For the financial year ending Dec 31, 2024, the group's revenue fell 50.4 per cent to S$27.6 million (US$21.4 million), with Cordlife primarily attributing the decline to the suspension of its Singapore operations. Its FY2024 revenue in Singapore was minus S$2 million, a steep reverse from S$24.7 million in 2023. In a separate bourse filing, Cordlife said it had appointed current group executive director Chen Xiaoling as its group CEO and Singapore CEO with effect from Thursday. The board said that it had considered Ms Chen's \"proven track record\" within the group as well as her qualifications, working experience, leadership capabilities and contributions. She will continue to serve as group executive director alongside her new roles, it added. Ms Chen was among nine people arrested earlier in connection with the mishandling of cord blood units. Non-independent non-executive directors,Mr Zhai Lingyun,Mr Yiu Ming Yiuand Mr Chow Wai Leong, Cordlife's chief financial officerMs Thet Hnin Yi, the company's former Group CEOTan Poh Lan, acting chairman Ho Choon Hou as well as independent directors Yeo Hwee Tiong and Titus Jim Cheong Tuck Yan were previously arrested and released on bail. In relation to a separatepolice report that was lodgedby Cordlife's board of directors in April last year over \"potential wrongdoings\" of former employees amid an internal probe into why the cord blood units in one of the tanks were damaged, the company said it had not received any update regarding that case. \"The company will continue to provide its full cooperation to the relevant authorities, as and when needed, for any subsequent investigations in connection with the police report,\" it said in a separate bourse filing on Friday.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Former Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean will first join Temasek Holdings’ board as deputy chairman on Jul 1 before becoming its fifth chairman on Oct 9. Temasek Holdings has named former Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean as its fifth chairman. Mr Teo will succeed Mr Lim Boon Heng who has been the state investor's chairman since 2013. (Photos: Temasek Holdings) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Temasek Holdings said on Friday (Jun 6) that former Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean will succeed Mr Lim Boon Heng as its fifth chairman. Mr Teo, whoretired from politics in Apriland did not contest in the recent General Election, will first join Temasek’s board as deputy chairman on Jul 1. He will take over as chairman on Oct 9 after the conclusion of Temasek’s third-quarter board meeting, the state investor announced alongside other changes to its board. In its press release, Temasek said Mr Teo had advanced Singapore’s interests in key areas such as geopolitics, as well as navigated complex challenges both in Singapore and abroad during his 53 years in public service. Mr Teo, 70, served as the chief of navy prior to entering politics. He made his political debut in 1992 when he was part of a People’s Action Party team that contested and won a by-election in Marine Parade GRC. He then moved to contest Pasir Ris GRC during the 1997 polls and was subsequently re-elected in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC five times. During his time in government, Mr Teo helmed the home affairs, defence, education and environment ministries, among other roles. A core member of Singapore’s third-generation leadership team, he later served as deputy prime minister between 2009 and 2019 before being appointed as senior minister. The political veteran also held the role of coordinating minister for national security from 2011 and oversaw other portfolios, such as the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group and the National Climate Change Secretariat, until he stepped down from politics. “He guided Singapore’s agencies to adopt a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to address complex issues such as population matters and climate change, including the formulation of practical decarbonisation and net-zero goals,” Temasek said. “In a rapidly changing world, his wealth of experience and strategic insights will bring valuable perspectives to Temasek as it continues to evolve and grow as a global investment company,” it added. In a separate statement, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said: “I thank Mr Lim for his dedicated service at Temasek. Under his stewardship, Temasek has expanded its global presence, strengthened its governance processes, and established itself as a leader in sustainable development.” “I also welcome Mr Teo as the incoming chairman. With his extensive experience in public service and deep understanding of Singapore’s strategic priorities, I am confident he will build on Temasek’s strong foundations and steer its continued success in an increasingly complex global environment,” added Mr Wong, who is also finance minister. His predecessor, Mr Lim, has been chairman of Temasek since 2013, when he took over from former Cabinet minister S Dhanabalan. Mr Lim himself held several key Cabinet positions in the government from 1993 to 2011, including second minister for trade and industry and minister in the Prime Minister’s Office. He was also the secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress from 1993 to 2006. The 77-year-old retired from politics in 2011 and joined Temasek as a director the following year. Temasek said it established itself as a global investor under Mr Lim’s chairmanship. Its net portfolio value grew from S$223 billion (US$174 billion) in March 2014 toS$389 billion in the last financial year. Since 2014, it also expanded its footprint into developed markets across Europe and the United States, which are now home to nearly half of its 13 offices around the world. Its portfolio exposure to these developed markets has since doubled. Among his other contributions, Mr Lim paid close attention to talent renewal, especially when it came to increasing Temasek’s international representation, the firm said. He also guided Temasek through its leadership transition in 2021, when Mr Dilhan Pillay took over from Madam Ho Ching as Temasek’s CEO. Temasek noted that Mr Lim has been an advocate of good corporate governance and sustainability in its portfolio companies through engagement forums like the annual Temasek Roundtable and its flagship Ecosperity conference which started in 2014. Mr Lim also guided Temasek’s various community contributions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when it led response efforts that included distributing essential supplies and medical equipment. Mr Lim championed tripartism through the Temasek Tripartite Conversations and also helped shape Temasek’s T2030 strategy in 2019, which served as its 10-year road map to construct a resilient and forward-looking portfolio, among other contributions. Reflecting on his 13 years at Temasek, Mr Lim said he has been “privileged to work with a capable, dedicated team unified by a strong sense of purpose and commitment to excellence”. “I am always inspired by my colleagues’ collective conviction that, like generations before us, we must always act today with tomorrow clearly in our minds,” he said. He added that he is pleased that Mr Teo will guide Temasek into its next chapter of growth. “His remarkable depth of experience in public service, combined with his seasoned wisdom on both local and global affairs, makes him the right helmsman for Temasek as we navigate increasingly choppy waters while remaining true to our purpose to ensure every generation prospers,” said Mr Lim. Speaking about his new appointment, Mr Teo thanked Mr Lim for his service to Temasek. He said that in the current era of deepening global uncertainty, Singapore must “remain clear-minded on critical matters such as international relations, security and climate change”. “As a key Singapore institution with a global investment footprint, Temasek understands that its long-term success requires both addressing today’s risks and opportunities and anticipating tomorrow’s trends,” said Mr Teo. “I look forward to working with Temasek’s board, management team and members of the wider Temasek family to build on the achievements of Temasek and chart a path for its continued success in the new global environment.” Mr Pillay said Mr Lim has been an inspirational figure and “exemplifies what it means to be a steward leader”. “Benefitting from his strong moral compass and wise counsel, we have strengthened our position as a globally recognised investment company, while remaining true to our Singapore roots and values,” said the Temasek CEO. He added that Mr Lim’s championing of the Temasek Tripartite Conversations has been particularly meaningful, as these dialogues have built “important bridges between Temasek, (its) portfolio companies and union representatives”. Doing so has created “a culture of trust and collaboration that fortifies the ecosystem with greater resilience”, he added. Mr Pillay also welcomed Mr Teo, saying that the state investor is privileged to benefit from his perspectives and extensive experiences. “We look forward to his stewardship as we navigate the opportunities and challenges ahead.” Temasek also announced three other retirements from its board. Deputy chairman Cheng Wai Keung and board director Stephen Lee will be retiring on Jun 30 after nearly 14 years and 8 years of service respectively. Director Bobby Chin will also retire on Jul 31 after serving for 11 years. “As respected business leaders with diverse expertise, they have guided the company’s investment and portfolio management deliberations,” Temasek said. “Their global perspectives on industry developments, tripartism, governance and risk management have been instrumental in upholding Temasek’s reputation for sound stewardship and accountability.” Temasek, which marked its 50th anniversary last year, was first formed as a holding company for the government’s assets, such as DBS and Singapore Airlines. From an initial Singapore-based portfolio made up of 35 companies valued at S$354 million, Temasek has since grown into a global investor with a multibillion-dollar portfolio.

    "title": "From bromance to brickbats: Timeline of the Trump-Musk breakup",
    "article_text": "World World US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk attend a press conference in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US on May 30, 2025. (File photo: REUTERS/Nathan Howard) US President Donald Trump on Thursday (Jun 5) threatened to cut off government contracts with Elon Musk's companies, as the once-close relationship between the world's most powerful man and its richest unravelled publicly on their rival social media platforms. Trump said in a televised Oval Office diatribe that he was \"very disappointed\" after his former aide and top donor criticised his \"big, beautiful\" spending Bill before Congress. The pair then hurled insults at each other on social media – with Musk even posting, without proof, that Trump was referenced in government documents on disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The row could have major political and economic fallout, as shares in Musk's Tesla car company plunged and the South African-born tech tycoon vowed that he would end a critical US spaceship program. Speculation had long swirled that a relationship between the world's richest person and its most powerful could not last long – but the speed of the meltdown took Washington by surprise. MAY 22 House Republicans on May 22, took a major step forward on President Donald Trump's agenda,approving a legislative packagethat combines tax breaks, spending cuts, border security funding and other priorities. House committees laboured for months on the Bill, which underwent late changes to win over holdouts in the Republican conference. It exceeds 1,000 pages and is titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a nod to Trump himself. Republicans made one last round of revisions before the Bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who did not believe the Bill did enough to curb spending. The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act - which has now moved to the Senate - would usher into law Trump's vision for a new \"Golden Age\", led by efforts to shrink social safety net programmes to pay for a 10-year extension of his 2017 tax cuts. Musk, in an interview with CBS News, criticised the Bill - but in relatively tame language. \"I was disappointed to see the massive spending Bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk said \"I think a Bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion,\" Musk added. In a separate interview with the Washington Post, Musk said: \"The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised.\" \"I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.\" Less than a week later, the gloves came off and the tone became significantly more confrontational. \"I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending Bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" Musk wrote on his X platform. \"It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to US$2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.\" Musk also posted on X: \"In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\" referring to the Senate elections which are scheduled to be held on Nov 3, 2026. On Wednesday, Musk made several posts on X about the Bill, writing that \"a new spending Bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 trillion dollars\". In another post later in the day, he wrote: \"Call your Senator, Call your Congressmen, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.\" He also called the spending Bill the \"Debt Slavery Bill\", as, according to him, the Bill contains the largest increase in the debt ceiling in US history. Trump, after he met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, addressed Musk's criticisms and added that he anticipated Musk criticising him personally. “Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “They’re having a hard time - the electric vehicles - and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidies. And, you know, Elon knew this from the beginning.” \"Look, Elon and I had a great relationship.

But I'm, I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.\" He went on to say Musk knew the inner workings of the Bill. On Wednesday, Musk posted on X: \"Slim Beautiful Bill for the win\". Musk then replied to this post on X at 12.13PM, writing: \"Keep the good, remove the bad.\" Musk appeared to respond in real time to Trump’s claims from the Oval Office about the EV mandate. \"Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the Bill, even though no oil& gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the mountain of disgusting pork in the Bill,\" he said. \"In the entire history of civilisation, there has never been legislation that is both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this! \"Either you get a big and ugly Bill or a slim and beautiful Bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.\" Musk then responded to a clip of Trump from the Oval Office that said Musk knew the inner workings of the bill. \"False. This Bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\" Musk wrote on X. At 12.44pm, Musk, in a repost of X user Jesse Paltan's post, who compiled a number of Trump's old tweets in a picture, wrote: \"Where is this guy today?\" At 1.57pm, Musk launched a poll on X with the question: \"Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80 per cent in the middle?\" The poll is now pinned to his X account. More than four million people have voted. Trump hit back on his social media platform, Truth Social: \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" Trump, in another Truth Social post, also said that he did not mind Musk turning against him, but \"he should have done so months ago\". \"This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, US$1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68 per cent Tax Increase, and things far worse than that,\" Trump said. \"I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" He added that the easiest way to save \"billions and billions of dollars\" was to \"terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!\" Musk then alleged that Trump is featured in secret government files on rich and powerful former Epstein associates. \"Time to drop the really big bomb: (Trump) is in the Epstein files,\" Musk posted on X. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public.\" Supporters on the conspiratorial end of Trump's base allege that Epstein's associates had their roles in his crimes covered up by government officials and others. They point the finger at Democrats and Hollywood celebrities, however, not at Trump himself, and no official source has ever confirmed that the president appears in any of the material. Musk did not reveal which files he was talking about, and offered no evidence for his claim. Musk, in a later post, responded to Trump's statements about the cancellation of his government contracts and said that \"SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately\".The vessel ferries cargo and people to the International Space Station for the US.

    "article_text": "Singapore Singapore Both platforms offered financial services in Singapore without valid capital markets services licences, in breach of the Securities and Futures Act, said the police and MAS. Screenshots of the Octa (left) and XM trading platforms, which will be blocked in Singapore from Jun 20, 2025. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Two overseas online trading platforms will be blocked in Singapore after they were found to have breached financial regulations, according to a joint news release from the police and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Friday (Jun 6). The websites of the platforms, Octa and XM, will be inaccessible to users in Singapore from Jun 20. Their services - including leveraged foreign exchange, commodities, indices and equities trading - were offered to Singapore customers without licences under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). This is in breach of the Act, the police and MAS said. The capital markets services licence is required for an entity to carry out business dealing in capital markets products, which include securities and leveraged foreign exchange trading, the authorities said. Investigations revealed that Octa and XM had also actively offered and marketed their services to customers in Singapore. The platforms are operated by entities incorporated overseas – Octa by Octa Markets and Uni Fin Invest, purportedly based in the Union of Comoros and Mauritius respectively; and XM by XM Global, purportedly incorporated in Belize. The authorities stated that these entities do not hold licences to deal in capital markets products and are therefore prohibited from offering such services. \"This prohibition extends to entities operating outside Singapore, when the entities solicit or advertise products or services that are targeted at Singapore persons, or if there is a substantial number of Singaporeans using a foreign entity's products or services,\" the release said. The information on their websites constitutes prohibited content under the Internet Code of Practice, the authorities added. \"As such, access to both trading platforms’ websites will be blocked for Singapore residents with effect from Jun 20 and consumers with active accounts with Octa and XM will not be able to access their websites through Internet Access Service Providers based in Singapore.\" The police and MAS advised the public to deal only with licensed platforms listed in MAS' Financial Institutions Directory. They added that unregulated online trading platforms, particularly those based outside Singapore, pose a greater risk of fraud since the credibility of their operations cannot be easily verified. Such platforms also offer limited recourse for consumers in the event of disputes. They may also require payment for trades to be made using credit or debit cards, posing the added risk of unauthorised card transactions, said the authorities. They added that they will continue to work together to block access to unlicensed overseas trading services.

    "article_text": "World World In this image made from video, people lay flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the Hillcrest Primary School in Devonport, Tasmania, Australia, on Dec 17, 2021. (Photo: Channel 9 via AP) SYDNEY: An Australian woman whose bouncy castle was blown into the air by a freak wind event, killing six children, was found not guilty on Friday (Jun 6) of failing to meet her health and safety duties. In December 2021, a gust of wind lifted the inflatable castle about 10m into the air while children were celebrating the end of their year at a primary school in Devonport, northern Tasmania. Six children died and three were seriously injured. Rosemary Gamble, owner of party equipment company Taz-Zorb that operated the bouncy castle, was charged with failing to comply with a workplace health and safety duty. She pleaded not guilty and on Friday the Devonport Magistrates Court dismissed the charges against her. Magistrate Robert Webster said the bouncy castle was lifted into the air by an \"unprecedented weather system, namely a dust devil\". \"Gamble could have done more or taken further steps however given the effects of the unforeseen and unforeseeable dust devil, had she done so, that would sadly have made no difference to the ultimate outcome,\" Webster said in his decision. \"In those circumstances I find the charge is not proved. It is therefore dismissed.\" Gamble said she accepted how \"deeply and tragically this incident impacted so many people and families\". \"I realise those scars will remain for an extremely long time, likely forever,\" she said in a statement to the Australian national broadcaster ABC. \"There are no words to describe how I have felt ever since that tragic incident took so much away from so many people and left nothing but heartbreak and emptiness in its place. \"I never meant for something like this to happen. And I am just so sorry that it did.\" Andrew Dodt, the father of one of the children who died in the incident, said he had been \"broken for a long time\". \"And I think I'm going to be broken for a lot more,\" Dodt said in a statement to the ABC.

Chin Mee Chin Confectionery (CMC), one of Singapore’s oldest coffee shops, is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Since 1925, CMC has been at the same location, in the heart of Katong, serving time-honoured recipes of kaya toast and kopi including their signature kaya toast–iconic round buns generously slathered with homemade kaya and cold butter. In 2018, CMC weathered a manpower crunch that nearly forced its closure. A revival bySingapore’s Ebb & Flow Group in 2021ensured that CMC could continue serving the community with its breakfast favourites. Since then, CMC has also introduced a wider variety of contemporary flavours to complement its classic offerings. To commemorate their anniversary, CMC will be launching a series of anniversary activities from June to August, featuring limited-edition merchandise, memorabilia, blind bags, as well as new menu items. From Jun 23 to 29, between noon to 4pm, customers who spend S$25 or more in-store will get a chance to draw a limited edition CMCoin from a blind draw box. Embossed with the coffee shop’s iconic kopi cup, there are 99 silver coins and just one rare gold coin available. These coins can later be redeemed for special gifts in July – a token of appreciation from CMC to its customers. Throughout the month of July, 99 lucky holders of the silver CMCoin can redeem an exclusive 100-year CMC T-shirt (worth S$38), while the one grand winner of the rare gold coin will win a two day one night stay at Artyzen Singapore (deluxe room with breakfast for two worth S$565++). The limited-edition 100-year CMC T-shirts are also available for purchase at S$38 each, while stocks last. From Aug 1 to 15, with every in-store purchase of S$25 and above, customers will get a turn at the CMClaw Machine for a guaranteed chance to take home a mystery keychain blind bag inspired by old-school calendars. Inside, its keychains are available in five designs inspired by CMC’s iconic elements – the CMC Shopfront, CMC Merchandise, CMC Kaya and Toast, CMC Pastry Set, and the CMC Kopi Pour. Only one blind bag can be won per transaction, regardless of total spend. CMC will also be launching special 100-year menu items, including the Curry Pork Chop (S$8.80), Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Mustard Greens (S$10.80), and the Peranakan treat Pang Susi (S$2.80). Other new additions include the Kaya French Toast (S$6), Peanut Butter French Toast (S$7), or Nutella French Toast (S$8), each a playful nod to CMC’s nostalgic menu. CMC has also collaborated with Artyzen Singapore hotel for The Heart of SG60, a special culinary campaign from May to October hosted at Cafe Quenino. From June to October, CMC’s iconic kaya will be featured in a decadent mille-feuille and woven throughout the hotel’s breakfast and high tea offerings. CMC’s modern interpretation of Hainanese beef brisket will also be served alongside Cafe Quenino’s creamy mashed potatoes. “As one of the nation’s oldest heritage coffee shops, this collaboration reflects our shared commitment to honouring tradition while embracing fresh, creative interpretations,” said Chin Mee Chin about the collaboration with Cafe Quenino. “It’s a celebration of where we’ve been, where we’re going, and the enduring flavors that connect us all.\" Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Commentary: Why Singapore PM Wong's recent comments on Israel actions in Gaza are significant",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Around the world, there is an increasing distinction between support for Israel and for the Netanyahu government, amid concern that restricting aid into Gaza may breach international law, says Clemens Chay from the NUS Middle East Institute. This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: Last week, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that Israel’s restriction of aid into Gaza may be a “likely breach of international humanitarian law” that “cannot be justified”. The comments were the strongest so far by Singapore’s leadership since the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct 7, 2023, and Israel’s response. Beyond the language, the fact that Mr Wong made those comments at ajoint press conference with visiting French President Emmanuel Macronwas significant: Of late, Mr Macron had himself emphasised that Europe should “harden its collective position” on Israel, including affording official recognition for a Palestinian state. This has come on the back of steps taken by the United Kingdom and Canada to denounce Israel’s latest military offensive in Gaza, including the threat of “concrete actions”. Perhaps what has raised eyebrows the most wasGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s recent comment that he could “no longer understand” what goal Israel was aiming to achieve with its latest Gaza offensive. It was a clear break from Germany’s longstanding “reason of state” – a special responsibility for Israel on account of the horrors perpetrated against European Jews by the Nazis. These actions point to a growing consensus internationally – even in the West – that Israel should not be given carte blanche in Gaza. But where do statements end, and actions begin? Following Mr Wong’s remarks, Acting Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs Faishal Ibrahim said he agreed with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who wrote in the newspaper Haaretz that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza. Prof Faishal took pains to note Israel’s contributions to “Singapore in our early years”, but said he thought it wastime “to be frank”. But while the Singapore leaders’ remarks received much attention, they should not be seen as a shift in our position. Just four months after Israel began retaliating for Hamas’ attacks, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told Parliament during the Committee of Supply debates on Feb 29, 2024 that its “military response has gone too far”. This followed his speech in November 2023, which outlined the three principles of Singapore’s position: zero tolerance towards terrorism; the right of self-defence dictated by international law; and that necessity and proportionality should be accounted for if military action is required for self-defence. Put simply, Singapore’s position that Israel was using disproportionate force was arrived at quickly. What is less talked about is Singapore’s longstanding support for Palestinian aspirations, including its voting record in the United Nations on the issue, and its constant backing for a two-state solution. After the Gaza war began, the government and people have backed their support with actions: The Republic of Singapore Air Force has deliveredseven tranches of humanitarian aid to Gaza, totalling over S$19 million, including via air drop operations. The Singapore Armed Forces, together with the Ministry of Health, deployed a medical contingent in April to treat Palestinians in Egypt. When compared to the likes of China, whose aid delivery so far amounted to US$2.75 million – broken down into six shipments of food parcels – Singapore has again punched above its weight in the international arena. What is also significant about Mr Wong’s remark is that it mirrors the increasing daylight between support for Israel and for the Netanyahu government, around the world, particularly in the West. What began with robust Spanish support for the Palestinians grew into recognition (alongside Ireland and Norway) of a Palestinian state in May 2024, and has now broadened into criticism of Israeli conduct among Israel’s closest European friends. The European Union has even moved to review the EU-Israel Association Agreement – the basis for trade relations. Trouble for Israel is brewing across the Atlantic, too. United States President Donald Trump’s has reportedly expressed frustration with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, owing to a divide between the former’s desire to see an end to the war and the latter’s defiance. Mr Trump has blindsided Mr Netanyahu on several other occasions thus far, including negotiating a new nuclear deal with Iran, and brokering direct agreements with Hamas and the Houthis that left Israel sidelined and vulnerable. The US president’shigh-profile trip to the Middle Eastjust two weeks ago omitted Israel, which spoke volumes – and that is before one accounts for his decision to lift sanctions on Syria. To rub salt in the wound, Vice President JD Vance scrapped a planned visit to Israel, too, reportedly over concerns that such a trip would validate its renewed offensive into Gaza. It must be said, however, that the current wave of criticism remains just that. Whether the US, Europe, or others will apply more than vocal and symbolic pressure on Israel in order to change the situation on the ground remains to be seen. Nevertheless, prospects for ending the war remain bleak for one reason: Neither side in Gaza has come down from their hardline positions. For every move made by Israel that prolongs the conflict, Hamas has one of its own. It recently torpedoed a US-backed ceasefire proposal with additional demands. As US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said, the Hamas response “only takes us backward”, when the original intention was build momentum with “substantive negotiations in good faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire”. If external pressure is not working, perhaps domestic concerns will force a rethink, as discontent continues to percolate. In Israel, public letters by reservists denouncing the continuation of war and poll findings that indicate a lack of trust (at 70 per cent) in the government, point to Mr Netanyahu’s precarious position. The latest survey conducted by the Pew Research Center reveals that 53 per cent of Israelis view the prime minister unfavourably. Likewise, in Gaza, support for Hamas has dwindled. Findings released by the Palestinian Center for Policy Survey Research show a significant drop in Gazan support for Hamas, from 64 per cent in June 2024 to 39 per cent in September 2024. In March this year, Palestinians also took to the streets in the Strip to demonstrate against Hamas, with chants of “we want an end to the war”. This should make both sides realise that an off-ramp is needed quickly. If this is to happen sooner rather than later, consistent messages from Israel’s friends – like the ones from Singapore – rather than hopping between unconditional support and shrill warnings, will be key.

(File photo: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji) SEOUL: South Korea's right is looking to remake itself after a massive defeat in this week's snap presidential election that left it with little power to challenge the ruling Democratic Party. New leader Lee Jae-myungand his party now control parliament and the presidency with Tuesday (Jun 3)'s polls exposing the smouldering resentment in South Korea over former President Yoon Suk Yeol's botched martial law declaration in December. The attempt at military rule led to Yoon's removal from office and the eventual defeat of the conservative People Power Party, which was unable to overcome divisions within the right and unify around a single candidate. The defeat has left conservative leaders pointing fingers and trading blame as the party searches for a new direction. On Thursday, the PPP's floor leader, lawmaker Kweon Seong-dong, stepped down and called for the party to wipe the slate clean and rebuild the conservative movement.

I think we need deep soul-searching and reform,\" Kim said on Wednesday as he kneeled in apology to party members and the public. Others pointed to the PPP's failure to fully separate itself from Yoon's unpopular and unconstitutional martial law. \"They failed to draw in moderate voters,\" said political commentator Park Sangbyoung. \"Instead, Yoon Suk Yeol sided with far-right ideas, and Kim Moon-soo, who has a history of working with far-right groups, was their candidate.\" Park said the \"complete downfall\" of the conservatives could damage Korean politics. \"To be a true opposing force against the Lee administration, they need to be reborn, even resorting to blowing up the party and creating a new one,\" Park said. South Korea's conservatives have staged unlikely comebacks before. Yoon is the second conservative president in a row to be removed from office, after Park Geun-hye was impeached and jailed in a corruption scandal in 2017. Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University, said \"until they clear the mess inside\" it will be difficult for the right to stand up to Lee. \"Rather than crisis of conservatives, I would call it the falling of People Power Party because of its leadership that runs the party based on self-interests, not fundamental values,\" he said. In the wake of Yoon's impeachment, then-PPP leader Han Dong-hoon promised that the president would resign and the party would help lead an interim government. When Yoon and his backers rejected that plan and fought his removal, it divided the party and led to Han's resignation. On Wednesday Han, who unsuccessfully ran for the PPP nomination, said the party needs to cooperate with the new liberal administration on economy and security but it must not compromise on challenging any effort by the ruling party to \"destroy the judiciary system\". The PPP has accused the Democratic Party of trying to pass bills that they say are meant to shield President Lee, who faces a slew of corruption charges, from any further legal troubles. \"Please do not give up,\" Han said. \"It is the last chance to end the same old politics and to establish politics that put the people first.\" Lawmaker Park Jeong-hoon said in a Facebook post that the party must change if it wants to survive. \"We must tear down our house and rebuild it. This is not a matter of factions but a matter of the party's survival.\" Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

    "article_text": "Business Business FILE PHOTO: A container is loaded onto a cargo ship while docked at Hai Phong port in Hai Phong, Vietnam, April 16, 2025. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/ File Photo HANOI :Vietnam reported double-digit growth in exports and imports in May, government data showed on Friday, as shipments in and out of the industrial hub accelerated before the United States' threatened \"reciprocal\" tariffs take effect. Exports in May rose 17 per cent from a year earlier to $39.60 billion, while imports were up 14.1 per cent at $39.04 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $560 million for the month, the National Statistics Office said in a report. Earlier this week, the government had said exports had risen an annual 14 per cent in May. The Southeast Asian country faces a 46 per cent \"reciprocal\" tariff from President Trump if a trade deal cannot be negotiated before a pause on the levies ends in July. If the tariffs come into effect, they could seriously undermine a growth model that relies on exports to the United States, its top market. Consumer prices in May rose 3.24 per cent from a year earlier, the NSO said, while industrial production rose an annual 9.4 per cent and retail sales were up 10.2 per cent. Foreign investment inflows in the January-May period rose 7.9 per cent from a year earlier to $8.9 billion, the NSO said. Foreign investment pledges over the period soared 51.2 per cent to $18.4 billion.

    "article_text": "Business Business Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp is now offering S$900 million (US$699.9 million) to buy the chunk of insurer Great Eastern that it does not already own, almost a year after failing to gain full control of the firm. Under the conditional exit offer announced on Friday (Jun 6), OCBC is offering S$30.15 for the 6.28 per cent of the insurer's stock that it does not own. This values Great Eastern at S$14.27 billion and paves the way for the insurer to be taken private by its owner. In May 2024, OCBC offered S$25.60 apiece for the 11.56 per cent stake in Great Eastern. The new exit offer reflects a 17.8 per cent premium from the previous bid.

(Photo: Facebook/Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore - MPA) This audio is generated by an AI tool. SINGAPORE: A container barge, Marco Polo 802, ran aground off Tanjong Beach in Sentosa on Friday (Jun 6) morning, said the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). There were no reports of damage, injuries or pollution, said MPA, adding that navigational safety was not impacted. In a Facebook post on Friday, Sentosa said that there were no oil spillage sightings. MPA activated tugboats to tow the barge, which remained stable, out to sea. At 10.45am, CNA saw that the barge had been moved a distance away from the shore. Tugboats were also seen pulling another tugboat that was stuck in a floating sea barrier, near where the barge had been grounded. A video posted on Facebook by tour agency Kayakasia at about 7.30am on Friday shows the barge grounded just off Tanjong Beach. The beach remained open to the public during the grounding. \"MPA and Sentosa Development Corporation are working with the relevant agencies to ensure minimal disruption,\" said MPA, adding that it is investigating the incident.

    "title": "The Best Books to Read in May, Chosen By GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. When we’re notscrolling on SSENSE,interviewing celebrities, orthinking about pants, your favoriteGQeditors like to read—a lot. But what are the best books to read this month? We’re so glad you asked. Earlier this year, I made a resolution with my two close friends to read two books a month. We started a monthly book club to keep us on track, and now, I’m bringing it to work. Whether yourNew Year’s resolutionwas also to read more books, you’re looking to curb blue-light-induced migraines, or you just need a new title to performatively plop on your nightstand, we’ve got you covered. Here’s a round of novels (remember those?), memoirs, sociological texts, and photo books that your friendly neighborhoodGQstaff enjoyed in May. Viola Davis Barnes & Noble Length: 304 pages Three years ago, aBreakfast Club interviewclip ofViola Davispromoting her memoirFinding Metook me out of a major slump. In it, she recalls a quote she reposted on her social media: “You haven't met all the people who are going to love you in your life yet.” She adds, “When you meet all these people who are going to love you, they do not want to meet a vengeful person.” We often get stuck in nihilistic thought patterns that we forget that life isn't something that just has to happen to us, but an experience we can actively shape. This book has done more for me than five years of therapy. I recommend listening to the audiobook, because the EGOT-winner herself narrates it.—Heven Haile, Editorial Operations Manager Taffy Brodesser-Akner Barnes & Noble Length: 464 pages Though the premise of this book is pure drama, Brodesser-Akner’s snarky voice and gossipy tone manages to keep it juicy and surprisingly funny from top to bottom. I should caveat that I have a particular affinity towards books about characters on the verge of, or actively experiencing, mental breakdowns—and that’s precisely what you’re getting here. If reading about spoiled rich kids turned into maladjusted adults embroiled in toxic family drama sounds as good to you as it did to me, then you should grab a copy.—Camille Ramos, Coordinating Producer Macaela MacKenzie Barnes & Noble Length: 336 pages Women's sports is escalating in growth, influence, and coverage—but they've been fighting the good fight for much longer than the recent rise in attention over the past few years. This book helps paint the bigger picture of why the fight for equity in women's sports goes beyond just athletics and into economic equity for women in general.—Brauna Marks, Visuals Editor Eric Schnall Barnes & Noble Length: 296 pages Sweaty, sun-kissed, often about the reckless, sexually-charged self-discovery of the young, the coming-of-age novel is a summer staple for a reason. Eric Schnall’s winsome debutI Make Envy On Your Disco, however, is a reminder that coming into yourself is a lifelong project—and that sometimes that can happen in your late 30s, against the grey, cold climes ofBerlinat the turn of the millennium. That city in transition is the perfect backdrop for this perceptive, melancholy story about a New York art advisor who flees to Berlin to escape the anxieties of middle age and long-term relationships. Full of techno, espressos, hot serpentine boys in cafes, well-timed musical cues (from Ace of Base to Edith Piaf), and the occasional tab of ecstasy, it’s a comforting, elegantly-written reminder that there’s life after twink death.—Raymond Ang, Associate Director of Editorial Operations Eleanor Coppola Amazon Length: 304 pages I read this a while ago but pulled it off the shelf again while editing thisFrancis Ford Coppola interviewa few weeks back. Eleanor, who died in 2024, was Coppola’s wife, creative partner, and secret sharer of 62 years but also a writer/director in her own right. You might know her documentaryHearts of Darkness, an essential portrait of her husband battling self-doubt and all manner of jungle madness in the Philippines while shootingApocalypse Now, which he’s convinced is going to be a career-endingly bad movie;Notes, drawn from Eleanor’s diaries during theApocalypseera, is no less action-packed and glamorous but also more intimate and thorny in its depiction of Eleanor's relationship with the angst-ridden and sometimes feckless Francis Ford. Parts of it feel like a high-‘70sLost in Translation, even before Eleanor takes Sofia on a train to Kyoto.—Alex Pappademas, Culture Director George W.S. Trow Amazon Length: 112 pages This book-length essay, originally published inThe New Yorkerin 1984, is an almost hypnotic piece of avant-garde magazine writing and reporting—so obliquely rendered as to nearly elude summary. At the surface, it’s a story about the management of a laboratory-forest gifted to Harvard for the study of silviculture. (Yawn? I know.) But it becomes a wholly idiosyncratic and deliriously self-indulgent (non-derogatory!) journey through history. What do the letters of Teddy Roosevelt, the market-value method of accounting, and Soviet physicist Pyotr Kapitsa’s 1966 address to the Royal Society all have to do with a 3,800-acre Hudson Valley forest? Something about how the fallenness of our world stops us from knowing it, freely and simply.—Matthew Browne, Sr. Research Manager Jamie Kreiner Barnes & Noble Length: 288 pages When Jamie Kreiner’sThe Wandering Mind: What Medieval Monks Tell Us About Distractioncame out a few years ago, many reviews noted that our propensity to easily lose focus was not just a modern problem exacerbated by new technologies, but rather a situation that has afflicted humans since time immemorial (or at least in this case, since monks started keeping records of their mental intrusions). Reading about how monks grappled with a “parallel commitment,” juggling concentration on a higher power with more earthly obligations, was especially compelling. “A good renunciation story was aspirational but impossible. The world could not be left behind, not completely,” she observes. One potential solution? “To tackle distraction,\" Kreiner writes, \"it was crucial to identify something worthy of total concentration.” After all, whether sacred or secular, many of us wish to transcend the petty interruptions that keep us from reaching the divine (whatever that might be).—Julia Pagnamenta, Research Manager Jason Jules & Graham Marsh Barnes & Noble Length: 224 pages So many advancements in African American men’s fashion have been aspirational in nature. This was as true during the US mid-century as in our more recent hip-hop style palettes.Black Ivy’s deep captions and ample photos explore, in page after vivid page, Civil Rights Era style icons—ranging from artists to academics to athletes to activists—who pull inspiration from Brooks Brothers’ crisp yet staid prepwear. In the process of Black adaptation and recontextualization, upper-class WASP signifiers such as button-downs, sack suits, and penny loafers were transformed, via remixes and mashups, from cold to cool. And on a personal level, thanks to this essential volume, as a literal child of the ’60s whose classic fashion sense is often mistaken for white preppy instead of being seen as drawing from my true Black inspirations, I finally feel seen.—Gaylord Fields, Copy Manager",

    "title": "Can Hong Kong convince private hospitals to be clear and upfront with fees?",
    "article_text": "Health authorities begin consulting on proposals aimed at improving transparency in private hospital bills Knee replacement surgery is one of the most common operations performed in Hong Kong, with a long waiting time at public hospitals that drives many to pay more for private treatment. But a patient hoping to compare prices at the city’s 14 private hospitals will find it hard to get a clear idea of how much the procedure may cost. Only half the hospitals provide information online for knee replacement surgery packages, with prices ranging from HK$88,000 (US$11,200) to about HK$330,000 for one knee. One made clear that doctors’ fees were not included, meaning the final bill could be considerably higher. The Post called six other private hospitals, posing as a patient’s family member, but could not get a clear indication of what they charged. Staff at four hospitals said the patient would need a medical consultation first. The other two gave only rough estimates of between HK$180,000 and HK$300,000. “We do not provide such pricing information. You have to ask your doctor,” a staff member at one hospital said. “Each doctor charges differently.”",

Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who has led the party’s advocacy for suspected gang member Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, is celebrating his return to the U.S., saying, \"This is not about the man. It’s about his constitutional rights.\"(Fox News and Kevin Dietsch) Abrego Garcia, 29, has been returned to the U.S. and is facing charges in a sealed federal indictment in Tennessee for alleged conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens. Though many Democrats claim Abrego Garcia is an innocent man who was wrongly deported, the administration has pointed to considerable evidence he is a member of the MS-13 gang. Abrego Garcia allegedly movedillegal immigrantsfrom Texas to interior states in what prosecutors say was an organized operation stretching back years. He has also been accused of being a member of the violent Salvadoran gang MS-13. According to court records filed by his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, he also allegedly physically abused her on multiple occasions.

After Fox News Digital asked Van Hollen in May whether he was aware of the domestic violence allegations against Abrego Garcia before he went to visit him in El Salvador, the senator became defensive, saying, \"What I said here was these issues need to be litigated in the courts.\" In a statement Friday, Van Hollen doubled down on that sentiment, saying, \"As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man.

TheNavyon Friday announced a third destroyer is being sent to the southern border to aid in the ongoing efforts to patrol the U.S.-Mexico boundary in an effort to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Navy officials said the USS Cole, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, has departed Mayport, Florida, to support southern border operations. Earlier this year, the USS Spurance deployed from its homeport of San Diego, and the USS Gravely deployed from its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia. Both vessels are currently sailing in waters on either side of Mexico, with aCoast GuardLaw Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) team on board. Together, the crews will work closely with the Coast Guard to intercept drug trafficking operations.

The Gravely entered the Gulf of America on March 15, and since then has received support from P-8 aircraft assigned to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, allowing for enhanced and increased identification of illicit activity by the Coast Guard.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the status of negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and the latest on a prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine as the U.S. pushes for peace. The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned some 35 individuals involved in laundering money for Iran on Friday as the administration seeks to make a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program. A State Department spokesperson saidin a statementthat,\"This network has laundered billions of dollars through Iranian exchange houses and foreign front companies to sustain Tehran’s campaigns of terror that undermine international peace and security and line the pockets of regime elites.\" Meanwhile, tensions with Iran continue, withthe Associated Pressreporting that Western powers are considering a resolution at the IAEA that would formally declare Tehran in non-compliance with its nuclear obligations. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the move a \"strategic mistake\" and accused the U.K., France, and Germany of choosing \"malign action\" over diplomacy. \"Mark my words as Europe ponders another major strategic mistake: Iran will react strongly against any violation of its rights,\" hewrote on X. IRAN'S KHAMENEI REJECTS US ZERO URANIUM ENRICHMENT DEMAND AS '100% AGAINST' ITS INTERESTS A military truck carries a missile past a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during an annual military parade.(ATTA KENARE/AFP/Getty Images) The draft resolution, expected to be introduced next week, would mark the first time in two decades that Western nations bring such a motion against Iran at the IAEA. As U.S. and Iranian negotiators engage in fragile talks, voices from within Iran reveal a grim paradox: while many citizens desperately seek relief from crushing economic hardship, they fear any deal may only tighten the Islamic Republic's grip on power. \"Right now, people in Iran do not have any hope for anything,\" said a female journalist in Tehran, who spoke anonymously out of fear for her safety. \"The economy is collapsing. We sometimes don’t have electricity or water. The value of the rial is falling. Life is becoming unlivable.\" Like many Iranians, she believes an agreement could temporarily ease inflation and halt the country's economic freefall. But she—and many others—fear the unintended consequences. \"If the regime reaches a deal, it could become more powerful and more confident in suppressing people. That’s what frightens us the most,\" she said. Under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran has faced growing unrest at home, triggered by economic pain, political repression, and widespread mistrust. As negotiations proceed, Iranian citizens are watching closely—but not with optimism.

On the other, the economic burden is so heavy that any deal offering relief feels like a lifeline. But the truth is, even if a deal is signed, ordinary people won't benefit. We’ve seen this before.\" He pointed to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Obama-era nuclear agreement that promised economic benefits but, according to many Iranians, never delivered meaningful change for the public. \"Only those connected to the regime gained anything,\" he said. \"For the rest of us, life stayed the same.\" While Iranian leaders claim the nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and allies remain concerned about uranium enrichment levels nearing weapons-grade levels. Trump has demanded a full halt to enrichment, while Khamenei insists on retaining it. \"I’m a journalist, and we work under extreme censorship,\" said the woman in Tehran. \"We’re not allowed to mention U.S. or Israeli military capabilities. We can’t publish anything about the talks without approval.\" A model of a missile is carried by Iranian demonstrators as minarets and the dome of a mosque is seen in the background during an anti-Israeli gathering at the Felestin (Palestine) Sq. in Tehran, Iran, Monday, April 15, 2024.(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OPEN TO ALLOWING IRAN TO CONTINUE SOME URANIUM ENRICHMENT: REPORT She described a system where state censors dictate what reporters can and cannot say—down to the vocabulary. \"It’s not just the content—it’s the individual words. And that makes journalism almost impossible.\" In the interviews with Fox News Digital, Iranians expressed deep skepticism that Khamenei would abide by any agreement. \"He lies,\" the journalist said bluntly. \"What he says publicly isnever what he actually does. He manipulates both the public and foreign governments. No one should trust a dictator like him.\" The man echoed the sentiment. \"The regime's survival depends on itshostility toward the U.S.and Israel. If it truly committed to a deal, it would undermine its own ideological foundation. That’s why no one believes it can last.\" Recent months have seen a resurgence of protest activity in Iran, including a growing nationwidestrike by truck driversdemanding fair wages and lower fuel prices. Though largely ignored by international media, these strikes follow years of widespread protests—most notably the 2022 \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" uprising sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in morality police custody. That movement, along with economic demonstrations in 2019 and 2021, was met with violent crackdowns, mass arrests, and internet blackouts. The pattern has left Iranians wary that any sign of instability is met with brutal suppression. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An Iranian student pointed to the truckers’ strikes currently roiling parts of Iran as a sign of grassroots unrest. \"These strikes are a direct message from the people,\" he said. \"They’ve been largely ignored by the media, but they are powerful and legitimate.

    "title": "Snub of Musk's NASA nominee ally preceded sudden 'big, beautiful bill' criticism, Trump feud",
    "article_text": "The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses the latest developments in the feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. A day after the White House held a farewell press conference for SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to highlight his efforts as outgoing leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), PresidentDonald Trumpsuddenly pulled Musk ally Jared Isaacman as his pick for NASA administrator. While the White House released a May 30 video chroniclingMusk’s contributionsto DOGE and several X posts thanking him and listing various \"DOGE wins,\" the gestures were some of the last, final public actions of goodwill between Trump and Musk. On Saturday, Trump announced in a social media post he was pulling the nomination for Isaacman, a commercial astronaut and founder and CEO of payment processing company Shift4 Payments after \"a thorough review of prior associations.\" Trump also said he would unveil a \"new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space.\" MUSK CONFIDENT DOGE WILL SAVE $1 TRILLION AS GOVERNMENT COST CUTTING CONTINUES Jared Isaacman, the nominee for NASA administrator, was booted by the White House Saturday.(Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Isaacman’s affiliations with Musk include being an investor in SpaceX, in addition to leading two private spaceflight missions with SpaceX, including Inspiration4. The 2021 Inspiration4 mission was the first time an all-civilian crew orbited Earth. Isaacman addressed his pulled nomination in an episode of the \"All-In Podcast,\" which is hosted by four venture capitalists and covers business, technology and society, that dropped Wednesday. Specifically, Isaacman said he received a call from the White House May 30 notifying him his nomination wouldn’t advance because the White House had \"decided to go in a different direction.\" DOGE STAFFING SHAKEUP AS ELON MUSK HANGS UP HIS HAT, WHITE HOUSE CONFIRMS Isaacman said he suspected his ties to Musk were part of the decision, noting the call came the same day Musk’s tenure with DOGE concluded. \"I don’t need to play dumb on this,\" Isaacman said in the podcast. \"I don’t think that the timing was much of a coincidence, that there were other changes going on the same day. \"There were some people that had some axes to grind, I guess, and I was a good, visible target.\" Tensions between Musk and Trump continued to escalate after Musk’s departure as a special government employee May 30 and Isaacman’s withdrawn nomination the following day. President Donald Trump bought a Tesla from Musk at the White House as a show of support earlier in 2025 when the electric vehicle maker faced consumer backlash over Musk's political activism.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) Although Musk previously told CBS News in an interview clip released May 27 that he was disappointed by the House’s passage of Trump’s massive tax and spending package, the \"big, beautiful bill,\" because it would increase the federal deficit, Musk’s attacks on the measure ramped up exponentially after Trump rescinded Isaacman’s nomination. Specifically, on Tuesday, Musk labeled the measure a \"disgusting abomination\" and followed up by urging the American public to contact lawmakers to \"KILL the BILL\" in an X post Wednesday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that Trump was aware of Musk’s position on the bill and that it didn’t change the president’s stance on the measure. And Trump did not mince words Thursday as tensions between the two men reached a boiling point. Trump said Musk was irritated with provisions in the bill that would cut an electric vehicle tax credit that benefits companies like Tesla. He also suggested Musk may suffer from \"Trump derangement syndrome,\" a term used to describe deeply negative reactions to the president. UNFINISHED BUSINESS: THE BUDGET CUTS MUSK COULDN’T COMPLETE AND WHAT’S NEXT FOR DOGE \"I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,\" Trump said in the Oval Office during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair.\" Trump also specifically mentioned Isaacman’s nomination, claiming Musk recommended Isaacman for the role. But Trump voiced concern about Isaacman’s ties to the Democratic Party. \"He wanted and rightfully, you know, he recommended somebody that he, I guess, knew very well. I'm sure he respected him, but to run NASA,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"And I didn't think it was appropriate. And he happened to be a Democrat, like, totally Democrat. And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges. And one of the privileges is we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important.\" Elon Musk receives a golden key from President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, May 30, 2025.(Reuters/Nathan Howard) Trump then said he \"understood\" why Musk was upset over the pulled nomination. The White House directed Fox News Digital to Trump's comments Thursday and Isaacman's previous donations to Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Isaacman told the \"All-In Podcast\" he doesn’t think his past political donations to Democrats were a factor in his pulled nomination, and that he identifies as \"right-leaning.\" Isaacman and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Trump and Muskcontinued to trade barbs Thursday. At one point, Musk urged the removal of the \"disgusting pork\" included in Trump’s tax and spending bill. He also said it was \"false\" that he was shown the measure \"even once.\" Musk even went so far as to say Trump wouldn’t have won the 2024 election if it weren’t for Musk's backing. Meanwhile, Trump accused Musk of going \"CRAZY\" over cuts to the EV credits and said Musk was \"wearing thin.\" President Donald Trump is joined by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, and his son, X Musk, during an executive order signing in the Oval Office at the White House Feb. 11, 2025.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Although Politico reported that Trump and Musk were slated to speak Friday over the phone, Trump shut down speculation of a call between the two. \"No. I won’t be speaking to him for a while I guess, but I wish him well,\" Trump said, according to CNN. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I’m not even thinking about Elon. He’s got a problem. The poor guy’s got a problem,\" Trump said. Despite Musk’s departure, White House officials have said DOGE’s efforts to address waste, fraud and abuse will continue, and Trump and cabinet members will oversee DOGE.

    "article_text": "Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses the war of words between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and codifying DOGE cuts on ‘America Reports.’ FIRST ON FOX: While Tesla CEOElon Muskhas departed the Department of Government Efficiency amid a blazing public tiff with the president, congressional DOGE leaders are primed to carry on the legacy well beyond his tenure. \"It’s never easy to see two friends at odds, but DOGE is bigger than any one person,\" House DOGE Caucus chairman Aaron Bean, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital on Friday – expressing endearment towards both Musk and PresidentDonald Trump. \"Our caucus, with 110 members, is laser-focused on delivering real solutions for the American people, reining in wasteful spending, demanding oversight, and ensuring every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely.\" Bean said his panel’s work rooting out government waste and streamlining the bureaucracy will continue on-track, with a major effort planned next week to change the Treasury’s payment system to curb improper disbursements. DRAIN THE SWAMP ACT SEEKS TO MOVE DC BUREAUCRACY ‘OUT OF CRAZYTOWN’: HOUSE DOGE LEADER Drain the Swamp Act being introduced in the House(Getty Images) The Jacksonville lawmaker said that longstanding issue has led to about $162 billion in wrongful payments every year. During his tenure, Musk also worked with Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentto fix systemic problems there. The House DOGE Caucus will continue to advocate to \"enact the cuts found by DOGE,\" Bean went on. The panel looks forward to working with House SpeakerMike Johnson, R-La., to pass $9.4 billion in rescissions identified by DOGE and presented to Congress for action by OMB Director Russ Vought. Republicans faced criticism for moving too slowly on DOGE’s proposed cuts, but GOP leadership sources said they needed either a formal request from Vought or separate bills outside the Big Beautiful Bill Act to avoid jeopardizing its eligibility for Senate reconciliation. DOGE MEETS CONGRESS: FL REP LAUNCHES CAUCUS TO HELP MUSK \"Taking on Crazytown is no easy task,\" Bean quipped to Fox News Digital last November when he launched the House DOGE Caucus. On the Senate side, DOGE caucus chairwoman Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, scrutinized a recent government report on COVID aid fraud and has already launched an effort to head off what she called easily-determinable signals that an application for government emergency aid is likely falsified or ineligible. Ernst this week flagged an analysis from the Pandemic Resources Accountability Committee – led by federal inspectors general – that randomly sampled nearly 700,000 identity records from 67.5 million applications for PPP, EIDL and other COVID-19 relief programs and found nearly $80 billion in potentially fraudulent payouts. Ernst said much of the likely fraud could have been prevented if officials had simply verified Social Security numbers, matched them with SSA records, and confirmed whether applicants were still alive. In turn, she informed Fox News Digital exclusively that she would be launching a bill Friday to prevent this kind of easily-avoided oversight issues in the future. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The DOGE in Spending Act would prevent \"con artists,\" she said, who, during COVID-19, \"raided America’s piggy bank.\" The bill’s name also signaled that the Senate, too, would continue its Musk-inspired work long after the mogul has left. \"There is nothing more frustrating than losing billions of dollars to preventable fraud,\" Ernst said, calling the illicit payouts during the pandemic \"unprecedented.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses the war of words between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the ‘big, beautiful bill’ and codifying DOGE cuts on ‘America Reports.’ TheU.S. Supreme Courton Friday ruled the Department of Government Efficiency could access Social Security systems with sensitive information. The ruling blocked a lower Maryland court order that keptDOGEfrom seeking certain Social Security information due to federal privacy laws. The data from the U.S. Social Security Administration includes Social Security numbers, medical information, citizenship records, school records, and tax returns for millions of Americans. EXCLUSIVE: LEGAL INSTITUTE CELEBRATES SCOTUS DECISION, DECLARES ‘RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IS ALIVE AND WELL’ The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday ruled the Department of Government Efficiency could access Social Security systems with sensitive information.(iStock) \"We conclude that, under the present circumstances, SSA may proceed to afford members of the SSA DOGE Team access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work,\" the court said in an unsigned order.

DOGE WILL GO ON: HILL PORK HAWK SAYS ROOTING OUT GOVERNMENT WASTE WILL CONTINUE AFTER ELON The ruling came soon after DOGE's former head, Elon Musk, left the government and a day after he and President Donald Trump traded personal attacks that were sparked by a disagreement over the president's \"Big, Beautiful\" bill.(Reuters/AP) Jackson said the ruling created \"grave privacy risks\" for millions of Americans by giving \"unfettered data access to DOGE regardless — despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access.\" The ruling came soon after DOGE's former head, Elon Musk, left the government and a day after he and President Donald Trumptraded personal attacksthat were sparked by a disagreement over the president's \"Big, Beautiful\" bill.

The Trump administration has said DOGE needs access to Social Security information to continue its core task of rooting out government waste. Musk has previously called Social Security a\"Ponzi scheme,\"and insisted on eliminating waste in the program. Maryland U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander previously ruled that DOGE’s efforts with Social Security were a \"fishing expedition\" based on \"little more than suspicion\" of fraud. She did allow some access, however, to anonymous data for DOGE workers who had gone through background checks.

    "article_text": "Tiffany Dunkin of the First Liberty Institute reacts to Thursday's unanimous Supreme Court ruling protecting Catholic Charities' religious status. EXCLUSIVE:A legal organization whose mission it is to defend the religious liberty of Americans has called theSupremeCourt's9-0 ruling in favor of the Catholic Charities Bureau (CCB) \"a huge moment for religious liberty in America,\" and a clear rejection of government overreach into religious life. \"This was not a hard call,\" Tiffany Dunkin, a legal fellow and attorney with the First Liberty Institute, emphasized in an interview with Fox News Digital, citing Thursday's unanimous SCOTUS decision to strike down Wisconsin’s attempt to withhold a religious tax exemption because the CCB does not proselytize or serve only Catholics. \"What Wisconsinwas doing… they were saying that the Catholic Charities was not a religious institution because they did not proselytize or serve people of their own faith,\" Dunkin explained. SUPREME COURT RULES WISCONSIN UNCONSTITUTIONALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CHRISTIAN CHARITY Facade of the Supreme Court.(Valerie Plesch/picture alliance via Getty Images) \"What they were doing was deciding what it means to be religious,\" she added. \"And the First Amendment prohibits the government from doing that.\" The case, Catholic Charities Bureau Inc. v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, questioned whetherfaith-based nonprofitsthat provide public services are \"religious enough\" to receive the same benefits as churches or houses of worship. Catholic Charities, affiliated with the Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin, provides critical care services for people with disabilities and mental health needs. Wisconsin argued those acts were not \"primarily religious.\" The Supreme Court disagreed. SCOTUS RULINGS THIS TERM COULD STRENGTHEN RELIGIOUS RIGHTS PROTECTIONS, EXPERT SAYS First Liberty Institute's Tiffany Dunkin sat down with Fox News Digital for an exclusive interview detailing their recent unanimous victory for religious freedom at the Supreme Court.(First Liberty Institute) Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing the opinion for the court, stated clearly that the government has no authority to assess or rank the religious nature of charitable work. Dunkin said the consequences of the ruling go far beyond Wisconsin. \"This is actually a pretty ongoing problem across the country,\" she noted. \"It’s not just Wisconsin. First Liberty Institute represents Dad’s Place in Bryan, Ohio… they’re saying that because you’re running a 24-7 homeless shelter, you’re not [religious].\" Other clients of Plano, Texas-based First Liberty in Colorado and Arizona have faced similar arguments from local governments, which question whether providing food, clothing or shelter to those in need is inherently religious. \"Even though there are churches doing this kind of work, the governments are saying, ‘Well, you're not religious enough,’\" Dunkin said. A Catholic Charities blanket is on the floor of a makeshift shelter at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Oct. 24, 2023.(Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) The court’s language in the ruling, Dunkin pointed out, \"affirms what the Supreme Court has said for nearly a century,\" that the government cannot choose which expressions of faith are valid. \"This sends a great message to people of all religions and all charitable organizations,\" she said. \"The government… cannot intrude into telling you exactly what you can and can’t do, whether you’re religious or not religious, in order to receive a government benefit or participate in society.\" Had SCOTUS ruled the other way, Dunkin warned, it would have \"grave implications\" for religious charities and ministries nationwide. \"It would allow the government to step into the religious doctrine of all faiths more than our Founding Fathers ever intended,\" she said. \"The government cannot step in and get involved in deciding and picking and choosing between one type of religious activity and another.\" When asked what this means for churches and ministries on the ground, Dunkin’s answer was clear: \"They should feel emboldened to continue to do what they feel called to do by their religious faith… especially in a charitable sense.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And for those who may see this as a one-off legal win? Not so fast. \"I see this really as two different things,\" she said. \"One, an affirmance of what theFirst Amendmenthas always stood for… but of course, going forward, we do hope and we’re encouraged that religious liberty in America is alive and well.

Removing illegal immigrants from Medicaid is one of the key provisions of that Medicaid reform. Meanwhile, Democrats have railed against possible Medicaid cuts since Trump was elected in November. Every House Democrat voted against the bill, and Democrats are already defining Medicaid cuts as a driving issue ahead of competitive midterm elections in 2026.

In addition to bolstering safety and security, the new orders will also spur greater innovation in the aerospace and drone sectors, something White House officials said has been stifled in recent years as a result of burdensome regulations. \"Flying cars are not just for the Jetsons,\" Michael Kratsios, a leadtech policyadvisor at the White House said. \"Since the beginning of his first term, President Trump has recognized the incredible potential of drones to boost American productivity, create high-skilled jobs and meet national needs in areas like public safety, infrastructure, inspection, agriculture and more.

    "article_text": "Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang discusses an upcoming bail hearing for a Chinese national accused of smuggling a dangerous fungus into the U.S. as President Donald Trump is expected to speak with Xi Jinping. EXCLUSIVE:After a dangerous fungus was intercepted in Detroit, MichiganHouse Speaker Matt Hallspoke out to Fox News Digital about the legislature's efforts to blunt Chinese influence and espionage. The fungus,Fusarium graminearum, is considered capable of \"agroterrorism\" and was allegedly smuggled into the country by two Chinese nationals studying at the University of Michigan. Hall, R-Kalamazoo, said he and colleagues have sounded the alarm for months about Beijing’s efforts and that the incident shows Michigan and other states need to be vigilant and prepared. \"As speaker, I led our Foreign Influence Protection package through the State House to blockCCP operativesfrom buying Michigan farmland, infiltrating our universities and accessing our most sensitive data,\" he said. CHINESE OFFICIAL CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE OF FUNGUS SITUATION, SAYS CHINA REQUIRES CITIZENS ‘ABIDE BY LOCAL LAWS’ A toxic fungus was allegedly smuggled into the U.S.(FBI) \"Our plan would have tackled this head-on and prevented Chinese government interference with our food supply and our universities.\" He called the bill package the strongest collection of protections against CCP interference nationwide but said it is being held up by Senate Democrats and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Requests for comment from Whitmer and Senate President Pro Tempore Jeremy Moss, D-Bloomfield, were not immediately returned. \"Their inaction means our farmland, our military bases and our universities are still at risk,\" Hall lamented while praising President Donald Trump for taking action to protect U.S. land and people from Chinese \"schemes.\" \"Too many professors and administrators have let Beijing use our campuses as pawns. We willexpose every CCP operation, root out every vulnerability and mobilize every state resource to secure Michigan — farmland, universities and beyond.\" While a Chinese embassy official claimed earlier this week to have no knowledge of the case involving two Chinese students allegedly attempting to bring a fungus to the University of Michigan, experts said the pathogen was capable of causing billions in damage to U.S. grain supplies. PATEL: CHINESE NATIONALS CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING 'KNOWN AGROTERRORISM AGENT' INTO US IS A 'DIRECT THREAT' House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Kalamazoo(Imagn) The case drew some parallels to the coronavirus pandemic, which sparked global debate over whether a viral pathogen may have emerged from a lab and infected the world. A Michigan House Republican Communications Office official said too many federal and state oversight bodies can be infiltrated by CCP sympathizers, and they have allowed foreign agents to run rampant on college campuses with CCP-backed research grants on dangerous things like Fusarium graminearum. While state officials like Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs have vetoed attempts to block Chinese-linked land purchases, Michigan House leaders have said security breaches like the Fusarium graminearum incident prove the issue cannot go unchecked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans similarly criticized Whitmer for touting \"corporate subsidy\" deals with Chinese EV battery companies and a proposed Gotion vehicle plant in Big Rapids, Michigan. In 2024, House Chinese Communist Party Select Committee ChairmanJohn Moolenaar,also a Michigan Republican, said he uncovered \"indisputable evidence\" that Gotion High Tech was connected to supply chains involving forced labor in China. \"The American people expect companies in the U.S. to avoid all involvement with the Chinese Communist Party’s campaign of genocide,\" Moolenaar said. The company, reportedly tied to both China and German-owned Volkswagen, denied the committee’s findings,calling them \"baseless and absolutely false.\" In October, five Chinese nationals studying in the Great Lakes State in partnership with a Chinese school were charged with espionage for what was an alleged spying operation outside Michigan National Guard Camp Grayling. A Michigan House source said the package would also block schools from accepting foreign grants if found to be promoting any anti-American agenda and strip foreign data-mining apps from government devices through provisions from Reps. Rachelle Smit, R-Allegan; Nancy Jenkins-Arno, R-Lenawee; and William Bruck, R-Erie. Michigan lawmakers are also trying to address another perceived threat from China: the use of drones and other technology linked to Chinese companies that are being employed by certain law enforcement agencies and municipal governments.

At his weekly press conference Friday, Fox News asked Jeffries if he was concerned that possibly demasking some ICE agents puts them or their families’ safety at risk. \"It seems to me that the officials at theDepartment of Homeland Security,including ICE, should be held to the same standards as every other part of law enforcement in terms of transparency,\" the Democrat from New York said.

Wear. A. Mask.\" Then around a year later, in August 2021,Jeffries said\"Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. Crush the virus.\" Two Democrat senators from Virginia, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, also wrote a letter last month to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and other top officials about ICE’s recent immigration enforcement operations taking an \"alarming and dangerous turn.\" \"We urge you to direct ICE officers and agents to promptly and clearly identify themselves as law enforcement officers conducting law enforcement actions when arresting subjects, and limit the use of face coverings during arrests and other enforcement actions to avoid intimidation and reduce safety risks to the public,\" they said. WHITE HOUSE BACKS MAJOR LEGISLATION TO SPEED UP DEPORTATIONS ICE officers are seen making an arrest in Lynn, Mass., last month.(ICE ) In August 2021, Kaine pushed mask wearing as well,writing in a Facebook postthat he was \"Deeply concerned about the rapid rise of COVID-19 delta variant infections we are seeing across the Commonwealth\" and that \"We should do all we can to help stop the spread of the virus and keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, including following CDC guidance such as getting vaccinated, masking up indoors, and social distancing.\" \"Folks, let’s continue to protect ourselves by getting vaccinated, masking up, and social distancing so we can safely return to all of the activities we love,\"Warneraddedat the time. In a statement Friday to Fox News Digital, Kaine said \"Masked agents conducting enforcement without any clearly visible law enforcement identification pose a danger to everyone, including themselves. \"Recently, ICE agents with nothing identifying them as law enforcement – one of whom was wearing a ski mask – initiated arrests inside a Virginia courthouse. In settings like courthouses, where there are armed officers, it’s important that officers are clearly identified to help avoid misunderstandings that could lead to escalation of violence, even to include officer-on-officer fire,\" he continued. \"To help mitigate risk and enhance safety, ICE and DHS should provide clear guidance to law enforcement ICE agents and officers regarding when and how to use face coverings, organizational clothing, or reveal officer and agent identities.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Representatives for Jeffries and Warner did not immediately respond Friday to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

    "title": "Trump's tariff strategy could pay for his tax bill, but only if they stick, experts warn",
    "article_text": "Trump's legislation runs the Congressional gauntlet TheWhite Houseand congressional Republicans have said that PresidentDonald Trump’ssweeping tariffs would help pay for his mammoth tax bill, but tax experts say it depends on whether the president stays consistent. Senate Republicansare in the midst of hashing out their plan to tweak and reshape the president’s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which includes Trump’s desire to extend and make permanent his first-term tax policies. SENATE REPUBLICANS EYE CHANGES TO TRUMP'S MEGABILL AFTER HOUSE WIN President Donald Trump during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, April 30, 2025. Trump blamed former President Joe Biden for weak economic data that sent stocks tumbling, arguing that government data showed that increased domestic investment signaled that his tariff plan is working.(Ken Cedeno/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images) However, thetaxportion of the bill alone is expected to cost roughly $4 trillion. And when factoring in spending cuts and other revenue and economic drivers, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found in a report earlier this week that, in all, the colossal legislative package would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The CBO, which has come under recent scrutiny from congressional Republicans unhappy with the scoring of the president’s \"big, beautiful bill,\" also found that Trump’s tariffs would reduce the deficit by $2.8 trillion over the same period. Joe Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told Fox News Digital that the reconciliation package’s potential impact on the debt is more concerning now than in 2017, due to higher debt levels and rising interest rates. 'GONE TOO FAR': GOP LAWMAKERS RALLY AROUND TRUMP AFTER MUSK RAISES EPSTEIN ALLEGATIONS The House is preparing to move forward its one-bill budget plan for President Trump, while the Senate has passed its own version as a backup.(Getty Images) When Republicans were putting together the president's original tax package, thenational debtwas roughly $20 trillion. Eight years later, that number has ballooned to over $36 trillion and counting. Rosenberg contended that if the CBO’s report were taken as is, then Trump’s tariffs would make the bill deficit neutral and then some. But the report assumed that the eye-popping sums that Trump’s tariffs could generate were based on whether they were permanent. \"I think what we've seen is that the tariff policy, again, seems to change day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute,\" he said. \"And the administration is a little bit inconsistent about whether they view tariffs as purely a revenue source versus essentially a negotiating tool.\" The report also found that in exchange for trillions in deficit reduction, household wealth would drop, and the economy would shrink each year over the next decade. Tad Dehaven, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, argued that this factor—along with Trump’s tariffs being tied up in court over constitutional challenges and their shifting application—makes any projected benefits \"extraordinarily unlikely.\" \"Let's pretend that these tariffs are going to remain in place for 10 years at some level delineated today. That's a major tax increase, so whatever alleged benefit you're receiving from the tax cut in the reconciliation package, it's being offset by a tax increase,\" he said. \"And a rather economically inefficient one.\" TRUMP'S TARIFFS AND TAX CUTS ARE CRUSHING MAIN STREET AND MAKING MAR-A-LAGO ELITES RICH President Donald Trump addressed a \"nasty\" question about his tariff negotiations.(Fox News) Mike Palicz, director of tax policy at the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, scoffed at the CBO’s recent scoring, and lamented the agency as \"a bunch of bean counters\" that often miss the mark on key pieces of legislation, like the president’s original Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He argued that none of the outside noise should matter, telling Fox News Digital that \"you cannot go out and explain to a normal person or business that their taxes aren't increasing next year if the Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire.\" \"That's what the whole point of this exercise is, preventing the expiration of tax cuts, preventing the largest tax increase in American history,\" he said. \"And no conservative, no Republican, should think that you address the deficit by raising taxes.\" Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.",

    "title": "South Sudan deportations have placed migrants, and ICE officials, in danger: new court filing",
    "article_text": "Fox News chief legal correspondent Shannon Bream discusses legal battles facing the Trump administration over immigration issues on ‘Special Report.’ Nearly a dozen ICE officials and a group of migrantsdeported to South Sudanby the Trump administration are currently being housed in a converted shipping container and face grave dangers to their physical health, according to a new court filing. The filing, submitted by senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Mellisa Harper, cites a combination of blistering-high heat conditions, exposure to malaria and \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen as threats to both the migrants and ICE officials. It comes after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of eight migrants who were deported to South Sudanwithout due processor the ability to challenge their removals to a third country. He ordered they remain in U.S. custody until each could be given a \"reasonable fear interview,\" or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released. But the filing makes clear that the migrants, and ICE officials, face dangers in the meantime. US JUDGE ACCUSES TRUMP ADMIN OF ‘MANUFACTURING CHAOS’ IN SOUTH SUDAN DEPORTATIONS, ESCALATING FEUD U.S. military aircraft as seen at U.S. Military Base Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. Camp Lemonnier is the only permanent United States military base in Africa.(Getty Images) According to Harper, ICE officials were not given anti-malaria medication prior to traveling to Djibouti – subjecting them to unknown levels of disease exposure in a war-torn region, where there has been an uptick in deadly clashes over resource scarcity, including cattle and access to potable water. The president of the country declared a state of emergency in certain parts of South Sudan just days ago. And even within the confines of the U.S. base, there are significant risks. According to ICE's submission, the migrants are being housed in a converted Conex shipping container at the U.S. military base in Djibouti, the only permanent military base the U.S. currently operates in Africa. Since their arrival, daily temperatures there have exceeded 100 degrees – searing conditions that they said make detention \"of any length,\" especially longer term. Nearby burn pits used by Djibouti to burn off trash and human waste form a giant \"smog cloud\" that hangs over the base for much of the day, exposing the group to unknown hazardous materials burned off under breezeless, blistering hot skies. Some ICE officers have started to sleep in N-95 masks for additional protection, Harper noted. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT Brian Murphy during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2024.(Senate Judiciary Committee) \"Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,\" Harper noted, with symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing, and achy joints – though they lack the testing or medication necessary for treatment. Other, more imminent risks also remain. Upon arrival, ICE officials were notified by Defense Department officials of the \"imminent danger\" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen, Harper noted, though ICE officers lack body armor or other gear appropriate in the case of an attack. The new filing could add pressure on the Trump administration to relocate the detainees and ICE officials in question. JUDGES V TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA Demonstrators gather outside the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., to protest the continued detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported to El Salvador in March.(Fox News Digital- Breanne Deppisch) Murphy had stated in a previous order that migrants deported to South Sudan need not be held there, in a country where recent infighting and deadly conflict have displaced more than 150,000 people this year alone. He said then that the government had mischaracterized his order, \"while at the same time manufacturing the very chaos they decry.\" His order requires the Trump administration to keep the six deported migrants in South Sudan under the custody of U.S. officials for a length of time needed to carry out the so-called \"reasonable fear interviews,\" and make a determination over whether the migrants' concerns are adequate. \"The court never said that defendants had to convert their foreign military base into an immigration facility,\" Murphywrote in that order. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It only left that as an option, again, at defendants’ request,\" he said then. It is unclear whether the government has plans to relocate the group.

A pair of bills cracking down onsanctuary citiespassed the House of Representatives this week — with the support of multiple Democrats. On Thursday, the House passed a bill to relocate Small Business Administration (SBA) offices from jurisdictions that shelter illegal immigrants. The legislation passed the House in a 211 to 199 vote, with five Democrats joining the GOP: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas, Laura Gillen of New York, Don Davis of North Carolina, Jared Golden of Maine and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington. DEMS FUME OVER 'DUE PROCESS' FOR ABREGO GARCIA DESPITE LONG HISTORY OF PARTY BUCKING THE LEGAL PRINCIPLE House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., left, saw several members of his caucus vote with House Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on sanctuary city bills.(Getty/AP) That's despite House Democratic leaders urging lawmakers to vote against the bill. SBA offices at the regional, district and local levels would be required to relocate if the administration publicly designated their locations assanctuary jurisdictions. \"House Republicans are holding these cities accountable for their refusal to follow immigration law and protect their citizens,\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the No. 3 House Republican, told Fox News Digital of the bill. \"Under President Trump, lawlessness that endangers the American people and prioritizes illegal aliens will not be rewarded with federal dollars and resources.\" Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, is among the Democrats who voted for both bills.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) The second bill, which passed on Friday morning, would add explicit language banning people in the U.S. illegally from obtainingSBA loans. Eight Democrats voted for that legislation — Perez, Cuellar, Gillen and Davis all voted for the bill, along with Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York, Josh Harder of California, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan. House Democratic leaders did not appear to give their caucus guidance on how to vote for the bill. The Trump administration, however, celebrated the bipartisan vote. \"By harboring criminal illegal aliens, sanctuary cities jeopardize both the lives of American citizens and the livelihoods of our small businesses — which is exactly why the SBA is moving our field offices out of these lawless jurisdictions and into safer, more accessible communities that comply with federal law,\" SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler told Fox News Digital. \"This Administration is committed to ending the illegal invasion of our nation – and I am grateful for the bipartisan group of House lawmakers who voted in support of that agenda.\" MAXINE WATERS FLOATS DEPORTING MELANIA TRUMP IN ANTI-DOGE DIATRIBE Rep.

    "title": "Claim Trump nixed top Musk ally from NASA post over Dem donations belied by ex-Dems on team",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest details on the Trump-Musk feud. Claims that PresidentDonald Trumpdropped his well-regarded NASA nominee over Democratic donations don’t hold up, given his track record of appointing officials from across the political spectrum. \"Trump Is Said to Have Known About NASA Nominee’s Donations Before Picking Him,\" read the latest headline from the New York Times about the president’s decision to pull Jared Isaacman’s nomination – as the firestorm continues over the spacewalking billionaire’s close ally Elon Musk’s coinciding break with the president. Trump had known about many of his circle’s Democratic ties before Isaacson came on the scene, including his own history. Until the Obama administration, Trump reliably donated to Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer, then-Rep. Anthony Weiner, Hillary Clinton – all of New York – Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, and then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. YOU'RE HIRED, HERE'S WHO PASSED CONGRESS' TRUMP CABINET TEST AND HOW STORMY THEIR HEARINGS WERE RFK Jr., left, Donald Trump, right.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Since then, however, Trump has taken an adversarial tack toward Obama andDemocrats associatedwith him, including Hillary Clinton – though he still reserves kind words for former President Bill Clinton. While many of Trump’s cabinet picks are former congressional Republicans, like Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins of Georgia and Secretary of State Marco Rubio of Florida, many also hail from the left or are known to donate to leftist causes. Health & Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy, Jr.,is the most notable example, given his surname and namesake. Kennedy, whose father was a New York senator, attorney general and a 1968 presidential candidate until his assassination, was a noted Democrat invested in environmentalism and other liberal causes. His sister, Kerry, was first lady of New York during her marriage to Andrew Cuomo, while another sister, Kathleen, was lieutenant governor of Maryland under Gov. Parris Glendening – and his uncles, John and Edward, were two of the most famous Democrats in U.S. history. GABBARD SPEAKS OUT AFTER LEAVING ‘WOKE’ DEMOCRATIC PARTY Trump, left, Jared Isaacman, right.(Getty) But Kennedy and his supporters forged a political bond with Trump and propelled him into the presidency, finding common ground on vaccine risk awareness, dangerous aspects of America’s food processing and transparency of government officials, particularly in the health care sector. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who later left her party after repeated barbs from its thought-leaders like Clinton – who accused her of being a Kremlin asset. And Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent remains in office and has been widely praised by fiscal conservatives for his decisions so far, while also having a history of Democratic donations. Bessent donated to Obama, Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore, and was also head of Soros Fund Management’s United Kingdom office in the early 1990s. The company, led by George Soros and his son Alex, is often considered the most powerful financial force on the far left. Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick – one of the lead negotiators ofTrump’s tariff and trade agenda– was also a Democratic donor while head of the financial firm Cantor-Fitzgerald. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lutnick’s donations have trended toward the GOP in recent years, and he has maintained a longtime friendship with Trump. On the Democratic side of the ledger, Lutnick historically supported the late Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, as well as Schumer and Clinton. Lutnick has preferred pro-business and anti-regulation candidates and issues moreso than coming from a purely political point of view. Isaacman, a New Jersey billionaire credited as the first private citizen to spacewalk, saw his May 31 nomination pulled this week after what Trump called \"a thorough review of his prior associations,\" which many, including in the media, believed referenced his history of Democratic donations. Isaacman has donated to fellow Garden State-born astronautMark Kelly– now the senior Democratic senator in Arizona – as well as former Sen. Bob Casey, Jr., D-Pa., and a SuperPAC aligned with Schumer. He also supported Rep. George Whitesides, D-Calif., a former NASA chief of staff and congressional freshman who upset a GOP-held swing district north of Los Angeles in 2024.

    "article_text": "Senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses advancements in artificial intelligence aimed at predicting an individual's future risk of breast cancer and the increased health risks from cannabis as users age. A drug intended to treat menopause symptoms could double asbreast cancer prevention. New research from Northwestern University in Illinois found that Duavee, a Pfizer-made drug, \"significantly reduced\" breast tissue cell growth, which is a major indicator of cancer progression. A phase 2 clinical trial included 141 post-menopausal women who had been diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also known as stage 0 breast cancer, according to a press release from Northwestern. PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE This non-invasivebreast canceraffects more than 60,000 American women each year, often leading to an outcome of invasive breast cancer. The women were separated into two groups — one received Duavee and the other took a placebo for a month before undergoing breast surgery. A drug intended to treat menopause symptoms could double as breast cancer prevention, new research suggests.(iStock) Duavee is a conjugatedestrogen/bazedoxifene (CE/BZA) drug, which combines estrogen with another medication that minimizes the potential harmful side effects of the hormone. \"The key takeaway from the study is that CE/BZA slows the growth (proliferation) of cells in milk ducts of DCIS that expressed the estrogen receptor significantly more than placebo,\" Dr. Swati Kulkarni, lead investigator and professor of breast surgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital. EXPERIMENTAL WOMEN'S CANCER DRUG BOOSTS SURVIVAL RATES IN NOTABLE STUDY Another major finding is that the quality of life did not differ significantly between the two groups, but patients who took the CE/BZA reported fewer hot flashes during the study, she noted. \"This would be expected, as the drug is FDA-approved to treat hot flashes.\" \"What excites me most is that a medication designed to help women feel better during menopause may also reduce their risk of invasive breast cancer.\" Kulkarni presented the study last week at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago. The findings are preliminary and have not yet been published in a medical journal. \"What excites me most is that a medication designed to help women feel better during menopause may also reduce their risk of invasive breast cancer,\" said the doctor, who is also a Northwestern Medicine breast surgeon. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also known as stage 0 breast cancer, affects more than 60,000 U.S. women each year.(iStock) Women who face a higher risk of breast cancer — including those who have experienced \"high-risk lesions\" — and who also havemenopausal symptomsare most likely to benefit from the drug, according to Kulkarni. \"These women are typically advised against standard hormone therapies, leaving them with few menopausal treatment options,\" the release stated. The researchers said they are \"encouraged\" by these early results, but more research is required before the medication can be considered for approval as a breast cancer prevention mechanism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our findings suggest that CE/BZA may prevent breast cancer, but larger studies with several years of follow-up are needed before we would know this for sure,\" Kulkarni told Fox News Digital. Post-menopausal patients who took the CE/BZA reported fewer hot flashes during the study.(iStock) Dr. Sheheryar Kabraji, chief of breast medicine at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings. \"While intriguing, this study is highly preliminary, andmore researchwill be needed before we can conclude that conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene (CD/BZA), a form of the hormone estrogen commonly prescribed to address symptoms of menopause, prevents invasive breast cancer or is effective at reducing cancer risk,\" he told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Kabraji also noted that the study focused on reducing levels of one specific protein, \"which does not always predict reduced recurrence of breast cancer.\" \"This study did not directly show that CE/BZA treatment reduces the risk of DCIS recurrence or development of invasive cancer,\" he noted. \"While intriguing, this study is highly preliminary.\" \"Importantly, however, patients who received this therapy experienced no worsening of quality of life, and saw improvement in vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes. If found to be effective in preventing breast cancer, CE/BZA is likely to have fewer side effects than current medications used forbreast cancer prevention.\" For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health Lead researcher Kulkarni emphasized that this medication is not for the treatment of invasive breast cancer or DCIS. \"Right now, we can say that women who are concerned about their risk of developing breast cancer can consider this medication to treat their menopausal symptoms,\" she added.

MINNEAPOLIS –M.S. had worked for years to become one of the top pitchers on her club softball team. She trained hard, earned her spot and was used to competing under pressure. But when she learned that the teammate she was now expected to compete against for pitching time was actually male, everything changed. \"I just started bawling right away,\" the 17-year-old told OutKick. \"I was pushing myself all season to do my best, and once I found out, I was like, all that work was for nothing — because the boy's still gonna beat me no matter what.\" M.S. ultimately made the decision to walk away from her club team. For her, she said, it was a no-brainer. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"If there’s a boy on this team, I’m not going to be playing,\" she said. That boy (who identifies as a girl) was Champlin Park High School junior Marissa Rothenberger, who took the mound in the Class AAAAMinnesota girls' softball state championshipgame on Friday morning and led the team to a title after pitching a shutout. Now, M.S. is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) on behalf of Female Athletes United (FAU). The lawsuit challenges the state of Minnesota and its public school districts over policies that allowtrans-identifying male athletesto compete in girls' sports. AFTER TRANS PITCHER LEADS TEAM TO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, OPPONENT AND LAWYER SUING OVER SITUATION SPEAK OUT The lawsuit, filed last month, argues that Minnesota’s gender-identity-based eligibility rules are a direct violation of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education, including athletics. \"Minnesota currently has a policy that allows male athletes to compete in women’s sports,\" explained ADF Legal Counsel Suzanne Beecher, who is representing the athletes. \"But under Title IX, schools that accept federal funding are required to provide equal opportunities for female athletes.Title IXpreempts state policies like this, which violate the equal accommodation requirement of federal law.\" FILE - Demonstrators cheer during the speaking program at the \"Our Bodies, Our Sports\" rally for the 50th anniversary of Title IX at Freedom Plaza on June 23, 2022 in Washington, DC.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The problem, Beecher said, goes beyond basic fairness. It’s also about safety, lost opportunity and institutional neglect. \"This is harming girls,\" she told OutKick. \"It’s putting them at safety risks, and it’s also denying them the opportunity to advance and experience victory. These are girls who have dedicated hours and years of hard work to being the best they can be. It’s heartbreaking to see that Minnesota's unfair policies are denying them a level playing field.\" In February, President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning males from competing in girls' and women's sports, citing these same Title IX protections. The order made clear that any state failing to comply would risk losing federal funding. In direct defiance of this order, the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) announced that it would continue its longstanding policy of allowing student-athletes to compete in events consistent with their gender identity, regardless of biological sex. The league cited the Minnesota Human Rights Act and the state constitution as the basis for this policy. Champlin Park and Eagan players shake hands following the quarterfinals round of the Minnesota Girls' Softball State Tournament.(Amber Harding/OutKick) Further, Minnesota allows individuals to change the sex marker on their birth certificate with either a letter from a physician or a court order, creating a loophole that essentially renders sex-based protections useless. \"The justification for having separate sports is because of the physiological differences between males and females,\" Beecher said. \"States need to have policies that meaningfully separate sports so there is a protected category for females. Girls deserve a fair and safe place where they can compete and win.\" The issue exploded into public view this week during the MSHSL Girls’ State Softball Tournament, where Rothenberger helped lead Champlin Park High School to the state championship game. Champlin Park took down Eagan High School, 5-0, in the quarterfinals and White Bear Lake, 3-2, in the semifinals. In addition to pitching back-to-back complete games, Rothenberger hit two doubles in that semifinal win. M.S. pitched in the tournament for Farmington High School but lost in the quarterfinals. She didn’t have to face Rothenberger directly, but she watched closely as other girls did. \"There are so many more girls that deserve it more than just a boy,\" she said. \"It was just so sad to see all the girls crying and having to accept the fact that their chance at winning a state title was taken from them just because a boy was pitching against them.\" Champlin Park High School has made headlines after dominating the Minnesota softball state championship behind the performance of trans pitcher Marissa Rothenberger.(Tyler Schank/NCAA Photos via Getty Images) M.S. has already committed to play college softball at St. Cloud State, but her decision to join the lawsuit wasn't just about herself — it was about protecting girls’ sports for those coming next. \"I wanted to join the lawsuit because it’s just painful to see a boy dominating the sport that me and other girls have grown up playing,\" she said. \"It's been a safe space for so long. And to see that safe space change — I feel like that’s the biggest reason why I wanted to do it.\" And her message going forward is simple: \"I want just girls playing in girls' sports. Get men out of women's sports.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ADF says Minnesota's policy doesn’t just violate federal law — it also silences those impacted by it. As OutKick previously reported, several parents and students in the tournament werewarned by school officials not to speak outor wear messages opposing trans participation in the state tournament.

But Minnesota places its ideology over fairness and safety. \"The only way to protect female athletes' safety and opportunities is to ensure that only girls compete in girls' sports. Minnesota is failing its female athletes, and its policy must be changed to reflect biological reality.\" M.S. will be back on the field next year for her senior season. Maybe by then, the rules will catch up with reality. \"I hope that the state tournament next year is a lot different than it was this year,\" she said.

    "article_text": "Republican Sen. Jim Banks explains why Indiana Fever fans deserve an apology after the league’s latest investigation during an appearance on OutKick’s ‘Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich.’ In just the first week of the WNBA season,Caitlin Clarkfound herself in more wars of words. A day after she and theIndiana Feverslaughtered Angel Reese and the Chicago Sky, the WNBA began investigating reports of \"hateful comments\" toward Reese by Fever fans that were ultimately \"not substantiated.\" When the WNBA announced the claims were not true, U.S. Sen.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Atlanta Dream center Brittney Griner watches from the bench in the first half against the LA Sparks at Crypto.com Arena.(Kirby Lee/Imagn Images) In speaking with Fox News Digital, Indiana Gov. Braun highlighted the importance of both Clark, the Fever, and the Indiana Pacers' NBA Finals run to his state. When the topic of Clark came up in discussion, Braun was hopeful that the apparent hatred against Clark, and throughout the association and its fans, could come to an end, while siding with Banks. \"I’m one that absolutely has zero tolerance for bigotry and bullying and all the stuff that comes along with that whole discussion. When comments are made that don’t make sense … when it’s out of line, you need to acknowledge it. So, I agree with Sen. Banks there, and I hope that there’s not any of that there,\" Braun said. Although the WNBA investigated reports of verbal attacks against Reese, the WNBA has not investigated a viral video of Brittney Griner in which many people on social media believe she was calling Clark \"trash\" and a \"f---ing white girl.\" The video of Griner emerged shortly after Griner fouled out against the Fever on a questionable foul during a game in which Clark and Griner, who play two separate positions, were hardly near each other. Others say Griner was actually calling the referee or the call that was made \"trash,\" adding it was a \"f---ing whack call.\" In any case, the video has been a hot topic online, and the WNBA has not acted. Braun said if the WNBA investigated what were determined to be false claims of hateful speech against Reese, it should look into Griner.

You ought to be grateful for it, not throwing around comments that might indicate otherwise,\" Braun said. \"Yes, I think if there was some look into what Angel Reese did, I think it would be good to put that to rest as well.

Some people believe, based on reading her lips, that she said \"f---ing white girl,\" while others believe she said \"f---ing whack call.\" While no one is certain exactly what she said, there's an easy way to find out: ask Griner. However, no one has done that. OutKick hasreached out to the WNBAand to Griner's management team several times, but hasn't received a single response. Still, Griner has participated in multiple games since the incident, which means the media has had plenty of access to simply ask the question. Yet, not a single \"reporter\" has.

Because there's no such thing as a WNBA \"reporter\" or \"journalist.\" Sure, there are people who have such titles in their social media bios or on their LinkedIn pages. But they're not telling the truth. The media members who cover the WNBA don't operate with journalistic integrity – instead, they act like PR professionals whose goal is not to report facts, but to simply promote the league. Why is that the case? Because the WNBA wants it that way. OutKick requested a media credential for the Atlanta Dream game in Los Angeles against the Sparks on May 27. The Sparks denied our request. OutKick requested a media credential for the Atlanta Dream game in Connecticut against the Sun on Friday night. The Sun denied our request. Here's the reason provided, via email, by the Sun: \"Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate your request for a media credential for Connecticut Sun vs. Atlanta Dream on Friday, June 6.Due toverylimited space, priority is given to those that are associated with outlets that have consistently covered the organization for previous seasons.\" A detail of the WNBA logo is seen on a basketball during warmups between the Seattle Storm and the Connecticut Sun at Climate Pledge Arena on June 20, 2023 in Seattle, Washington.(Steph Chambers/Getty Images) CAITLIN CLARK'S EAGERLY AWAITED REMATCH WITH ANGEL REESE PUT ON ICE AS STAR TAKES SMART APPROACH TO RECOVERY Really? There's not enough space for one more media member for a regular-season game between the 1-6 Connecticut Sun and the Atlanta Dream? Interesting. OutKick asked the team why it refused our request for a credential, if it denied any other credentials and if there is an edict from the WNBA to keep us from covering games. The Sun did not respond to our questions. The Sun granted several media credentials to OutKick last year, includinga playoff game that featured the Indiana Fever and Caitlin Clark, so it's unlikely that their excuse is anywhere near the truth. No, the more likely reason is that the WNBA doesn't want OutKick at its games. Why? Because we refuse to act like a PR firm representing the league andwant to ask actual questions. You know, reporting. But the WNBA doesn't want that. That's why not one \"reporter\" or \"journalist\" has asked Brittney Griner what she said on May 23. They want to continue to get media credentials. The league has sent the message loud-and-clear: cover the WNBA how we want you to cover it, or you're not going to be invited back.

Why wouldn't they? Transparency builds trust. And if there's nothing to hide, there's no reason not to be transparent. Maybe the WNBA isn't hiding anything. But denying media access to a major news organization raises doubts about whether it is being fully transparent. Take a look at an example from last season. Christine Brennan,one of the most progressive liberals in the sports media, came under fire for simply asking DiJonai Carrington aboutpoking Caitlin Clark in the eye. It was a perfectly reasonable question, and one that needed to be asked. Yet, the WNBA Players' Association issued a statementasking the league to revoke Brennan's media credentials. Cover us the way we want, or you're not coming to our birthday party! But just because the WNBA won't let us into its games doesn't mean we're going to stop asking.

Those players included star running back Saquon Barkley. \"It's everybody's choice,\" McNabb said of the players who went. \"You don't harp on anybody else's decision of what they made, it's a decision. It's a personal decision that he made, for both, for Jalen and for Saquon,\" McNabb said. \"And again, after you do your visit or whatever it may be, you get right back to focusing on the task at hand and seeing if you can have that opportunity to be invited back to the White House.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When the Eagles won the Super Bowl back in 2018, the team decided not to attend the White House. Trump rescinded the invitation to host the Eagles after several players said they would not participate in the visit because of his previous criticisms of national anthem protests.

    "article_text": "Check out the best moments between the Athletics and the Toronto Blue Jays! They simply go bythe Athleticsnow, as the team formerly stationed in Oakland will soon plant their roots in Las Vegas. For now, the team plays their games at Sutter Health Park, a minor league field in Sacramento, while the transition to Las Vegas continues to run its course. As a result, there is a large portion of the team’s fanbase that remains disgruntled at ownership for moving to Sin City instead of continuing to play in Oakland. Well, one fan decided to make his presence known during the team’s pregame show on Thursday ahead of the match-up with theMinnesota Twins. He wore a t-shirt that read, \"SELL.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM A fan wears a \"SELL\" t-shirt during the first inning between the Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics at T-Mobile Park.(Steven Bisig-Imagn Images) While the pregame show was going on, that fan was quickly confronted by a Sutter Health Park security guard, and more team and field officials quickly followed suit. The whole thing was captured on the live broadcast. Joe Horton identified himself on social media as the man in question, and he noted that security allowed him to remain in his seat for the game after speaking with them. He told Awful Announcing, who posted the pregame clips on X, that this was \"not my first rodeo.\" ATHLETICS' SACRAMENTO ERA STARTS WITH HISTORIC BLOWOUT, ‘SELL THE TEAM’ CHANTS AND PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES \"When they show up I think the whole time – you know this too is on TV right?\" Horton replied on X.

Oakland Athletics fans Sabrina Winn (left) and Milton Cardoza carry \"Sell\" flags to protest ownership plans to move the franchise to Las Vegas, before an Opening Day game between the Athletics and Cleveland Guardians at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.(D. Ross Cameron-USA Today Sports) \"Look how many friends I made today,\" he captioned the screenshot. Fans like Horton remain ticked off by A’s owner John Fisher, who is leading the move toLas Vegas. Similar t-shirts, signs, and flags were seen at the Oakland Coliseum last season when the team’s home games started to dwindle as the schedule came to a close. The Athletics will be playing in Sacramento for at least the next couple of seasons, as the team’s new ballpark in Las Vegas won’t be ready until 2028 at the earliest. So, fans like Horton continue to voice their opinion on Fisher’s moves, and it’s clear a good portion of the fan base wishes him out of baseball. He doesn’t seem inclined to do so.

WWE star The Miz may be one of the biggestCleveland Brownsfans in sports. The Ohio native has been seen supporting the Browns at games in Cleveland and on NFL shows talking about the team he loves. Cleveland was once again the talk of the NFL world in April when the team traded the No. 2 overall pick in the draft to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who eventually selected Travis Hunter. The Browns received the No. 5 pick and drafted Mason Graham. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders (12) takes a break during NFL football practice in Berea, Ohio, Wednesday, June 4, 2025.(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki) It took until the later rounds, but the Browns added to their quarterback room with the selections of Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel. Cleveland took Sanders after Gabriel as the former Colorado quarterback slid, sparking the attention of the sports world, including PresidentDonald Trump. The Miz, whose real name is Mike Mizanin, told Fox News Digital in recent interview that Sanders is in a great spot to learn the ropes as a professional quarterback with Joe Flacco on the roster. \"I’m not really a professional football player, and I’m not a quarterback, and I’m not in a quarterback room with Joe Flacco,\" he prefaced. \"But if you are in a quarterback room with Joe Flacco who has been to the Super Bowl, won the Super Bowl, has doneincredible things in the NFL,I would just put my head down and learn and listen, because he has a great coach and Kevin Stefanski and I think just be the player that he was in Colorado.

Like, I always feel like … the best person is a person that can’t help being themselves, right? That’s the best, in my opinion, and I think he can’t help being himself, and think he’s a born leader. And I think, in the end … I know it’s gonna be a little circus here and there, but if he can play to the caliber that I feel like he could be, he could be a franchise quarterback.\" Sanders will compete with Gabriel and Kenny Pickett for the few spots on the roster. Flacco may have the advantage going in as he was on the team in 2023 and took over for an injured Deshaun Watson to keep the Browns on a playoff pace. Watson suffered a torn Achilles in 2024 and re-ruptured the Achilles as he recovered. It’s unclear whether he’ll be healthy and ready to return to the field anytime soon.

A man who climbed Mount Everest to install a defibrillator there says the device wound upsaving a woman’s lifejust three weeks afterward. David Sullivan, 62, made the journey to the Himalayas to place the lifesaving device on the mountain. He believes it is the world's highest-positioned defibrillator, sitting more than 16,000 feet above sea level, according to news agency SWNS.

He began traveling the globe as an advocate to provideCPR trainingand install life-saving equipment in hard-to-reach places. David Sullivan, 62, pictured here, made the journey to the Himalayas to place the lifesaving device on the mountain.(David Sullivan / SWNS) Earlier this year, Sullivan climbed to an altitude of 22,000 feet to test a defibrillator. He then descended to a village near Everest Base Camp to install it for emergency use. Sullivan returned home to Surrey on April 30, glad about what he'd accomplished — but with no idea how quickly his work would make an impact. HOT TRAVEL TREND HAS PEOPLE ‘TOWNSIZING’ BY VISITING QUAINT AMERICAN TOWNS Just three weeks later, he got a phone call. \"It was … Friday (May 23), at around 3:45 a.m.,\" Sullivan told SWNS. \"I have kids traveling the world, so I initially thought, ‘Oh my God, something's happened.’\" Sullivan founded Code Blue CPR, an organization that aims to teach people lifesaving CPR and install more defibrillators in out-of-the-way places.(David Sullivan / SWNS) He added, \"But it was a Sherpa [a Tibetan mountain guide] who told me the defibrillator had been activated and saved a 30-year-old woman's life,\" Sullivan said. \"It was the proudest moment of my life.\" The rescue confirmed why he'd taken on the physically and emotionallydemanding journey. \"I hope it will help people realize how important it is to have access to defibrillators.\" While in the Himalayas, Sullivan didn’t just install the defibrillator - he also trained local Sherpas and villagers, many of whom had never received emergency medical instruction, according to SWNS. \"It is incredible that something so simple can save someone's life - and I hope it will help people realize how important it is to have access to defibrillators,\" Sullivan said.

For Sullivan, there's another personal angle. \"It was the proudest moment of my life.\" He once had to use his CPR training just months after learning it himself. \"I performed nine minutes of CPR for a young man and used a defibrillator just three months after I had been shown how to,\" he told SWNS. \"While I was doing this, around 30 people just watched and didn't help - because they didn't know how.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER When the young man's mother called him the next day to say her son was alive, Sullivan said it changed his life. \"I knew then that everyone should know how tosave a life,\" Sullivan said.

    "title": "Musk vs. Trump: Why MAGA needs to make up its mind",
    "article_text": "‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Charles Hurt break down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, after they exchanged public jabs online. Every divorce is painful, even the ones we see coming. TheMAGA faithful—those who’ve spent the last decade weathering smear campaigns, censorship, and mockery for backing a man who promised to drain the swamp—now face a difficult reckoning. It’s time to pick sides. And make no mistake: this is a split. The Trump-Musk bromance, once filled with mutual nods and occasional meme-sharing affection, is over. And that’s not a tragedy. It’s clarity.Because while many on the right have admiredElon Muskfor his defiance of woke orthodoxy, his skirmishes with legacy media, and his talent for commanding attention, he was never truly aligned with the mission. Elon isn’t fighting for America. He’s fighting for something else entirely: bandwidth, bots, and Mars.Trump? He’s still fighting for you. DEMOCRATS BEGIN TO EMBRACE MUSK AMID TRUMP SPAT AFTER PARTY RAILED AGAINST HIM AS A 'DICTATOR' For a while, it was convenient to pretend the two men were aligned. Both billionaires. Both anti-establishment disruptors. Both hated by the same people. But that’s a surface reading—a lazy one. Scratch even slightly beneath, and what emerges is a yawning ideological gap between a nationalist and a globalist. A man trying to restore America’s sovereignty, and a man trying to abandon Earth entirely. Trump’s project has always been terrestrial. He wants factories in Michigan,borders in Texas, and jobs in Ohio. He wants to make America great again, not because it’s nostalgic, but because it was working—until it wasn’t. Musk, on the other hand, wants to make Mars habitable. He talks about humanity like a species, not a nation. It’s not evil. But it’s not patriotic either. Musk’s horizon doesn’t stop at the Pacific—it doesn’t even stop at the stratosphere.And when it comes to allegiance, Musk’s is flexible—transactional. He sides with whoever can help him build the next piece of his empire. One day it’s Trump. The next, it'sXi Jinping, who previously rolled out the red carpet while Musk praised China’s \"work ethic\" and handed over key patents for electric vehicle tech. This isn’t a man committed to the West. It’s a man committed to whatever works. This isn’t a matter of good guy versus bad guy. It’s a matter of side. One wants a sovereign America, and the other wants a scalable platform. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS STAND FIRM AGAINST MUSK'S ‘KILL THE BILL’ ASSAULT ON TRUMP'S AGENDA Let’s not forget who these men are.Donald Trumpis crude, sure. But he’s clear. He believes the American worker has been screwed, the middle class decimated, and the country handed over to foreign interests and multinational parasites. And he’s not wrong. He ran on a promise to put America first. Musk, on the other hand, believes the solution to our problems is a blend of Neuralink, Starlink, and some theoretical Martian colony where free speech exists in the form of X Premium subscriptions. His obsession isn’t justice—it’s optimization. He doesn’t care about restoring the American Dream. He wants to replace it with a simulation. Look closely, and you’ll see that Musk’s libertarian chic has always been more about license than liberty. He wants fewer rules—not necessarily more rights. His vision isn’t rooted in the Constitution. It’s rooted in code. ELON MUSK MAY SPEAK TO TRUMP AIDES IN PUSH TO CALM FEUD Meanwhile, Trump stands for something dangerous in elite circles: limits.Borders. Culture. Memory. The idea that you can’t code your way out of decline. That you actually have to fight for your country, not automate it out of existence. That’s why the regime hates him. And why some on the right, mesmerized by Musk’s IQ and memes, need to wake the hell up. Because this divorce was inevitable. The man who wants to lead a nation can’t stay hitched to the man who wants to lead a species. And the man who wants to win the hearts and minds of blue-collar America can’t march in lockstep with the guy who’sbuilding a rocketin Texas to colonize Olympus Mons. It’s fine to admire Musk’s courage in certain cultural battles. But admiration doesn’t equal allegiance. This isn’t about who’s cool on X. This is about who shows up for the American worker. Who bleeds when this country bleeds. Who isn’t looking for the eject button.So yes—divorces hurt. But sometimes they’re clarifying. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONReal MAGA means putting America first. NotMars. Not markets. Not memes. Trump doesn’t want to terraform a new world. He wants to fight for this one.And if you believe this country is still worth saving, then your choice isn’t complicated.Choose the president. Not the platform.

    "title": "LIZ PEEK: Five critical takeaways from the epic Trump-Musk rumble",
    "article_text": "‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ co-hosts Rachel Campos-Duffy and Charles Hurt break down the growing rift between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, after they exchanged public jabs online. The world’s richest man and the world's most powerful man are butting heads in one of the most embarrassing and possibly most damaging squabbles of all time; it was inevitable. For months, observers of the bromance between PresidentDonald Trumpand Tesla founder Elon Musk have wondered when, not if, it would end. Two men whose accomplishments have bestowed them with sizeable egos, are both impulsive, quick to rile and not shy about taking their every thought public. Both men, used to having their way and getting things done, joined forces to take on the status quo in Washington, and ran smack into the concrete of bureaucratic inertia, making their tasks almost impossible. Trump, in his second Oval Office term, was expecting that. Musk, though, did not take resistance well. MUSK'S QUESTION ABOUT CREATING NEW POLITICAL PARTY PIQUES STEPHEN A SMITH'S INTEREST AMID CEO'S TRUMP FEUD The row between Musk and Trump that emerged on X and Truth Social, respectively, had all the dignity of mud wrestling. It began with Musk calling thepresident’s \"big, beautiful bill\"an abomination, irate that it is projected to add trillions of dollars to the nation’s debt. At a moment when Republicans are struggling to pass a critical piece of their agenda, turning public opinion against the legislation was a slap in the face to the White House. From better times a week ago: Elon Musk receives a golden key from President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on May 30.(Reuters/Nathan Howard) Trump responded by acknowledging to reporters some uncertainty about the future of their relationship, causing Musk to attack the bill again, and, in particular, its rescinding of tax credits for EVs, a potential hit to the fortunes ofTesla. Musk then took credit for GOP victories in last year’s election, posting, \"Such ingratitude.\" The back-and-forth spooled out over a few hours, with Musk and Trump ramping up their outrage and accusations. Trump posted that Musk went \"crazy\" when he asked the SpaceX founder to leave the government and because \"I took away his EV mandate.\" DEMOCRATS BEGIN TO EMBRACE MUSK AMID TRUMP SPAT AFTER PARTY RAILED AGAINST HIM AS A 'DICTATOR' Ultimately, Musk posted what he described as a \"big bomb,\" claiming that Trump was \"in\" theJeffrey Epstein files,which is \"why they have not been made public.\" That charge falls flat, because the public has known for years that Trump flew on Epstein’s jet; if anything especially damaging is in those files, certainly former President Joe Biden would have leaked it. The nastiness continued, with Musk predicting that the \"Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of the year.\" Finally, after threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft that ferried astronauts home from the space station, which would hurt the country and Musk’s prestigious leadership of our space effort, someone recommended on X that Musk cool off, and he quieted down. This is not the first time in recent months that Musk has lashed out at members of the Trump administration. After the election, he got into a shouting match with Trump lawyer Boris Epshteyn, as the two men jousted for influence over cabinet picks. He also reportedly got into a loud altercation recently with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over who should lead the IRS. As Axios reported, \"Musk has had high-profile disputes with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Trade Adviser Peter Navarro as well.\" WOULD DONALD TRUMP HAVE WON THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WITHOUT ELON MUSK'S HELP? As these battles raged, some in the administration concluded that Musk had gotten a \"little big for his britches,\" while another told NBC News that the entrepreneur is \"behaving as if he's a co-president.\" Most recently, Musk blew up when his pick for NASA director, Jared Isaacman, was dumped at the last minute, reportedly as punishment for his criticism of the BBB. According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, the \"decision infuriated Musk, who complained to associates over the weekend that he had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected…\", suggesting he expected payback. Not wise. Trump bought a Tesla from Musk at the White House as a show of support earlier this year when the EV-maker faced consumer backlash over Musk's political activism.(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) FETTERMAN DISSES DEMS FOR SUDDENLY EMBRACING MUSK AMID TRUMP FALLOUT Generally, Trump has succeeded in controlling the big personalities on his team. AfterMusk’s set-to with Bessent, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"it's no secret President Trump has put together a team of people who are incredibly passionate about the issues impacting our country.\" Sometimes passion is uncontrollable. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION A few conclusions: 1.Elon Muskis a somewhat erratic genius who has built some of the most consequential businesses of our time. But he knows very little about how the government functions and what is required to pass legislation. The BBB is far from perfect, but it is likely the best Republicans can do. 2. If Musk thinks he can make new friends on the left, he’s wrong. They hate him for being anti-union and anti-woke, guaranteeing free speech on Twitter (X) and for electing Trump. He has opined about a new political party — that won’t happen. 3. Musk did the U.S. a great service by calling out some of the waste and fraud he and hisDOGEteam discovered. The effort will hopefully go forward, as bipartisan estimates of misspent taxpayer dollars run into the hundreds of billions of dollars. That is unacceptable, and unaffordable. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS STAND FIRM AGAINST MUSK'S 'KILL THE BILL' ASSAULT ON TRUMP'S AGENDA 4. As we hurtle towards an AI-informed world, Musk’s xAI will be essential to providing balance. Do we want to cede all future instruction and the rewriting of history to leftists at Google or Meta? No, Musk’s company will provide an alternative, which must be encouraged. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Most recently, Musk blew up when his pick for NASA director, Jared Isaacman, was dumped at the last minute, reportedly as punishment for his criticism of the BBB. 5. Trump managed to harness Musk’s brilliance to the service of the country. He also benefited from Musk’s substantial support during the election. For both those reasons, the president should make every effort to rebuild his relationship with Musk, who can help keep our technology and space industries the envy of the world. For his part, Musk should remember: there is only one president. Musk and Trump created a partnership that benefited the country. It wasn’t perfect; the government is a dangerous place to make waves. President Trump discovered that during his first term. Beneficiaries of the status quo rise up to resist change; with every dollar cut, someone’s ox gets gored. But the work must go forward. This Trump-Musk rift must heal. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK",

    "title": "Why Trump’s $3 billion wake-up call to higher ed is exactly what America needs",
    "article_text": "People in Washington D.C., Detroit, MI and Houston, TX react to President Trump pulling Harvard University funding and his proposal to shuffle the cut finances to trade schools. When PresidentDonald Trumprecently suggested taking $3 billion from Harvard’s federal funding and redirecting it toward trade schools, he didn’t just launch a headline, he launched a national reckoning. And as a university president, I believe he touched a nerve that desperately needed to be hit. For too long, higher education has drifted from its purpose.Elite institutionshave grown wealthier and more disconnected, while everyday Americans shoulder massive student debt for degrees that no longer guarantee opportunity. The result? A broken pipeline, rising costs, shrinking returns, and students who feel forced to choose between meaning and mobility. Graduates celebrate during Harvard University's 374th Commencement on May 29, 2025. (Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images) But here’s the truth few are willing to say out loud: not every student is called to a traditional university path. And that’s not a problem to fix, it’s a reality to embrace. HARVARD VS. TRUMP: ALL THE PRESIDENT WANTS IS FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO OBEY THE LAW In my role, I’ve seen firsthand the power ofaligning education with calling. That includes aspiring teachers, ministers and entrepreneurs, but also electricians, HVAC technicians, mechanics and builders. I’ve met students who feel more alive on a construction site than in a lecture hall. And I’ve seen how learning construction technology can do more than build a career, it can restore confidence, dignity and purpose. This is personal for me. I lead a university, yes, but I also lead with the conviction that education should serve the whole person: spiritually, practically and vocationally. That’s why I believe the future of higher ed must includethe trades, not as a fallback, but as a foundation. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Christian tradition understands this well. Jesus worked with wood and nails before preaching in synagogues. Paul made tents to support his ministry. Scripture doesn’t draw a line between spiritual work and skilled labor. It lifts both as sacred. As Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 4:11, \"Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life… and to work with your hands.\" What we need now is a cultural reset. One that stops looking down on trades and starts investing in them, not just with funding, but with respect. That means parents affirming their child’s calling, even if it leads to a job site instead of a boardroom. It means pastors reminding their congregations that all honest work is sacred. And it means more universities embracing flexible, high-quality training that equips students for lives of both character and competence. The goal isn’t to pit trade schools againsttraditional universities. It’s to restore balance. Because the future of our country won’t be built from ivory towers. It will be built from the ground up, by people with tools in their hands and purpose in their hearts. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We need welders with wisdom. Carpenters with character.

    "title": "Federal AI power grab could end state protections for kids and workers",
    "article_text": "Gladstone A.I. co-founders and CEOs Edouard Harris and Jeremie Harris explain the major role that A.I will play in national security and warfare on ‘The Will Cain Show.’ Just asAI begins to upendAmerican society, Congress is considering a move that would sideline states from enforcing commonsense safeguards. Tucked into the recently passed House reconciliation package is Section 43201, a provision that would pre-empt nearly all state and local laws governing \"artificial intelligence models,\" \"artificial intelligence systems,\" and \"automated decision systems\" for the next 10 years. Last night, the Senate released its own version of the moratorium that would restrict states from receiving federal funding for broadband infrastructure if they don’t fall in line. Supporters argue that a moratorium is needed to avoid a patchwork of state rules that could jeopardize U.S. AI competitiveness. AI'S DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA – AND IT ALL HINGES ON THESE FREEDOMS But this sweeping approach threatens to override legitimate state efforts to curb Big Tech’s worst abuses—with no federal safeguards to replace them. It also risks undermining the constitutional role of state legislatures to protect the interests and rights of American children and working families amid AI’s far-reaching social and economic disruptions. In the absence of Congressional action, states have been the first line of defense againstBig Tech. Texas, Florida, Utah, and other states have led the way to protect children online, safeguard data privacy, and rein in platform censorship. Section 43201 puts many of those laws—even those not directly related to AI—at risk. The provision defines \"automated decision systems\" broadly, potentially capturing core functions of social media platforms, such as TikTok’s For You feed or Instagram’s recommendation engine. At least 12 states have enacted laws requiring parental consent or age verification for minors accessing these platforms. However, because these laws specifically apply to social media platforms, they could easily be construed as regulating \"automated decision systems\"— and thus be swept up in the moratorium. Further, Section 43201 might also block provisions of existing state privacy laws that restrict the use of algorithms—including AI—to predict consumer behavior, preferences, or characteristics. Even setting aside concerns with the moratorium’s expansive scope, it suffers from a more fundamental flaw. The moratorium threatens to short-circuit American federalism by undermining state laws that ensure AI lives up to the promise outlined by Vice PresidentJ.D. Vance. Speaking at the Paris AI Summit, he warned against viewing \"AI as a purely disruptive technology that will inevitably automate away our labor force.\" Instead,Vance called for\"policies that ensure that AI… make[s] our workers more productive\" and rewards them with \"higher wages, better benefits, and safer and more prosperous communities.\" That vision is nearly impossible without state-level action. Legislators, governors, and attorneys general from Nashville to Salt Lake City are already advancing creative, democratically accountable solutions. Tennessee’s novel ELVIS Act protects music artists from nonconsensual AI-generated voice and likeness cloning. Utah’s AI consumer protection law requires that generative AI model deployers notify consumers when they are interacting with an AI. Other states, including Arkansas and Montana, are building legal frameworks for digital property rights with respect to AI models, algorithms, data, and model outputs. All of this is now at risk. As laboratories of democracy, states are essential to navigating the inevitable and innumerable trade-offs entailed by the diffusion ofemerging technologies. Federalism enables continuous experimentation and competition between states—exposing the best and worst approaches to regulation in highly dynamic environments. That’s critical when confronting AI’s vast and constantly evolving sphere of impact on children and employment—to say nothing of the technology’s wider socio-economic effects. Sixty leading advocacy and research organizations have warned thatAI chatbotspose a significant threat to kids. They cite harrowing stories of teens who have been induced to suicide, addiction, sexual perversion, and self-harm at the hands of Big AI. Even industry leaders are sounding alarms: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimates that AI could force up to 20% unemployment over the next five years. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Innovation inherently brings disruption—but disruption without guardrails can harm the very communities AI is purportedly meant to uplift. That’s why 40 state attorneys general, Democrats and Republicans alike, signed a letter opposing Section 43201, warning that it would override \"carefully tailored laws targeting specific harms related to the use of AI.\" To be sure, not all laws are drafted equal. States like California and Colorado are imposing European-style AI regulations particularly detrimental to \"Little Tech\" and open-source model developers. But Congress shouldn’t throw out federalism with the \"doomer\" bathwater. Rather than a blanket pre-emption, it should consider narrow, targeted limits carefully tailored to stymie high-risk bills—modeled on California and Colorado’s approach—that foist doomer AI standards on the rest of the nation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Absent a comprehensive federal AI framework, states must retain freedom to act—specifically, to ensure that AI bolsters American innovation and competitiveness in pursuit of a thriving middle class. America’s AI future has great potential. But our laboratories of democracy are key to securing it. Daniel Cochrane is a Senior Research Associate for The Heritage Foundation’s Tech Policy Center.",

    "article_text": "Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the Trump administration's border security agenda and the House-passed spending bill that would fund thousands of new ICE officers. Our country stands at a crossroads. Thanks to PresidentDonald Trump’s and Homeland Security Secretary Noem’s leadership, our border is secure. We can either capitalize on this success and give law enforcement the resources it needs to keep it secure by passing the One Big, Beautiful Bill, or we can let the sacrifice of our men and women on the ground be in vain. Considering the sheer size and prior dismantling of oursouthern border, what Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Coast Guard, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have managed to accomplish is remarkable. They cut daily encounters with illegal aliens by 95%, seized billions of dollars worth of cocaine and over 3,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl, and deported hundreds of gang members and terrorists. On day one of President Trump’s second term, he deployed the U.S. military to help secure our border and protect our homeland. This includes Kansas’ own 1st Infantry Division, or \"The Big Red One,\" stationed at Fort Riley, which has been deployed to Fort Huachuca in Sierra Vista, Arizona. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on May 30, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Recently, I traveled to the southern border alongside law enforcement officers from Kansas – to personally thank these soldiers and all CBP officers for their service. BIDEN'S BORDER LEGACY: A FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT WILL LAST FOR YEARS What I saw was encouraging – morale is high and there is a clear hop in their step. However, resources are stretched thin, and their work is far from over. A full one-third of the cameras used by CBP to monitor the border are not working. While the administration has built nearly 80 miles ofborder wall, the CBP relies on these cameras to cover the areas that lack a wall. We need those cameras and a completed wall to ensure that no future president can throw open our border to the entire world ever again. CBP also patrols nearly 2,000 miles along the southern border – much of it in hostile and difficult terrain. Yet, its vehicle fleet is simply not up to the task. Cartels are now trying to circumvent our closed land borders by smuggling drugs over the high seas. At the same time, the Coast Guard – charged with securing our maritime border – is facing its greatest readiness crisis since World War II. I REPRESENT A BORDER DISTRICT THAT WAS SWAMPED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. WHAT I'M SEEING NOW MIGHT SURPRISE YOU Its fleet of cutters is aging, a lack of manpower and funding caused six stations to be shut down, and under Biden, it missed its recruitment goals for four straight years. Secretary Noem has stopped the bleeding, and new recruits are flooding in, but only Congress can give the service what it needs to shut the cartels down once and for all. Under Biden, over 1.7 millionillegal immigrantsevaded Border Patrol. These are the worst of the worst: dangerous gang members, terrorists and violent criminals. ICE is quite literally so successful at arresting these criminals that they are running out of space to house them as they prepare them for removal. And, without sufficient ICE officers on the ground, we will never be able to fulfill President Trump’s mandate to deport 1 million illegal aliens per year. Our brave men and women in law enforcement and the military need more funding, they need more materials and they need more personnel. Now that the House has passed the One Big, Beautiful Bill, we must step up and get it to President Trump’s desk. Passing this bill is the only way we canensure that our border stays secure. It will provide more than $46 billion to finish building the border wall and fix those broken cameras. It also appropriates $1 billion for CBP to replace its inadequate vehicle fleet. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER The Coast Guard will receive $21 billion to help it acquire new cutters, airframes and 15,000 new coasties. Every dollar spent will help them break up smuggling networks and keep fentanyl – the deadly drug that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans – out of our communities. The bill will also provide ICE with the funding it needs to hire and train 10,000 new agents – reinforcements that are much needed. ICE officers are facing down some of the worst criminals in our country every day, and they are facing a 412% increase in assaults. Just the other week, an ICE officer was injured while arresting a criminal alien. ICE needs backup, and it needed it yesterday. Super Bowl-winning teams know that in the offseason, the work doesn’t stop. New players must be drafted, trained and prepped for another championship run.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Cornelius Garrison was murdered in New Orleans in 2020. He had been cooperating with federal authorities investigating a crash-for-cash insurance fraud scheme. For years, Garrison helped stage car crashes, directing participants to purposefully crash into trucks with the hopes of extracting a settlement from their companies. He would then funnel the passengers from these choreographed car wrecks to billboard attorney Vanessa Motta’s law firm, who would then file knowingly fraudulent lawsuits. For agreeing to expose thiscrime network,Garrison lost his life. Nine defendants now face charges related to this particular staged automobile collision scheme, according to anindictmentfrom the U.S. Department of Justice. So far, more than 63 individuals have been charged in a federal probe ofstaged car crashesin the New Orleans metro area. Unfortunately, these tactics are not isolated to New Orleans. They are occurring in cities across this country.Criminal networks across the United States are choreographing collisions withtrucks,rideshare cars and private motorists, causing injuries, and eventually siphoning settlements that the rest of us ultimately fund. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVIVES ENGLISH LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT FOR TRUCK DRIVERS Congresscan stop it. Earlier this month, I led a group of U.S. representatives in calling United States Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a federal task force to investigate and prosecute these rings, helping to shut them down. The Trump administration should launch it now. New York is central to the nationwide staged accident problem. FILE: A truck driving through a Soho intersection in Manhattan. Today, motorists face choreographed threats when they drive on America’s roads. It may look like two sedans boxing in an eighty-thousand-pound tractor-trailer. The lead car slams the brakes. Physics takes over. Moments later, the truck has \"rear-ended\" a vehicle whose drivers set the whole scheme in motion. They call a lawyer. Lawsuits are filed. The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud says such scamshelp drain $308 billion annuallyfrom the U.S. economy, including $45 billion in property-and-casualty lines. Commercial vehicles, including truck drivers and rideshares, are easy targets to these criminal networks because the liability limits are high, and juries often blame the big trucks and commercial companies.Premiums for independent truckershave jumped nearly 50% in three years. AUTO OWNERS WORRIED ABOUT RISING INSURANCE PREMIUMS In my home state of Georgia, 23% of every Uber ride goes directly into insurance costs. Fewer trucks on America’s roads mean higher freight rates and thinner inventories. Every shopper pays the price. This fraud also corrodes the rule of law. Free markets can function only when real risk, not manufactured danger, sets the price of insurance. Honest drivers subsidize this deceit. The reach and breadth of this fraud is staggering. In New York, ground zero of the so-called \"fraudemic,\" a surge of staged-accident lawsuits and collusion between plaintiff lawyers and medical providers triggered investigations that forced one billboard attorney firm to drop hundreds of bogus claims. Since 2014, there have been 63 investigations involving U-Haul-related fraud, resulting in 47 arrests, including 20 criminal cases opened in 2019 alone. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION A focused federal task force could put a stop to this. Stronger laws must also back the effort. I have introduced the\"Staged Accident Fraud Prevention Act.\"It would make causing a crash for a payday a specific federal crime with hard prison time. Fraud is already illegal, but current penalties were written for one-off crashes, not the exploding cottage industry of assembly-line scams, causing million-dollar payouts. The law should match the crime. STUNTWOMAN PERSONAL INJURY ATTORNEY STAGED CAR CRASHES FOR PROFIT: FEDS This billstill ensures justice for those who have been harmed in an accident. Genuine victims would still get their day in court. What vanishes is the incentive to invent injuries or recruit passengers as props. This fraud also corrodes the rule of law. Free markets can function only when real risk, not manufactured danger, sets the price of insurance. Honest drivers subsidize this deceit. The reach and breadth of this fraud is staggering. Consumers would benefit first. Lower fraud losses mean lower premiums. Small trucking operators would stay in business. Rideshare passengers would see relief in the form of their total ride cost. Roads would grow safer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Support for broad reform is growing. The American Trucking Association, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, and rideshare companies like Uber have all called for quick action in launching a task force. These organizations are on the road every day and see it firsthand. The path forward is clear. The Department of Justice should launch the task force. Congress should pass the prevention act. Staged-accident fraud may not lead cable news segments nightly, but it drains wallets and endangers lives. Congress can — and should — end it. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

    "title": "Sanctuary cities forced to comply with federal immigration rules due to innovative program",
    "article_text": "‘Border czar’ Tom Homan discusses a Tennessee mayor being accused of aiding and abetting illegal migrants on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Sanctuary cities’ runaround of the law may have finally come to an end, thanks to a creative program calledOperation Guardian Angel. Launched by Bill Essayli, the new U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, this commonsense approach to force scofflawsanctuary citiesto cooperate with—and stop obstructing—federal immigration authorities should be copied by U.S. attorneys around the nation to help rid the country of criminal illegal aliens being detained by local authorities. It's a no-brainer. 'FLOOD THE SYSTEM': US ATTORNEY UNLEASHES NEW TASK FORCE TO CRACK DOWN ON BLUE STATE'S SANCTUARY POLICIES Sanctuary Cities 101 California has been a sanctuary state since 2018, when former Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law turning it into a sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens. But California’s move to create a safe haven for criminals started even earlier, at the local level. In 1979, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates implemented \"Special Order 40,\" which prohibited his police officers both from making contact with anyone for the sole purpose of learning their immigration status and from making arrests for violations of U.S. immigration law. In 1985, San Francisco’s then-mayor Dianne Feinstein signed legislation designating the city as a sanctuary for aliens whose asylum claims had been rejected by the federal government. In 1989, San Francisco voters passed an ordinance extending that protection to all illegal aliens, prohibiting the city’s police force from aidingfederal immigration officers. In 2013, San Franciscans passed the \"Due Process for All\" ordinance, which limited when local law enforcement officers could give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) advance notice of an illegal alien’s release from a local jail and prohibited cooperation with ICE detainer warrants or requests. In 2016, San Franciscans amended the law again to impose even further restrictions on city employees that, in essence, ban any and all inquiries into the immigration status of any resident and prohibit any cooperation with federal officers. Sanctuary City Crime Hell Holes Is it any surprise that California as a whole and particularly its cities have become a magnet forillegal aliens? It shouldn’t be. And is it any surprise when some of those illegal aliens commit additional crimes, including rape and murder? Sadly, no. But lawmakers and elected politicians there think it's better to endanger the safety of their constituents by releasing these criminals back into local communities rather than turning them over to the feds so they can be deported and returned to their native countries. This has consequences. Take Kate Steinle. She was murdered on Pier 14 in San Francisco by José Inez García Zárate, a career criminal with seven felony convictions and who had beendeported five times.  He had recently been released from local custody back out on the streets after San Francisco dropped drug charges that were pending against him and refused to cooperate with the immigration detainer ICE had filed against him. California’s brand of egregious sanctuary legislation explains how it’s possible for 250,000 illegal aliens to have a combined total of nearly 1.7 million arrests for three million offenses committed on U.S. soil, as one 2011 study showed. Of course, those numbers have likely expanded exponentially after four years of Biden’s open border policies with virtually no vetting. Just this week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a list ofsanctuary jurisdictionsacross the country, including entire states, counties, and cities. That list includes a total of over 560 sanctuaries that release thousands of deportable criminal aliens every year. Between 2021 and 2024 alone, 22,000 illegal aliens were released from sanctuary city jails without notification to ICE. One of these released illegal aliens was Jose Antonio Ibarra, the Venezuelan man who brutally murdered Laken Riley in February of 2024. The 22-year-old nursing student was jogging on the University of Georgia campus when she was attacked by Ibarra. DNA evidence showed Riley fought back against Ibarra, who was trying to rape her. After a struggle, Ibarra bashed her head in with a rock multiple times. Her cause of death was blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. But it was New York’s sanctuary policy that allowed it to happen. Shortly before Laken’s murder, Ibarra had been released from New York custody after being arrested on local charges, but ICE was not informed. Tragically, Laken and Kate’s stories are not unique. Every day, thousands of Americans are victimized by violent illegal aliens, who are escorted right past ICE and into our communities by the district attorneys of sanctuary cities. Flouting Federal Law Local and state laws that claimsanctuary statusdirectly violate federal law— specifically, 8 U.S.C. §1373, which bans local governments from preventing law enforcement from sharing information about the \"citizen or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.\" Laken Riley would be alive today had New York’s rogue prosecutor Alvin Bragg waited until the DHS issued a detainer for Ibarra and then cooperated with DHS the way the law requires. Kate Steinle’s life would have been spared if San Francisco hadn’t enacted a policy banning local police officers from notifying DHS when they arrest an illegal alien. A New Way Forward Fortunately, one U.S. attorney is finally fed up with his fellow Californians being slaughtered, assaulted, raped, and otherwise victimized by criminal illegals benefitting from the Golden State’s irresponsible policies. Operation Guardian Angel closes the loophole in sanctuary cities’ blatantly lawless schemes that allow them to simply ignore administrative ICE detainer warrants. How? Two words: judicial warrants. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli pulled together an all-starfederal taskforcecomprising agents from five federal law enforcement agencies—including ICE and the FBI—all working out of an office in Los Angeles. When an illegal alien with a prior deportation is inevitably arrested, upon identification and booking into the local jail, the taskforce seeks a federal criminal warrant—signed by a federal judge—for felony re-entry under 8 USC §1326. By using available criminal databases to find illegal aliens who were arrested and jailed the day before, the team quickly learns of each new offender. Then, a federal warrant is served on local officials, who obviously won’t buck a federal judge’s warrant. That warrant requires local officials to hand over the illegal criminal alien to ICE. As Essayli said in one interview, \"They have no choice; they will comply.\" And it’s already working. Operation Guardian Angel started May 10th, and by the 15th, ICE agents had made 13 arrests. Once fully underway, the taskforce expects to make 40-50 arrests weekly, even despite the obstructionist sanctuary policies of the city and the state. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There is no reason why every one of the 93 U.S. Attorney’s offices shouldn’t be copying Essayli’s playbook. His simple, effective strategy returns to immigration law enforcement the power that his sanctuary state wrongfully stole. Operation Guardian Angel is a step in the right direction of recovering the Central District of California from the open border crisis, removing criminal illegal aliens, and restoring sanity in a state that has lost its way.

    "article_text": "Democratic strategist James Carville said on Wednesday he doesn’t buy it when wealthy Jewish donors tell him they’re ditching the Democratic Party because of antisemitism among its members. He says they’re doing it for a \"f------ tax cut.\" There are two truths about presidential candidates. One: There is no such thing as a perfect candidate. Two: It is very difficult to convince party elites that there are no perfect candidates. CHARLAMAGNE GRILLS ERIC SWALWELL ON HOW DEMS CAN BE TRUSTED AFTER THEY 'LIED TO US SO LONG' ABOUT BIDEN President Donald Trump’s second first 100 days are now behind him, and the Democrats are still struggling to recover after the trauma of the 2024 election. As former PresidentJoe Bidenfocuses on treatment for his cancer diagnosis, fresh questions about the chronology ofBiden’s declinein mental and physical health have further waftedKamala Harris’ hopesof a second presidential or California gubernatorial bid off the political radar and out to sea. Vice President JD Vance speaks as he visits Nucor Steel Berkeley on May 1, 2025, in Huger, South Carolina.(Photo by Kevin Lamarque-Pool/Getty Images) TheDemocratshave made it no secret they are in a desperate quest for the proper frontrunner/savior who can patch the torn fabric of their political and policy agenda, show enough leadership chops to unite both the Democratic Party and the country, and then go on to win back the White House in 2028. Former President Bill Clinton used to say of his own complicated story, \"If you want a perfect candidate, vote for somebody else.\" Yet back in 1992, despite myriad personal dramas, Clinton possessed many elements of the classic successful contender of that era: young but seasoned, a governor from a Southern state, folksy in style but gilded academically (Georgetown and Yale), respected for his brilliance within the party but able to relate to a broad swath of the voting public. PETER DOOCY, JACQUI HEINRICH SHARE SHOCK OVER KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DITCHING DEMOCRATS: 'SHE WAS WRONG' As always, at this stage of the cycle, the names of dozens of potential contenders from the out-party are being tossed about with the typical fervid combo of optimism, conviction, delusion and brio. But no potential candidate has yet broken out as an obvious frontrunner, let alone a great political athlete or generational talent such as Clinton or President Barack Obama. That is not to say that the Democratic field does not include highly intelligent, highly accomplished and highly skilled women and men. The potential contenders are an extraordinary bunch of American leaders. But none has all the necessary elements to take on the current White House or make a clear bid to win it all. Clinton, always good for a pithy remark, also has noted, \"you can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle.\" In 2028,if one could take a page from Dr. Frankenstein and turn that pig into an eagle, which attributes would the Democrats choose for their perfect model? PELOSI'S STOCK TRADING LEGACY HAUNTS DEMOCRATS AS JEFFRIES SLAMS GOP FRESHMAN'S 'THIEVERY' Let’s start with Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary under Biden and before that, the wunderkind \"Mayor Pete\" of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg, like Trump, has what one might call a \"go-on-anything confidence.\" Pete can appear on any television network, any podcast, any stage (from vast stadiums to slatted apple crates), in any state in America, and feel comfortable and poised with his audience. That trait is an essential component for 2028. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, whose good looks and stylish mien often are cited more as a disadvantage than an attribute, has a profound understanding of what is modern and urgent for today’s electorate. Newsom thinks tirelessly about America’s future, and what is important to the young and the old, growing families and hard-working tradespeople, and everyone in between. Former Transportation Secy. Pete Buttigieg speaks with reporters after holding a town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on May 13, 2025.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the popular governor of a swing state, understands how to connect with voters in a battleground arena by focusing on economic concerns and remaining on the right side of cultural issues despite party pressure. Rahm Emanuel, former congressman, White House chief of staff, mayor of Chicago, and former ambassador to Japan, brings not just his famous rough-and-tumble uncompromising bravado, but an ability to raise massive amounts of cash. His fundraising power comes from the business community, where he made millions; from Hollywood, where his brother, Ari Emanuel remains an uber mover and shaker; and from decades of fundraising amidst America’s wealthiest Democratic communities. FETTERMAN DEFIES 'PUNITIVE' PUNISHMENT FOR BREAKING WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY DURING BIPARTISAN DISCUSSION Amy Klobuchar, senator from Minnesota, has a fierce determination and inner energy that will allow her to set goals and follow through with conviction. This is an essential combo required to win a modern political contest. Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, has shown he can twist the old adage of former New York pol Mario Cuomo, who spoke of campaigning in poetry and governing in prose. Shapiro, on the other hand, is able to merge poetry and prose in his governance, achieving solid substantive goals while creating an atmosphere of aspiration and inspiration for his constituents. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, has the \"It Factor.\" Bright, charismatic, and always interesting, she commands attention whenever she speaks. (Or tweets, or comments, or posts, or poses). Gina Raimondo, Biden’s Commerce secretary and former governor of Rhode Island, is well-known, well-liked, and well-respected in the business community, which offsets a huge imbalance on the Republican side. A pro-business Democrat, Raimondo can speak the language of the business world, get its political support and earn its trust. DEMOCRATS WANT ICE AGENTS TO LOSE MASKS DESPITE SAFETY CONCERNS Ro Khanna, congressman from California, understands policy and how to connect it to the real lives of real people. Khanna is a stand-out in the Democratic Party who can envision viable policy ideas and can explain his plans plainly to the American people. Wes Moore, the governor of Maryland, has a powerful origin story and biography. After overcoming some early challenges, Moore thrived academically, served in the military, worked on Wall Street, authored several books, ran a leading nonprofit, and dedicated his life to service. He has shown a capacity to link lessons learned from his life experience to his policy goals. New York Democrat Rep.

And withJD Vance,there currently is no assembly required. With just a few months as vice president under his (Rust) belt, Vance already has proven to be perhaps the most powerful and effectual vice president in history — yes, even including Dick Cheney, Al Gore and LBJ. Not only has Vance brilliantly managed to remain this close to the mercurial Trump without once stepping on his presidential toes, but he has forged solid bonds with fellow politicos (even those who initially looked askance when Vance was tapped for the ticket). CNN POLLING EXPERT MARVELS AT COLLAPSE OF DEMOCRATIC ADVANTAGE WITH MIDDLE CLASS IN TRUMP ERA He has built up an impressive, appropriate and exceedingly visible administrative portfolio and networked productively with the most powerful GOP grassroots activists and fundraising leaders around the country. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Simultaneously, he trotted out and shielded his attractive young family; and offered a friendly hand and flash of coattails to those peers with presidential aspirations of their own, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Clinton, always good for a pithy remark, also has noted, \"you can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle.\" Vance has an additional, and unique, advantage. Most vice presidents who are champing to step into the top spot only get the chance after slogging through eight long years as a second banana, and must fight for the job just as the country has grown weary of the current administration and are longing for a new dynamic. Some, such as George H. W. Bush, can slide into office riding the departing fumes of their popular boss, while others, such as Al Gore, fumble to seal the deal. CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS UNCERTAIN ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS’ POTENTIAL RUN FOR GOVERNOR Vance will be able to run as a sitting vice president after serving just one term, still relevant, still modern, but with a souped-up resume and sleek gravitas.

The order instructs the FAA to end the overland supersonic ban and create noise-based certification standards, allowing faster-than-sound travel as long as no audible sonic boom reaches the ground. “The reality is that Americans should be able to fly from New York to LA in under four hours,” Michael Kratsios, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told reporters Friday. The move could help accelerate commercial supersonic flight development, including efforts by Boom Supersonic. In January, Boom’s XB-1 demonstrator became the firstprivately developedcivil aircraft to break the sound barrier over the continental U.S. Asked for comment Friday, Boom CEO Blake Scholl wrote “Booooom!” in an email to TechCrunch. Added Scholl, “The sound barrier was never physical — it was regulatory. With supersonic legalized, the return of supersonic passenger air travel is just a matter of time.” Trump also signed two other future-of-flight executive orders Friday: one to speed updrone commercialization and electric vertical takeoff vehicledevelopment, and another to establish a federal task force ondrone flight restrictions.

I’ve spent a decade coveringTeslaand CEOElon Musk, so it would be natural for me to weigh in here about the billionaire’s public fallout withPresident Donald Trump. Plenty of other reporters, armchair analysts, influencers, and bloggers have already done that. Some of it is smart, while some of it misses the mark — by miles.Since I have the benefit of institutional knowledge, and a helluva good memory, let me offer some brief reminders and predictions. We’ve been here before — Musk has a long, well-documented history of creating seemingly strong alliances and then burning it all down. As senior reporter Tim De Chant noted,Elon is getting an introduction to politics. The problem here is that Musk also embraces risk and gravitas — which means that learning something doesn’t equate to his behavior changing. Expect a roller-coaster ride of tentative peace followed by public outbursts. Rinse. Repeat. The implications of this fallout promise to be broad and will likely touch all of Musk’s various enterprises. I will be monitoring how Tesla EV sales numbers fare and how the “Big, Beautiful Bill” will actually affect the automaker’s business if it is passed into law. In the short term, I will be focused on Tesla’s great robotaxi experiment in Austin, Texas, and how Musk’s complicated and increasingly toxic relationship with the Trump administration affects his dealings with theDepartment of Transportation. Prior to his public breakup with Trump, Musk waslobbying lawmakerson legislation related to autonomous vehicles — specifically over a bill introduced on May 15 called theAutonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act. Ever sinceRivianspun outAlso, amicromobility startupthat also received backing from Eclipse Ventures, we’ve been poking around to find out more. A few little birds have been in touch and helped us better understand how the skunkworks program turned into a stand-alone company; they also revealed a surprising detail: Jony Ive’s creative firm LoveFrom worked alongside Rivian’s design team and the staff under the skunkworks program.

Memorandums of understanding rarely grab my attention. But this one did. Joby Aviationand Saudi Arabian conglomerateAbdul Latif Jameelsigned a memorandum of understanding to explore a distribution agreement forup to 200 electric aircraft. The tentative deal is notable because Abdul Latif Jameel is already an investor of Joby. If finalized, the partnership could provide Joby with a fast path to monetizing its electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles in Saudi Arabia. Turning an investor into a customer can complicate the relationship, too (just ask Amazon and Rivian.) Obvio, a California-based startup that is combining AI with cameras placed at stop signs to root out unsafe driving behavior,raised $22 millionin a Series A funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures.

Recent executive shuffling coupled with comments byUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahidon’t just hint at the company’s strategy. Nope, this is like a neon blinking sign and the word “autonomy” is at the center. Earlier this week, Uber announced it had appointedAndrew “Mac” Macdonaldas president and chief operating officer. The company also announced the departure of Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, who ran Uber’s delivery business. Gore-Coty’s responsibilities will slot under Macdonald, who has been with the company since 2012 and most recently led the mobility and business operations. Another tidbit worth mentioning: He launched Uber’s Toronto operations 13 years ago and spearheaded its autonomous strategy. Mac’s new role will combine mobility, delivery, and autonomy. At a Bloomberg conference,Khosrowshahiwas asked about AVs. He talked about building the AV ecosystem and Uber’s stakes in companies (Aurora and Waabi) developing autonomous vehicle technology.“We want to essentially support the AV ecosystem and continue to help that ecosystem develop and then AVs penetrate into the marketplace,” he said. “AVs, we think, represent a safer way of transportation. Ultimately, we think it’ll expand the marketplace as it makes kind of safe transportation cities available to everybody.” In other Uber news, the company hasadded a new type of account with a simpler UI for older people.

I reached out to Redwood to understand why. Redwood initially applied for a DOE loan in 2021. The process dragged on and at considerable cost to Redwood. Companies that go through this process are responsible for paying the third-party consultants and experts hired to vet the business and technology. By 2024, Redwood was still on the conditional approval limbo. While it was waiting, the company raised more than $2 billion in private funding and generated nearly $200 million in revenue last year.

Omada Health, a 14-year-old company providing virtual care for chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension between office visits, closed its first trading day on Friday at $23 a share, a 21% jump from the IPO price of $19. The IPO valued the company just above $1 billion (excluding employee options), a figure that’s nearly identical to Omada’s last private valuation of $1 billion set in its previous VC round. The debut is one of the first among recent IPOs that was not a so-called down-round. Many of the latest public listings, includingHinge,ServiceTitan, andReddit, priced below their private market highs, though have faired well as public companies. For founder and CEO Sean Duffy, the successful public offering validates his decision to start a company that he believed the market desperately needed. In 2011, he dropped out of Harvard Medical School after realizing that chronic illness patients required more continuous support than the existing healthcare system delivered. Before the offering, he owned 4.1% of the company, according to Omada’soffering document.  Other significant shareholders included Revelation Partners (10.9%), US Venture Partners (9.9%), Andreessen Horowitz (9.6%), and FMR (9.3%). Duffy told TechCrunch that over his 14-year journey as a founder, he had many harrowing moments. “I didn’t think our series A was going to come together because we were working on this commercial deal that didn’t materialize, and that spooked one investor,” he said. “As a young business, something tries to kill you every month,” he continued. “And then as the business grows, it turns into like every quarter or six months, year, two years.” One of the recent challenges for many digital health businesses is navigating the “collapse” of the market post-COVID boom. Omada steered through the turbulent times by seeking new, rising markets. It recently expanded its offerings to include diet management support for GLP-1 patients.

Or, it would be the year when the metaverse goes down as a “legendary misadventure.” These days, Boz appears to be leaning towards its potential for greatness. But, the market will be the final determinant. “We’ll judge at the end of the decade, but this does feel like the pivotal year,” Boz said Thursday during a Bloomberg Technology interview. Boz noted that Meta’s Ray Ban AI glasses had been a breakthrough that excited both consumers and competitors. As of February, Meta has soldmore than 2 million pairssince their October 2023 debut. Last fall, theyoutsold traditional Ray Bans, even before Meta rolled out AI features. Meanwhile, Google last month announced partnerships with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker tocreate smart glassesbased on Android XR. Apple is also reportedly making a push torelease smart glasses in 2026. “Suddenly, we go from toiling in the realms of obscurity to being very much in the world with a product that is very attractive to consumers, and thus competitors,” Boz said. “The clock has started on competition coming, and that just means that the progress we make in this year is of disproportionate value to any year before or after it closes.” Still, competition among other incumbents means nothing if the market doesn’t adopt Meta’s AR and VR products, which is what would drive the industry to standardize the technology. “The market is actually, especially when it comes to hardware, a trailing indicator,” Boz said. “So you look for early indicators. To some degree, you do have to have a level of confidence and taste in-house.” He said this was something he learned from Sheryl Sandberg, former chief operating officer at Meta. “Sheryl used to always talk about how most companies don’t fail because they got beaten by a competitor,” Boz said. “Most companies fail because they didn’t execute their own plan correctly. And so what I try to do with the team is really focus us, not so much on the competitive landscape as on [whether] we’re executing to our standards.” The Meta CTO said the company has “a set of ambitious plans for the year” that it is on track for. “What we’ll know by the end of the year is whether we executed on our plan or not,” said Boz. “What we’ll know in five years time is whether that was enough.” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Incumbents like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google are scaling their capabilities fast to swallow many of the offerings of smaller companies. At the same time, new startups are reaching the growth stage much faster than they historically have. But defining “growth stage” in AI startups is not so cut-and-dried today. Jill Chase, partner at CapitalG, said on stage atTechCrunch AI Sessionsthat she’s seeing more companies that are only a year old, yet have already reached tens of millions in annual recurring revenue and more than $1 billion in valuation. While those companies might be defined as mature due to their valuation and revenue generation, they often lack much of the necessary safety, hiring, and executive infrastructure. “On one hand, that’s really exciting. It represents this brand new trend of extremely fast growth, which is awesome,” Chase said. “On the other hand, it’s a little bit scary because I’m gonna pay at an $X billion valuation for this company that didn’t exist 12 months ago, and things are changing so quickly.” “Who knows who is in a garage somewhere, maybe in this audience somewhere, starting a company that in 12 months will be a lot better than this one I’m investing in that’s at $50 million ARR today,” Chase continued. “So it’s made growth investing a little confusing.” To cut through the noise, Chase said it’s important for investors to feel good about the category and the “ability of the founder to very quickly adapt and see around corners.” She noted that AI coding startup Cursor is a great example of a company that “jumped on the exact right use case of AI code generation that was available and possible given the technology at the time.” However, Cursor will need to work to maintain its edge. “There will be, by the end of this year, AI software engineers,” Chase said. “In that scenario, what Cursor has today is going to be a little less relevant. It is incumbent on the Cursor team to see that future and to think, okay, how do I start building my product so that when those models come out and are much more powerful, the product surface represents those and I can very quickly plug those in and switch into that state of code generation?” Topics Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk’s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Anthropic’s long-term benefit trust is a governance mechanism that Anthropic claims helps it promote safety over profit, and which has the power to elect some of the company’s board of directors. The trust’s other members include Centre for Effective Altruism CEO Zachary Robinson, Clinton Health Access Initiative CEO Neil Buddy Shah, and Evidence Action President Kanika Bahl. In a statement, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that Fontaine’s hiring will “[strengthen] the trust’s ability to guide Anthropic through complex decisions” about AI as it relates to security. “Richard’s expertise comes at a critical time as advanced AI capabilities increasingly intersect with national security considerations,” Amodei continued. “I’ve long believed that ensuring democratic nations maintain leadership in responsible AI development is essential for both global security and the common good.” Fontaine, who as a trustee won’t have a financial stake in Anthropic, previously served as a foreign policy adviser to the late Sen. John McCain and was an adjunct professor at Georgetown teaching security studies. For more than six years, he led the Center for A New American Security, a national security think tank based in Washington, D.C., as its president.

This is part of a citywide trend: AI firms are one of the few sectors expanding in San Francisco, accounting for 1.6 million square feet leased last year and now occupying 5 million total, per the real estate services firm CBRE. (Unsurprisingly, OpenAI accounts for asizable chunkof that overall figure.) If CBRE’s projections are to be believed, there’s much more to come. It thinks these scrappy startups could reach 21 million in square feet within five years, potentially halving the city’s current 35.8% vacancy rate and creating tens of thousands of jobs. “It could fundamentally change the vibrancy of downtown,” CBRE analyst Colin Yasukochi tells the outlet.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us An Italian parliamentary committee confirmed that the Italian government used spyware made by the Israeli company Paragon to hack several activists working to save immigrants at sea. The committee, however, said its investigation concluded that a prominent Italian journalist was not among the victims, leaving key questions about the spyware attacks unanswered. The Parliamentary Committee for the Security of the Republic, known as COPASIR,published a reporton Thursday that concluded a months-long inquiry into the use of Paragon’s spyware, known as Graphite, across Italy. Israeli newspaper Haaretzfirst wrote about the report. In January,WhatsApp began sending notifications to around 90 of its users, alerting them that they may have been targeted with Paragon’s spyware.Severalpeoplein Italycame forwardafter receiving the notifications, prompting a scandal in Italy, which has a long history of hostingspywarecompanies, as well as its government’sownspywareusesandabuses. Since then, COPASIR has investigated the allegations with the goal of clarifying exactly what happened. COPASIR specifically investigated the targeting ofLuca CasariniandGiuseppe Caccia, who both work forMediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian nonprofit with the mission of rescuing immigrants who try to cross the Mediterranean Sea. In both their cases, the committee concluded that they were lawfully targeted by Italian intelligence agencies as part of investigations related to the alleged facilitation of illegal immigration into the country. But the COPASIR committee concluded there was no evidence thatFrancesco Cancellato, a journalist who also received a notification from WhatsApp warning him he had been a target of Paragon’s spyware, had been targeted by Italy’s intelligence agencies. The committee wrote that its representatives were able to query the intelligence agencies’ spyware database and audit logs for Cancellato’s phone number, and did not find any relevant records. The committee said it also did not find evidence of any legal requests to spy on Cancellato from the country’s top prosecutor’s office, nor from the Department of Information for Security, orDIS, a top Italian government department that oversees the activities of the country’s two intelligence agencies, the AISE and AISI. The report noted that Paragon has foreign government customers that could potentially target Italians, leaving the door open that this may be how the targeting of Cancellato’s phone can be explained. COPASIR did not provide any evidence to support this theory. Contact UsDo you have more information about Paragon, and this spyware campaign? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, oremail.You also can contact TechCrunch viaSecureDrop. Cancellato is the director ofFanpage.it, an Italian news website that isknown for several investigations, including one onthe youth-wingof the far-right ruling party in Italy, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. That investigation revealed that, in private, the members made racist remarks and chanted fascist songs and slogans. The report made no mention of Ciro Pellegrino, a colleague of Cancellato, who received a notification from Apple at the end of April sayinghe had been targeted with government spyware. It’s unclear if Pellegrino was targeted with Paragon’s spyware, and the Apple notification did not say. The Italian government, as well as COPASIR, did not respond to a request for comment, specifically asking about Cancellato and Pellegrino. Cancellato responded to the reportin an article published on Friday, in which he questioned COPASIR’s conclusions on his case, and asked for more and better explanations. “Case closed? Not at all,” Cancellato wrote. For John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that investigates spyware abuses (including the recent cases of abuse in Italy), determining who was targeting Cancellato is the top question left unanswered by the report. “This report creates a problem for Paragon Solutions because the report leaves the most politically sensitive case unanswered: Who targeted this journalist? This outcome can’t make Paragon happy,” Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. “Because Francesco Cancellato’s case remains completely unexplained, all eyes are back on Paragon for an answer.” Scott-Railton also said that Citizen Lab is still investigating Cancellato’s case and analyzing his phone and data. Cancellato also confirmed this to TechCrunch. Paragon did not respond to a request for comment. COPASIR also investigated the cases ofMattia Ferrari, the chaplain on the rescue ship of Mediterranea Saving Humans; andDavid Yambio, the president and co-founder of the non-government organizationRefugees in Libya, which is active in Italy. COPASIR said it did not find evidence that Ferrari was targeted, but confirmed there was evidence Yambio had been a lawful target of surveillance, although not with Paragon’s spyware. As part of its investigation into the Italian government’s alleged use of spyware, COPASIR set out to find information about the use of Paragon in the country, requesting information from other government bodies, as well as from Citizen Lab, and WhatsApp’s owner Meta. According to the report, the national anti-mafia prosecutor told COPASIR that no prosecutor’s office in Italy had acquired nor used Paragon’s spyware. (In Italy, every local prosecutor’s office has some level of freedom in procuring spyware.) The Carabinieri military police, the national Polizia di Stato, and the financial crimes agency Guardia di Finanza gave the committee the same answer. Paragon told COPASIR that it had contracts with Italy’s two intelligence agencies,AISEandAISI. The report said that COPASIR representatives visited the DIS, as well as the two agencies’ offices, and examined the spyware’s database and audit logs to see how the agencies used Paragon’s spyware, including who they targeted. The representatives concluded that there were no abuses related to the surveillance of the people who came forward as spyware targets in the last few months. COPASIR’s report also revealed new details on how Paragon’s spyware system works behind the scenes. COPASIR said it verified that to use Paragon’s spyware, an operator has to log in with a username and password, and each deployment of the spyware leaves detailed logs, which are located on a server controlled by the customer and not accessible by Paragon. But, according to COPASIR, the customer cannot delete data from the audit logs on their servers. The committee also uncovered details about the relationship between Paragon and its Italian intelligence customers, AISE and AISI, which said they have since rescinded their contracts with Paragon. Italy’s foreign intelligence agency AISE, which started using Graphite on January 23, 2024 after signing a contract a month earlier, has been using Paragon’s spyware with the goal of investigating “illegal immigration, searching for fugitives, smuggling of fuels, counterintelligence, countering terrorism and organized crime, as well as for the internal security activities of the agency itself.” In doing so, the report said AISE targeted an “extremely limited” but unspecified number of phone users and accessed both real-time and stored communications sent over end-to-end encrypted apps. COPASIR said that AISI, Italy’s domestic intelligence agency, started using Graphite earlier in 2023 and its now-canceled contract would have expired on November 7, 2025. Like AISE, AISI used Graphite in a small but undisclosed number of cases related to acquiring real-time communications, while the cases are “a little more numerous” when it comes to exfiltrating chat messages stored on a target’s devices. For every spyware deployment, the agencies said it had the appropriate legal approval, according to the report. COPASIR said it had a chance to review Paragon’s contracts with its Italian customers and verify that there are clauses that forbid the use of the spyware against journalists and human rights activists.

According to new data from Sensor Tower, the app formerly known as Twitter skyrocketed up the U.S. App Store’s top charts, landing at the 23rd overall spot on June 5 — up from an average rank of No. 68 over the last 30 days. X also saw an average rank of No. 58 over the past six months. The ranking changes could be influenced by increased downloads and engagements with the X application. Meanwhile, X’s ranking on Google Play in the U.S. climbed as well, up around 20 spots from the prior seven-day average and up 16 spots from the average over the past 30 days. Sensor Tower estimates that total U.S. mobile app active users on X on June 5 increased by 6%, likely as a result of the Trump-Musk breakup, which captured the internet’s interest. Specifically, the firm found that U.S. mobile app active users on X between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time on June 5 were up by 54% compared to the last seven days. Trump’s own social network, Truth Social, benefited from the feud as well, as the president shared his thoughts about Musk with his followers. Compared with the last seven days, U.S. mobile app active users on Truth Social increased by more than 400%, Sensor Tower’s proprietary panel indicates. However, X is still much larger than Truth Social, Sensor Tower notes, as it has 100x more U.S. mobile app users than Trump’s social network. Across both apps, the number of U.S. mobile app active users between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern reached a 90-day high. X is continuing to grow its rank in the wake of the Trump-Musk breakup. As of the time of writing, the app is the 19th top free iPhone app on the U.S. App Store. Truth Social is No. 14 in the Social Networking category, but is ranked below No. 150 overall on the free iPhone apps chart on the U.S. App Store.

Figure has recently been the subject of a couplenews articlesthat questioned its progress with marquee customer BMW. Figure objected so strenuously to at least one of these reports thatAdcock publicly threatenedto sue the publication. When asked about the skepticism surrounding the BMW relationship and whether it is a pilot or has commercial value to the company, Adcock replied with an explanation of the technical benefit of having robots on a factory floor but didn’t provide specifics about the contractual relationship with BMW. “We get a lot of value, and it’s really important that we need to figure out how to run robots every day. We get to see how well they perform. We get to track all the metrics,” he said. Two months ago, Figure also publisheda YouTube videoshowing a couple of its robots working in a BMW factory. Adcock did, however, say that Figure AI has signed a contract with a second, unnamed customer for initial deployment, a customer that Bloomberg has reported to beUPS. Figure AI has drawn attention for making claims that its AI-powered robots possess human-like fine motor skills and can manipulate objects with precision. Despite releasing numerous videos of its robots at work, the company hasn’t done a live demonstration of the humanoids. The interviewer, Bloomberg’s Ed Ludlow, pointed out that while two other robotics companies, Agility Robotics and Boston Dynamics, showcased their robots at the conference, Figure AI did not. “It kind of goes back to our whole philosophy around we don’t go to a lot of events,” said Adcock. “I think it’s a giant waste of time. To be frank, I have to bring a team here to bring robots here. They could be at the office,” he said, adding that the company is showcasing the robots in videos. Adcock confirmed that Figure AI is expecting to manufacture and deploy roughly 100,000 units within four years. The skepticism about Figure’s commercial relationship comes amid the company’s attempts to raise a $1.5 billion round at a$39.5 billionvaluation, sources told Bloomberg, a fifteenfold increase from the$2.6 billionvaluation it achieved in February 2024. TechCrunch reported in April that Figure AI has been issuingcease-and-desist lettersto secondary market brokers, demanding they stop marketing its shares because they are not authorized to do so.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us LoveFrom, the creative firm founded by former Apple chief designer Jony Ive, played a role in the development of Rivian’s first electric bike, according to multiple sources who spoke to TechCrunch. For about 18 months, a handful of LoveFrom staff worked alongside Rivian’s design team and engineers within a skunkworks program led by Specialized’s former chief product and technology officer Chris Yu. LoveFrom’s work on the micromobility project ended in fall 2024, according to the sources. LoveFrom and Rivian declined to comment. Rivian’s skunkworks program, which eventually grew to a team of about 70 people hailing from Apple, Google, Specialized, Tesla, and REI Co-Op,spun out earlier this yearwith a new name and $105 million in funding from Eclipse Ventures. The micromobility startup, called Also, has yet to show off its first vehicle designs. In interviews with TechCrunch, Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe (who is on Also’s board) and Yu were cagey about what the new company’s first vehicle would look like. “There’s a seat, and there’s two wheels, there’s a screen, and there’s a few computers and a battery,” Scaringe said in March. He has also said it will be “bike-like,” a description confirmed by sources. But both Scaringe and Yu spoke of a much bigger vision for Also, one where it could theoretically tackle almost any imaginable micromobility form factor. The new company is supposed to reveal its first designs at an event later this year. An Also spokesperson declined to comment about its bike or any connection to LoveFrom. When the electric “bike” is revealed, it’s possible that Ive’s fingerprints will be all over it. Ive is best known for being the design force behind the iPhone and myriad other Apple products, and most recently, for hiswork with Sam Altman and OpenAI. But his collaboration with Rivian is not his first foray into the transportation industry. The parent company of Ferrariannouncedin 2021 that Ive’s firm would help develop the Italian supercar manufacturer’s next-generation vehicles. Ive was also involved with Apple’s secretive car project. He wasreportedly one of the main proponentsfor centering Apple’s long-running car project around autonomy, whereas other people inside the company pushed for a more traditional electric car. Apple abandoned that project early last year. Sources told TechCrunch that Ive’s LoveFrom has acted as a consultant for Rivian in the past, including on the company’s redesigned infotainment system and retail, among other areas, according to two former employees with knowledge of the relationship. But its involvement in what would become Also was a more structured and dedicated effort, another source familiar with the relationship said. The skunkworks program began taking shape in early 2022 with a directive to explore whether Rivian’s EV technology could be condensed down into something smaller and more affordable than its electric vans, trucks, and SUVs. Initially, the small team worked with Rivian designers to develop a product that could scale to different types of vehicles. A key design challenge was how to make the bike-like product modular while still maintaining the elevated aesthetics Rivian has become known for. By the time LoveFrom got involved in the project in early 2023, a lot of work had been completed, according to sources who said they helped refine the prototypes. The relationship was described as a “pretty tight” collaboration between the skunkworks team, LoveFrom’s staff, and the industrial designers based out of Rivian’s headquarters in Irvine. This group looked at everything, including the user interface and UX for the bike. The industrial design team at LoveFrom, which has a lot of experience with thoughtful and clever packaging, was particularly involved, according to one source, who noted the team brought an interdisciplinary and international perspective to the project.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Nucleus Genomics, a genetic testing startup founded by 25-year-old Kian Sadeghi,initially launched in 2021with the goal of calculating a patient’s risk for specific diseases. But it’s been courting controversy for years with products that claim to tell people how their genetics correlate to a host of complex issues, including their IQ. On Wednesday, it ratcheted up the controversy to an earsplitting level when it announced a new product called Nucleus Embryowith a tweetthat said: “Every parent wants to give their children more than they had. For the first time in human history, Nucleus adds a new tool to that commitment.” Every parent wants to give their children more than they had. For the first time in human history, Nucleus adds a new tool to that commitment.Welcome to Nucleus Embryo.https://t.co/jQd8SCVJaP Nucleus says it can test IVF embryos not just for well-known specific genes that have a high chance of illnesses like breast cancer, but also for appearance — sex, height, hair color, eye color — as well as IQ and complex health attributes like anxiety and ADHD. The launch video includes a screenshot of a comparison menu. The idea is to help parents choose which embryos to pick and which ones to, perhaps, discard. Genetic testing of embryos isn’t unheard of. IVF physicianscan test forgenes that can cause conditions like Down syndrome, or when parents know they are of high risk for a particular genetic disorder, like cystic fibrosis. But that’s not exactly what Nucleus is doing. It is using controversial “polygenic scores” to determine “complex genetic outcomes, like intelligence and anxiety,” a spokesperson says. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, polygenic scores only calculate the probabilities of a certain complex illness occurring, mainly within populations. “A polygenic risk score can only explain the relative risk for a disease,”the NHGR says. This is not the same as discovering a specific gene, such as the BRCA1 gene mutation, which gives a person a 60% to 80% “absolute risk of breast cancer,” the NHGR says. There’s a reason doctors don’t typically use such tests for individuals. “Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated,” according to the NHGR. Nucleus defends that its method can be used to determine an individual’s risk. The spokesperson pointed us toa 2018 paperwhere the authors said they had developed validated methods for five common diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. That paper was advocating screenings to help individuals make lifestyle or therapeutic decisions, similar to Nucleus’s initial concept. Wednesday’s tweet was promising parents that Nucleus can help them create designer babies. It has now been viewed more than 4 million times and has hundreds of comments, many of them either expressing disbelief that this works as promised, or horror at the idea. OneVC chimedinto the discussion saying, “I was going to type something like Noah get the boat but honestly the reality of this just makes me so nauseous.” I was going to type something like Noah get the boat but honestly the reality of this just makes me so nauseouspic.twitter.com/s16hOwJYuN Nucleus has experienced this kind of controversy before, asTechCrunch previously reported, when it announced its $14 million Series A earlier this year. The startup is backed by Founders Fund; Alexis Ohanian’s 776;and angels, includingAdrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), and Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep). Last year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which is supposed to tell users how much their genetics influence intelligence. The product was blastedas “bad science and big business”by some critics. Sadeghipublished a lengthy defenseof his company’s methodology. Even so, telling adults that they are genetically smart is one thing. Telling IVF parents that they can choose the appearance and other complex attributes for their children is,many would argue, something else. Nucleusis not currently conducting such tests via IVF lab partnersitself, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s partnering with Genomic Prediction, which works with IVF clinics. A Genomic executive told the WSJ that many parents request intelligence tests, and it doesn’t provide that. Parents can voluntarily upload genetic data information to Nucleus if they want to pursue it. Or, as Sadeghi said in the launch video aimed at would-be parents: “Not that long ago, IVF-1 sparked fear and the stigma of test tube babies,” he said. “What was once controversial is now an everyday practice. The same is true with genetic optimization. The technology is now here and it’s here to stay.” Topics Venture Editor From seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston. Be part of the conversation.

The dataset, called the Common Pile v0.1, took around two years to complete in collaboration with AI startups Poolside, Hugging Face, and others, along with several academic institutions. Weighing in at 8 terabytes in size, the Common Pile v0.1 was used to train two new AI models from EleutherAI, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, that EleutherAI claims perform on par with models developed using unlicensed, copyrighted data. AI companies, including OpenAI, are embroiled inlawsuitsover their AI training practices, which rely on scraping the web — including copyrighted material like books and research journals — to build model training datasets. While some AI companies have licensing arrangements in place with certain content providers, most maintain that the U.S. legal doctrine of fair use shields them from liability in cases where they trained on copyrighted work without permission. EleutherAI argues that these lawsuits have “drastically decreased” transparency from AI companies, which the organization says has harmed the broader AI research field by making it more difficult to understand how models work and what their flaws might be. “[Copyright] lawsuits have not meaningfully changed data sourcing practices in [model] training, but they have drastically decreased the transparency companies engage in,” Stella Biderman, EleutherAI’s executive director, wrote in ablog poston Hugging Face early Friday. “Researchers at some companies we have spoken to have also specifically cited lawsuits as the reason why they’ve been unable to release the research they’re doing in highly data-centric areas.” The Common Pile v0.1, which can be downloaded from Hugging Face’s AI dev platform and GitHub, was created in consultation with legal experts, and it draws on sources, including 300,000 public domain books digitized by the Library of Congress and the Internet Archive. EleutherAI also used Whisper, OpenAI’s open source speech-to-text model, to transcribe audio content. EleutherAI claims Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T are evidence that the Common Pile v0.1 was curated carefully enough to enable developers to build models competitive with proprietary alternatives. According to EleutherAI, the models, both of which are 7 billion parameters in size and were trained on only a fraction of the Common Pile v0.1, rival models like Meta’s first Llama AI model on benchmarks for coding, image understanding, and math. Parameters, sometimes referred to as weights, are the internal components of an AI model that guide its behavior and answers. “In general, we think that the common idea that unlicensed text drives performance is unjustified,” Biderman wrote in her post. “As the amount of accessible openly licensed and public domain data grows, we can expect the quality of models trained on openly licensed content to improve.” The Common Pile v0.1 appears to be in part an effort to right EleutherAI’s historical wrongs. Years ago, the company released The Pile, an open collection of training text that includes copyrighted material. AI companies have come under fire — and legal pressure — for using The Pile to train models. EleutherAI is committing to releasing open datasets more frequently going forward in collaboration with its research and infrastructure partners. Updated 9:48 a.m. Pacific:Bidermanclarifiedin a post on X that EleutherAI contributed to the release of the datasets and models, but that their development involved many partners, including the University of Toronto, which helped lead the research.

    "title": "Will Musk's explosive row with Trump help or harm his businesses?",
    "article_text": "When Elon Musk recently announced that he was stepping back from politics, investors hoped that would mean he would step up his involvement in the many tech firms he runs. His explosive row with President Donald Trump - and the very public airing of his dirty White House laundry - suggests Musk's changing priorities might not quite be the salve they had been hoping for. Instead of Musk retreating somewhat from the public eye and focusing on boosting the fortunes of Tesla and his other enterprises, he now finds himself being threatened with a boycott from one of his main customers - Trump's federal government. Tesla shares were sent into freefall on Thursday - falling 14% - as he sounded off about President Donald Trump on social media. They rebounded a little on Friday following some indications tempers were cooling. Even so, for the investors and analysts who, for months, had made clear they wanted Musk off his phone and back at work, the situation is far from ideal. Some though argue the problems for Musk's businesses run much deeper than this spat - and the controversial role in the Trump administration it has brought a spectacular end to. For veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher, that is especially so for Tesla. \"Tesla's finished,\" she told the BBC on the sidelines of the San Francisco Media Summit early this week. \"It was a great car company. They could compete in the autonomous taxi space but they're way behind.\" Tesla has long attempted to play catch-up against rival Waymo, owned by Google-parent Alphabet, whose driverless taxis have traversed the streets of San Francisco for years - and now operate in several more cities. This month, Musk is supposed to be overseeing Tesla's launch of a batch of autonomous robo-taxis in Austin, Texas. He posted to X last week that the electric vehicle maker had been testing the Model Y with no drivers on board. \"I believe 90% of the future value of Tesla is going to be autonomous and robotics,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told the BBC this week, adding that the Austin launch would be \"a watershed moment\". \"The first task at hand is ensuring the autonomous vision gets off to a phenomenal start,\" Ives added. But with Musk's attention divided, the project's odds of success would appear to have lengthened. And there's something else to factor in too: Musk's own motivation. The talk in Silicon Valley lately centres less on whether Musk can turn things around and more on whether he even cares. \"He's a really powerful person when he's focused on something,\" said Ross Gerber, President and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management. \"Before, it was about proving to the world that he would make EVs - the tech that nobody else could do. It was about proving he could make rockets. He had a lot to prove.\" A longtime Tesla investor, Gerber has soured on the stock, and has been pairing back his holdings since Musk's foray into right-wing politics. He called Thursday an \"extremely painful day.\" \"It's the dumbest thing you could possibly do to think that you have more power than the president of the United States,\" Gerber said, referring to Musk's social media tirade against Trump. The BBC reached out to X, Tesla, and SpaceX seeking comment from Mr Musk but did not receive a response. A particular problem for Musk is that, before he seemingly created an enemy in Donald Trump, he already had one in the grassroots social media campaign against his car-maker. Protests, dubbed #TeslaTakedown, have played out across the country every weekend since Trump took office. In April, Teslareported a 20% drop in car salesfor the first three months of the year. Profits plunged more than 70%, and the share price went down with it. \"He should not be deciding the fate of our democracy by disassembling our government piece by piece. It's not right,\" protestor Linda Koistinen told me at a demonstration outside a Berkeley, California Tesla dealership in February. Koistinen said she wanted to make a \"visible stand\" against Musk personally. \"Ultimately it's not about the tech or the Tesla corporation,\" said Joan Donovan, a prominent disinformation researcher who co-organized the #TeslaTakedown protests on social media. \"It's about the way in which the stock of Tesla has been able to be weaponized against the people and it has put Musk in such a position to have an incredible amount of power with no transparency,\" Donovan added. Another aspect of Musk's empire that has raised the ire of his detractors is X, the social media platform once known as Twitter. \"He bought Twitter so that he had clout and would be able to - at the drop of a hat - reach hundreds of millions of people,\" Donovan said. There is another possibility here though. Could Musk's high-profile falling out with Trump help rehabilitate him in the eyes of people who turned against him because of his previous closeness to the president? Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, thinks it could. \"We're a very forgiving country,\" Moorhead says in a telephone interview. \"These things take time,\" he acknowledges, but \"it's not unprecedented\". Swisher likened Musk's personal brand to that of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates more than two decades ago. She said Gates was once regarded as \"the Darth Vader of Silicon Valley\" because of his \"arrogant and rude\" personality. Today, despite his flaws, Gates has largely rehabilitated his image. \"He learned. He grew up. People can change,\" Swisher told me, even though Musk is \"clearly troubled.\" The problem for Musk is the future for him and his companies is not just about what he does - but what Trump decides too. And while Trump needed Musk in the past, not least to help fund his presidential race, it's not so clear he does now. Noah Smith, writer of the Noahpinion Substack, said Trump's highly lucrative foray into cryptocurrencies -as unseemly as it has been- may have freed him from depending on Musk to carry out his will. \"My guess is that this was so he could get out from under Elon,\" Smith said. In Trump's most menacing comment of the day, he suggested cutting Musk's government contracts, which have an estimated value of $38 billion. A significant chunk of that goes to Musk's rocket company SpaceX - seemingly threatening its future. However, despite the bluster, Trump's warning may be a little more hollow than it seems. That's because SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft ferries people and cargo to the International Space Station where three NASA astronauts are currently posted. It demonstrates that SpaceX has so entrenched itself in the US space and national security apparatus, that Trump's threat could be difficult to carry out. You could make a similar argument about Musk's internet satellite company, Starlink. Finding an alternative could be easier said than done. But, if there are limits on what Trump can do, the same is also true of Musk. In the middle of his row with Trump, he threatened to decommission the Dragon - but it wasn't long before he was rowing back. Responding to an X user's suggestion he that he \"cool down\" he wrote,\"Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.\" It's clear Musk and Trump's friendship is over. It's less certain their reliance on each other is. Whatever the future for Musk's businesses is then, it seems Trump - and his administration's actions - will continue to have a big say in them.

    "title": "Secret Glastonbury: The mystery of the festival's surprise stars",
    "article_text": "After the full Glastonbury timetable was published this week, one band's name was on everybody's lips. Except no-one knows who they actually are. Patchwork have a prime place on the festival's line-up - third from the top of the bill on the main Pyramid Stage on the Saturday night. The only thing is, there's no band called Patchwork. It's a fake name for a mystery guest - just as an unknown band called The ChurnUps were on the Pyramid bill in 2023, and turned out to be the Foo Fighters. Fans immediately went into overdrive to try to work out Patchwork's identity - part of the frenzied guessing game surrounding the festival's \"surprise\" sets. The main theories include: In conclusion: I don't know. \"Radioheadalso are in the mix of rumours because they've been teasing some tour action,\" suggests music journalist and broadcaster Georgie Rogers, who was a judge for Glastonbury's emerging talent competition this year and is DJing at the festival. \"Or couldElton Johnbe returning to do something with Brandi Carlile?\" Sir Elton headlined in 2023, and Carlile, his collaborator on his last album, is on the Pyramid Stage bill on the same day as Patchwork. The Patchwork slot is just one of several tantalising gaps in this year's schedule. Another mystery Pyramid performer is listed as \"TBA\" for Friday afternoon, while the smaller Park and Woodsies stages - which have hosted secret sets by big names in the past - each have an empty space on the line-up. \"They're quite prominent sets, and they do tend to put in massive artists,\" says Rogers. One group of fans think they know who will fill those gaps. \"Of the four main slots, I think we've got three of them, maybe four, nailed down,\" says Ad, one of the people behind theSecretglastosocial media account. \"I think it's definitely people who have got relationships with the festival who will be doing the big slots. An emotional return for one or two, I think. Some unfinished business.\" Ad doesn't say any more, but that could point toLewis Capaldi, whostruggled to finish his set in 2023before announcing a break from touring to get his \"mental and physical health in order\".He made a tentative comeback last month, and would be a popular choice. Lana Del Reyalso has unfinished business - her 2023 set was cut short after she breached the curfew. She's back on tour in the UK, with free days on the Friday and Sunday of Glastonbury weekend. Other stars who have been rumoured includeLady Gaga, who hasn't played Glastonbury since 2009. Asked earlier this year what it would take for her to return to the festival,she replied: \"Not much\". Gaga has already played Coachella and been on tour this year. Lordeisn't on the bill either, but told BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley this week she's \"pretty keen\" to be. \"The album's gonna be coming out right around that time,\" she said. \"I am quite tempted by what's going on because I've got lots of friends playing as well. We'll see if I can pull some strings and get there.\" The Secretglasto team have gathered and posted information about secret sets for more than a decade, and interest in their tips has gone \"a bit crazy\" in recent years. Ad - who doesn't want to give his full name - says they have built up a network of reliable sources. \"We've got loads of contacts at different stages and record labels and whatever else. And people trust us to be sensible with the information,\" he says. \"And the bands themselves don't want empty secret sets do they? So we have had occasions where they have come to us.\" The six people who work on the account aren't music industry insiders themselves. Another team member, JB, says they sometimes approach acts directly to seek confirmation. \"Now that we've been around for 10 years and have a decent bit of clout, we will contact some of the artists via their inboxes, and quite often they're happy to confirm. \"Sometimes they don't. Sometimes they block us. But generally we're able to piece all that together fairly quickly.\" He adds: \"By the time the gates open, there aren't many things we don't know.\" In the past couple of years, some acts have begun harnessing the buzz about secret sets for PR purposes for their album or tour, Ad believes. \"It used to just be friends of the festival, whereas now people are like, 'If we do the secret set we're going to get loads of hype and media attention'.\" Ad was among the lucky few to see Lady Gaga play an after-hours set in Club Dada following her main appearance as her career was taking off in 2009. \"She did three or four hits and then disappeared,\" he recalls. \"Because the phone signal was so bad, you couldn't ring or text your mate to let them know. So only the people who happened to be there got to experience it, which was a few hundred. \"I'm surprised she hasn't come back. Yet.\" That was one of the more exclusive secret sets in Glastonbury history. Others draw huge crowds when the word gets out - which it usually does. Rogers was in the right place when she a rumour swept the site that Radiohead would play in 2011. \"We were over that side of the festival anyway, so on a wing and a prayer, just in case it was true, we dashed over to the Park Stage in good time, and we got pretty close to the stage,\" she says. \"There are reports that it was the biggest crowd on the Park Stage for a secret set ever. I'd waited my whole life to see Radiohead live, and then suddenly here we are, and they did this amazing set. \"As my first ever time seeing them, and being in prime position, and it being a genuine surprise - it was just pure glee. I was just so happy, and I couldn't believe it.\" Secret sets have been a feature of the festival for decades. In 1992, the line-up poster wasn't topped by a star name but the promise of \"a special guest that we can't announce\". That turned out to be Welsh pop stallion Tom Jones. But Glastonbury's greatest ever secret set didn't happen at the festival at all. In 1995, indie gods The Stone Roses pulled out of headlining after guitarist John Squire broke his collarbone. But by the time organiser Michael Eavis threw his annual low-key autumn gig in the local village to thank residents for putting up with the main event, Squire was back in action. So the band played their first UK gig for five years in a marquee on a Somerset playing field to a couple of thousand lucky people. They still haven't appeared at the festival itself, however. Unfinished business? Tick. Emotional return? Tick! Could Patchwork in fact beThe Stone Rosesmaking a long-awaited and triumphant appearance? Who cares if the likelihood rating is-100/10. Add them to the list! Levi Heron, 29 from Stornoway added his own touch to The Glen by the Scottish band Beluga Lagoon. The singer's hit Ordinary notches up its 12th week at number one in the UK - the longest since 2017. A Queer Ceilidh planned for Friday night and an after party on Saturday are both still on. Lotus is the award-winning London rapper's first work since her split from producer Inflo. The vintage festival in Bournemouth will be ticketed for the first time in its 11-year history.",

    "title": "Far-right group Proud Boys sues US for $100m over Jan 6 prosecutions",
    "article_text": "Five leaders of far-right group the Proud Boys, who were convicted in connection to the 6 January, 2021 Capitol riot, have sued the US government for $100 million (£74m), claiming that their rights were violated during their prosecution. The five were convicted of plotting and taking part in the riot to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election. Trump pardoned or commuted their sentences earlier this year. The lawsuit, filed in Florida on Friday, claims FBI agents and prosecutors were motivated by personal biases when prosecuting their cases. They argue their constitutional rights were trampled on \"to punish and oppress political allies\" of Trump. The lawsuit was filed by Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Dominic Pezzola. Tarrio was found guilty of plotting the 2021 attack on the US Capitol, which happened as lawmakers were certifying former President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison, the longest out of the five. He was formally convicted of seditious conspiracy, a rarely used charge of planning to overthrow the government, and multiple other counts. The other four leaders faced similar charges, and were also sentenced to time behind bars. Their convictions were overturned by Trump, who issued approximately 1,500 pardons of people involved in the Capitol riot in January, on the day of his inauguration. \"These people have been destroyed,\" Trump said after signing their pardons. \"What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country.\" The lawsuit filed on Friday alleges the five leaders of the Proud Boys were subject to \"egregious and systemic abuse of the legal system\". It accuses prosecutors of engaging in instances of \"evidence tampering\" and \"witness intimidation\". It also alleges that their prosecution was \"corrupt and politically motivated.\" The lawsuit was filed against the Department of Justice, which is currently operating under the Trump administration and is run by Attorney General Pam Bondi. The BBC has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. According to figures released by the department in January, approximately 1,583 defendants have been charged with crimes associated with the Capitol riot. More than 600 were charged with assaulting, resisting or obstructing law enforcement, including around 175 charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Capitol Police officers were attacked by rioters with weapons including metal batons, wooden planks, flagpoles, fire extinguishers and pepper spray. Many lawmakers had condemned the riot, while Trump has described it as a \"day of love\". His pardons of those convicted have been criticised by Democratic lawmakers as an attempt to re-write history. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who was among the lawmakers forced to flee during the riot, called the pardons \"an outrageous insult to our justice system\". Five people are killed in a drone and missile attack on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, officials say. Salvadoran Kilmar Ábrego García, whose case became a political flashpoint, has been charged with human trafficking by US officials. The BBC’s Nomia Iqbal speaks to voters in Philadelphia, where the tech billionaire campaigned for the president and even gave away a few $1m cheques. Experts say his tech empire needs more of Musk's attention - but also the continued custom of the government.

    "title": "Hopes of closure fade as police wrap up Madeleine McCann search",
    "article_text": "From the moment I arrived in Praia da Luz on Monday the word on everyone's lips was \"closure\". All the long-term residents of the sleepy Atlantic resort told me closure was what they were hoping for. From the English woman who lived at the time above the apartment from which Madeleine McCann disappeared in 2007, to the former neighbour of the main suspect in the case. They all said: \"We hope her family get closure\". Of course, any chance of a really positive outcome disappeared years ago. Closure now would mean either finding Madeleine McCann's body, or finding her living with another family, unable to remember her parents or her younger twin siblings. But, frustrated as residents are when the world's media return to Praia da Luz - year after year at the same time that purple flowers appear on the jacaranda trees - they do understand the unbearable pain that Kate and Gerry McCann must feel. How that shock of realisation that Madeleine was not in her bed turned into minutes, then hours, and then days of panic. Then tortuous, unending months and years of uncertainty. For 13 years there was no single theory as to what happened to Madeleine McCann. Did she wake up in the middle of an opportunistic burglary and have to be silenced? Was she abducted on behalf of a couple desperate for a child of their own? Had her own parents covered up her accidental death? (A theory given sufficient weight by Portuguese prosecutors that for a while Kate and Gerry McCann were officially under suspicion.) The initial Portuguese investigation failed to preserve the scene adequately, so the opportunity to gather forensic evidence from Madeline McCann's room at the Ocean Club was lost. Long-term residents remember joining in uncoordinated and ad-hoc searches of the town. The Metropolitan Police investigation that began in 2011 built to a peak in 2014, with substantial searches near Praia da Luz - but they did not appear to have any identifiable suspects. They had 60 people of interest, 38 of whom they were investigating. Portuguese prosecutors had allowed them to search only one of three sites they had asked for access to. Everything changed in June 2020 when, out of the blue, the head prosecutor in Braunschweig in Germany, Hans Christian Wolters, saidhe had evidence that Madeleine McCann was dead. Working with the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), the German equivalent of the FBI, he said he had identified a suspect, later identified as Christian Brückner. \"The evidence is strong enough to say that the girl is dead, and to accuse a specific individual of murder,\" Hans Christian Wolter said. Brückner, who spent many years of his life in the Algarve, was a drifter, a petty criminal and a convicted sex offender. It all fitted neatly into place and it seemed that the mystery might finally be solved. Brückner's long list of previous convictions includes ones for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016. The Braunschweig prosecution team have never disclosed the extent of any evidence they have, but we do know their suspicions are partly based on a conversation an old acquaintance of Brückner's claims they had at a festival in 2008. Helge Busching says the topic of Madeleine McCann's disappearance came up, and Brückner said she \"didn't scream\". Mr Busching says it was clear to him what Brückner meant. Since 2019, Brückner has been in prison in Germany for raping a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz in 2005. But he is due for release in September, or in January if he does not pay an outstanding fine. Brückner told an RTL reporter earlier this year that he was looking forward to a \"decent steak and a beer\". The concern is that he will leave the country and head somewhere with no extradition treaty with Germany, though he appears to have no money. The Braunschweig prosecutors' confidence was dealt a severe blow last year when they put Brückner on trial for rape and unconnected attempted child abductions. Mr Busching gave evidence, but the court in Braunschweig acquitted Brückner and suddenly time was very short. Mr Wolters has made no secret of the fact that he wants more evidence to charge Brückner. That is why the BKA footed the bill forthe search this weekin ruined farm buildings on merciless, shadeless scrubland in the rising heat of an Algarve summer. The buildings are frequented at night by the kind of drifters and petty criminals that Brückner once was. Nearby residents told us they sometimes find looted suitcases among the ruins that have been stolen from holidaymakers. But this week's searches were not targeted on one specific building, so any intelligence they were based on was clearly quite vague. It all felt a bit like a last desperate attempt to back Mr Busching's statements with concrete, physical evidence. In some ways this search was similar to those I have seen on previous trips. The use of shovels in the heat, digging up stone-hard ground. But the German team were mostly targeting old farm buildings. This meant they needed a large, yellow mechanical digger to break up the concrete floors and sift through the resulting rubble. They also made extensive use of a ground-penetrating radar, slowly pushing the device across the buildings' floors, looking for anomalies and cavities underneath. The Portuguese fire brigade helped on the first day, pumping out an old well so it could be safely searched. The officers were looking for traces of Madeleine McCann, or some of her clothing. Every time I travel to Portugal for a new search it always begins optimistically. Could police find something this time? But on every occasion it quickly becomes apparent the searches are not tightly targeted. The police work always clearly based on quite vague intelligence - or just an investigator's hunch. Luis Neves, the National Director of the Polícia Judiciária, the Portuguese equivalent of the FBI, said at the end of the week that, \"nothing is in vain, not least because doors are being closed\". As we watched the German detectives packing away it felt like the spring of hope of a resolution that had bubbled up in June 2020 was evaporating in the thankless heat. When Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner in Portugal's Nations League semi-final against Germany, he completed a rare career first. Greg Monks was reported missing in Albufeira last week after travelling to the resort for a stag party. Searches have resumed in Portugal nearly two decades after the three-year-old went missing. Police are searching an area where prime suspect, Christian Brückner, stayed at the time of Madeleine's disappearance. Authorities say the new search will be across 21 plots and will continue until Friday.",

    "title": "Reform UK struggles to find friends to share council power",
    "article_text": "Reform UK's success in the recent local elections has propelled many councillors with limited or no political experience into council chambers across England. While Reform UK's rise was the big story of those elections, almost half of the councils up for grabs were not won outright by any single party. That means many of those newbie councillors are now navigating so-called hung councils, where parties with little in common often work together to get the business of local government done. But so far, it hasn't panned out that way for Reform UK, which isn't involved in any formal coalitions, pacts or deals in areas where there were local elections this year. This was despite rampant speculation about Reform-Conservative coalitions ahead of the polls, with party leaders Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage not ruling out council deals. So, what's going on? In some places - Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Leicestershire - Reform UK has enough councillors to form minority administrations and is attempting to govern alone. In other areas where coalitions were possible, Reform UK has either shunned co-operation or vice versa. Where Reform UK has explored potential partnerships locally, its policies have been viewed with suspicion by the established parties. In Cornwall, the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Conservatives refused to work with Reform UK, even though it was the biggest party and had won the most seats. Instead, the Lib Dems teamed up with independent councillors to run Cornwall Council as a minority administration. That infuriated Reform UK's group leader in Cornwall, Rob Parsonage, who branded the coalition deal \"undemocratic\" and \"a total stitch-up\". Did other parties contrive to exclude Reform UK? The newly minted Lib Dem council leader, Leigh Frost, does not think so. \"The reality is our core values at heart of it just stand for two very different things and it makes working together incompatible,\" Frost told the BBC. \"And then Reform was given two weeks to try to form an administration and chose not to.\" Frost said Reform UK's Cornwall candidates mainly campaigned on immigration. This was echoed in conversations with other local party leaders across the country. The BBC was told Reform's candidates had little local policy to offer and mostly focused on national issues, such as stopping small boats crossing the English Channel. Slashing \"wasteful spending\" by councils, like Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in the US, was also a common campaign theme. In Worcestershire, where Reform won the most seats but fell short of a majority, the party's supposed lack of local policy was a major sticking point for the Conservatives. \"They haven't got a local prospectus and that was part of the problem,\" said Adam Kent, Tory group leader on Worcestershire County Council. \"They didn't stand on any local issues. It was on national politics. How can you go into coalition with somebody if you don't even know what they stand for?\" Joanne Monk, the Reform UK council leader in the county, said she only had \"a brief couple of chats\" with other party leaders but was uncompromising on coalitions. \"I'm damned sure we're not on the same wavelength,\" she said. She followed the lead of Farage, who ruled out formal coalitions at council level but said \"in the interests of local people we'll do deals\", in comments ahead of the local elections. In Worcestershire, Reform UK's minority administration may need to do deals to pass key decisions and avoid other parties banding together to veto their plans. Recognising this, she acknowledged other parties were \"going to have to work with us at some point\". In Northumberland, the Conservatives retained their position as the largest party and gave the impression they were willing to entertain coalition talks with Reform UK, which gained 23 seats. \"I said I would work with anyone and my door is open,\" said Conservative council leader Glen Sanderson. \"But Reform the next day put out a press release saying the price for working with the Conservatives would be extremely high. So on that basis, I assumed that was the door closed on me.\" No talks were held and the Conservatives formed a minority administration. Weeks had passed after the local elections before Mark Peart was voted in as Reform UK's local group leader in the county. As a result, he wasn't in a position to talk to anybody. \"Everything had already been agreed,\" Peart said. \"It was too late.\" Reform UK sources admitted the party was caught a bit flat-footed here and elsewhere as many of its new councillors got the grips with their new jobs in the weeks following the local elections. A support network for those councillors, in the form of training sessions and a local branch system, is being developed by the party. But this week Zia Yusuf, one of the key architects behind that professionalisation drive and the Doge cost-cutting initiative,resigned as party chairman, leaving a gap in the party's leadership. Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, said the party's success at the local elections \"was partly because of the significant efforts and improvements to the infrastructure of the party\" spearheaded by Yusuf. Though Yusuf is gone, the party has considerably strengthened its foundations at local level, after gaining 677 new councillors and two mayors. A Reform UK source said party bosses will be keeping an eye out for stand-out councillors who could go on to become parliamentary candidates before the general election. They said in areas where Reform UK runs councils as a minority administration, it's going to take some compromise with other parties and independents to pass budgets and key policies. In the messy world of town halls and council chambers, that could be a tough apprenticeship. The party, which took control in May, says the review of spending will \"take as long as it takes\".

    "title": "How the Glazer family cost Manchester United £1.2bn",
    "article_text": "How the Glazer family cost Manchester United Â£1.2bn On 28 June 2005, the Glazer family completed their takeover of Manchester United Football Club. It loaded the club with debt, and over the next 20 years, BBC Verify has found about Â£1.2bn has been spent on debt interest, debt repayments, dividends and fees to the family. To fund the deal, the Glazers borrowed millions of pounds from hedge funds and left the club with debts of Â£604m. One year on, the club had already paid Â£53.2m in debt interest to its lenders and in fees to the Glazer family. June 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of the Florida-based Glazer familytaking full control of the Premier League club. It was a deeply controversial takeover from the beginning because of the financial implications for United. On 22 June 2005, the Glazer family paid Â£790m to buy out the club's exiting shareholders and to remove the club from the London stock market. But it was a deal mainly funded by borrowed money and loaded Â£604m in debts on to the club, which had previously had borrowings of only Â£50m. The club'sboard had warned,externalin April 2005 about the dangers of this amount of debt, saying it was not \"prudent\" and risked \"a downward spiral in both team and financial performance\". The takeover provoked protests from fans, which continue to this day. Calculations by BBC Verify - based on an analysis of the club's published accounts and stock market announcements - show that since the Glazer family's acquisition of the club in June 2005 it has paid out: Â£815m in debt interest repayments Â£166m in dividends to shareholders Â£10m in management and administration fees to Glazer family companies Â£197m in external net debt repayments This means that, in total, Â£1.187bn in cash left the club between 2005 and 2024 which it is reasonable to argue would not have done so in the absence of the Glazer takeover. It is a conservative estimate, too, because it does not include various fees to banks, financial advisers and other financing costs, including currency hedging. It also does not include the cash that has left the club in the form of directors' fees. Since the Glazers re-listed a portion of the club's shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, Â£125m has also been paid out in compensation to the club's directors. Given half of the directors were Glazer family members, it's likely half of this sum - about Â£63m - went to them. BBC Verify asked the club to comment on the findings and they said they would leave the accounts to speak for themselves. The Glazer family can legitimately point to the fact they have significantly grown the value of the club over the past two decades. Under the Glazers' two decades of full ownership, United's annual commercial revenues have risen more than fivefold - from Â£55m in 2006 to Â£303m in 2024. This is reflected in the implied market value of the club. The Glazers acquired United for Â£790m. The stock market implied value of the club in May 2025 was more than Â£3.2bn. And the financial terms of the sale of a stake in the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024 implies an overall valuation of Â£4.3bn. The family can also point to the fact that, under their ownership, the club has spent more than Â£2bn on signing new players since 2012. This compares well withexpenditure by most of the club's rivals,externalover that period. On the pitch, United have won 15 major trophies under the Glazers, but only five have those have come since the retirement of legendary former manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. Last season they finished 15th in the Premier League - the lowest they have ended a campaign since a year in the second tier in 1974-75. This was acknowledged in the club's quarterly accounts, released on Friday. Chief executive officer Omar Berrada said it had been \"a difficult season in the Premier League, which we all know fell below our standards and we have a clear expectation of improvement next season\". The Glazers mainly used borrowed money to buy the club in 2005, but the accounts show they also put in Â£273m of their own cash. However, they have invested no money of their own since. The investments in the squad have come from the club's own internally generated cash resources and from debt secured on the club directly and on the ownership shares in the club. The family have also realised considerable value from their investment. Between 2012 and 2022 the Glazer family sold Â£555m in shares in the club, including the proceeds of a Â£150m 2012 listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Of the sale proceeds, Â£484m went to them directly, though Â£71m went to partially pay down the debt they took out to buy the club. In 2005, Manchester United PLC's total gross debt was just Â£50m. The Glazers' leveraged buyout increased the gross debt listed in the accounts to Â£604m in 2006 - this was partially secured on the club's assets directly, and partially secured on the Glazer family's ownership shares. There has been been some major refinancing of the debt over the two decades, including in 2010 and 2015. But in 2024, the club's gross debt still stood at Â£547m. Other measures of debt which factor in the future cost of transfers put this figure at almost Â£1bn. Average annual interest costs since 2005 have been Â£42m with costs of Â£37.2m in the most recent financial year of 2023-24. In 2024, the Glazer family sold Â£732m in shares to Ratcliffe, leaving him with roughly a 30% ownership stake and control of the football operations. As part of the deal, Ratcliffe injected a further Â£236m of his own funds directly into the club for investment into the infrastructure of their Old Trafford stadium. This additional investment was not funded by additional debt. Ratcliffetold the BBCin March 2025 the club had been set to run out of money by the end of this year, forcing him to drastically cut costs.",

    "title": "On board the driverless lorries hoping to transform China's transport industry",
    "article_text": "They rumble down the highway between Beijing and Tianjin port: big lorries, loaded up and fully able to navigate themselves. Sure, there is a safety driver in the seat, as per government regulations, but these lorries don't require them, and many analysts say it won't take long before they are gone. When \"safety driver\" Huo Kangtian, 32, first takes his hands off the wheel, and lets the lorry drive itself, it is somehow impressive and disconcerting in equal measures. For the initial stages of the journey, he is in full control. Then - at a certain point - he hits a few buttons, and the powerful, heavy machine is driving itself, moving at speed along a public road to Tianjin. \"Of course, I felt a bit scared the first time I drove an autonomous truck,\" says Mr Huo. \"But, after spending a lot of time observing and testing these machines, I think they are actually pretty good and safe.\" As the lorry veers off the freeway and up a ramp towards the toll gates, the machine is still driving itself. On the other side of the tollgate, Mr Huo again presses a few buttons, and he is back in charge. \"My job as a safety driver is to act as the last line of defence. For example, in the case of an emergency, I would have to take back control of the vehicle immediately to ensure everyone's safety,\"  he explains. In terms of the upsides for a driver, he says that switching to autonomous mode can help combat stress and fatigue, as well as freeing up hands and feet for other tasks. He says it doesn't make his job boring, but rather more interesting. When asked if he is worried that this technology may one day render his job obsolete, he says he doesn't know too much about this. It's the diplomatic answer. Pony AI's fleet of driverless lorries, currently operating on these test routes, is only the start of what is to come, the company's vice-president Li Hengyu tells the BBC. \"In the future, with driverless operations, our transportation efficiency will definitely be greatly improved,\" he says. \"For example, labour costs will be reduced but, more importantly, we can deal better with harsh environments and long hours driving.\" What this all boils down to is saving money, says industry expert Yang Ruigang, a technology professor from Shanghai Jiaotong University, who has extensive experience working on driverless technology in both China and the US. \"Anything that can reduce operating costs is something a company would like to have, so it's fairly easy to justify the investment in having a fully autonomous, driverless truck,\" he tells the BBC. In short, he says, the goal is simple: \"Reduce the driver cost close to zero.\" However, significant hurdles remain before lorries will be allowed to drive themselves on roads around the world - not the least of which is public concern. In China, self-driving technology suffered a major setback following an accident which killed three university students after their vehicle had been in \"auto pilot\" mode. Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Chim Lee says the Chinese public still has quite a way to go before it is won over. \"We know that recent accidents involving passenger cars have caused a huge uproar in China. So, for driverless trucks – even though they tend to be more specific to certain locations for the time being – the public's image of them is going to be absolutely critical for policy makers, and for the market as well, compared to passenger vehicles.\" Professor Yang agrees that lorry drivers are unlikely to lose their jobs in large numbers just yet. \"We have to discuss the context. Open environment? Probably not. High speed? Definitely no. But, if it is a low-speed situation, like with the last mile delivery trucks, it's here already.\" In Eastern China's Anhui Province, hundreds of driverless delivery vans navigate their way through the suburban streets of Hefei - a city with an official population of eight million - as human-driven scooters and cars whizz around them. It was once one of country's poorest cities, but these days its government wants it to be known as a place of the future, prepared to give new technology a chance. Gary Huang, president of autonomous vehicle company, Rino.ai, says they discovered a market niche where driverless delivery vans could send parcels from big distribution hubs run by courier companies to local neighbourhood stations. At that point, scooter drivers take over, dropping off the packages to people's front doors. \"We're allowing couriers to stay within community areas to do pickup and drop off while the autonomous vans handle the repetitive, longer-distance trips. This boosts the entire system's efficiency,\" he tells us. Rino has also been talking to other countries, and the company says the quickest uptake of its vehicles will be in Australia later this year, when a supermarket chain will start using their driverless delivery vehicles. Meanwhile, in China, they say they're now running more than 500 vans with road access in over 50 cities. However, Hefei remains the most advanced. Apart from Rino, the city has also now given permission for other driverless delivery van companies to operate. Gary Huang says this is due to a combination of factors. \"Encouragement came from the government, followed by local experimentation, the gaining of experience, the refinement of regulations and eventually allowing a broad implementation.\" And you can see them on the roads, changing lanes, indicating before they turn, pulling up at red lights and avoiding other traffic. For the courier companies, the numbers tell the story. According to Rino's regional director for Anhui Province, Zhang Qichen, deliveries are not only faster, but companies can hire three autonomous electric delivery vans which will run for days without needing a charge for the same cost as one driver. She says she has been blown away by the pace of change in her industry and adds that she would not be surprised if heavy, long-haul lorries are routinely driving themselves on roads in certain circumstances within five years. Professor Yang agrees. \"Heavy trucks running along a highway unrestricted, at least five years away.\" When asked if it could really happen so soon, he responds: \"I'm pretty sure it will happen. In fact, I'm confident that it will happen.\" Industry insiders say that the most immediate applications for driverless lorries – apart from in enclosed industrial zones likes open-cut mines or ports – are probably in remote, harsh terrain with extreme environmental conditions, especially along vast stretches and in a largely straight trajectory. Significant technical challenges do remain though. Heavy lorries need better cameras to track well ahead into distance to detect hazards much further down the road, in the same way a person can; more tricky roads may also need to have extra sensors placed along the route; other hurdles could include breakdowns in extreme weather or sudden, unexpected dangers emerging amidst very busy traffic. On top of all this, the technology – when it comes to heavy lorries – is still not cheap. What's more, these vehicles are right now modified old style lorries rather than self-driving vehicles straight off the production line. China wants to be a champion of new tech, but it also has to be careful, not only because of the potential for deadly accidents but also because of how Chinese people might view this shift. \"This is not just about fulfilling regulations. It is not just about building a public image,\" says Chim Lee. \"But that, over time, the public will see the benefit of this technology, see how it will reduce their costs for buying things, or look at it as a way of imagining that society is improving, rather than viewing this as technology which is potentially destroying, causing car accidents or removing employment opportunities.\" Professor Yang sees another problem. \"We humans can tolerate another human driver making mistakes but our tolerance for autonomous trucks is much much lower. Machines are not supposed to make mistakes. So, we have to make sure that the system is extremely reliable.\" At the coroner's court in County Clare, a French tourist describes seeing the 12-year-old boy from China fall over the edge. The leaders of the US and China agree to further talks aimed at reaching a deal amid an ongoing trade war. Oxford Brookes student Sunjaya Phillips says she uses the technology to help create ideas.

    "title": "'Our son is one of 16 kids with this condition. He might not live to Christmas'",
    "article_text": "Jack is one of only 16 children in the world with a life-limiting genetic condition that is so rare it doesn't have a name. The 11-month-old has a mutation of the PPFIBP1 gene which means he is blind, has frequent seizures and is unlikely to ever walk or talk. His mum and dad want to track down the parents of the other children with his condition to better understand their son's diagnosis and offer support. \"It is very limited with what they can tell us,\" said his mum Amanda Thomas from St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. \"But what they have said is it is life-limiting and it is likely that he will pass away at some point during childhood but they don't know when that will be.\" To date Amanda has spoken to one other parent, a woman from Georgia in the US, whose daughter had the condition and died at the age of two. \"She felt so blessed to have her little girl in her life, even for a short time and you could just see how much love was there,\" said Amanda. She said being able to ask one another questions was helpful for both of them and she was left overwhelmed by the experience. For the first few weeks of his life, Amanda and Nick's fourth child Jack appeared completely healthy. He was nine weeks old when they first spotted something that caused concern. \"His right eye had dropped to the outside and it had fixed but his head had stuck to the side as well,\" explained Amanda. \"Nick took one look at him and said 'I think he needs to go into A&E'.\" Initially doctors were not overly concerned and the family returned home. Just hours later the same thing happened again only this time Jack was also lethargic and his breathing had become shallow so he was taken to hospital by ambulance. Shortly after arriving he had his first seizure. \"He stopped breathing, I shouted for help and an entire crash team came in,\" said Amanda. \"They resuscitated him and then on the way to taking him to resus they had to stop in the corridor and resuscitate him again.\" Jack was put on a ventilator and moved into intensive care. Doctors were at a loss as to what was wrong with him. Following a number of tests that led nowhere the family underwent genetic testing. The results showed Jack has a mutated PPFIBP1 gene. \"They explained that every gene has two copies and with this particular gene I carry one mutated copy and Nick carries another mutated copy,\" said Amanda. \"It's meant that both of Jack's copies of this gene have got a variation to it which has caused this neurodevelopmental disorder which doesn't have a name because it is so rare.\" With so few known cases it is hard for doctors to predict Jack's life expectancy. \"They've said it could be when he's one, it could be when he's five, it could be 10 years but knowing that we're going to outlive our child and knowing that his brothers and his sister may one day have to say goodbye to him is heart-breaking,\" said Amanda. Amanda and Nick were told their other children - aged 10, eight and 4 - also had a 25% chance of having the mutated gene but tests showed this was not the case. When Jack first became unwell last September the family were in the middle of fully renovating their house. Everything came to a standstill so the family home is a partial building site. Amanda has left her job in social services to take care of Jack full-time and Nick has been able to continue working but is still recovering from a stroke in July 2023 and heart surgery that followed in May last year. They are trying to crowdfund the renovation as well as equipment for Jack. \"Life is testing,\" admitted Nick. \"Amanda and I have to be realistic this could be his last Christmas, this could be his last birthday so really we're just trying to get this as comfortable as possible so Jack enjoys the time he does have with us. He said he and Amanda found strength in one another. Alongside all of this Amanda is continuing her search for other parents of children with Jack's condition. \"When we had our diagnosis we had nobody to turn to because there was nobody who had the same condition so there's no support groups available, there's nothing,\" said Amanda. \"If somebody in the future gets this diagnosis then perhaps they can find me, and I can offer a bit of support that I didn't have in the beginning because there were so many questions, so many what ifs, where, how, which were all just being met with 'we don't know'.\" Over the past eight months Jack has been taken to hospital by air ambulance three times and the family have spent about 60 nights in hospital. With the future so uncertain the family are making the most of every moment. \"I just used to stress about the things that didn't matter, my house not being tidy, the washing piling up, now I'm learning that's not important anymore,\" said Amanda. \"We really do have limited time with Jack so it's about having those moments and making the most of it.\" Matthew's father died late last year - before learning the truth about his family history.

    "article_text": "A yellow warning for thunderstorms has been issued by the Met Office for large parts of England and Wales. The warning, which covers the majority of southern England, parts of the Midlands and most of south Wales, comes into effect from 09:00 BST on Saturday and lasts until 18:00. Around 10-15mm of rain could fall in less than an hour while some places could see 30-40mm of rain over several hours from successive showers and storms, the Met Office says. The UK's weather agency also warned that frequent lightning, hail and strong, gusty winds would be additional hazards. After arecord-breaking spring, the weather has been distinctly unsettled since the start of June with wetter, windier and cooler temperatures than what is typical for the start of meteorological summer. On average, England experienced just 32.8mm of rain last month in what was its driest spring in more than 100 years. Now, it appears, there could be more rainfall on Saturday than there was in the whole of May in some places. It can be hard to predict where thunderstorms will turn up because they are small-scale weather features. Not everywhere will get a torrential downpour or a thunderstorm - most parts will see a shower but some may stay dry and avoid the rain completely. The weather agency has warned thatin places that do experience heavy showers there is the potential for disruptionto transport, with driving conditions affected by spray and standing water, leading to longer journey times. Train services could also be delayed. It also said that some short-term loss of power and other services was likely, and potential lightning strikes could cause damage to buildings. While the storms are expected to occur for much of the day, they will ease off in the west from mid-afternoon. A yellow weather warning is the lowest level of warning issued by the Met Office. Warnings are issued on the probability of severe weather occurring as well as the impact it could have. There will be showers in other parts of the UK on Saturday, but not as heavy as in the south. A yellow thunderstorm warning is in place for parts of England, including the south and south east. A yellow warning has been issued for thunderstorms and floods, despite the UK experiencing its driest spring for nearly 70 years. The Met Office has issued the warning for Monday between 12:00 BST and 22:00. After a week of good weather, Paris was hit by a hailstorm and thunder on Saturday afternoon. At least 10 million people remained under winter weather advisories and warnings as of Thursday morning.",

    "title": "Bargain Hunt expert jailed for selling art to suspected Hezbollah financier",
    "article_text": "A former Bargain Hunt art expert has been jailed for two years and six monthsfor failing to declare art he sold to a suspected financier of Hezbollah. In the first prosecution of its kind, Oghenochuko Ojiri, 53, admitted eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000 of failing to make a disclosure during the course of businessbefore his sentencing at the Old Bailey on Friday. Hezbollah is a group proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK. Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said Ojiri had been aware the art he had sold was to Nazem Ahmad, who had been sanctioned in 2019 by the US authorities. \"These offences are so severe that only a custodial sentence can be justified,\" she said. \"Your hard work, talent and charisma has brought you a great deal of success... you knew you should not have been dealing with that man.\" Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubbadded there was no evidence Ojiri supported any form of extremism but that his conduct undermined the detection of terrorist financing. Gavin Irwin, representing Ojiri, said the art expert's \"humiliation is complete\" with the star losing \"his good name\" and the \"work he loves.\" \"He'd like to apologise for undermining trust\" in the art market, Mr Irwin said, adding Ojiri had been naïve. Ojiri's motivation appeared \"to be financial along with a broader desire to boost his gallery's reputation within the art market by dealing with such a well-known collector,\" said Bethan David, head of the CPS Counter Terrorism Division. \"This prosecution is believed to be the first of its kind, and the CPS will not hesitate to bring criminal charges against individuals who flout the law in this way.\" So how did an art expert, famous for appearing on UK daytime television get mixed up in funding Hezbollah? The Old Bailey heard UK law enforcement had been alerted to suspicious transactions linked to Mr Ahmad by their counterparts in the US. Mr Ahmad was sanctioned in 2019 by US authorities because he is believed to be a top donor to Lebanon-based Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group, which is backed by Iran and banned as a terrorist organisation by the US and UK. Hezbollah used Mr Ahmad, who has joint Lebanese-Belgian nationality, \"to launder substantial amounts of money bound for the terrorist group\", according to the US Treasury department. It claims he has longstanding ties with the illegal trade in \"blood diamonds.\" US authorities are offering a $10m reward for information about Mr Ahmad, who is thought to still be in Lebanon. Transactions uncovered by UK police showed he paid nearly £140,000 for works, which he had shipped from London to Dubai and Beirut. He bought them from Ojiri, including a £20,000 painting by Icelandic artist Baldur Helgason. Ojiri founded Ramp Gallery, now known as the Ojiri Gallery, based in east London. He came to public prominence with appearances in the BBC series Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, before hitting the big time on Bargain Hunt, in 2019. He has also appeared on Channel 5's Storage: Flog the Lot! In 2021, he joined Antiques Road Trip. By this time, he had made several secret sales of art to the suspected Hezbollah financier. Although he was careful to keep Mr Ahmad's name off the paperwork, officers in the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit tracked the money to Ojiri and, in April 2023, police arrested him. On the same day the Treasury sanctioned Mr Ahmad and banned him from travelling to the UK. The US authorities also charged Mr Ahmad with defrauding the US and foreign governments, money laundering and sanctions evasion, claiming companies connected to him had been engaged in more than $400m worth of financial transactions between 2020 and 2022. As part of the American case, the Met police arrested a man living in Hayes, west London, for extradition to the US. Sundar Nagarajan is now awaiting trial in New York, accused of acting as Mr Ahmad's accountant and advisor. At first, Ochuko Ojiri refused to answer police questions, but in a prepared statement he said he had no reason to believe Mr Ahmad was a terrorist and money launderer. But evidence seized from his phone showed he had researched who Mr Ahmad was and knew he had been sanctioned by the US. A colleague had even messaged to warn him against doing business with Mr Ahmad. At today's sentencing hearing Lyndon Harris, for the prosecution, said \"analysis of Ojiri's phone revealed Mr Ahmad was in his contacts as 'Moss Collector', a name deliberately chosen to disguise the art collector as one of his contacts.\" The Old Bailey heard how Mr Ahmad had sent Ojiri messages on email and Instagram. \"The defendant engaged in sales discussions and sales with Nazem Ahmad and his associates\" over a 14-month period. He explained how Ojiri's  arrest came after people working in the art market were brought into the regulated sector in 2020, meaning they were bound by anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures to report suspicious transactions or face prosecution. The TV star was charged under a section of the Terrorism Act 2000 that has never been used before. Police hope it will send a clear message to those doing business in the art world. \"You will need to make sure you are doing your due diligence,\" says Cdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command Last year, the National Crime Agency issued an amber alert warning that storage facilities for artwork could be used by criminals \"seeking a capital asset that can be safely stored, that appreciates in value over time, and that can be liquidated if and when required\". It followed the seizure of 23 paintings, worth almost £1m, from a warehouse and an auction house in London. The art, which included work by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, belonged to Mr Ahmad. It will soon be sold off at auction as the proceeds of crime and the money raised will go to the Home Office to be used in the fight against crime. Ahead the sentencing on Friday, the BBC Press Office said: \"Oghenochuko Ojiri is not a member of staff but a freelance presenter. He is not currently working with the BBC and has not worked on BBC programmes since 2023.\"",

In what his team describes as a \"landmark speech\" in Monaco on Sunday - World Oceans Day - he will address environmentalists and, crucially, investors, to urge them to work together to protect our oceans Prince William will attend the Blue Economy and Finance Forum as founder of the Earthshot environmental prize which looks for solutions to the world's climate challenges. The forum is the curtain-raiser to the UN Oceans Conference in Nice next week. \"The Prince of Wales feels passionately about action being taken to protect and restore our oceans,\" a Kensington Palace spokesperson told the BBC. \"Tomorrow, he's going to be calling for swift, immediate global action. The time is now.\" Rising temperatures, pollution and overfishing are causing huge damage to the world's oceans and the communities that rely on them. Events this weekend will look at the role oceans play in global trade, food security and sustainable energy. The meeting will be held at the Grimaldi Forum, an eye-catching steel and glass venue, named after Monaco's own royal family. Prince Albert II of Monaco is a supporter of many oceans projects and is a key player at the forum. \"This event will be more than a forum. It will provide an unique opportunity to bring together decision makers, finance professionals, philanthropists, NGOs and players from the private sector to turn ambition into action,\" he says. Last month,Sir David Attenborough's new film, Oceans, was released in cinemas. It gave his lifelong perspective on the value of oceans. \"After living for nearly 100 years on this planet,\" he says \"I now understand that the most important place on earth is not on land but at sea and today we are living in the greatest age of ocean discovery.\" The film places the oceans as being at a crossroads, needing more action to help them continue as the \"planet's support system\". Prince William shares that view. He has made hisadmiration for Sir David, who was an inspiration for the creation ofthe Earthshot Prize, clear. Sir David's storytelling around the environment is a powerful asset in getting public attention and buy in – something the prince is acutely aware of. The visit to France is an insight into how Prince William sees his role in the environmental space and part of his development as a global statesman. Also attending the forum in Monaco will be France's President Emmanuel Macron and President Rodrigo Roblez of Costa Rica. Why Monaco? Because, over the coming days, gathered in this wealthy, tax haven, amid the super yachts and holidaying multi-millionaires, is some serious cash and investors willing to spend it on protecting marine life and the oceans they live in. The prince's speech and meetings will largely be in public on Sunday. But he will also hold a closed, private session with experts and the investor community. It's a pragmatic approach to using his royal soft power to draw in people who have the resources to help generate change. Throughout his life, the King has used his platform to bring the conversation about the environment into the mainstream. His son is now building on that, in his own way, to try to show that environmental solutions are worth the investment. And the oceans can be a difficult sell. The sheer scale of the work that needs to be done can make it less attractive to investors. \"I have a job that should not exist\" is how Sam Teicher, the co-founder and chief reef officer of CoralVita often begins his pitches. His business was the first winner of the million-pound Earthshot prize in 2021 for solutions to repair and protect oceans. CoralVita grows corals to restore dying reefs. Of this year's Earthshot nominations, only 9% have entered the \"Revive Our Oceans\" category. \"We are land creatures, it is out of sight and out of mind for a lot of people,\" says Sam Teicher. He will be in Monaco this weekend and describes his approach to raising money for his business as \"trying to harness capitalism for good\", stressing that \"you need to be genuine and maintain integrity, you don't want to blue wash or green wash\". And that strategy is working. The BBC has learnt that CoralVita has just won funding of about £6m ($8.1m) with investors led by Builders Vision – a philanthropic organisation created by Lukas Walton, whose grandparents founded the Walmart chain in the United States. It is one of the biggest funding offers for oceans work and will mean CoralVita can scale up and accelerate its restoration projects to help preserve the ocean's biodiversity. The investment power of Builders Vision will now also support the Earthshot Prize in a newly announced partnership. It again highlights the impact Prince William can have in linking up environmental solutions with investors. The Prince William factor has been a huge benefit to CoralVita as it works to scale up its business. \"He helps getting in front of people who would normally not think it was investible or that it mattered,\" says Mr Teicher. \"We need to expand out to bankers, government leaders, tech specialists. He gets more people around the table.\" And ultimately this is an event where money matters. For Mr Teicher the target is always the right type of investor. \"We aren't looking for people wanting a traditional five to seven year return,\" he says. \"This is a long-haul problem. We need people in it for the long haul.\" The actor and activist was speaking to the BBC at a summit organised by his Climate Initiative. The Mobuoy site, near Londonderry, is considered to be one of the biggest illegal dumps in Europe. Royal visitors meet people visiting the three-day event and sample some food and drink. The UK's driest spring in 50 years is causing issues for some farmers. The King makes his first visit to the home of the Royal Artillery since becoming Captain General.",

    "title": "Fraud culture was 'pervasive' at union, auditors say",
    "article_text": "There was a \"pervasive fraud environment\" at one of the UK's largest trade unions Unite, an auditors' report obtained by the BBC has concluded. In a highly critical 35-page document, auditors BDO said in the 2021 financial year \"dominant personalities and a weak control environment facilitated opportunities to commit fraud\" at the union. The BDO report says there were \"unusual relationships\" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers, as well as a culture that \"did not challenge\" financial transactions and \"failed to ensure\" appropriate financial reporting. This relates, in part, to the union spending £112m on building a hotel and conference centre in Birmingham. The property has since been valued at a fraction of that sum and the auditors said today that Unite had taken a financial hit of £53.8m on the project. Unite, which at one time was the Labour Party's biggest donor, has more than a million members. The probe was ordered by General Secretary Sharon Graham shortly after she was elected in 2021. It was presented to the union's ruling executive council by the auditors on Friday. Ms Graham said: \"On behalf of Unite's 1.2 million plus members, I promised on my election that I would uncover the truth about historic alleged corruption related to the Birmingham hotel project. \"This process has quite frankly been an ugly one, where I have endured attacks and smears from those with much to lose, but they have not deterred me. \"The re-audit is in its final stages and as we move to completion, I will ensure steps are taken so that this can never happen again and we have already started the process of getting our money back.\" The BBCpreviously reported that the Serious Fraud Officehas launched an investigation into the hotel construction project. South Wales Police and HMRC are investigating historical allegations of fraud, bribery and money laundering linked to the union. Officersraided Unite's London headquarters in April 2022. Auditors BDO identified \"properties, made available to certain staff and senior management that appear to have facilitated a financial upside… with the Union taking on disproportionate risk\". It is unclear which staff benefitted. The report said members of the union's executive council \"are not required to provide details of all business interests\" and other relationships meaning Unite is \"unable to determine whether conflicts of interests have occurred\". Sharon Graham has committed to tightening governance procedures including those involving expenses, gifts and hospitality.",

    "title": "Farm day visitors warned over Cryptosporidium parasite threat",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of visitors due to attend a UK-wide open farm day this weekend have been warned about a parasitic infection that causes serious gastrointestinal illness. There were 17 outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis linked to farms in England and Wales in 2024 and an outbreak in south Wales earlier this year has seen dozens of people fall ill. According to inspection reports from the past five years - released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act - some farms repeatedly ignored health inspectors' advice and allowed children to handle sick animals in filthy pens. The organisers of Open Farm Sunday, which sees 190,000 visitors, said its farms have high health and safety standards. Cryptosporidium can cause severe stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through direct contact with animals or touching surfaces that have animal faeces on them. The young, pregnant women and those with health conditions which affect their immune system can be particularly vulnerable. Public Health Wales said individual cases of cryptosporidiosis linked to visits to Cowbridge Farm Shop at Marlborough Grange Farm in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, this springhad now risen to 89 people. In England, one of those affected after a farm visit was Emily Fryer's six-year-old son Isaac. He was admitted to hospital after falling ill following a visit to Gannow Farm in Worcestershire last year. Mrs Fryer told the BBC: \"He didn't eat or drink for about five days. He just slept all the time. His sugars were dangerously low and they admitted him. \"Obviously, I was really worried then. Because he is autistic and non-verbal, we didn't really know how we could help him.\" Mrs Fryer said the family had taken hygiene seriously when they visited the farm and had washed their hands thoroughly using facilities provided on site. A year earlier the farm had been issued with a prohibition notice by the Health and Safety Executive because it was failing to prevent or control the risk of exposure to cryptosporidium. Those issues were dealt with and the farm was licensed to show animals to the public in 2024. Mrs Fryer said she was disappointed that the farm had been allowed to reopen to visitors. \"I just think it's awful,\" she said. The owners of the farm, which has now stopped its open days,  declined to comment when approached by the BBC but have previously said they had \"made every precaution possible\" to prevent an outbreak. Many farms across the UK have had to diversify their businesses over recent years to boost their profitability, with public open days, petting farms and play barns becoming an important source of income. But inspection reports released to the BBC under the Freedom Information Act by the UK's national cryptosporidium reference unit show that a small number of farms are not meeting health and safety standards - and, in extreme cases, are ignoring warnings from inspectors. On one farm in Wales, which was linked to a number of outbreaks, inspectors found sick animals kept on display and a lack of handwashing facilities, risk assessments and staff training. According to reports, the inspectors told the farm those failings were \"consistent with those identified previously. This indicates you are failing to maintain the required improvements from one season to the next\". Another farm visited in 2023 had also failed to implement recommendations from a previous inspection, which led to another outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, while another farm, due to host a school visit a few days after inspection, was found to be failing. \"Comparing current visit to last year found the conditions worse,\" the report noted. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the 16 outbreaks in England last year was a provisional figure and data analysis due to be published later in the month may see that rise. Both Public Health Wales and the UKHSA have warned the estimated 190,000 visitors who will be visiting the 250 farms taking part in Open Farm Sunday this weekend to make sure they takebasic hygiene measures. Jo Hatton, an education specialist for organisers of the open farm event LEAF (Linking Environment And Farming), said all its participating farmers were given advice and training on how best to keep visitors safe. \"We are supporting farmers to open their farms and with their risk assessments. We are on the phone with farmers checking in with them throughout the planning process and helping them to understand how to ensure that that visit goes smoothly and everyone goes home happy and healthy,\" she explained. One farm manager who says he is ensuring the highest health and safety standards for visitors on Sunday is Andy Bason, who will be welcoming around 2,000 visitors onto Newhouse Farm, Alresford, Hampshire. He said LEAF's health and safety training had \"really opened my eyes to what's needed to host this kind of event\". \"With the kind of numbers we see, it is a huge task. We want everyone to come here, have a great day and go home safe without any illness,\" he explained. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said that the health and safety of all visitors to farms was \"taken extremely seriously\". The UK's driest spring in 50 years is causing issues for some farmers. The annual South of England show at Ardingly is a chance for farmers to show off what they do. Business leaders believe the combined value of the shows to the South West economy was about £80m. It comes after the UK recorded its warmest spring on record and its driest in more than 50 years. A farmer says many in the industry are \"embracing the challenge\" of working more sustainably.",

    "title": "Did Welsh rarebit start as a joke by the English?",
    "article_text": "It's a beloved national dish of Wales and is found on restaurant menus across the country, but did Welsh rarebit actually start life as a joke played by the English? Toasted bread smothered in a rich, cheesy sauce - what's not to love? But the origin stories of this nostalgic comfort food are as varied as the recipes you can use to make it. Some credit poor farmers using a clever substitute for meat while others think English pubs coined the name as a joke, mocking the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. But which of these cheesy tales cuts the mustard? Welsh food historian and author Carwyn Graves said rarebit was \"clearly associated with cultural and ethnic Welshness\", with cheese being a vital part of European diets for a long time, especially in regions like Wales, where the dairy industry thrived. In the Middle Ages, before refrigeration, cheese and butter were essential for preserving milk from the spring and summer for use during the colder months. It was also a vital source of protein for poorer communities, particularly in areas like Wales and the Alps, where meat was scarce. In Wales, melted or roasted cheese became popular across all social classes, eventually evolving into Welsh rarebit. The 1536 Act of Union, incorporating Wales into England, saw Welsh migrants bringing melted cheese dishes to English cities. Mr Graves said the English saw it as an ethnic curiosity, even joking about it. One 16th Century tale sees Saint Peter trick Welshmen with the call caws bobi - Welsh for roasted cheese - which he said reflected the dish's cultural ties to Wales. The name Welsh rarebit appeared much later, with early English cookbooks, such as Hannah Glasse's in 1747, using terms including Welsh rabbit and Scotch rabbit for similar cheese on toast recipes. However, Mr Graves said there was no historical evidence linking the name to actual rabbits and he said the theory that poor people couldn't afford rabbit meat and used cheese instead was unproven. Kacie, from The Rare Welsh Bit food blog said Welsh rarebit, also known as Welsh rabbit, originated in the 1500s as a popular dish among Welsh working-class families who couldn't afford meat like rabbit, using cheese on toast as a substitute. According to her, the dish was first recorded in 1725 and over time, the name shifted from Welsh rabbit to Welsh rarebit, possibly to move away \"from patronising connotations associated with the nature of the dish as a poor man's supper\". Katrina from Real Girls Travel explained \"nobody's quite sure how the name came about\", but it's generally believed \"Welsh rarebit\" likely began as a joke about the poor people of south Wales, who were thought to live on rabbit and ale. She added that many mistakenly think Welsh rarebit contains rabbit because the dish was originally called \"Welsh rabbit\" in 1725. According to Katrina, the name probably changed because, in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the English often gave humorous or fanciful names to regional foods, making the change \"an attempt to make it a more fitting dish\". \"I personally think it was a language barrier or a strong Welsh accent that gave the dish its name,\" she added. In Sarah Fritsche's blog the Cheese Professor, she explained the word \"Welsh\" was used as an insult in 1700s Britain, similar to how \"welch\" functioned as a pejorative. According to Ms Fritsche, \"rabbit\" was used humorously because only the wealthy could afford real rabbit, making the cheesy toast a \"poor person's substitute\". She added \"rarebit\" was a corruption of \"rabbit\" and is unique to this dish, first appearing as \"rare bit\". Rose Geraedts, originally from the Netherlands, has lived in Brecon, Powys, for 20 years and runs the International Welsh Rarebit Centre. She opened the business eight years ago after noticing cafes and pubs in the area were not serving it, despite high demand from tourists. \"I thought it was crazy that a national dish wasn't on the menu. I think many saw it as old-fashioned,\" she said. She took over a disused Victorian school building, renovated it and made Welsh rarebit the star of the show. \"It seemed mad not to do it - but a lot of people think I'm nuts,\" she added. The cafe now offers six varieties and Ms Geraedts said customers loved the dish's rich, comforting flavour, seasoned with cayenne pepper, nutmeg, paprika and Worcestershire sauce. Ms Geraedts said she had welcomed visitors from around the world, from Australia to America, and even served celebrities including Jonathan Ross and rugby legend Gareth Edwards. She added: \"People love it because it's nostalgic. They remember their mother or grandmother making it. \"It's much more than just dry cheese on toast.\" Ms Geraedts believes rarebit became popular due to Wales' connection to cheese-making, despite its name being a sarcastic \"patronising\" English joke. University lecturer, dietician, cook and food writer Beca Lyne-Pirkis said she first learned to make Welsh rarebit with her grandparents so it brings back \"nostalgic memories\". The 43-year-old, from Cardiff, said it was a great first dish to learn as it's \"more complicated than cheese on toast\" but not too difficult. Ms Lyne-Pirkis said she has two versions - a rich, roux-based recipe with cheddar, beer, mustard and Worcestershire sauce and a quicker one mixing egg, cheese, and seasoning to spread on toast. The dish stayed with her through her university years and is now a favourite with her children. \"I fell in love with the flavour,\" she said. \"When I eat it I get the nostalgic childhood feeling as I have so many fond memories of eating it. That's where my love of food came from.\" Whatever the roots, Ms Lyne-Pirkis said rarebit was now a timeless, adaptable national dish rooted in family stories and experimentation. \"Every recipe has its own story, which helps keep the recipe alive.\" The prosecution says 329kg of cannabis worth millions was imported from America. Cardiff complete the signing of lock George Nott from Dragons. Among the missing items are documents from Gwrych Castle, which hosted I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! The 21-year-old died from combination of sepsis, pneumonia and Crohn's disease at hospital in 2020. Emily Brazier says she was left alone to give birth despite her pregnancy being high-risk.",

    "title": "Why 'the game is about glory' has a hollow ring at Spurs",
    "article_text": "Ange Postecoglou was sacked despite winning the Europa League, the club's first trophy for 17 years The famous phrase \"the game is about glory\" echoes around the magnificent Tottenham Hotspur Stadium before every game as a call to arms and the club's mission statement. They were the words of the legendary Danny Blanchflower, who captained Spurs to the league and FA Cup Double in 1961, the charismatic figure who epitomised the stylish image the club wished to portray. Ange Postecoglou, the Australian manager who led Spurs to the first glory they have enjoyed in 17 years by winning the Europa League, has discovered in the most brutal manner that this message carries a hollow ring in the hands of chairman Daniel Levy. Postecoglou followed that time-honoured Spurs mantra, fulfilling a promise to win a trophy in his second season. His reward for grabbing the glory was the sack. In the statement confirming Postecoglou's dismissal after two seasons, Spurs revealed the new reality by saying: \"Whilst winning the Europa League this season ranks as one of the club's greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.\" In other words, head not heart. Glory and emotion are welcome but are not the currency that carry most weight at Tottenham Hotspur these days. Glory and emotion, at least under Levy, are not enough for Spurs any more, even though his only previous brush with success during his time as chairman was winning the League Cup with Juande Ramos as manager in 2008. Postecoglou, justifiably, reflected on his work with \"pride\". In a statement he said: \"The opportunity to lead one of England's historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime.\" When history tells the tale of Postecoglou's time at Spurs, it will remember the historic night in Bilbao when Manchester United were overcome in a manner his critics claimed was beyond him - organised, disciplined, tactically sound, victorious. It will also recall a dreadful Premier League season and a 17th-place finish, with 22 defeats and only 11 victories, but Postecoglou's real legacy will be becoming only the third Spurs manager to win a European trophy after the great Bill Nicholson and Keith Burkinshaw. Postecoglou sacked by Spurs after Europa League win The cracks at Spurs that Europa League glory could not hide Frank emerges as leading candidate - but who else in Tottenham frame? And this is why there was a strong case for Postecoglou keeping his job, with even the confirmation of his dismissal acknowledging he had established \"a great platform to build upon\". Of course Postecoglou had flaws, such as his stubborn refusal to change his high-line, high-risk strategy, even when it was being exposed in his first season, but the Europa League showed he could do it differently, especially when a crippling injury list thinned out. Many Spurs fans will feel it is right to sack Postecoglou, but others will believe his success earned him the right to a third season, an opportunity to build on the emotional scenes witnessed in Bilbao, then on the streets around Tottenham at the Europa League homecoming. The Premier League placing will be 'Exhibit A' in the case against Postecoglou, but it is a reflection of the cold state of the game these days when securing a club's first silverware in 17 years sees you out of a job. Comparisons will be made with Manchester United's ill-fated and expensive decision to keep Erik ten Hag last summer after they won the FA Cup, only to sack him in October, but they had also won silverware under his predecessors Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal. Spurs, by contrast, were starved of trophies until Postecoglou changed all that. They had no recent history of winning until the Australian arrived following a brilliant spell at Celtic. Postecoglou achieved something that was beyond those who went before him, illustrious names like Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho and Antonio Conte, by providing Spurs with the glory they once regarded as their hallmark. Former England striker and BBC pundit Alan Shearer made his feelings clear on X when he posted: \"What a stupid game football is!\" And ex-Celtic striker Chris Sutton told BBC Sport: \"I would love to know the thought process behind the decision to get rid of him. Is it saying the finance of the Premier League is the be-all and end-all? So finishing fourth or fifth in the Premier League and not winning a trophy is what matters. \"It is like they are morphing into Arsenal under Arsene Wenger at the end, if that's what is important. \"But money over glory sums up the owner, Daniel Levy, doesn't it? \"Nothing surprises me in football any more, so Postecoglou is better off out of it really - and maybe they can go back to being mediocre old Tottenham again now.\" Sutton added: \"To get someone in who wins them silverware, then straightaway get rid of him, that sums up modern football, doesn't it? It's absolutely bonkers.\" It was Levy who grabbed the microphone at the post-match party in Bilbao and shouted: \"We're champions. \"This has been a very long time coming - 1984 was the last time we won a European cup. Tonight was have made history and I want to thank Ange and all the coaching staff, all the players. You guys have gone down in history. \"This a magnificent achievement for the club and hopefully gets us on the road we absolutely deserve to be - which is at the very top.\" If they achieve, or get anywhere near, to that target remains to be seen, but it will be done without Postecoglou, who clearly wanted to carry on in charge. Levy was basking in the glory Postecoglou brought him, but this did not stop him taking a decision which he insisted could not be shaped by emotion. The pressure and scrutiny will now switch back to Levy, who has followed his long track record of sacking managers who did not win trophies by sacking the one who did. Postecoglou brought glory - only to learn the harsh lesson that it is not enough for Daniel Levy.

    "title": "The cracks at Spurs that Europa League glory could not hide",
    "article_text": "The cracks at Spurs that Europa League glory could not hide Tottenham's euphoric players stepped off the plane the day after the night before and ventured straight into central London. The squad, according to well-placed sources, ended up in trendy London nightspot Mistress of Mayfair to mark the club'sEuropa League final victory over Manchester United in Bilbao. Once there, the players frantically waved white table handkerchiefs above their heads to a live rendition of Freed From Desire expertly played by the in-house saxophonist. Their manager, Ange Postecoglou, was elsewhere - having a separate celebration in the capital. Outwardly, the head coach's relationship with his squad appeared to be one of the strongest reasons to keep the 59-year-old. Away from the glare of the cameras, however, there were cracks in that togetherness. Now, just 16 days after victory in Bilbao,Postecoglou has been sackedafter his customary second-season success. Here we look at some of the key reasons - from a breakdown in relationships, to concern over injuries, tactics and signings - before assessing who might be next. This video can not be played Postecoglou's final BBC interview on Match of the Day after defeat by Brighton Public backing from a host of players - including key figures Cristian Romero and James Maddison - and the squad's determination to include Postecoglou in their on-pitch celebrations in Bilbao appeared to be an indication of deep connections. But it had not gone unnoticed that Postecoglou had become increasingly distant from the squad in recent months. At the start of his reign, the Australian would regularly have breakfast - certainly at away games - with the rest of his team. Recently, however, his obligatory ham and cheese toastie had been delivered to his room by a member of staff. On those away trips, it had been known for him not to be visible around the team hotel until noon. As a result, some players started taking issues they'd usually approach Postecoglou with to other members of the backroom team. That isn't to say the players didn't like Postecoglou. They did. They found him a refreshing change from the insular and sulky demeanour of Antonio Conte. The public messages of support for Postecoglou since the final provides evidence that their remains a bond between the group and their manager. While Postecoglou may have maintained a divide between himself and his players in recent months, his loyalty to his staff cannot be questioned. Indeed, it was said the biggest concern Postecoglou had about losing his job was his staff. He had been at pains to make sure they would be looked after. The story of Tottenham's campaign started with the visit of one of European football's emerging 'Golden Boys'. It is a little-known fact that Spurs' preparations for the 2024-25 campaign started with a visit from Desire Doue. The talented attacker, then playing for Rennes, was so intrigued by Postecoglou's project he made an undercover visit to the club's training ground in Enfield amid optimism a deal could be done. Fast forward nine months and Doue, who in the interim had signed for Paris St-Germain, was thestar of the Champions League final. In retrospect, Spurs' failure to lure him was a sign of what was to come - a series of blows during a truly forgettable domestic season. It's important to stress their inability to land Doue, 20, wasn't for the want of trying - but while his reputation has soared, Tottenham and Postecoglou were left in despair all too often. This video can not be played 'I told them and they laughed' - Postecoglou at Tottenham's Europa League victory parade Speak to those behind the scenes at Tottenham and they will explain injuries have been the most pertinent factor behind their recent issues. Romero, Son Heung-min, Dominic Solanke, Dejan Kulusevski, Micky van de Ven, Richarlison and Guglielmo Vicario are among the players to have spent extended spells on the sidelines this season - many with muscular issues. Maddison, Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall were all unavailable in Bilbao while Son started on the bench because he was deemed unfit having only recently returned from injury. Multiple sources have told BBC Sport the club's injury record has been at the centre of some friction between members of the coaching team and medical and strength and conditioning staff over the course of the season. \"It's been the blame game,\" one well-placed source said. Richarlison's injury-disrupted campaign has been a real bone of contention, according to sources, particularly in the aftermath of the 4-0 Carabao Cup defeat by Liverpool in February when, having only recently returned from hamstring and groin problems, the Brazil international injured a calf. There have been other examples this season when Postecoglou's team and the medical and fitness department have not seen eye to eye. Much has been made of Postecoglou's attacking approach or, more pertinently, the accusation he was unwilling to adapt. \"It's just who we are, mate,\" he famously said when questioned about his tactics earlier this season. Some continue to call his apparent refusal to ditch his philosophy commendable. Others believe his stubbornness was the root of Tottenham's difficulties. Certain members of the team felt during the first half of the season they were too open, and Postecoglou should have considered making defensive tweaks. The Australian's apparent reluctance to adapt led to a degree of internal frustration. Letting a two-goal lead slip in the 3-2 loss at Brighton raised eyebrows, and there was similar angst in the 4-3 loss to Chelsea in December after Spurs raced 2-0 ahead inside 12 minutes. Intriguingly, well-placed sources insist Postecoglou did tweak his defensive approach in both games. Postecoglou was also widely praised for the way he set up his team sturdily in the Europa League quarter-final second-leg win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Spurs were particularly robust in the comprehensive semi-final victory over Bodo/Glimt, too, then kept another clean sheet in Bilbao to finish the job. Speaking in the aftermath of the Europa League final victory,Postecoglou made clear his hope he would stay in charge. It seemed perfectly reasonable, with a trophy and Champions League qualification not generally leading to the sacking of a manager. Unfortunately for Postecoglou, Daniel Levy simply wasn't for turning - the Tottenham chairman sticking with 'Plan A' to dispense with the Australian. The euphoria and affection directed towards Postecoglou from players and supporters may have run some interference, but not enough to change the direction of travel. Had Spurs lost to United, it is widely acknowledged Postecoglou would have been relieved of his duties before now. Victory added some emotion into the equation - but clearly not enough for Levy to have a change of heart. The delay in making the decision is the result of various factors. Most pertinently, Postecoglou, Levy and chief football officer Scott Munn - whose job is also under threat - were away last week. But sources have also claimed Levy wanted to put time between the emotional outpouring that came after the final and making his decision. At the heart of his thinking was Tottenham's 17th-place finish in the Premier League after 22 losses in 38 matches. In the end, he could not look past it. In fact in the statement announcing his sacking, Spurs pointed out - with eye-opening precision - the team had taken 78 points from their past 66 games. Football Daily Postecoglou sacked by Spurs Attention will now turn towho replaces Postecoglou. Multiple sources have told BBC Sport there is an interest in Brentford head coach Thomas Frank. Frank has a good relationship with Spurs technical director Johan Lange, which could be a deciding factor when Levy comes to decide who he appoints. It is understood consideration was given to the prospect of making an unlikely move for Eddie Howe, but Newcastle's qualification for the Champions League would, you imagine, nip that in the bud. A return for Mauricio Pochettino would have significant support from fans but is a move that comes with a number of obstacles. Pochettino is managing the United States, who will co-host next year's World Cup, and it would take a compensation package described to BBC Sport as one of the \"biggest in football history\" to release him. Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva, recently appointed Al-Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi and Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner are among the others to have been considered. So just a fortnight after Spurs were partying, all eyes are now on what present Levy delivers for the club.

    "title": "Understated Dawson shows England magic they've been missing",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'He's back!' - Dawson takes four wickets on England return Tall or short. Right-arm or left. Leg-spin, off-spin or Dan Mousley's darts. Eleven men bowled spin for England between Liam Dawson's 20th and 21st international caps. Seam bowler Ollie Robinson has even turned his arm over with some offies during a miserable Ashes defeat in Adelaide since Dawson's last Test. But in taking 4-20 against West Indies in the hosts' 21-run win in the first T20, Dawson gave a hint at what England have been missing. \"I have not played international cricket for three-and-a-half years,\" the 35-year-old told BBC Test Match Special. \"To contribute to a win is a really special feeling.\" Buttler and returning Dawson lead England to win England v West Indies: First T20 Highlights Visa issues stop two Windies players travelling to UK Even that sentence tells you something. It had, in fact, been two years and six months since Dawson's last England appearance but he would be forgiven for thinking it had been longer. Whenever an England squad was named - or they lost a Test - Dawson's absence was a hotly-contested topic. At times verging on culture-war status, county fans were dumfounded the leading English spinner in the County Championship in 2023 and 2024 was being consistently overlooked. England's managing director Rob Key famously said Dawson was \"not someone who wants to go around India as the 15th or 16th man\" after leaving him out of a Test squad. Since then, Dawson had accepted that the call from England would never come again. \"Probably not,\" he said on Friday, when asked if he expected this international comeback to happen. \"For a couple of years I have not expected to play. \"I want to go out and enjoy my cricket, whoever I am playing for. To come back and do well, I am very proud and it is pleasing.\" Dawson has shown - from Lord's to Lahore, Dubai to Durban - he is a dependable operator in his time away from international cricket. He has been a regular pick on the franchise circuit and was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in April. And at the start of a new era under captain Harry Brook, in need of wins to halt a slide that has lasted 18 months, England finally realised that dependable was no longer a criticism but a strength. \"I have played against Daws quite a bit,\" said Brook. \"I played with him for England a few times. \"He's such a good bowler. He's good bloke as well, which helps.\" Recalling Dawson was not solely Brook's decision, although it is significant the comeback came for the Yorkshireman's first T20 series in charge. After three poor white-ball tournaments in a row, Key said earlier this year England had to improve their bowling of left-arm spin in a hint at what was to come for an outfit that had previously packed their side with pace. This video can not be played Buttler and Dawson star as England beat West Indies in first T20 Dawson, meanwhile, admits he does not try to do anything \"flash\". While Shoaib Bashir and Tom Hartley have their high release points and Rehan Ahmed his googly, Dawson is a throwback - the old-school magician who can still deceive you with two hands and a pack of cards, without the need for saws, fire and flashing lights. In Chester-le-Street, he outfoxed West Indies with that understated routine of tricks. After conceding only four runs from the first over, Dawson struck in his second. With extra loop, he dropped 10mph from his previous delivery and found the sharpest turn in the match. Johnson Charles charged towards him to be left stranded and stumped. From there, after two opening overs that cost only seven, Dawson rested and West Indies rebuilt. Dawson returned, the dangerous Sherfane Rutherford on strike, and the spinner delivered for Brook as the left-hander hit to long-on. If credit for that one would be generous, Dawson's next scalp - two balls later - came with another drop in pace and, crucially, a wider line. From outside off stump Roston Chase gave Ben Duckett another catch in the deep to make England huge favourites once again. As boundaries flowed at the other end - younger men Jacob Bethell, Will Jacks and Matthew Potts among those punished - Dawson was not hit to the rope until his fourth over. The dangerous Rovman Powell struck him for four twice but a ball later Dawson changed again. He went quicker and flatter, Powell was bowled and Dawson had his best T20 international figures. His 4-20 was also the best by a left-arm spinner for England in the format. Key could hardly have asked for more. The backdrop to England's win is the T20 World Cup that looms next year. They have only 12 matches in this format before travelling to India and Sri Lanka, where spin is expected to be crucial. \"That's not even come into my thoughts,\" said Dawson, when asked if he had one eye on making that World Cup squad. \"I'm just happy to be back involved in this, take one game at a time and enjoy every time I play.\" Dawson was an unused squad member when England won the 50-over World Cup in 2019. Six years on, he may finally be the one they need. Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Slicker endures horror debut - but who is Scotland's seventh-choice keeper?",
    "article_text": "Cieran Slicker flashed a quick smile at head coach Steve Clarke as he bounded on to the Hampden pitch six minutes and 37 seconds into Scotland's friendly with Iceland to replace stricken starter Angus Gunn. Just 64 seconds later, the debutant took a panicked slash at a Kieran Tierney pass back and the ball eventually found its way to Andri Gudjohnsen, who arced a fine finish high over the stranded goalkeeper. The smile was gone. The misery was just beginning. The next hour of Scotland's 3-1 defeat by Iceland might be among the worst Slicker will endure in his career. Slicker endures horror debut - but who is Scotland's seventh-choice keeper? Abject Scotland booed off after woeful defeat by Iceland Scotland must get it right quickly - Robertson Slicker didn't really have any time to acclimatise to international football. One mistake - and a relatively small one at that - one goal. Bang. His confidence was visibly shaken and he rushed his next couple of kicks before unconvincingly clinging on to a shot from Jon Dagur Thorsteinsson at the second attempt. It was his only save of the night. The second Iceland goal was caused by dreadful work by the entire Scotland defence, culminating with Slicker failing to scramble the ball off his line after it ricocheted towards goal off Lewis Ferguson. Half-time should have been an opportunity to regroup and reset, but the third concession was perhaps the most egregious. Victor Palsson's header was straight at Slicker, but the ball burst through his arms and into the back of the net. Moments later, the sparse Hampden crowd cheered ironically when Slicker successfully caught the ball. It summed up a torrid night for the young man. This video can not be played Watch Iceland capitalise on Scotland's many failings Eligible through his Scottish father, Slicker was signed by the then League One Ipswich Town from Manchester City for an undisclosed fee in the summer of 2023 on a three-year deal. The 22-year-old was an unused substitute for City manager Pep Guardiola for several first-team games in the 2021-22 season. He also spent time on loan at Rochdale before moving to Ipswich, but failed to make a league appearance. He was part of the Tractor Boys squad that recorded back-to-back promotions to the Premier League, making a few appearances in domestic cup competitions along the way and filling in as the back-up keeper on occasion too. But Slicker played just 10 minutes for Ipswich last season - in the FA Cup - and is still to make his senior league debut. He has 17 caps at under-21 level for Scotland - with three clean sheets - and was first called up for the senior squad in November 2024. \"It's difficult for Cieran, I really feel for him,\" the Scotland head coach told BBC Sport Scotland. \"He got thrown into a situation that he wasn't quite ready for but Craig Gordon's injured, Liam Kelly's injured, Zander Clark is injured. \"The only good thing is it came in a friendly match. I'd imagine [Angus Gunn] won't play the next game. \"I've had young Callan McKenna in the squad so he'll travel then we'll have a look and see if we can find another goalkeeper in Scotland who's not on holiday.\" This video can not be played Clarke on Scotland's goalkeeper crisis Not only are Gordon, Kelly and Clark out at present, Robby McCrorie went down in the warm-up. It all likelihood, he's the one who would have come on against Iceland. With Gunn and McCrorie likely to be out of Monday's friendly against Liechtenstein, too, and Slicker's confidence through the floor, will Clarke turn to someone else? \"You have to find out what's in the player's mind as well, how he's feeling about it,\" former Scotland defender Willie Miller said of Slicker. \"What you're looking for is honesty from him. Does he feel like he can take on the challenge in the next game, or that he doesn't want to? \"Does the manager want to take him out of the firing line?\" McKenna, 18, has more senior experience than Slicker, but not by much. He played nine matches for Queen's Park in the Scottish Championship before signing for Bournemouth in 2024. He's been in their development squad since and has been with the Scotland group as a training player for the past week. Given the lack of options, Clarke's first phone call might be to Jon McLaughlin. The two-time Scotland cap, 37, only played one FA Cup game for Swansea City last season and is now out of contract. But he was a squad regular, is experienced, and would likely be considered one of the safest options. Dundee goalkeeper Jon McCracken was in Scotland squads during the season just gone, but was replaced between at Dens Park by Trevor Carson midway through the term. Other Scotland-based options would be Scott Bain - recently released by Celtic - or Ross Doohan - recently signed by Celtic. MK Dons keeper Craig MacGillivray has previously been called up by Clarke, too, but would appear to be a long way down the pecking order these days. Cieran Slicker made his Scotland debut before playing a senior league match Clarke was much more candid about Slicker's night than many thought he might be. He spoke about this was too early for him, him not being ready for it. It's clear that the lad is suffering after being thrown in to a situation. It also sounds like he was always going to be third choice - and therefore there for experience rather than game time - until McCrorie's injury in the warm-up. It's an unforgiving position. One thing is clear though, Clarke's manner over the goalkeeping situation was frustration bordering on anger.",

    "title": "'Could be last match I play here' - was that Djokovic's goodbye to Paris?",
    "article_text": "Djokovic has won three of his 24 Grand Slam titles at the French Open French Open 2025 Dates:25 May-8 JuneVenue:Roland Garros Coverage:Live radio commentaries across 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app Before Novak Djokovic left the court after his French Open semi-final defeat, he put his racquet bags down on the clay and said a heartfelt goodbye to the Paris crowd. He bent to touch the clay on Court Philippe Chatrier before holding his hand to his heart and waving to the crowd. It felt like a final farewell for a player who turned 38 last month. Or will it prove to be 'au revoir' until they meet again next year? Three-time champion Djokovic, who lost a tight battle with world number one Jannik Sinner in straight sets, is unsure if he will return. \"This could have been the last match ever I played here - I don't know. That's why it was a bit more emotional at the end,\" said Djokovic. \"But if this was the farewell match of Roland Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd.\" Djokovic was given huge vocal support as he tried to move a step closer to a standalone record 25th major title. The Serb was also aiming for another record - victory in Sunday's final would have made him the oldest Grand Slam men's singles champion. But he could not break down the steely resistance of top seed Sinner, who won 6-4 7-5 7-6 (7-3) to set up a final against second seed Carlos Alcaraz. Pressed about how his future could look, Djokovic said: \"I don't know right now. Twelve months at this point in my career is quite a long time. \"Do I wish to play more? Yes, I do. But will I be able to play in 12 months' time here again? I don't know. \"That's all I can say for the moment.\" Novak Djokovic won his last Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2023 A patchy season by Djokovic's lofty standards led to questions about his stamina and motivation coming into Roland Garros. The departure of rival-turned-coach Andy Murray also indicated things were not functioning as hoped, although he did warm up by winning his 100th ATP title at the Geneva Open. Djokovic's performance against Sinner showed he is not ready to roll over into retirement just yet - and emphasised why he prioritises the four majors in the latter stages of his career. \"Those tournaments are the priorities of my schedule,\" Djokovic said. \"Wimbledon and US Open, yes, they are in plans. That's all I can say right now. \"I feel like I want to play those two, for sure. For the rest, I'm not so sure.\" Djokovic will be bidding for a record-equalling eighth men's singles title at Wimbledon, having lost the past two finals there to Alcaraz. \"Wimbledon is my childhood favourite tournament. I'm going to do everything possible to get myself ready,\" he added. \"I guess my best chances maybe are Wimbledon, you know, to win another Slam or maybe Australia.\" The end is clearly in sight for Djokovic, who has played 1,375 matches since turning professional in 2004. But his trademark fight and fitness helped him stay within touching distance of 23-year-old Sinner, who has dominated the ATP Tour over the past 18 months. \"I was proud of my effort tonight in this tournament, considering I wasn't in great form coming into Roland Garros,\" he said. \"Jannik was just too good for me.\" The pair went toe-to-toe in an absorbing contest lasting over three hours in which both men pushed each other to their limits. Afterwards Sinner, who has won his past 20 Grand Slam matches, described Djokovic's level as \"amazing\". \"I had to step up and play the best tennis I could,\" the Italian added. \"It shows again what a role model for all of us, especially for young players. \"What he is doing is incredible.

    "title": "Wales will attack Belgium after beating Liechtenstein - Bellamy",
    "article_text": "Craig Bellamy has won five and drawn four of his nine games as Wales head coach World Cup qualifier: Belgium v Wales Venue:King Baudouin Stadium, BrusselsDate:Monday, 9 JuneKick off:19:45 BST Coverage:Live on BBC One, S4C, iPlayer, BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru, the BBC Sport website and app, plus live text commentary. Head coach Craig Bellamy vowed Wales would go on the attack in Belgium on Monday after beating Liechtenstein to top their World Cup qualifying group. Friday night's 3-0 triumph in Cardiff extended Wales' unbeaten start under Bellamy to nine games and took them two points clear at the summit of Group J. They face their sternest challenge yet under their former captain on Monday when they travel to Brussels to face the group's top seeds. Belgium only started their campaign on Friday, conceding a late equaliser in North Macedonia to leave them six points behind Wales, albeit with two games in hand. Asked if he thought that result put Belgium under pressure before facing Wales, Bellamy said: \"No, I don't. These games can happen. They haven't lost. \"Did I expect them to get three points? I did. I need to see the game back to give you a better rundown on what happened and how it happened, and even for myself. But, yeah, North Macedonia played their part, so good. \"We go there and I'm not camping. I'm not sitting back. It's not in my make-up. I can't do it, I don't want to do it. \"So let me watch the game a little bit more. I've got a little bit more in my head but I'm really excited about it.\" Wales see off Liechtenstein to top World Cup group Wales wait for news on Williams ankle injury Mindset, meetings, minutiae - how Bellamy changed Wales Wales were utterly dominant against Liechtenstein, as they would have expected to be against predominantly part-time opponents ranked 205th in the world. Although they were initially frustrated by their determined, defensive visitors, Wales secured victory with goals by Joe Rodon, Harry Wilson and Kieffer Moore â and the winning margin could have been far greater. \"There is a lot I liked. I'd really like us to make this six, seven, eight. That's what we need to push,\" said Bellamy. \"These games have never been easy for our nation. We have a proven record of that and the chances we created we could make this more. \"We'll get to that, but I liked the reactions as soon as we lose we get it back. The mentality of the players was really good. Did we expect to win? Of course we did. \"Did we expect such a slow game? I felt our ball boys could have been a bit quicker. \"We are at home so we have a choice in that as well. I'm going to be looking for them in a bit - I'm not, I'm joking.\"",

    "article_text": "A group of men removed from the US toDjibouti, in east Africa, are stranded in a converted shipping container together with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers sent to supervise them after a deportation flight to South Sudan was stopped by an American court. The eight deportees and 13 Ice staff have begun to “feel ill”, the US government said. Eight men, from Latin America, Asia andSouth Sudan, and the Ice staff have been stuck at a US naval base since late May. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that the Ice officers began to fall ill “within 72 hours of landing” in Djibouti, and continue to suffer from suspected bacterial upper respiratory infections. TheTrump administrationhad attempted to send the eight detainees, who it said had been convicted of criminal offenses, to South Sudan, but ajudge intervenedto stop their flight in May, arguing that they were entitled to challenge the deportation in the courts. Mellissa Harper, a top official at the DHS and Ice, said in acourt declarationthat the detainees are being held in a shipping container that was previously converted into a conference room. The Ice officers are “sharing very limited sleeping quarters”, Harper said, with only six beds between 13 people. In the declaration, Harper said burn pits inDjiboutihave led to Ice officials experiencing “throat irritation”. She said the outside temperature frequently exceeds 100F (38C) in the daytime, and said Ice officials were at risk of malaria because they did not take anti-malaria medication before arriving in Djibouti. “Within 72 hours of landing in Djibouti, the officers and detainees began to feel ill,” Harper said, but they were unable to obtain proper testing for a diagnosis. Harper added: “Upon arrival in Djibouti, officers were warned by US Department of Defense officials of imminent danger of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. The Ice officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack.” The declaration detailed the conditions that the detainees face, including only being allowed to shower once a day, and being subjected to “pat-downs and searches” during trips to the restroom, which is 40 yards from the shipping container where they are being held. Harper said there is limited lighting in the area, “which makes visibility difficult and creates a significant security risk for both the officers and aliens”. The Trump administration hadattempted to send the eight mento their home countries of Myanmar, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Mexico and South Sudan. Those countries declined to accept them, however, and US authorities then arranged to fly them to South Sudan in late May. Brian Murphy, a US district judge in Boston, intervened, ruling that the administration had“unquestionably” violated his earlier order, issued in April, which ruled that anyone facing deportation to third-party countries had the right to challenge it legally.",

    "title": "Canada’s PM faces backlash for inviting India’s Narendra Modi for G7 summit",
    "article_text": "Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, has defended his decision to invite India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to the upcoming G7 summit in Alberta, despite the conclusion of Canada’s federal police’s that the murder of a prominent Sikh activist in British Columbia wasorchestrated by the “highest levels” of the Indian government. Carney declined to answer reporters’ questions over whether he believed Modi had a role in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar – a killing on Canadian soil that shattered relations between the two countries. “There is a legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced inCanada, and it’s never appropriate to make comments with respect to those legal processes,” he said on Friday. Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder. The summit, attended by key world leaders, runs from 15 to 17 June in Kananaskis, Alberta. Carney said becauseIndiawas the “fifth largest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and central to supply chains”, he said it was important to invite the country’s leader despite the continuing investigation to discuss energy, artificial intelligence and critical minerals. “I extended the invitation to Prime Minister Modi and, in that context, he has accepted,” Carney said. Modi said he was glad to receive a call from Carney and congratulated the Liberal leader on his recent electoral victory. “As vibrant democracies bound by deep people-to-people ties, India and Canada will work together with renewed vigour, guided by mutual respect and shared interests. Look forward to our meeting at the summit,” Modi said in a statement. Canada and India expelled each other’s top diplomatslast year over Nijjar’s politically motivated murder in the British Columbia city of Surrey. Canadian law enforcement also alleged India was involved in extortion, gang violence and intimidation. Carney’s decision to invite Modi prompted an outraged response from the World Sikh Organization. “For Sikhs in Canada, this is a betrayal, not just of our community, but of core Canadian values. Prime Minister Carney’s decision to inviteNarendra Modi, while India continues to deny any role in the assassination of Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar and refuses to cooperate with Canadian authorities, is both shameful and dangerous,” its president, Danish Singh, wrote in a statement. “We would never welcome leaders from Russia, China, or Iran under such circumstances. Yet India has done far more on Canadian soil in terms of foreign interference and transnational repression, including orchestrating murders, and is being rewarded with a red carpet welcome.” Carney’s decision comes as his new government looks to ease tensions with other countries feuding with Canada. Late Thursday, he posted a readout of a call with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, and said there was interest on both sides to “regularize channels of communication” amid a trade spat that has cost both sides billions through tariffs on seafood, electric vehicles, canola, pork and peas. In the call, the first high-level telephone communication since becoming prime minister in March, Carney said both sides were also fighting illegal production of the opioid fentanyl. Carney is also in direct talks with Donald Trump, the US president, to end a trade war between the two allies following economically damaging tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Doug Ford, the Ontario premier, told reporters the Canadian prime minister was engaged in “deep, deep discussions” with Trump’s team – a development confirmed by Canada’s industry minister hours later.",

    "title": "Catholics now make up little more than half Brazil’s population",
    "article_text": "Home to the world’s largestCatholicpopulation,Brazilhas once again witnessed a decline in the faith’s following, according to new figures released by the country’s national statistics institute (IBGE). Thirty years ago, Catholics made up 82.9% of Brazil’s population but now account for just over half, 56.7%, according to the 2022 census – whose results on religion were only released on Friday. Meanwhile, the number of evangelicals has continued to grow, rising from 9% of the population to 26.9% over the past three decades. Although the growth rate has slowed slightly – rising by 6.5 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and 5.3 since – the new data shows that, for the first time, at least one in four Brazilians identifies as evangelical. The analysts did not specify the denominations among evangelicals and said they do not yet know if this will be detailed in the future. “In recent years, we’ve seen a growing presence of evangelicals emerging and gradually asserting themselves in society, taking a stand, expressing their values, ideas, and faith,” said an IBGE analyst, Maria Goreth Santos. Gospel singers and religious influencershave become superstars, evangelical-themed booksconsistently top bestseller lists, and Brazil’s still immensely popular telenovelas haveincreasingly incorporated evangelical charactersand storylines into their plots. In politics, evangelicals haveemerged as a significant political force, forming one of the main support bases for the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now pose an additional challenge for the leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as he prepares to seek re-election in 2026. A poll released earlier this week showed that, despite positive economic indicators, the veteran South American leader is struggling in his third term:disapproval stands at 57%among the general population but is even higher among evangelicals, at 66%. “Rationally, the government understands it needs to engage with evangelicals, but internally, many of Lula’s party leaders still believe religion is a thing of the past and that the faithful are simply people who haven’t had proper access to education,” said the anthropologist and historianJuliano Spyer, author of books on the evangelical movement in Brazil. The new IBGE data also showed that, proportionally within each group, there are more Black evangelicals than white ones – a particularly relevant finding given that the majority of Brazil’s population, 56%, is Black. Although Catholics remain the majority in both cases, just one in four white Brazilians identifies as evangelical, compared with one in three among Black Brazilians. The data also showed an increase in the number of people with no religious affiliation, rising from 4.6% 30 years ago to 9.3% today. Another significant figure the IBGE researchers highlighted was the growth in the number of followers of Afro-Brazilian religions such as candomblé and umbanda, which rose from 0.3% to 1%. The Brazilian state has historically persecuted followers of Afro-Brazilian religions. Brazil was the country thatkidnapped the highest number of enslaved Africans, and during the more than three centuries of slavery, practising any faith other than Catholicism was prohibited. After abolition in 1888, religions of African origin were still criminalised. It was only with the adoption of the country’s most recent constitution, in 1988, that practitioners of umbanda and candomblé gained some form of state protection – at least in theory. In recent years, however, they haveagain faced persecution, this time from extremist Catholics and evangelicals and evendrug traffickers who claim to have embraced Christianity. Santos said that although followers of Afro-Brazilian religions still represent a small minority of the population, the rise in self-declared adherents may reflect both people who previously identified with other religions out of fear and actual migration. She sees the growth as a potential result of “all these movements to celebrate Afro-Brazilian culture in recent years … with prominent figures in society, influencers and artists identifying with these religions … and also a massive campaign against religious intolerance”.",

    "title": "‘I had 30 Lamborghinis’: Pablo Escobar’s top cocaine pilot gives first interview",
    "article_text": "A man who eventually becamePablo Escobar’s go-to cocaine pilot has revealed that he first turned down an employment offer from the notorious Colombian drug lord because he was content with the $4m a month he was earning while flying for a competitor. But, in a new podcast containing what is believed to be his first interview since authorities arrested him at his Florida mansion in 1988,Tirso “TJ” Dominguezrecounted how he changed his mind about working for Escobar when the so-called Patrón – or boss – offered him a salary that was five times higher: $20m monthly. “I had 30 Lamborghinis, and I dressed well,” Dominguez says of his ensuing lifestyle during the eight-part documentary podcast titledCocaine Air, a copy of which was provided to the Guardian. “They brought me the car that matched the shirt that I decided to wear that day.” The interview that Dominguezgrantedthe Cocaine Air host Johnathan Walton after spending more than a dozen years in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering provides a stark, first-hand account of what would motivate someone to work for one of the world’s most infamous criminals. Escobar had a hand in murders, kidnappings and bombings before Colombia’s special forces shot him to death in 1993. As he told it to Walton, Dominguez only became involved in drug smuggling in the late 1970s after his father, a southFloridareal estate developer, unexpectedly died from cancer in the middle of building a sugar mill in Haiti. Dominguez says he was 20 at the time, and he was subsequently scammed out of $100,000 by two ruthless Miami bankers who refused to give him the $14m loan his father had secured before dying. Desperate to raise capital for the sugar mill, Dominguez – whose mother was a homemaker – learned to fly airplanes so he could earn some money from drug dealers by illicitly smuggling marijuana into the US from the Bahamas andColombia. He says he graduated to illegally flying cocaine over American skies after he dropped $800,000 worth of marijuana into the wrong smuggling boat, prompting his suppliers to kidnap him and threaten to kill him along with his family if he did not quickly make them whole. The quickest path to regaining the lost investment was to fly a planeload of coke to be dealt on behalf of another supplier, so Dominguez did it, according to his account. “I never wanted to get into cocaine because cocaine [smugglers] were the bad guys … doing all the killing,” Dominguez says on Walton’s podcast, which is unrelated to an upcoming Netflix documentary of the same name but on a different subject. “I don’t condone drugs. I’ve never done any drugs. I was the victim of a con which actually pushed me in the direction that I ended up in.” Nonetheless, that first flight brought Dominguez a cool $1m to pay back his irate weed suppliers, he says. He says that was lucrative enough for him to decide to begin flying smuggled cocaine full-time, proving himself to be someone who was punctual as well as professional – and he never lost a shipment. Dominguez said his reliability ultimately captured the attention of Escobar, who tried to recruit him to his cartel. Yet Dominguez, also nicknamed Tito, initially was unmoved, saying he was fine with four flights a month at $1m a pop. “I’ll be honest with you – Pablo Escobar didn’t mean anything to me,” Dominguez says on Cocaine Air. “I [was] full of myself. I walk on water, you know? I’m making $4m a month. What the hell’s wrong with that?” Escobar then offered to pay Dominguez for four flights a month at $5m a trip. Dominguez thought $20m monthly – the equivalent of $60m today when factoring in inflation – was too much to pass up. And he says that was when he opted to begin flying for Escobar exclusively. That fee evidently became too much even for Escobar, who later started paying Dominguez in cocaine. Dominguez at that point went from a cocaine smuggler to a dealer, meaning he could fly the product, sell it, collect the proceeds, launder the money and invest the funds – all on his own, without needing to count on middlemen. “I did what no other smuggler had ever done in the history of smuggling,” Dominguez bragged to Walton, whose prior projects include the hitQueen of the Con: The Irish Heiresspodcast series. In a particularly noteworthy moment on Cocaine Air’s series opener, Dominguez reads from a memoir co-authored by Escobar’s brother – his accountantRoberto Escobar– that asserts TJ had a fleet of 30 airplanes and was one of the “main transporters” for Pablo’s drug empire. Dominguez recalled accumulating a mansion, a company that sold cellphones at a time when the devices cost $5,000 a piece, a housing development, a charter airplane and boat business, and an exotic car dealership at the peak of his powers. He even raised a pet mountain lion whom he dubbed Top Cat. But it all came crashing down one early morning in April 1988 when federal investigators – equipped with rifles and helicopters – descended on his house and arrested him. Prosecutors had charged him and 12 associates with illegally bringing more than five tons each of marijuana and cocaine into south Florida from at least July 1984 to December 1985, as the Miami Herald and Sun Sentinel newspapersreported. Officials contended that Dominguez’s exotic-car dealership in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and his other businesses in the area were fronts for a multimillion-dollar drug-smuggling ring. They seized two dozen luxury cars – Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Excaliburs and Panteras – and five airplanes collectively worth nearly $3m to auction them off, among other consequences for Dominguez. In 1991, about two years before Escobar’s slaying, Dominguez pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine and marijuana as well as illicitly laundering money. He spent 13 years imprisoned, including two in solitary confinement after one of his fellow inmates reported Dominguez after he managed to buy a helicopter from within his cell and plotted to be flown out to freedom. Dominguez explains on Cocaine Air that, before being caught, he had instructed the helicopter pilot to land on the grounds of the prison and then “just jump me over the fence”. “There was a canal, not too far away – I had a car waiting for me,” Dominguez says on Cocaine Air, which premiered on Wednesday with plans to release new episodes weekly through 23 July on podcast platforms such as Apple andSpotify. Now aged 73, Dominguez told the podcast that he considers his debt to society repaid and aspires to become a legitimate entrepreneur. “Failing is when you quit,” Dominguez says of his desire to write a new chapter in his life. “You’re going to fall? You fall forward. That means you gained two steps already. “The glass is always half full for me.”",

    "title": "Frequent TikTok users in Taiwan more likely to agree with pro-China narratives, study finds",
    "article_text": "Taiwanese people who spend large amounts of time onTikTokare more likely to agree with some pro-China narratives, a survey has suggested. The study, conducted by the Taiwan-based DoubleThink Lab, surveyed people acrossTaiwanin March, asking a series of questions about politics and democracy in Taiwan and China, and their views on unification of the two sides. It found that among the respondents, agreement with criticisms of Taiwan’s domestic issues, and with the prospect of unifying withChina, rose as TikTok use increased, before dropping again among the heaviest users of more than 14 hours a week. China’s ruling Communist party (CCP)claims Taiwan is a province of Chinaand has vowed to annex it under what it terms “reunification”, by force if necessary. Social media is a key battleground in China’s information warfare, as it seeks to convince or coerce Taiwan into accepting annexation without military conflict. The DoubleThink Lab report claimed the more active TikTok users showed stronger correlations with an openness to Chinese propaganda and the idea that unification with China is inevitable and democracy should be sacrificed for peace. There was also correlation with unhappiness about current domestic issues, including opposition-driven accusations of judicial unfairness and erosions of free speech. Differences were stark among supporters of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which the CCP has labelled illegal separatists. “Our analysis suggests that active TikTok use is more likely to influence users’ political attitudes toward being more anti-democratic establishment and positive attitudes toward PRC governance, even among groups traditionally opposed to the CCP,” said the report’s author, Eric Hsu. The percentage of DPP supporters who used TikTok and thought it was acceptable to give up Taiwan’s democratic system “for the sake of cross-strait peace” was 10 points higher than non-users, at 26.8%, the report said. And in response to statements that the DPP was “no different from the CCP and Taiwan lacks freedom of speech”, 23.9% of DPP supporters who used TikTok agreed, compared with 9.3% who were not active on the app. TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, and fears of it being used to spread pro-CCP propaganda have already resulted in restrictions or threats of outright bans in several countries, including the US. In Taiwan, there are rules against TikTok being used on government devices. In 2019, theGuardian revealedhow ByteDance used TikTok to advance Beijing’s foreign policy aims by moderating sensitive content. A 2023 study, by Rutgers University’s Network Contagion Research Institute in the US, found TikTok’s algorithms consistently amplify pro-CCP content and suppress anti-CCP narratives, with much of the pro-CCP content originating from state-linked entities. ByteDance has long denied the allegations. “From the CCP’s founding, there has always been a strong emphasis on both the ‘pen’ and the ‘gun’ – meaning propaganda and force,” said Yu-hui Tai, an assistant professor at Taiwan’s National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. Tai said Taiwan was on the frontline of China’s propaganda efforts, and its digital environment was “complex”. She added: “TikTok is not the only app young people use”, noting that Douyin – the Chinese domestic version of TikTok, which some Taiwanese also use – is very different in content and moderation to TikTok. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion The Guardian has reported previously on the popularity of other Chinese apps that have increased theircultural influence among young Taiwanese. Titus C Chen, a research fellow at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said the vast majority of TikTok users “aren’t actively seeking out political content when they use the platform”. He said it could not be ruled out that users were just more inclined to agree with such views and so were being fed content that aligned with their interests. “That said, it’s undeniably true that TikTok’s content – both its Chinese and international versions – is heavily influenced and controlled by the Chinese government,” said Chen. “So it’s very unlikely you’ll come across much content on TikTok that supports liberal democracy.” Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu",

    "title": "Weather tracker: Fierce thunderstorms and big hailstones hit parts of Europe",
    "article_text": "This week, large parts ofEuropehave been affected by a series of intense thunderstorms, bringing torrential rain, damaging winds and large hail. CentralFrancewas particularly badly affected by the severe weather, as powerful storm systems swept south-westward across the country. The departments of Loire and Puy-de-Dôme were among the hardest hit, experiencing significant damage from a particularly violent supercell thunderstorm that produced hailstones measuring up to 6cm in diameter – larger than ping-pong balls. The storm system also generated flash flooding, strong wind gusts, and reports of a localised “mini-tornado”, leaving widespread damage to infrastructure and vehicles in its wake. The storms were fuelled by warm, saturated air rising from the Mediterranean clashing with cooler air descending from northern Europe. This temperature contrast created significant atmospheric instability. Additionally, theorographicinfluence of the Vosges and Jura mountain ranges probably contributed to storm intensification by enhancing uplift. The powerful supercell formed under conditions of high wind shear, where changes in wind speed and direction with altitude encouraged the development of a rotating updraft. These intense updrafts lifted raindrops high into the atmosphere, where they froze and coalesced into large hailstones before falling to the ground with destructive force. Meanwhile, southernChinahas once again experienced heavy rainfall, triggering landslides, emergency evacuations, and widespread disruption to transport networks across the region. In Quanzhou County, approximately 300 cubic metres of debris, including soil and large boulders, tumbled down a hillside, blocking a major roadway and bringing traffic to a standstill. In Guilin’s Lingui district, rainfall totals exceeded 207mm on Monday alone, highlighting the severity of the ongoing weather system and its impact on the local infrastructure and communities. Canada is currently battling more than 200 active wildfires, primarily across Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with approximately 2.3 million hectares burnt, most within the past week. At least half of these fires are classified as out of control, and have led to widespread evacuations. Thick smoke from the fires has significantly reduced air quality, spreading across a third of the US, and more recently have reached Europe. Hot, dry conditions, intensified by climate change, have been worsening the situation, and are expected to help fuel the fires over the coming days.",

    "title": "Confusion and chaos reign in Tasmanian parliament with no endgame in sight",
    "article_text": "Craig Garland, the fisherman turned maverick independent MP from Tasmania’s north-western corner, summed it up best when he told state parliament on Thursday morning he was “a bit confused”. Garland wasn’t confused about what he was doing – he calmly backed a no-confidence motion in the Liberal premier, Jeremy Rockliff. But he expressed doubts about how the Tasmanian parliament got here, and what lay ahead. Based on the reaction online and on talkback radio, many Tasmanians agree. From the outside – and to many on the inside – the events in parliament this week look like a form of collective madness that was entirely avoidable and, despite all the strong words, largely pointless. The vote of no-confidence in Rockliff, moved by the Labor leader Dean Winter, passed on Thursday afternoon by the barest of margins: 18-17. It has pushed the state to the brink of a fresh election just 15 months sincethe last one. Bizarrely, the state finds itself in this position despite all the major players – Liberals, Labor and the Greens – declaring loudly that an election is a bad idea and should not happen. Each had the power to prevent one. Which is not to say all are equally to blame. We need to briefly rewind 15 months.On 23 March last year, Tasmanians chose what some have called a rainbow parliament, and others have described as chaos: 14 Liberals, 10 Labor, five Greens, three MPs from the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) and three independents. No party was close to the 18 seats needed for a majority government, but the Liberals had a clear plurality of support. Winter declined to try to lead the state despite the crossbench being made up largely of progressive MPs, declaring he would never deal with the Greens. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Rockliff won a promise of support on confidence and budget supply from JLN and the independent David O’Byrne, a former Labor leader, who would prefer an ALP government but wanted the parliament to work. In the months that followed JLN fell apart and the government’s position became more precarious. The sole remaining JLN MP, Andrew Jenner,refused to vote for a budgetreleased in September, breaking his commitment to ensure the government survived. The then treasurer and deputy premier, Michael Ferguson,was forced to resign and move to the backbenchwhen he faced what would have been a successful no-confidence vote over mismanagement of new Spirit of Tasmania ferries. And the Greens moved two no-confidence motions in Rockliff – one over a shelved gambling harm minimisation promise, the other overa controversial AFL stadium planned for Macquarie Point, on Hobart’s waterfront. Despite the noise, the premier appeared relatively safe. Just last month, Labor argued the stateneeded a period of stability. That changed on Tuesday, when Winter surprised observers bytabling a no-confidence motion at the end of a budget reply speech, and declaring he would move it when it was clear it had enough support. It was a dare to both the crossbench and the government. But it was a tactic without a clear endgame. The motion was ostensibly about the budget, arguing Rockliff had wrecked the state’s finances, planned to sell public assets and had mismanaged the ferries. Handed down five days earlier, the budget had beenwidely criticisedfor increasing debt and spending, and failing to provide solutions to structural problems. Some government supporters said it was the worst they had seen. But the opposition leader did not make a case for what Labor would do differently, and did not make a pitch to become premier if the no-confidence motion carried. The goal was to either push the Greens to side with Rockliff to prevent chaos or, more likely, claim the premier’s scalp by forcing the Liberals to replace him, almost certainly with someone less popular. Neither happened. The motion quickly won backing on Tuesday from Garland, Jenner, and the independent Kristie Johnston (who had backed earlier no-confidence motions). The Greens declared their support after meeting on Wednesday morning. But the Greens did not want the motion to just be about the budget. The minor party tried to amend it to include a rejection of the stadium – one of the biggest issues dominating public debate in the state over the past year given the likely $1bn-plus cost, and because admission of the Tasmania Devils to the AFL hinges on it being built. Their leader, Rosalie Woodruff, alsooffered to work with Labor to try to form an alternative government. Both steps were rejected. The Greens knew they would be. They backed the motion anyway. Some commentary over the past week assumed the motion would lead to a Labor-Greens minority government. But the relationship between the two parties in the state is hostile, and they are ideologically miles apart. Winter’s defining position since becoming Labor leader last year has been to argue for “traditional industries” – including native forest logging, salmon farming and mining – and to reject suggestions he would work with the minor party. Winter did not speak with crossbenchers before tabling the no-confidence motion, and Labor and the Greens mostly voted against Rockliff for different reasons. Sign up toFive Great Reads Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Saturday morning after newsletter promotion There is deep history to this. Labor and the Greens fell out after governing in partnership from 2010 to 2014, a period in which two Greens held ministries. The relationship has become more distant under Winter, who is close to the former premier Paul Lennon, an assertively pro-industry and anti-green figure. It doesn’t take much analysis to realise this raises questions about whether Labor can form government anytime soon, given it has lost four straight elections and has less than a third of seats in the state’s lower house. It continues to argue it could win a majority. Labor and the Greens are also sharply divided over the stadium, which has become the most politically charged issue facing the state and driven significant public resentment against the government. Polls suggest a majority of the public are opposed to it in every electorate, especially in the state’s parochial north. But the stadium has the support of both major parties – not least because neither wants to stand accused of killing thelong-held dream of a Tasmanian AFL team, which still has overwhelming public support. There is a compelling case that a new stadium will be needed in the state’s capital for the club to be a success. But the state government spectacularly stuffed up the argument. It signed a lopsided deal under which the AFL pays a meagre $15m of the direct funding for the stadium’s construction. Predictably, the cost of the stadium to taxpayershas blown out beyond Rockliff’s initial pledgeit would be capped at $375m. And thesite itself is controversial. The premier has broken promises on the issue, including introducing legislation to circumvent a drawn out independent assessment process. Meanwhile, the AFL has refused to budge from its line – no stadium at Macquarie Point, no team. Critics including most non-major party MPs accuse the government of caving to AFL pressure, point to crises on housing, health and the budget, and argue a stadium cannot be justified. Some have claimed, without obvious evidence, that the AFL could be forced to redraw the deal. Some vocal critics don’t care if the state has a team. Butthat’s not where most of the public is. It’s a mess that has hurt the government, but doesn’t necessarily win support for Labor. As the no-confidence motion was debated, Tasmania Devils executive Kath McCannbroke down at a press conferenceas she argued the future of the club was uncertain if Rockliff was removed. While it wasn’t the subject of the no-confidence motion, you could make a decent case that the stadium – including the AFL’s refusal to accommodate genuinely held Tasmanian concerns – will cost Rockliff his job. But that hasn’t happened yet, and it is not clear if it will. The Liberals have backed Rockliff, for now at least, rather than replace him with one of a list of potential contenders. Liberal MPs have argued the budget was backed by the government, not just Rockliff, and supported his push for an early election if the no-confidence motion was passed. They may yet change their minds. Business leaders warn an election would hurt confidence and stall investment. Some senior Liberal figureshave urged the parliamentary party elect a new leaderto avoid forcing Tasmanians vote again. The parliament has to return on Tuesday to pass a short-term supply bill before Rockliff plans to speak with the governor, Barbara Baker, so they have a few days to work it out. If there is an election, it is difficult to see either major party approaching a majority of seats. Themost recent ERMS pollhad Labor on 31% support, ahead of the Liberals, who fell five percentage points to just 29%. But 37% said they preferred someone else. This doesn’t bode well for the major parties, which have struggled to come to grips with the reality ofan expanded 35-member parliamentin which no one has control. The Liberals failed to maintain the support of enough MPs. Labor has done little to develop a relationship with the crossbench. Tasmanians might soon tell them that’s not good enough, and to try again.",

    "title": "Should Sydney’s light rail carriages be modified after second death in two years?",
    "article_text": "For the second time in two years, a pedestrian has died after being struck by a tram on Sydney’s light rail. New South Wales police said they found a man under a tram carriage in Surry Hills on Thursday afternoon. Paramedics treated him at the scene, but he died. Police said initial inquiries showed the man was attempting to cross the light rail track between two carriages when the tram began moving and trapped him. In May 2023, a teenage girl died after attempting to cross a street in Sydney’s CBD between two tram carriages. She became trapped underneath one of them when the tram started moving, suffering fatal injuries. That two similar deaths occurred just two years apart meant police, the premier, and transport bureaucrats fielded questions from the media this week over whether the light rail network, and the trams themselves, should be made safer. Dr Geoffrey Clinton, a senior lecturer in transport management at the University of Sydney, said it was “probably wise” for the government to investigate additional safety measures to stop people from attempting to climb over them. Sydney’s light rail network uses a few different tram models – what bureaucrats call “rolling stock”. What they have in common is that they typically have separate carriages that are coupled together to form a longer vehicle, unlike trams in Melbourne, which have only one carriage. Many of the trams now have “danger” signs on the joinery between the carriages, warning people not to try to climb over them. Clinton said the state government or the network’s private operator, Transdev, could consider additional signage. “Or even something like a net between the two carriages to discourage people from trying to clamber through,” he said. He posed the idea of running the trams twice as frequently with only one carriage, making them half as long, but said it didn’t “seem like a feasible solution”. “[That] would very expensive to do and wouldn’t add to the capacity of the network, but it would double the labour cost,” he said. The transport minister, John Graham, declined to comment. ATransportfor New South Wales (TfNSW) spokesperson said the man’s death was “extremely distressing”. The NSW police inspector Anderson Lessing on Thursday said that after speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV, it appeared the man had stepped between the tram carriages off the platform at the light rail stop on Devonshire Street. “There’s obviously risk involved, but it comes back to personal responsibility when you do cross the tram line, and it’s that balance that we have to get right,” he said. The TfNSW coordinator-general, Howard Collins, expressed his condolences to the man’s family and first responders. He said the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator (ONRSR) would work with Transdev to establish whether any safety recommendations could be made or whether the death was “a case of really unfortunate misadventure”. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The ONRSR also reviewed the 2023 light rail death. On Friday, there was some confusion between the government and Transdev over whether the operator had received a report from the regulator. ONRSR later confirmed its investigation reports were not released to operators. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The Australian Transport Safety Bureau and NSW Office of Transport Safety Investigations said they had not reviewed the 2023 death and would not to review Thursday’s one either. “[We] have reviewed the initial available information and determined that, as in the 2023 occurrence … it is unlikely an independent transport safety investigation would identify any new or unknown transport safety factor that could prevent an incident of this nature from occurring in the future,” a spokesperson said. The premier,Chris Minns, said he was sorry for the man and his family, but he wouldn’t be drawn on whether the government was considering any safety upgrades. “The safety regulator’s in place,” he said. “It’s obviously the case that whenever there’s a terrible event like this, a terrible incident, they conduct an investigation.” Terry Lee-Williams, a transport planning strategist, said it was “awful that somebody died”, but overall, Sydney’s light rail network was safe and “actually quite a low speed system”. One suggestion for improving safety could be replacing the trams with the concertina-like ones used in Melbourne, he said, but this would be costly. He said Sydney’s trams were a “standard design” and similar to those operated in many European countries. “You don’t see much of the Melbourne-style trams around the world because they’re less accessible,” he said. “Sydney has very narrow, windy streets.”",

    "title": "Wintery long weekend to deliver snowy start to Australia’s ski season",
    "article_text": "The King’s birthday long weekend could be the snowiest start to an Australian ski season in years, forecasters predict. Weatherzone said up to 70cm of snow could accumulate at the higher resorts by Tuesday evening, with at least 15cm to 30cm at lower resorts. A strong cold front in the Great Australian Bight will move in overnight, weatherzone meteorologists said, bringing with it dumps of snow. Jonathan How, from the Bureau of Meteorology, said south-east Australia can expect “very cold” and windy conditions over the three-day weekend. Melbourne is forecast for a high of 15C on Saturday and a low of 6C on Monday. The weekend in Sydney should be mostly sunny with possible showers, with expectations of a high of 19C on Saturday followed by 8C on Monday, the bureau said. On Friday, a severe weather warning was issued forSouth Australiaand south-west Victoria. Rain is predicted to break a record drought for the region. Damaging winds could top 90km/h on Friday, impacting parts ofVictoria, including the Otway ranges and Mornington Peninsula. Gusts are predicted to increase and move into South Australia on Friday afternoon, reaching Adelaide and the Mount Lofty ranges. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The strong winds will continue on Saturday through Victoria and SA, the bureau said. The coldest weather will arrive in a second cold front, which will reach SA potentially on Sunday morning, bringing thunderstorms and hail. Adelaide has a predicted high of 17C on Saturday and low of 6C on Monday. Melbourne will not be impacted by the damaging winds on Friday, but the city will experience a strong wind chill and showers that will also reach the Yarra Valley and Macedon Ranges. The cold front will move into south-east NSW by Friday evening. How cautioned black ice will pose a risk over the weekend across NSW and Victoria. “Take care if you are heading up to the slopes this weekend for the snow,” he said. Snow showers are predicted across the alps of Victoria and NSW, with snow levels in those regions predicted to drop to 1,500m by Friday.Snowlevels will fall further on Saturday to about 1,150m. How said he expected high snow accumulation between 30cm and 70cm around alpine ski resorts, with the potential to move to lower regions. “We may even see some blizzard conditions across some of those alpine peaks,” he said. On Sunday, snow levels are expected to fall to 800m in Victoria and NSW and 900m in western Victoria, including the Grampians. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion In Tasmania the snow level is predicted to drop to 1,000m on Saturday. Hobart is set for a chilly low of 4C on Sunday and maximum of 15C on Saturday. Despite what looks to be a snowy beginning to the ski season,a warm winter is forecast for Australia. Professor Emeritus David Karoly, from the University of Melbourne and the Australian Climate Council, said there is clear evidence of snow cover declining and snow season length reducing due to global warming. “It’s long-term warming due to human-caused climate change from burning fossil fuels,” he said. Karoly said last year’s snow season started similarly to this year, with relatively good snow early on, but due to high temperatures and low snowfall there was not enough to maintain snow for the whole season. He said the impact of climate change from Australian and global emissions, with a new world record for climate pollution set in 2024, will cause continued decline in snow cover and snow season length until at least2050 – the current target date for net zero emissions. “By that stage there will be very, very few commercially viable ski areas in Australia even with increases in snowmaking on the resorts,” he said. He said lack of action from powerful countries like the US to reduce their emissions and the Australian government’s expansion of the North West Shelf pas project “will make it virtually impossible to meet its commitments for zero emissions by 2050”.",

    "title": "Russia is at war with Britain and US is no longer a reliable ally, UK adviser says",
    "article_text": "Russia is at war with Britain, the US is no longer a reliable ally and the UK has to respond by becoming more cohesive and more resilient, according to one of the three authors of the strategic defence review. Fiona Hill, from County Durham, became the White House’s chief Russia adviser during Donald Trump’s first term and contributed to the British government’s strategy. She made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian. “We’re in pretty big trouble,” Hill said, describing the UK’s geopolitical situation as caught between “the rock” of Vladimir Putin’s Russia and “the hard place” of Donald Trump’s increasingly unpredictable US. Hill, 59, is perhaps the best known of the reviewers appointed by Labour, alongside Lord Robertson, a former Nato secretary general, and the retired general Sir Richard Barrons. She said she was happy to take on the role because it was “such a major pivot point in global affairs”. She remains a dual national after living in the US for more than 30 years. “Russia has hardened as an adversary in ways that we probably hadn’t fully anticipated,” Hill said, arguing that Putin saw the Ukraine war as a starting point to Moscow becoming “a dominant military power in all of Europe”. As part of that long-term effort, Russia was already “menacing the UK in various different ways,” she said, citing “the poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations, all kinds of cyber-attacks and influence operations. The sensors that we see that they’re putting down around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables.” The conclusion, Hill said, was that “Russia is at war with us”. The foreign policy expert, a longtime Russia watcher, said she had first made a similar warning in 2015, in a revised version of a book she wrote about the Russian president with Clifford Gaddy, reflecting on the invasion and annexation of Crimea. “We said Putin had declared war on the west,” she said. At the time, other experts disagreed, but Hill said events since had demonstrated “he obviously had, and we haven’t been paying attention to it”. The Russian leader, she argues, sees the fight in Ukraine as “part of a proxy war with the United States; that’s how he has persuadedChina,North KoreaandIranto join in”. Putin believed that Ukraine had already been decoupled from the US relationship, Hill said, because “Trump really wants to have a separate relationship with Putin to do arms control agreements and also business that will probably enrich their entourages further, though Putin doesn’t need any more enrichment”. When it came to defence, however, she said the UK could not rely on the military umbrella of the US as during the cold war and in the generation that followed, at least “not in the way that we did before”. In her description, the UK “is having to manage its number one ally”, though the challenge is not to overreact because “you don’t want to have a rupture”. This way of thinking appears inthe defence reviewpublished earlier this week, which says “the UK’s longstanding assumptions about global power balances and structures are no longer certain” – a rare acknowledgment in a British government document of how far and how fast Trumpism is affecting foreign policy certainties. The review team reported to Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, and the defence secretary, John Healey. Most of Hill’s interaction were with Healey, however, and she said she had met the prime minister only once – describing him as “pretty charming … in a proper and correct way” and as “having read all the papers”. Hill was not drawn on whether she had advised Starmer or Healey on how to deal with Donald Trump, saying instead: “The advice I would give is the same I would give in a public setting.” She said simply that the Trump White House “is not an administration, it is a court” in which a transactional president is driven by his “own desires and interests, and who listens often to the last person he talks to”. She added that unlike his close circle, Trump had “a special affinity for the UK” based partly on his own family ties (his mothercame from the Hebridean island of Lewis, emigrating to New York aged 18) and an admiration for the royal family, particularlythe late queen. “He talked endlessly about that,” she said. On the other hand, Hill is no fan of the populist right administration in the White House and worries it could come to Britain if “the same culture wars” are allowed to develop with the encouragement of Republicans from the US. She noted that Reform UK had won a string of council elections last month, including in her native Durham, and that the party’s leader, Nigel Farage, wanted to emulate some of the aggressive efforts to restructure government led by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) before his falling-out with Trump. “When Nigel Farage says hewants to do a Dogeagainst the local county council, he should come over here [to the US] and see what kind of impact that has,” she said. “This is going to be the largest layoffs in US history happening all at once, much bigger than hits to steelworks and coalmines.” Hill’s argument is that in a time of profound uncertainty, Britain needs greater internal cohesion if it is to protect itself. “We can’t rely exclusively on anyone any more,” she said, arguing that Britain needed to have “a different mindset” based as much on traditional defence as on social resilience. Some of that, Hill said, was about a greater recognition of the level of external threat and initiatives for greater integration, by teaching first aid in schools or encouraging more teenagers to join school cadet forces, a recommendation of the defence review. “What you need to do is get people engaged in all kinds of different ways in support of their communities,” she said. Hill said she saw that deindustrialisation and a rise of inequality in Russia and the US had contributed to the rise in national populism in both countries. Politicians in Britain, or elsewhere, “have to be much more creative and engage people where they are at” as part of a “national effort”, she said. If this seems far away from a conventional view of defence, that’s because it is, though Hill also argues that traditional conceptions of war are changing as technology evolves and with it what makes a potent force. “People keep saying the British army has the smallest number of troops since the Napoleonic era. Why is the Napoleonic era relevant? Or that we have fewer ships than the time of Charles II. The metrics are all off here,” she said. “The Ukrainians are fighting with drones. Even though they have no navy, they sank a third of the Russian Black Sea fleet.” Her aim, therefore, is not just to be critical but to propose solutions. Hill recalled that a close family friend, on hearing that she had taken on the defence review, had told her: “‘Don’t tell us how shite we are, tell us what we can do, how we can fix things.’ People understand that we have a problem and that the world has changed.”",

    "title": "EU agrees to increase flight delay times before passengers get compensation",
    "article_text": "EU countries have agreed to increase the amount of time aircraft passengers are delayed before they can qualify for compensation. Passengers on short-haul flights would have to be delayed by four hours or more before they could claim compensation, under the plans. For long-haul flights delays would have to be six or more hours. Current EU rules dictate that passengers can ask for compensation if their flight is delayed for more than three hours. The EU countries also agreed to increase the amount of compensation for those delayed on short-haul flights from €250 (£211) to €300, but plan to reduce compensation for long-haul flights from €600 to €500. The revision of the EU’s air passenger rights was initially proposed in 2013 by the European Commission. It has taken 12 years of negotiations for member states to reach an agreement on changes to the timeframe for compensation, and the plans still have to be negotiated with the European parliament before they become law. The European Consumer Organisation, the BEUC, said the plan would deprive “the majority of passengers from their compensation rights”, as most delays are between two and four hours. The trade body Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents companies such as Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa, also condemned the plan because it wanted delay times to be even longer before compensation payments kick in. Ourania Georgoutsakou, the A4E managing director, said: “Europe has been waiting for transparent and workable passenger rights for 12 years and member states have fallen at the final hurdle to deliver. “Rather than providing delay thresholds of five and nine hours that would save up to 70% of rescuable cancelled flights, member states have diluted the European Commission’s original proposal and introduced even more complexity.” The European Commission’s initial plan included extending the time to five hours for short-haul flights and nine for long-haul. The agreement also includes a “right to be rerouted” when there are long delays, automating forms for compensation and stronger rights for passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Philippe Tabarot, the French transport minister, said he was pleased with the agreement. He wrote on X: “The text could have been more ambitious, but it is an important step towards improving the quality of service offered to air passengers.” The UK has its own rules on air passenger rights, based on EU regulation. Under these rules, airlines must compensate passengers if their flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late and extraordinary circumstances did not cause the delay. For short-haul flights under 1,500km (932 miles), passengers can be compensated up to £220. This rises to £350 for medium-haul flights between 1,500km and 3,500km. For long-haul flights of more than 3,500km, delayed passengers can be paid up to £520, although this can be lowered to £260 if the passenger arrives at the destination with a delay of less than four hours. However, an EU official said its changes could affect British travellers too, as it applies to passengers taking flights with an EU carrier. This means it could affect a passenger travelling to and from an EU country on an EU airline.",

    "title": "Russia bombards Kyiv after Putin vows revenge for Operation Spiderweb",
    "article_text": "Russia launched an intense missile and drone barrage at Kyiv overnight after Vladimir Putin vowed to respond to Ukraine’sOperation Spiderwebattack on some of the Kremlin’s nuclear-capable bombers. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched more than 400 drones and more than 40 missiles atUkraine, as he urged allies to build pressure on the Kremlin to end its war. Four people were killed, including three emergency workers in Kyiv. The Ukrainian president wrote in a social media post: “If someone does not put pressure and gives the war more time to take lives, they are complicit and responsible. We need to act decisively.” Missiles and drones hammered the Ukrainian capital leading fires to rage through residential buildings and forcing the local metro system to close after a train was hit. It was part of a nationwide assault that ranks among the largest coordinated attacks in the three years of full-scale war, with 44 ballistic and cruise missiles and 407 drones launched. About 50 people were injured across the country. Yurii Ihnat, the Ukrainian air force spokesperson, said Ukrainian forces had shot down about 30 of the cruise missiles and up to 200 of the drones. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had carried out the overnight attacks in response to what it called Ukrainian “terrorist acts” againstRussia. The Kremlin later described its three-year invasion of Ukraine as “existential” for Russia, casting it as nothing short of a battle for the “future” of Russia. “For us it is an existential issue, an issue on our national interest, safety, on our future and the future of our children, of our country,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters, responding to remarks by Trump on Thursday comparing Moscow and Kyiv to brawling children. On Friday night Trump was more critical of Ukraine, telling reporters on Air Force One that Operation Spiderweb had “given Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them”. Despite the efforts of Ukraine’s air defences, the authorities in Kyiv reported that three emergency workers had been killed and 20 people wounded, of whom 16 had been hospitalised. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing at several locations,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram. According to the ministry of internal affairs, the three victimswere firefightersfrom the state emergency service who died while responding to the attack. “They were working under fire to help people,” the ministry said in a statement. Operation of the city’s metro transport system was disrupted after a Russian strike damaged a train travelling between stations, the city’s military administration said. The air attack also triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of Kyiv, authorities said. A residential block in the Solomianskyi district took severe damage to the upper floors with entire windows, balcony frames, and parts of an outer wall blown away. More than 2,000 households in Kyiv’s eastern bank remained without electricity on Friday morning. Russia had previouslyvowed to take revengeon Ukraine after Monday’s audacious drone attack, known as Operation Spiderweb, on its bomber fleet. Initially, two TU-95MC and two TU-160MC bombers were deployed by Russia on Thursday night. This was a lower number than had been feared and may have been the result of the Kremlin’s resources being reduced by the events of 1 June. Kalibr missiles were also fired from Russian warships stationed in the Black Sea. Putin informed the US president, Donald Trump, in a call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the operation that Ukraine has claimed damaged or destroyed 41 aircraft. “They went deep into Russia and [Putin] actually told me we have no choice but to attack based on that, and it’s probably not going to be pretty,” Trump had told reporters. Trump said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia“fight for a while”rather than pursue peace immediately. Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Istanbul on Monday with no headway to a truce, but the two sides signalled progress on other issues, including the transfer of captives and bodies. The barrage on Kyiv had begun with the buzz of Russian kamikaze drones followed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft fire. Through the night the city was shaken by large explosions. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city. One unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze. Tkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. Drone fragments were found in three districts. Ukraine’s commissioner for human rights, Dmytro Lubinets, demanded a strong international response to Russia’s latest attack. “Russia is acting like a terrorist, systematically targeting civilian infrastructure,” he wrote on Telegram. “The world must respond clearly and take concrete steps, including condemning the aggressor’s actions.” Elsewhere in the country, 10 people were reported injured in the western city of Ternopil, including five emergency workers, said the regional governor, Viacheslav Nehoda. Three people were injured in Ukraine’s central Poltava region after strikes on administrative buildings, warehouses and a cafe. Russian forces also struck the Khmelnytskyi region, damaging a private residential building, outbuildings, and several vehicles. Air defence forces shot down three Russian missiles in the western Lviv region overnight, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi.",

    "title": "Netanyahu defends arming Palestinian clans accused of ties with jihadist groups",
    "article_text": "The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has admitted arming clans in Gaza that he says are opposed to Hamas, after allegations that members of these criminal gangs looted humanitarian aid and have ties to jihadist groups. The admission came after Israeli media reports quoted defence sources as saying Netanyahu had authorised giving weapons to a clan reportedly led by a man known as Yasser Abu Shabab, a Rafah resident from a Bedouin family, known locally for his involvement in criminal activity.Israelallegedly provided Abu Shabab’s group, which calls itself the “Anti-Terror Service”, with Kalashnikov assault rifles, including weapons seized from Hamas. “On the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas. What’s wrong with that?” Netanyahu said in a shortvideohe posted on social media. “It only saves the lives of Israeli solders, and publicising this only benefits Hamas.” Strong criticism of the initiative has come from opposition parties in Israel. In a social media post on X, Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, said: “Netanyahu is a threat to Israel’s national security. Instead of bringing about a deal … bringing the hostages home and providing security for Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking timebomb inGaza.” Palestinians in Gaza marked the start of Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s most important holidays, on Friday with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes and food supplies dwindling. Food distribution points run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reopened on Friday before closing a few hours later. Work at the sites was previously halted this week in response to a series of deadly shootings by Israeli soldiers that on Tuesday killed 27 Palestinians and injured hundreds as they were waiting for food. The UN says more than 2,700 children in Gaza are suffering fromacute malnutrition. Israeli jets meanwhile continued to pound the territory and, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 38 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military on Friday, including 11 in a single strike in the north. Israel said four soldiers were killed in combat. On Thursday, after the allegations on arming Hamas-opposed clans in Gaza circulated in the media, Netanyahu’s office said Israel “was working to defeatHamasthrough various means, based on the recommendations of all the heads of the security establishment”. The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with Islamic State. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio. The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was unclear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Abu Shabab’s involvement with Israeli troops was confirmed last week through several videos circulating on social media in Gaza, showing him operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas. Last week, Abu Shabab’s family issued a statement disowning him, accusing him of collaborating with Israeli forces. “We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said. “We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.” On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupiedPalestinian territories, said: “The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.” When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab”. On several posts on Facebook, reported by local media, Abu Shabab denied the allegations of looting, saying he was taking the goods only to feed himself and his family. Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war. Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza. Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began. The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”. Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government. To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises. Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondent Despite nationwide protests demanding a ceasefire deal and the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s coalition remains solid, buoyed up by the steadfast support of far-right parties. That unity may soon be tested, however, after the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in Netanyahu’s coalition announced it would support dissolving the Knesset. The Shas party’s decision comes after no significant progress in advancing a law in effect exempting ultra-Orthodox citizens from the military draft. Israel has mandatory army service but for decades made anexemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study. But an alternative plan seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists, while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students. Due to the war in Gaza, the IDF is saying yeshiva students must be drafted, as it urgently needs an additional 10,000 combat soldiers and about 3,000 soldiers for other roles. .",

The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, will represent the US side in the trade talks. “The meeting should go very well,” Trump wrote on his social media platform on Friday afternoon. The conversation between Trump and Xi, who lead the world’s two biggest economies, lasted about an hour and a half, according to Trump. The Chinese foreign ministry has said Trump initiated the call. The ministry said Xi asked Trump to “remove the negative measures” that the US has taken againstChina.

    "article_text": "The high court has told senior lawyers to take urgent action to prevent the misuse ofartificial intelligenceafter dozens of fake case-law citations were put before the courts that were either completely fictitious or contained made-up passages. Lawyers are increasingly using AI systems to help them build legal arguments, but two cases this year were blighted by made-up case-law citations that were either definitely or suspected to have been generated by AI. In a £89m damages case against the Qatar National Bank, the claimants made 45 case-law citations, 18 of which turned out to be fictitious, with quotes in many of the others also bogus. The claimant admitted using publicly available AI tools and his solicitor accepted he cited the sham authorities. When Haringey Law Centre challenged the London borough of Haringey over its alleged failure to provide its client with temporary accommodation, its lawyer cited phantom case law five times. Suspicions were raised when the solicitor defending the council had to repeatedly query why they could not find any trace of the supposed authorities. It resulted in a legal action for wasted legal costs and a court found the law centre and its lawyer, a pupil barrister, were negligent. The barrister denied using AI in that case but said she may have inadvertently done so while using Google or Safari in preparation for a separate case where she also cited phantom authorities. In that case she said she may have taken account of AI summaries without realising what they were. In aregulatory rulingresponding to the cases on Friday, Dame Victoria Sharp, the president of the King’s bench division, said there were “serious implications for the administration of justice and public confidence in the justice system if artificial intelligence is misused” and that lawyers misusing AI could face sanctions, from public admonishment to facing contempt of court proceedings and referral to the police. She called on the Bar Council and the Law Society to consider steps to curb the problem “as a matter of urgency” and told heads of barristers’ chambers and managing partners of solicitors to ensure all lawyers know their professional and ethical duties if using AI. “Such tools can produce apparently coherent and plausible responses to prompts, but those coherent and plausible responses may turn out to be entirely incorrect,” she wrote. “The responses may make confident assertions that are simply untrue. They may cite sources that do not exist. They may purport to quote passages from a genuine source that do not appear in that source.” Ian Jeffery, the chief executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, said the ruling “lays bare the dangers of using AI in legal work”. “Artificial intelligence tools are increasingly used to support legal service delivery,” he added. “However, the real risk of incorrect outputs produced by generative AI requires lawyers to check, review and ensure the accuracy of their work.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The cases are not the first to have been blighted by AI-created hallucinations.

The investigation has so far involved a large-scale search operation, including the use of helicopters, divers, and specialist digital and financial investigators. Police said almost 400 people had been spoken to as part of door-to-door inquiries, and more than 2,000 hours of CCTV footage had been reviewed.

    "article_text": "Campaigners have accused ministers of lying to parliament and the creative industries after the government signalled it would not force AI companies to disclose how they train their models. Ministers are holding firm in a standoff with theHouse of Lords, which has called for artists to be offered immediate copyright protection against artificial intelligence companies. Peers votedby 221 to 116 on Wednesdayto insist on an amendment to the data bill that would force AI firms to be transparent about what copyrighted material they use to train their models. In an amendment tabled on Friday, the government dismissed the Lords’ request and reiterated its promise to publish an economic impact assessment and technical reports on the future of AI and copyright regulation. Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peer and film director who has campaigned on behalf of the industry, said during Wednesday’s debate that she would “accept anything that the Commons does” after this week. “I will not stand in front of your Lordships again and press our case,” she said. But the News Media Association (NMA), which represents publishers including the Guardian, said peers could table further amendments to the data bill when it returns to the Lords next Wednesday. Industry figures said the government was acting in bad faith by not addressing the Lords’ concerns and called for it to make further amendments of its own before MPs vote on it on Tuesday. Kidron said: “The government has repeatedly taken all protections for UK copyrights holders out of the data bill. In doing so they have shafted the creative industries, and they have proved willing to decimate the UK’s second-biggest industrial sector. They have lied to parliament, and they are lying to the sector.” She said the government’s action “adds another sector to the growing number that have an unbridgeable gap of trust with the government”. Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the NMA, said: “The government’s refusal to listen to the strong view of the Lords … risks undermining the legislative process. “There is still time for the government to do the right thing, and take transparency powers in this bill. This would be a key step towards rebuilding trust with a £126bn industry.” Sign up toHeadlines UK Get the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion The government’s approach to copyright has drawn the ire of major creative artists and organisations including Paul McCartney, Kate Bush and the National Theatre, with Elton John describing the situation as an “existential issue” this week. Opponents of the plans have warned that even if the attempts to insert clauses into the data bill fail, the government could be challenged in the courts over the proposed changes. The consultation on copyright changes, which is due to produce its findings before the end of the year, contains four options: to let AI companies use copyrighted work without permission, alongside an option for artists to “opt out” of the process; to leave the situation unchanged; to require AI companies to seek licences for using copyrighted work; and to allow AI firms to use copyrighted work with no opt-out for creative companies and individuals. The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, has said the copyright-waiver-plus-opt-out scenario is no longer the government’s preferred option, but Kidron’s amendments have attempted to head off that option by effectively requiring tech companies to seek licensing deals for any content that they use to train their AI models.",

    "article_text": "TheUS supreme courton Friday allowed members of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) to access the sensitive records kept by the Social Security Administration while legal challenges play out. The conservative-majority court, in an unsigned order with the three liberal justices dissenting, sided with the Trump administration in the appeal involving Doge, the team spearheaded by the billionaireElon Musk. The high court agreed to lift an injunction issued by a federal district court judge in Maryland, writing that the social security agency “may proceed” to grant members of the Doge team “access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work”. Doge, which was created by executive order and is not an official government department, slashed its way through federal agencies as part of its mission to end the “tyranny of the bureaucracy”. Musk stepped back from his government work last month and is nowpublicly feudingwith Trump. TheTrump administrationsaid Doge needed access to the information to fulfill its goal of targeting waste and fraud in the federal government and saving taxpayer money. Musk had identified social security as an area he claimed was rife with fraud. The billionaire tech executive once said social security – which provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans, including retirees and disabled Americans – was “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”. He and Trump have repeated inaccurate claims that millions of people born over a century ago are collecting social security checks. “Today, the court grants a stay permitting the government to give unfettered data access to Doge regardless – despite its failure to show any need or any interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before we know for sure whether federal law countenances such access,” Jackson wrote in her dissent. “The court is thereby, unfortunately, suggesting that what would be an extraordinary request for everyone else is nothing more than an ordinary day on the docket for this administration.” The lawsuit was brought by labor unions and an advocacy group, which sued to block Doge from accessing the agency’s databases, which store the personal information of nearly every American, including financial information, medical history and school records. “This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,” Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs, said. “This ruling will enable President Trump and Doge’s affiliates to steal Americans’ private and personal data. Elon Musk may have left Washington DC, but his impact continues to harm millions of people. “We will continue to use every legal tool at our disposal to keep unelected bureaucrats from misusing the public’s most sensitive data as this case moves forward.” In April, Judge Ellen Hollander, of the US district court for Maryland, imposed strict restrictions on access to the records, citing the agency’s “abiding commitment to the privacy and confidentiality of the personal information entrusted to it by the American people”. “For some 90 years, [the] SSA has been guided by the foundational principle of an expectation of privacy with respect to its records,” she wrote. “This case exposes a wide fissure in the foundation.” Her order directed Doge employees, and social security employees working with them, to “disgorge and delete” any personal information already in their possession. News that the Doge team had sought access to the data raised alarms among federal workers, privacy advocates and Democrats who charged that Musk could use the information to benefit his private companies. At town halls, many constituents demanded their elected leaders protect their data from Doge.",

    "article_text": "Yoga classes are back on atSan Diegobeaches this week after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional and that teaching yoga was “protected speech”. The three-judge panel of the US ninth circuit court of appeals on Wednesday overruled a San Diego judge and decided in favor of two instructors who had sued over a law that San Diego passed in 2024 banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. “Because the ordinance targets teaching yoga, it plainly implicates [the instructors’] first amendment right to speak,” the ruling stated, finding that the ordinance violated the instructors’ rights. The city had argued the rule wasn’t specific to yoga, but commercial activity, as the instructors Steven Hubbard and Amy Baack’s free classes can draw as many as 100 people who give donations for each class ranging from $5 to $40.“The city’s legitimate governmental interests in this case include the preservation, safety, and orderly use of its parks and beaches by all visitors and residents who visit them,” San Diego’s attorneys wrote in court papers, adding that the city and county drew 32 million visitors in 2023. By Thursday, Hubbard had resumed teaching yoga to a dozen people underneath palm trees in the park at Pacific Beach. He said he was cited for his classes, which are free and open to all, at least 10 times since the ordinance took effect last year. He began holding classes on a live stream from his backyard, just across the street from the beach. Bryan Pease, a lawyer for both instructors, said a park official cited Hubbard for holding classes in the park even though he was not there.Outdoor yoga is a service to those who are disabled or cannot afford yoga classes elsewhere, said Pease.“It is a popular thing here. We’re a beach community, and it’s a way for people to access yoga that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to,” Pease said.At the Pacific Beach park, John Noack, who has attended Hubbard’s classes for four years, said he thought the group was targeted because wealthy homeowners in the area did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views.“I personally see this as a triumph of community over a handful of elites,” Noack said.",

    "title": "US Supreme Court grants DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data",
    "article_text": "The United States Supreme Court has sided with the administration of President Donald Trump in two cases about government records — and who should have access to them. On Friday, the six-member conservative majority overturned a lower court’s ruling that limited the kinds of data that Trump’sDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) could access through the Social Security Administration (SSA). In a separate case, the majority also decided that DOGE was not required to turn over records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a government transparency law. In both cases, the Supreme Court’s three left-leaning justices — Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan — opposed the majority’s decision. DOGE has been at the forefront of Trump’s campaign to reimagine the federal government and cut down on bureaucratic “bloat”. Unveiledon November 13, just eight days after Trump’s re-election, DOGE was designed to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies”. At first, it was unclear how DOGE would interact with the executive branch: whether it would be an advisory panel, a new department or a nongovernmental entity. But on January 20, when Trump was sworn in for his second term, heannouncedthat the existing US Digital Service — a technology initiative founded by former President Barack Obama — would be reorganised to create DOGE. The government efficiency panel has since led a wide-scale overhaul of the federal government, implementing mass layoffs and seeking to shutter entities like the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It also advertised cost-savings it had achieved or alleged fraud it had uncovered, though many of those claims have been contradicted or questioned by journalists and experts. In addition, DOGE’s sweeping changes to the federal government made it the subject of criticism and concern, particularly as it sought greater access to sensitive data and systems. Up until last week, DOGE was led by Elon Musk, a billionaire and tech entrepreneur who had been a prominent backer of Trump’s re-election bid. Musk and Trump, however, have hada public rupturefollowing the end of the billionaire’s tenure as a “special government employee” in the White House. That falling-out has left DOGE’s future uncertain. One of DOGE’s controversial initiatives has been its push toaccess Social Security data, in the name ofrooting outwaste, fraud and abuse. Early in Trump’s second term, both the president and Musk repeatedmisleading claimsthat Social Security payments were being made to millions of people listed as 150 years old or older. But fact-checkers quickly refuted that allegation. Instead, they pointed out that the Social Security Administration has implemented a code to automatically stop payments to anyone listed as alive and more than 115 years old. They also pointed out that the COBOL programming language flags incomplete entries in the Social Security system with birthdates set back 150 years, possibly prompting the Trump administration’s confusion. Less than 1 percent of Social Security payments are made erroneously, according to a 2024 inspector general report. Still, Trump officials criticised the Social Security Administration, with Musk dubbing it “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time” and calling for its elimination. In March, US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander blocked DOGE from having unfettered access to Social Security data, citing the sensitive nature of such information. Social Security numbers, for instance, are key to verifying a person’s identity in the US, and the release of such numbers could endanger individual privacy. Lipton Hollander ruled that DOGE had “never identified or articulated even a single reason for which the DOGE Team needs unlimited access to SSA’s entire record systems”. She questioned why DOGE had not sought a “more tailored” approach. “Instead, the government simply repeats its incantation of a need to modernize the system and uncover fraud,” she wrote in her ruling. “Its method of doing so is tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.” The judge’s ruling, however, did allow DOGE to view anonymised data, without personally identifying information. The Trump administration, nevertheless, appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that Judge Lipton Hollander had exceeded her authority in blocking DOGE’s access. The Supreme Court granted its emergency petition on Friday, lifting Lipton Hollander’s temporary restrictions on the data in an unsigned decision. But Justice Brown Jackson issued a blistering dissent (PDF), suggesting that the Supreme Court was willing to break norms to assist a presidency that was unwilling to let legal challenges play out in lower courts. “Once again, this Court dons its emergency-responder gear, rushes to the scene, and uses its equitable power to fan the flames rather than extinguish them,” Brown Jackson wrote. She argued that the Trump administration had not established that any “irreparable harm” would occur if DOGE were temporarily blocked from accessing Social Security data. But by granting the Trump administration’s emergency petition, she said the court was “jettisoning careful judicial decision-making and creating grave privacy risks for millions of Americans in the process”. The second Supreme Court decision on Friday concerned whether DOGE itself had to surrender documents under federal transparency laws. The question was raised as part of a lawsuit brought by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government watchdog group. It argued that DOGE’s sweeping powers suggested it should be subject to laws like FOIA, just like any other executive agency. But CREW also alleged that the ambiguity surrounding DOGE’s structures had kept it insulated from outside probes. “While publicly available information indicates that DOGE is subject to FOIA, the lack of clarity on DOGE’s authority leaves that an open question,” CREW said in astatement. The watchdog group sought to compel DOGE to provide information about its inner workings. While a US district judge had sided with CREW’s request for records in April, the Supreme Court on Friday paused that lower court’s decision (PDF). It sent the case back to a court of appeals for further consideration, with instructions that the April order be narrowed. “Any inquiry into whether an entity is an agency for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act cannot turn on the entity’s ability to persuade,” the Supreme Court’s conservative majority ruled. It also said that the courts needed to exercise “deference and restraint” regarding “internal” executive communications.",

    "article_text": "Top-ranked Jannik Sinner beat Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (3) to set up a French Open final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic is the men’s record 24-time Grand Slam champion but could not counter Sinner’s relentless accuracy and pounding forehands on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Friday evening. Sinner became only the second Italian man to reach the final at Roland-Garros after Adriano Panatta, the 1976 champion. Earlier, Alcaraz led 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-0, 2-0 against Lorenzo Musetti whenthe eighth-seeded Italian retired with a leg injury. Sinner is aiming for his fourth major title, Alcaraz his fifth. Djokovic fought back in the third set but wilted in the tiebreaker, somehow missing an easy smash at the net to trail 3-0 and then lost on the second match point he faced when his forehand hit the net. “These are rare and special moments,” Sinner said. “I’m very happy.” He extended his winning streak in Grand Slam tournaments to 20 matches after winning the US Open and the Australian Open. Djokovic was bidding for a record-extending 38th Grand Slam final, and eighth in Paris, where he was won three times. But he spent much of the semifinal camped behind the baseline, sliding at full stretch and grunting loudly while Sinner sent him scurrying left and right like a windscreen wiper. A cross-court two-handed backhand winner from Sinner in the ninth game of the third set was executed with such pure timing that it drew applause even from Djokovic. Sinner gave him almost no chances, but there was a glimmer of light in the 10th game, when Djokovic had four chances to break Sinner’s serve. The crowd broke out into prolonged chants of “Nole! Nole!” as Djokovic forced two break points at 15-40. Sinner saved both. Tensions were rising. The crowd started self-policing when a couple of rowdy fans shouted out as Sinner prepared to serve, telling the offenders to “Chut!” (French for shush). Djokovic’s forehand landed wide on his third break-point chance, making it deuce. The chair umpire, Damien Dumusois, came down to check the mark. Djokovic disagreed and walked over, saying, “It’s on the line.” Then Sinner came to the net and had a brief discussion with Djokovic, who lost the point but won the next with an overhead smash for a fourth set point, saved again by Sinner.",

    "title": "Deported man Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to US to face charges",
    "article_text": "A man the Donald Trump administration mistakenlydeportedto El Salvador has been brought back to the United States, where authorities say he will face criminal charges. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 29, a Salvadoran immigrant who had lived nearly half his life in Maryland before he was deported in March, faces charges of transporting undocumented migrants inside the US, according to recently unsealed court records. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Friday that Abrego Garcia was returned to the US to “face justice”. The indictment against him was filed on May 21, more than two months after he wasdeported in spite of a court order barring his removal. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, which suspected Abrego Garcia of human trafficking but ultimately issued only a warning for an expired driver’s license, according to a Department of Homeland Security report. Bondi, speaking at a news conference, said a grand jury had “found that over the past nine years, Abrego Garcia has played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring”. She said Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele agreed to return Abrego Garcia to the US after American officials presented his government with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia had been sent to El Salvador as part of a Trump scheme to move undocumented migrants it accuses of being gang members, to prison in the Central American country without due process. Bukele said in asocial media postthat his government works with the Trump administration and “of course” would not refuse a request to return “a gang member” to the US. Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, said Abrego Garcia could face up to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. But “that does not deal with the ongoing matter of whether or not he should be deported”, she added. “That’s a separate legal matter.” Abrego Garcia will have the chance to enter a plea in court and contest the charges at trial. If he is convicted, he would be deported to El Salvador after serving his sentence, Bondi said. In a statement, Abrego Garcia’s lawyer, Andrew Rossman, said it would now be up to the US judicial system to ensure he received due process. “Today’s action proves what we’ve known all along – that the administration had the ability to bring him back and just refused to do so,” said Rossman, a partner at law firm Quinn Emanuel. Abrego Garcia’s deportation defied an immigration judge’s 2019 order granting him protection from being sent back to El Salvador, where it found he was likely to be persecuted by gangs if returned, court records show. Trump critics pointed to the erroneous deportation as an example of the excesses of the Republican president’s aggressive approach to stepping up deportations. Officials countered by alleging that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His lawyers have denied that he was a gang member and said he had not been convicted of any crime. Abrego Garcia’s case hasbecome a flash pointfor escalating tensions between the executive branch and the judiciary, which has ruled against a number of Trump’s policies. The US Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return, with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the government had cited no basis for what she called his “warrantless arrest”. US District Judge Paula Xinis also opened a probe into what, if anything, the Trump administration did to secure his return, after his lawyers accused officials of stonewalling their requests for information.",

    "title": "Trump announces second round of US trade talks with China next week",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump has announced a new round of trade talks with China in an apparent bid to dial down a bitter battle over tariffs between the world’s two biggest economies. The president said on social media that the meeting would take place in London on Monday, his announcement coming one day after a rare leader-to-leaderphone callwith Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to calm rising tensions. “The meeting should go very well,” said Trump in a post on his Truth Social platform, adding that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would meet the Chinese team. The talks will mark the second round of negotiations between the two countries since Trump launched his trade war this year, targeting China with levies of up to 145 percent. Beijing struck back with countermeasures of 125 percent. Following talks in Geneva last month, both sides agreed to temporarily bring down the triple-digit tariffs, with US tariffs cooling to 30 percent and China’s to 10 percent. But the temporary halt is expected to expire in early August and Trump last week accused China of violating the pact, underscoring deeper differences on both sides. US officials have accused China of slow-walking export approvals of rare earth minerals, which the country had limited after the tariff war broke out, triggering alarm among US companies. Other US concerns include allegedfentanyl trafficking, the status of democratically governed Taiwan, and China’s state-dominated, export-driven economic model. On Wednesday,Trumpsaid on Truth Social that Xi was “VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH”. However, he reported a “positive conclusion”, following his long-awaited phone call with Xi on Thursday, which likely paved the way for further high-level trade talks – though a swift resolution to the tariffs impasse remains uncertain. The Chinese foreign ministry said Xi asked Trump to “remove the negative measures” that the US has taken against China, alluding to his administration’s decision to revoke the visas ofChinese studentsstudying in the US.",

    "article_text": "Muslims around the globe are celebrating Eid al-Adha, one of the biggest holidays in the Islamic calendar that commemorates sacrifice and submission to God. The festival, running from June 6-9, honours the Prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to obey God’s command that he sacrifice his only son Ismail, ignoring the devil’s attempts to dissuade him from the act. The devil appeared before Ibrahim three times, but the prophet responded by throwing stones, driving him away. As he was about to kill his son, God stayed his hand and spared his son, giving him a lamb to sacrifice instead. The “Feast of Sacrifice” is traditionally marked by the slaughter of an animal, typically a goat, sheep, cow, bull or camel, with the meat shared among neighbours, family members and the poor. The start of the event coincides with the final rites of the annual Hajj, the once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, observed by adult Muslims. In remembrance of Ibrahim’s resistance to Satan, pilgrims at Hajj participate in a symbolic “stoning of the devil” at the Jamarat complex in Mina, near Mecca. The stoning ritual takes place at the three spots where it is said the devil tried to dissuade Ibrahim from obeying God, represented by three concrete walls. Pilgrims collected their pebbles overnight on Thursday from Muzdalifah, an area located a few kilometres away from Arafat, a hill outside the city of Mecca with great spiritual significance. On Friday, an estimated 1.6 million-plus pilgrims stoned the devil, throwing their pebbles at the concrete walls in Mina. For some, the ritual marks a solemn moment – a complete submission to God. For others, it represents a victory over evil.",

    "title": "Russia’s Wagner mercenaries leaving Mali, Africa Corps to remain",
    "article_text": "Russia’s Wagner mercenary group says it will withdraw from Mali after more than three and a half years on the ground. The paramilitary force announced the move on Friday, claiming it had successfully completed its mission against armed groups in the West African nation. In a post on its Telegram channel, the group said that it had brought all of the country’s regional centres back under the control of the Malian military government, pushing out rebel forces and killing their commanders. But Wagner’s withdrawal from Mali does not mean the country will be without Russian fighters. Russian mercenaries will remain under the banner of the Africa Corps, a separate Kremlin-backed paramilitary group created after Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhinled a failed mutinyagainst the Russian military in June 2023. “Russia does not lose ground, but on the contrary, continues to support Bamako now at a more fundamental level,” said a statement by Africa Corps, referring to Mali’s capital city. In addition to Africa Corps, “Russian security advisers are stepping in where the mercenaries are stepping out,” said Al Jazeera’s Nicolas Haque, reporting from neighbouring Senegal. Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel programme at Germany’s Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told Reuters that while “the Russian military engagement in Mali will continue … the focus might change more to training and providing equipment and less actual fighting jihadists”. Christian Ani, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, told Al Jazeera that Africa Corps is expected to concentrate its operations around Bamako, while taking part in air strikes “from time to time against jihadist forces”. The shift in the Russian presence in Mali follows a spate of attacks in recent weeks that armed fighters say killed more than 100 Malian soldiers, as well as some mercenaries. Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an armed group in the Sahel, claimed responsibility for the violence, including one attack on Sunday that killed at least 30 soldiers at central Mali’s Boulkessi army base. Local officials told Reuters the military has since abandoned the base. Ukrainian-backed Tuareg rebels have also been behind some of the attacks on Russian mercenaries in the country, reported Haque. “They [Wagner] have realised it has cost them so much to have the boots on the ground,” said Ani of the Institute for Security Studies. Malian forces and their Russian allies have meanwhile been accused of abuses against civilians, including aFebruary attack on a convoythat killed more than 20 people believed to be Tuareg, among them children and elderly people. Such cases of “indiscriminate violence” allegedly involving Wagner forces has significantly hurt the group’s reputation, said Ani. “I think all that culminated in it … having to take a step back.”",

    "title": "Tottenham sack Postecoglou despite Europa League win",
    "article_text": "Ange Postecoglou spoke of his intense pride at his two-year stint as Tottenham Hotspur manager after it ended with him being sacked by the Premier League club. The 59-year-old Australian took the club to their first trophy for 17 years last month whenTottenham beat Manchester Unitedto win the Europa League. But the club axed him on Friday after their worst top-flight campaign since 1976-77, finishing one place above the Premier League’s relegation zone after losing 22 games. “When I reflect on my time as Manager of Tottenham Hotspur my overriding emotion is one of pride,” he said in a statement released shortly after his dismissal was confirmed. “The opportunity to lead one of England’s historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime. Sharing that experience with all those who truly love this club and seeing the impact it had on them is something I will never forget. “That night in Bilbao was the culmination of two years of hard work, dedication and unwavering belief in a dream. There were many challenges to overcome and plenty of noise that comes with trying to accomplish what many said was not possible.” Postecoglou spoke in the build-up to the Europa League final about changing the way the club is perceived, and he said his accomplishments should ensure that Tottenham will not have to wait so long for their next trophy. “We have laid foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success,” he said. “I have enormous faith in this group of players and know there is much more potential and growth in them.” While Tottenham fans were split over Postecoglou’s future, he had a message for the supporters. “I sincerely want to thank those who are the lifeblood of the club, the supporters,” he said. “I know there were some difficult times but I always felt that they wanted me to succeed and that gave me all the motivation I needed to push on. “And finally, I want to thank those who were with me every day for the last two years. A fantastic group of young men who are now legends of this football club and the brilliant coaches who never once doubted we could do something special. We are forever connected.” The 59-year-old ultimately paid the price for a horrendous Premier League season, which saw Tottenham finish 17th. “The Board has unanimously concluded that it is in the best interests of the Club for a change to take place,” Tottenham said in a statement. “Following a positive start in the 2023/24 Premier League (PL) season, we recorded 78 points from the last 66 PL games. This culminated in our worst-ever PL finish last season.” Postecoglou leaves two years to the day after his appointment and 16 days after his side beat Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao for the club’s first silverware since 2008, a win that also put them in next season’s Champions League. The former Celtic manager has had to face questions over his future for several months, yet delivered on his claim early last season that he always wins a trophy in his second season in a job. He also took Tottenham to the League Cup semifinal, but their league campaign was their worst since the last time the club suffered relegation from the top flight, in 1976-77. Several of the club’s first team have voiced their support for Postecoglou since beating United, but chairman Daniel Levy is now searching for his fifth full-time manager in six years since Mauricio Pochettino was sacked in 2019. “At times there were extenuating circumstances — injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign,” the club said. “Whilst winning the Europa League this season ranks as one of the Club’s greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.” Several managers have been linked to the Tottenham job, including Brentford’s Thomas Frank and Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner. Postecoglou will walk away with his pride intact and a handsome bonus, but his recent comment to fans at the Europa League victory parade that the third season of a TV series is always better than the second now looks hollow. It all started so well for Postecoglou. He began the 2023-24 campaign by guiding Tottenham to their best start to a top-flight season since the 1961 title-winning team. That form soon dipped, and despite finishing fifth in his first campaign, the momentum had long since gone. This season, Tottenham earned only 38 points and lost 22 top-flight matches. They managed five points from their last 12 league games, and the only win they earned during that run was against a Southampton side who narrowly avoided becoming statistically the worst team ever in the Premier League. Postecoglou has pointed to a long injury list, which denied him the likes of Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Dejan Kulusevski, Destiny Udogie, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Son Heung-min for significant periods. But while it has clearly been one of long-serving chairman Levy’s toughest calls, he has concluded that Postecoglou is not the man to lead the club forward. “We have made what we believe is the right decision to give us the best chance of success going forward, not the easy decision,” the club statement said. “We have a talented, young squad and Ange has given us a great platform to build upon. We should like to express our gratitude to him. We wish him well for the future — he will always be welcome back at our home.”",

With that declaration on Friday, the DoT paved the way for looser fuel standards and published the “Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program” (CAFE) rule. A future separate rule from the administration of President Donald Trump will revise the fuel economy requirements. “We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States. The previous administration illegally used CAFE standards as an electric vehicle mandate,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. The department’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in writing its rule last year under Biden, had “assumedsignificant numbers of EVs would continue to be producedregardless of the standards set by the agency, in turn increasing the level of standards that could be considered maximum feasible,” it said Friday. A shift away from Biden policies In January, Duffy signed an order directing NHTSA to rescind fuel economy standards issued under Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks. In a release last year,the DoT, then led by Pete Buttigieg, put in place a required fuel economy to increase by 2 percent for cars made between 2027 and 2031. At the time, the DoT said it would help saveconsumers upwards of $600 on gas every year.It was also part of the Biden administration’s plan to address climate change. “These new fuel economy standards will save our nation billions of dollars, help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and make our air cleaner for everyone. Americans will enjoy the benefits of this rule for decades to come,” then NHTSA Deputy Administrator Sophie Shulman said at the time. In June 2024, the NHTSA said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 litres per 100km) by 2031 from 39.1mpg currently for light-duty vehicles. The agency last year said the rule for passenger cars and trucks would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons, cutting fuel costs with net benefits estimated at $35.2bn. Late on Thursday, Senate Republicans proposed eliminating fines for failures to meet CAFE rules as part of a wide-ranging tax bill, the latest move aimed at making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles. Last year, Chrysler-parent Stellantis paid $190.7m in civil penalties for failing to meet US fuel economy requirements for 2019 and 2020 after paying nearly $400m for penalties from 2016 through 2019. GM previously paid $128.2m in penalties for 2016 and 2017. Stellantis said it supported the Senate Republican proposal “to provide relief while DoT develops its proposal to reset the CAFE standards … The standards are out of sync with the current market reality, and immediate relief is necessary to preserve affordability and freedom of choice.” GM declined to comment.",

    "title": "Interpol red notice issued for Ghana’s former finance minister",
    "article_text": "Ghana’s former finance minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, has been placed on Interpol’s red notice list after allegedly using public office for personal gain. Ofori-Atta, whose location remains unclear as he reportedly seeks medical treatment, is being investigated over a string of high-profile contracts relating to petroleum revenues, electricity supply and ambulance procurement. He is also under investigation over a controversial national cathedral project that swallowed tens of millions of dollars in public money yet remains little more than a hole in the ground. The red notice – a request to police worldwide to detain a suspect pending extradition – was issued four days after Ghana’s Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) re-declared the 65-year-old a wanted person after he failed to appear for a scheduled interrogation. The OSP insists Ofori-Atta must appear in person, rejecting requests from his legal team for a virtual session on medical grounds. The prosecutor’s notice, published by the state-run Ghana News Agency on Monday, stated a number of possible locations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Guyana, Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands. “We will not countenance this conduct, not in this case,” Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyebeng told local media on Monday. Frank Davies, a member of Ofori-Atta’s legal team, was cited by the news agency AFP as saying medical records had been submitted “in good faith”, but that “the office has chosen to ignore them”. “The special prosecutor is not being sensitive to the issues at hand, especially knowing that Mr Ofori-Atta is unwell and receiving treatment,” said Davies on Friday. The new administration of President John Mahama has been on the heels of former government appointees to account for their tenure in office. The attorney general is currently building 33 cases of corruption and related offences against former government appointees. Ofori-Atta served as former President Nana Akufo-Addo’s finance minister for seven years.",

    "title": "US economy adds 139,000 jobs as growth slows",
    "article_text": "Employers in the United States have slowed hiring even though they added a solid 139,000 jobs in May. While that was higher than the forecast of 133,000 jobs, it was lower than the 147,000 hires in April,  Labor Department data released on Friday showed. It also sharply revised downward the data for March and April by 95,000 jobs. The US Labor Department said the biggest gains were in the healthcare industry which added 62,000 jobs; followed by the leisure and hospitality sector which added 48,000, 30,000 of which were in food services. The social services sector followed suit, adding about 16,000 jobs. The federal government contracted 22,000 jobs. Industries including manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, transportation and warehousing showed little change as tariff anticipation spending slowed. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.2 percent. Wages ticked up slightly. The average wage grew by 15 cents or 0.4 percent. “The job market is steadily but surely throttling back. Monthly job gains are moderating, and most telling, the gains are being consistently revised lower, and not by a little bit. Indeed, after revision, monthly job gains appear to be closing in on 100,000,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told Al Jazeera. “It [the jobs report] does signal the job market and economy are increasingly fragile as the fallout from the global trade war intensifies.” Private payrolls also tumbled this month, according to payroll firm ADP in a report on Wednesday, which showed the US economy added only 37,000 jobs, the lowest in two years. Unlike the Labor Department report which lags by a few weeks, this report is more immediate. “After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, said in a release. What was particularly notable about the ADP report was the set of industries with net job losses. The manufacturing sector recorded a net loss of 3,000. Natural resources and the mining industry lost 5,000. Those losses in the goods-producing sectors were offset by a job gain of 6,000 in construction. The only substantive gains were in the leisure and hospitality sector, a notoriously low-paying sector, which added 38,000, according to ADP. Financial services followed in the gains, adding 18,000 jobs. However, those gains were offset by losses, including in education and health, which cut 13,000 jobs. The trade and transportation and utilities sector cut 4,000 jobs. Last month, the ADP report showed 62,000 jobs were added, in stark contrast to the Labor Department’s 147,000, because it is considered a more immediate measure. On Tuesday, the job openings and labour turnover survey or JOLTS report, which captures data at a significant lag to the Labor Department and ADP, showed there were 7.4 million open jobs in April, up roughly 191,000 from the month before. But just because jobs are open does not mean they are being filled, according to Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “I think that reflects some cautiousness on the part of both employers and workers,” Gould told Al Jazeera. While job openings in sectors like trade, transportation and utilities increased, hiring actually decreased. This comes as major employers have implemented hiring slowdowns and freezes across sectors. American Airlines reportedly put in place a hiring freeze for flight attendants in April amid uncertainty in the travel market. The financial services company T Rowe Price slowed down its hiring. And amid a slowdown in research grants, universities have put in place hiring freezes, most recently Johns Hopkins University, which currently has 600 National Institutes of Health-funded medical research projects under way. As Al Jazeera has previously reported,small businesses said because of the looming tariffs, they’ve had to implement hiring freezes. Hiring for small businesses declined in May by 4.4 percent compared with this time last year, according to Homebase, a payroll service provider for more than 150,000 small businesses accounting for roughly 3.8 million workers. To forecast what to expect in the jobs market moving forward, EPI’s Gould suggests a close watch on key indicators including housing starts and factory orders, which indicate that manufacturers and construction companies will need to cut jobs if trends continue. “Some of the government data [like the jobs and JOLTS report] takes a lot longer to sort of see trouble to catch that turning point and you might see it in the other measures a little bit faster, but there’s also a lot of volatility in them,” Gould said. In April, residential home construction declined by 0.9 percent, the third straight month of declines, suggesting a pullback that indicates both builders and consumers are wary about building new homes and making improvements. At the same time, orders for goods made inUS factories fell by 3.7 percentin April, according to the Census Bureau.",

    "article_text": "Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz secured a return to the French Open final after an early scare from eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who was eventually forced to retire with injury. Italian Musetti took the first set 6-4, before Alcaraz fought back to take the next two sets 7-6(3) 6-0 and lead 2-0 in the fourth before his opponent’s leg injury took hold on Friday. The Spaniard, who is attempting to become only the third man to retainhis Roland Garros titlethis century after Rafa Nadal and Gustavo Kuerten, will face either world number one Jannik Sinner or 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in Sunday’s final. “It’s never great to go through like this,” Alcaraz said, before hailing Musetti’s achievement of reaching at least the semifinals of all four elite claycourt events this year. “He’s a great player, he has had an incredible claycourt season … I wish him a speedy recovery and I’m sure we’ll be enjoying his tennis pretty soon.” Musetti twice denied Alcaraz the chance to break in the opening nine games before the 23-year-old suddenly dialled up the intensity and snatched the opening set when his Spanish opponent produced errors in a poor service game. A frustrated Alcaraz kicked his bench during the second set but finally found a way through Musetti’s dogged defence to draw level after a tiebreak and then produced a dazzling display of power and precision to dish out a bagel in the third set. Musetti, who appeared to be hampered by a left thigh issue midway through the third set, threw in the towel after two games in the fourth. “The first two sets were tough. I had chances to be up in the match, but couldn’t make the most of them,” Alcaraz added. “When I won the second set, I was relieved, and I knew that I needed to be aggressive and be myself. I was calmer. I could see clearer and I could play great tennis at the start of the third. “I’m feeling great physically. It’s been three intense weeks, but I have one more step to take. I’m playing great tennis and I have great confidence. I’ve been doing great things in this tournament, and now is the time to give 100 percent in the final.” Alcaraz said he would tune into the second semifinal on Court Philippe Chatrier to study his potential opponents. “I’m not going to miss tonight’s match, it’s one of the best we can have right now, Sinner against Djokovic,” he said. “I’m going to watch it and enjoy it and take tactics from the match.”",

    "title": "The Netherlands to hold election on October 29 after government collapse",
    "article_text": "Dutch voters will head to the polls on October 29 in snap elections triggered by the dramaticcollapse of the right-wing ruling coalition. Interior Minister Judith Uitermark announced the election date on Friday and said she would coordinate with municipalities to ensure a smooth voting process. Polls indicate a close race between the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), led by firebrand Geert Wilders, and the Labour/Green Left alliance, headed by former European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans. The centre-right VVD is trailing slightly behind, suggesting a tightly contested vote. The election was called after Wilders withdrew the PVV from the governing coalition in adispute over immigration policy, pushing Prime Minister Dick Schoof and his cabinet to resign. Wilders had accused the government of dragging its feet on implementing what was intended to be the “strictest-ever” immigration policy agreed by the four-way coalition. His decision to bring down the coalition prompted a backlash from partners, who accused him of acting out of self-interest. “We had a right-wing majority and he’s let it all go for the sake of his ego,” said Dilan Yesilgoz, leader of the VVD, which was a coalition member. “It is irresponsible to take down the government at this point,” added Nicolien van Vroonhoven, leader of the NSC, another member of the collapsed alliance. Wilders’s PVV stunned the political establishment in November 2023 bywinning 37 of the 150 seats in parliament– emerging as the largest party by a strong margin. To govern, he assembled a four-party coalition with the VVD, the farmers’ BBB party and the anticorruption NSC – but the price was to give up his ambition to become prime minister. Polling as of May 31 shows the PVV’s support has dipped slightly – from 23 percent at the time of the 2023 election to 20 percent. The Labour/Green Left alliance follows closely with 19 percent and currently holds 25 seats in the lower house of parliament, second only to the PVV. The fragmented political landscape makes the outcome difficult to predict. In the meantime, Schoof has said he and his cabinet will continue in a caretaker role until a new government is formed.",

    "title": "Jordan celebrate reaching first World Cup after win against Oman",
    "article_text": "Jordan is celebrating the qualification of its football team for a FIFA World Cup for the first time following a decisive 3-0 victory against Oman. Huge celebrations erupted as fans drove their cars through Jordan’s capital Amman late on Thursday and into Friday, honking their horns and chanting victory while others waved the national flag in triumph. “We are all with you!” and “It’s getting closer, heroes” read messages written into the night sky in a spectacular drone light show. Jordan sealed their place on the penultimate day of Asian qualifying for the 2026 tournament, which will be played in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Ali Olwin netted a hat-trick as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up to Qatar etched their name in the history books. They secured their spot in the World Cup when South Korea defeated Iraq, also on Thursday, 2-0. The royal court published pictures of King Abdullah II wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the embassy in London, where he was on a visit. I wholeheartedly congratulate the sons and daughters of our dear people on our national football team’s qualification for the World Cup finals,” he wrote on social media platform X. “This historic qualification is well-deserved by our team, which includes stars and cadres of whom we are proud. “Special thanks go to our loyal fans who have been our support and encouragement.” His Majesty King Abdullah  watches the national football team’s World Cup qualifier match against Oman, at the Jordanian embassy in London, during a working visit to Europe( Photos courtesy of Royal Court )pic.twitter.com/CI4JMurjQu — The Jordan Times (@jordantimes)June 5, 2025 Sohad Idrissi, a 48-year-old housewife who watched the game with her siblings, beamed with pride as she told AFP that her side had played “a beautiful game and deserved to qualify for the World Cup”. “Today the joy is two-fold: there is the joy of Eid al-Adha, and the joy of Nashama qualifying,” she said, using a nickname for the Jordanian team. Fadi Qalanzi, a 21-year-old university student, called the win “a dream that is finally coming true”. “Our team put on a beautiful performance, and they truly deserved to qualify,” he added. Osama al-Shreeda, a 60-year-old retired civil servant, also called it a dream come true. “I’ve been following Jordanian football since 1978, and a relative of mine used to play with the national team,” he said. “It’s a great opportunity for our team and its players to be recognised globally,” he added, calling it an achievement not just for Jordan but for the wider Arab region. “It was about time, this is a joy we’d been waiting for, for a long time,” said 55-year-old teacher Nashat Badr. For Uzbekistan, a 0-0 draw against the United Arab Emirates was enough to take the second automatic qualification spot in Group A behind Iran. With Asia now having eight guaranteed qualifiers – after just four for the 2022 edition in Qatar – Uzbekistan was a likely contender to step up. While most of its team plays in the domestic league, it includes a few Europe-based stars like Roma forward Eldor Shomurodov and Manchester City defender Abdukodir Khusanov. Jordan’s highest-profile player is winger Mousa Tamari at French club Rennes. Palestine’s 2-0 win in Kuwait kept alive their hopes of reaching their first World Cup finals. The victory, thanks to goals from Tamer Seyam and Wessam Abou Ali, means Palestine in fifth spot in Group B are one point outside the playoff qualification positions with one game to play. A win in their final match in Amman, Jordan, against Oman, who hold fourth spot and are one point ahead of Palestine, on Tuesday will see them finish above their opponents. Third and fourth positions in the three groups, in the third round of AFC qualifiers for the World Cup, progress to a fourth qualifying stage of playoffs. The top two teams from each of the three six-team groups qualify automatically for next summer’s tournament, while the teams in fifth and sixth position are eliminated. Indonesia, meantime, remain on course for a playoff finish, and only a second appearance at a World Cup finals, following their1-0 win against Chinato hold fourth spot in Group C.",

    "title": "The best robot vacuums we&#8217;ve tested for 2025",
    "article_text": "We picked the best bots you can buy right now. We picked the best bots you can buy right now. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Robot vacuums are impressive devices that will clean your floors well and — thanks to bigger batteries and better robot brains — rarely get tired of doing their job. Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor tofull-fledged home robotsthat can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. I’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you. Along with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. With top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop. Tap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock. I test robot vacuums constantly. At any time, there are seven or eight of these busy little bots roaming my floors. Alongside everyday use, I put them through a gauntlet of specific tests. This includes testing object detection and avoidance with phone chargers, socks, a pencil, and fake pet poop. I throw in Cheerios or popcorn to see if they know to vacuum that up rather than avoid it. I also run them over oatmeal and flour to see how well they pick up fine debris and have them tackle both thick and low-pile carpets. I watch to see how they handle rug tassels, skinny chair legs, and room transitions.For mopping prowess, I test them on hardwood and tile floors with dried milk, fresh OJ, and ketchup. I monitor how quickly they fill up their bin / auto-empty dock and how efficiently they use water and clean their mop pads.I also set schedules, hook them up to voice assistants, and play with any advanced features in the app. I evaluate how well they map and how easy the maps are to edit and use, as well as test and unique features such as home security camera capabilities, AI cleaning programs, and auto-mop removal.. It’s not all about suction. In my testing, the brush is also a big factor in how well a robot will clean your floors. A large rubber roller brush is much better than a small bristle brush at picking up debris. It’s also less prone to getting tangled up with hair. Two brushes are better than one, and a brush housing that has some flexibility — so it can move with the contours of the floor — is also more effective. It’s hard to find a robot vac that doesn’t have some form of mopping, but not all mops are created equal. I looked for mopping bots that could get up dried-on stains, like milk and ketchup, and scrub up small wet spills without messing themselves up. Oscillating, spinning, or vibrating mop pads clean better than bots that just drag a wet rag around, but the new self-cleaning roller mops that are beginning to appear are even more effective. Auto-carpet sensing is also important since it prevents the robot from accidentally mopping your rug. A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. The largest I’ve seen is 800ml, but anything over 500ml is decent. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots, plus the popularity of self-empty dock / charging bases, it’s getting harder to find small robot vacs with big bins. But they’re worth considering — especially if you have carpets and pets. I love self-empty docks, but sometimes you don’t have space for them, and if you like your robot to be out of sight (living under your bed or sofa), you’ll want a big bin and no dock. These are becoming standard now and coming down in price (thankfully). A self-empty dock turns the charging base for your robot into a motorized emptying station that sucks out the dirt from its bin. (Warning: this process can be loud!) This saves you from having to pull out the bin after every few runs and empty it yourself. Instead, you’ll have to replace the bag (and buy new ones) when it gets full, generally about once a month. Many robots now have a self-empty dock option you can add later, although buying them together is generally cheaper. Another nice-to-have feature, AI-powered obstacle detection helps your robot “intelligently” detect and avoid clutter (and apotential poop apocalypse if it encounters pet waste). These models use cameras (worth noting) to see objects in their path and onboard processors to “decide” how to approach them based on what they see. All AI is not created equal, however, and some are much better at this than others. The end result is that robot vacuums with AI detection are less likely to get stuck when cleaning, so you’re more likely to come home to a clean floor rather than a beached bot. A robot that maps your house will get into every nook and cranny better than one that bumps and rolls around. Mapping also lets you send the robot to clean specific rooms rather than the whole space and add virtual walls to prevent your bot from going where you don’t want it to. These are crucial if you have delicate objects or areas in your home that regularly trap robots. Most robots use variations onsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology, such aslidarorvSLAM. A good app has easy controls to stop and start your vacuum, scheduling options (including do-not disturb hours), plus good mapping features. Nice-to-have features are room-specific cleaning and settings (so you can tell your vacuum to clean the kitchen or have it mop and vacuum the kitchen but only vacuum the living room). My biggest frustration with apps is maps that are fiddly to update and / or crash and must be rebuilt constantly. Most vacuums now have voice control (see FAQs), but some offer more in-depth control, such as telling Alexa to have the robot clean twice under the dining room table. Nearly all robot vacuums can “recharge and resume” — take themselves back to their dock when they’re low and recharge before picking up where they left off. But a vacuum with at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is ideal) will clean the whole house in one go. If it takes too long, noisy robots that are constantly running will get shut off by annoyed family members who aren’t about to clean the room for you. Robot vacuums are quite an investment, and it’s important to be able to buy replacement parts to keep them going for longer and have access to good support in case your robot has a serious issue. 9 Verge Score Excellent vacuuming performanceGood sonic moppingExtendable side brush gets into corners betterVery good app Dock is still quite uglyMopping tray is hard to cleanExpensive Dustbin capacity:270ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, 20mm/Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:10,000Pa/ Remote check-in:Yes/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Dual rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts,Apple Home via Matter Roborock’sS8 MaxV Ultra($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed. The S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with theS7 MaxV Ultraand has been steadily improving it. That’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest. For $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy theRefill & Drainage Systemmodel. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with theSwitchBot S10with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it. The S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up. Roborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. It also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. Its sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners. Roborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” Roborock also sells theS8 Max Ultra(no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV. There are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good. 8 Verge Score Cheap, even with the auto-empty dockA dual mop and dustbin means no swappingRoom-specific cleaningCarpet boost Short battery lifeSlow to rechargeDocking can be spottyBasic obstacle detection Dustbin capacity:300ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:No/ Mop lift:No/Mop washing: No/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:No /Suction power:5,300Pa/Remote check-in:No/Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin. Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris. Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean. Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations. 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots. It’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin. 8 Verge Score The best mopping robotAlso good at vacuumingVery quietBig water tanks mean less refilling Middling laser-based obstacle avoidanceWonky appHuge charging dock Dustbin capacity:1L /Self-empty dock option:No /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, 12mm/Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:8,200Pa/ Remote check-in:No/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks. The Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors. Its charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks. Its charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe In fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets. Narwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test. The app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job. 8 Verge Score Self-removing mop padsMop extension reaches under edgesSelf-cleaning washboardDirt detection tech Middling AI obstacle detectionSingle rubber roller brushApp can be flaky Dustbin capacity:300ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop-lift:Yes, 20mm/Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:12,000Pa/ Remote check-in:Yes/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single, rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts The Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive. The X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you. Its signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius. While it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you Roborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features. The X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer. The X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature. 7 Verge Score Good AI-powered obstacle detectionEffective moppingExcellent valueNice dock Single rubber / bristle brushLower suction powerNo heated mop washingSome navigation issues Dustbin capacity:Unknown /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes /Mop lift:Yes, 12mm/Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying/ Mapping:Yes, lidar /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:8,000Pa /Remote check-in: No /Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Single rubber / bristle hybrid /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home The Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and theEufy X8 Proself-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection. With 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.” The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them The Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.) An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places. The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out. While its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective. The Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out. 7 Verge Score Excellent vacuumingSuperior AI obstacle detectionSmart scrub feature works wellAttractive dock that doubles as a table Small mop padLimited cleaning customizationMapping can take a long timeNavigation can be buggy Dustbin capacity:250 ml /Self-empty dock option:Yes /Auto-refill mop option:Yes/ Mop lift:Yes, up and over/Mop washing: Yes/ Mapping:Yes, vSLAM /AI-powered obstacle detection:Yes /Suction power:N/A/ Remote check-in:No/ Keep-out zones:Yes, virtual /Brush style:Dual rubber /Works with:Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol. While Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. The newest model, theCombo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). While its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and itsretractable mopping systemis handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. The Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (Thej9 Combo Plushas the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. iRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition. While its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas usevSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted. I really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get theRoomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping. Suction power ismeasured in pascals (Pa), and while most vacuums offer between 5,000 and 8,000, we’re starting to see robots with 18,000 and even 22,000Pa. Higher suction power will do a better job getting the fine dust and debris off your floor, but it’s important that it’s paired with effective brushes. The real key to a clean floor with a robot vac is consistency. Run it daily if you can; it won’t keep up as well if it only runs once a week. If you want hands-free cleaning everywhere, you’ll want to budget for one per floor or be prepared to move it around. You can also buy extra charging bases, and most models can map multiple floors. Yes, every Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuum worth its salt today works with Alexa or Google smart speakers for voice control. However, some are limited to stop, start, pause, and maybe suction level, whereas others can be told to go clean specific areas. Here’s how to set up a bot withAlexa voice controlorGoogle Home voice control. A couple of manufacturers now also work withSiri Shortcuts, so you can use Apple’s Siri voice assistant to command your bot. Robot vacuums arenow part of Matter, meaning more opportunities for smart home integration and native Siri voice control for robot vacuums. Matteris a new smart home standard that allows connected gadgets to work with any smart home platform, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. When connected to your smart home platform through Matter, you should be able to control basic robot actions including start / stop and changing cleaning modes, as well as get alerts directly in the app, meaning you won’t need to use the manufacturer’s app for these functions.The latest Matter spec,Matter 1.4, adds support for cleaning specific areas, so while you will still need the manufacturer app to set up a map, you will be able to use your smart home platform app and / or voice assistant to direct the robot to do things like clean the kitchen or clean downstairs. Samsung SmartThings and Amazon both support robot vacuums in Matter; Apple has added itto iOS 18.4, which should come this spring, and Google said support is coming soon.While Amazon Alexa and Google Home have supported robot vacuums for years via the cloud, Matter will bring this control locally. It will also bring support to Apple Home for the first time, allowing you to control them with Siri through HomePods and add them to scenes and automation.There are still relatively few robot vacuums that support Matter.

Wu-Tang Clan ain’t nothing to f- with…but you can play with them. byAsh Parrish In 1999, the iconic New York rap group Wu-Tang Clan released their very first video game,Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style.

Announced simultaneously at Summer Game Fest and at the opening performance of the group’s farewell tour,Rise of the Deceiveris part of the apotheosis of one of the greatest rap groups of all time. The Vergehad the opportunity to speak to the game’s developers at Brass Lion Entertainment about working with some of rap’s living legends on a project that is both the end of an era in rap history and the beginning of something new. Rise of the Deceiveris an action co-op game in which players, imbued with powers bestowed upon them by the legendary members of the Wu-Tang Clan, fight against invaders that wish to corrupt their home. It’s been in development for three years, and started as a companion piece toAngel of Dust, a movie produced by Ghostface Killah and directed by The RZA. “What we did is we leaned into elements of that script that worked really, really well from an interactive perspective, and made a companion piece to it,” said Bryna Dabby Smith co-founder and CEO of Brass Lion Entertainment. According to Dabby Smith, the driving ethos behindRise of the Deceiveris essentially, “do it for the culture.” While there have been numerous hip-hop-centric video games over the years, very few of them tackle the artistry, history, and culture of the genre beyond using it as set dressing. “We wanted to create something where it was built from the ground up,” Dabby Smith said. “It was by the culture, for the culture, and actually representing what [Wu-Tang Clan] put out there through the years.” And for the game’s soundtrack, which incorporates music from throughout the group’s 30-plus year history, it really was built from the ground up. “For us, the treatment of the music was a really big deal,” said Dabby Smith. It’s not just snippets of “C.R.E.A.M” or “Protect Ya Neck” playing during cutscenes. She talked about how their sound team created a dynamic music system. “So while you are playing the game, the music is reacting to what you’re doing and it’s completely unique to your playing experience.” Additionally, players will experience Wu-Tang’s discography in ways they’ve never heard before. “It’s not just the traditional songs that you’ve heard. It’s remix versions. It’s orchestral versions,” Dabby Smith said. There are even totally new tracks in the game that incorporate Wu-Tang samples to make something unique but still familiar to fans’ ears. “Hip-hop is a syncretic art form. It takes pieces of things that have existed elsewhere and mashes them together in unique ways,” said Evan Narcisse, a former video game journalist who worked as a writer on the project. “We’re doing the same thing.” Rise of the Deceiveris meant to appeal to all kinds of video game fans, not just 30-something hip-hop heads. There’s something for everyone. And if youarea 30-something hip-hop head, this game will be a love letter to one of the greatest musical acts in a generation. “The Wu Tang Clan are larger than life,” said Narcisse. ”They’re superheroes, and they deserve a world that speaks that legacy.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "byAndrew Webster It’s that time of year again. WithE3 done and gone, Summer Game Fest has taken its place, and it always makes for a busy few days in gaming. The centerpiece of the event is SGF Live on June 6th at 5PM ET, a keynote hosted by Geoff Keighley that, like The Game Awards, is packed with new game announcements as well as updates and trailers for games we already know about. But there are also a handful of other smaller showcases sprinkled throughout the week, including the Access-Ability Summer Showcase (June 6th at 11AM ET), Day of the Devs (June 6th at 7PM ET), the Wholesome Direct (June 7th at 12PM ET), and the PC Gaming Show (June 8th at 3PM ET).

Andrew Webster I’m not sure how it took so long, but a real-time strategy game set in Westeros is finally in the works. The new game is calledGame of Thrones: War for Westeros, and it’s described as a “classic, premium” RTS game for PC that will let players take control of the various houses and factions in George R.R. Martin’s fantasy universe. The game is being developed by PlaySide Studios, and will include both a single-player campaign and multiplayer options. Here’s the official description: Andrew Webster It wouldn’t be a Summer Game Fest without Hideo Kojima, and he stopped by to show off a new trailer forDeath Stranding 2that weirdly looks nothing likeDeath Stranding 2.

Geoffrey Bunting Now in its third year, the Access-Ability Summer Showcase is back to redress the lack of meaningful accessibility information across the ongoing video game showcase season.As we see progress broadly slow down, it’s also a timely reminder of the good work that’s still happening in pursuit of greater accessibility in gaming. “At a time where we are seeing a slowdown in accessibility adoption in the AAA games space,” organizerLaura Kate Dalesays, “we’re showing that there are interesting accessible games being made, games with unique and interesting features, and that being accessible is something that can bring an additional audience to purchase and play your games.” Jay Peters Host Geoff Keighley shared a list ofmore than 60 “partners”that will be part of Summer Game Fest, including Annapurna Interactive, CD Projekt Red, Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox.

    "title": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is here: all of the launch news",
    "article_text": "byJay Peters After a long wait filled withleaks,reveals,preorder stress, andhands-on events, the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch day has finally arrived around the world, including launch events at retailers likeWalmart,GameStop,Best Buy, andTarget. Nintendo’s next console looks like a worthy successor to the original Switch, and it has a lot of games to play on day one, including the newMario KartWorldand upgrades toThe Legend of Zelda:Breath of the WildandTears of the Kingdom. The Switch 2 also has new software features like the Discord-like GameChat, which could make it easier to trash-talk your friends. There are new accessories, too, including an improved Pro Controller. Now that the Switch 2 is finally getting into people’s hands (if you don’t have a preorder secured,we have some advice on where to look on day one), we can all dive into what it’s like to actually have the console in our homes and in our bags. And, of course, there will be lots of games to play. Here’s all of our coverage of the launch. Sean Hollister The Nintendo Switch 2 is more expensive in practically every way: pricier console, pricier games, an entire Chat buttonyou’ll eventually have to pay to use. So it was nice when Nintendo revealed youwon’tneed itsown $55 camerato video chat with pals. “You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C® camera you’d like,”the company wrote. But you might be mighty disappointed if you simply buy a PC webcam off the shelf. Sean Hollister Our 8BitDo pads definitely needed them (they’re live!), andGuliKit has now announcedits KK3 Maxneeds this oneto unlock Amiibo support. (Yes, it’s the rare quality 3rd-party pad with working NFC for Nintendo’s figurines, andit’s in our best controller guide.) Depending on your pad, some simply won’t pair with the Switch 2 at all, while others are missing some features. In general, Nintendo says original Switch controllerswon’t be able to wake the Switch 2 from sleep. Charles Pulliam-Moore While you could playFortniteon the original Nintendo Switch, it was a less than ideal situation that made the game feel more like a rough around the edges tech demo than a polished piece of software. Because of the Switch’s hardware limitations,Fortnitecould only run at 30 frames per second max, which could make it tricky to pull off well-timed shots. Character models were often so simplified that they barely looked like their counterparts on other consoles. And a combination of dropped frames, simpler textures, and overall lower resolution gave the island a choppy, muddy aesthetic quality that was tolerable, but far from beautiful. Though it was constantly being patched,Fortnitefelt dated on the original Switch in a way that made it hard to justify Battle Passes or get excited about new design changes to the island. But, similar toPokémon ScarletandViolet,Fortnite’s Switch 2 update revitalizes the game by addressing almost every one of its core issues and highlighting all of the new bells and whistles Epic has been developing for it. Andrew Liszewski After retroactivelylowering the original Nintendo Switch’s repairability scorefrom an8 out of 10to just 4 out of 10 to reflect 2025 standards, iFixit has found the Switch 2 to be even harder to fix. Following itsfull teardown of the new console, iFixit is giving the Switch 2 a 3 out of 10 repairability score thanks, in part, to a battery that’s once again “glued in with powerful adhesive” and flash storage modules and USB-C ports that are soldered to the main board. Nintendo continues to rely on the tri-point screws the company has been using to assemble its consoles and handhelds for decades, and on the Switch 2, many are hidden behind stickers that get damaged in the process of removing them to access the screws. The company has never released repair parts or manuals for the original Switch, and there are currently none available for the Switch 2, so you’ll need third-party alternatives to reassemble the console. Jay Peters Last night, I stayed up way too late playing through the Great Plateau section ofThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and I’m falling in love with the game all over again. The opening moments ofBreath of the Wildare iconic. The wide shot of Hyrule you see after leaving that first cave is breathtaking, showing you the world of possibilities ahead. Solving the puzzles on the Great Plateau requires some real creativity and experimentation, especially to survive the colder parts of the area. All of that magic is still there with the Switch 2 version of the game, which you can get as a $9.99 upgrade if you already own the Switch version or as a standalone $69.99 purchase, but it all plays better. Andrew Liszewski Once again confirmingwhat many originalSwitch owners feared, iFixit’s teardown of the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons reveals a familiar joystick design that uses a resistive material that could lead tojoystick driftagain if it wears down over time. The new Joy-Cons also don’t look any easier to disassemble and repair. You’ll need a tri-point screwdriver to remove screws, and iFixit had to use a pick and isopropyl alcohol to dislodge the batteries. Andrew Liszewski 8BitDo announced that eight of its flagship controllers are now compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 following a firmware update. Although some companies had early access to the Switch 2’s specs to buildaccessories like cases and screen protectors, many had to wait until launch day to ensure their devices were compatible with the new console. Cameron Faulkner The Nintendo Switch 2 launched on June 5th, and with it, so did a bunch of games. Some are first-party Nintendo titles, though most are third-party offerings, including some notable ports of games we’ve been enjoying for a while on other gaming platforms. We bundled together all of theSwitch 2 accessoriesin one, easy to browse article, so we’re doing the same for the launch games. In addition to prices, we’ll include install size, and whether the game is on the cartridge in full, or if it’s one of Nintendo’sGame-Key Cards(they’re cartridges that entitle you to a digital download, and that can be resold without issue). Jess Weatherbed You can use your iPhone (and likely Android phone) as a webcam for the Switch 2 if you connect them via a USB-C to HDMI cable and HDMI converter cable — total cost about $30. No need to buy adedicated webcamjust for the new console, which are typically worse than the cameras on modern phones anyway. Sean Hollister Nintendo made the original Switch’s game cards tasteterrible,coating them in a bitter chemical called denatonium benzoate. So we had to know... do Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges taste better? Time for a taste test! And while we’re at it, why not add a button battery coated in the same stuff, a Nintendo DS cartridge, and a 3DS cartridge too? Don’t try this at home, kids. Jay Peters Some people reported an unwelcome surprise after picking up their Nintendo Switch 2 preorders at GameStop: staples used to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes ended up damaging the screens on the console,as reported byIGN. However, GameStop says this was an issue that was “isolated” to a single store and that it has already offered replacements. When you open the box for the Switch 2, the tablet / screen part of the device is just under the top flap of the packaging. The tablet’s proximity to the top of the box possibly explains how staples could get through and poke holes in the screen — especially if the person using the stapler gave it a solid push. Sean Hollister We aren’t having great luck, andReddit’s seeingmixed results too. Though Nintendoassured the publicthat “you can use... any compatible USB-C camera you’d like,” our USB-C toting Logitech Brio 4K, Opal Tadpole and DJI OP3 aren’t working, even while anine-year-oldLogitech C922 with USB-A does when docked. Redditors say the Elgato Facecam, Insta360 Link, Sony ZV-E10, and Sony’s various PlayStation cameras don’t work, while aging Logitech and Microsoft Lifecams apparently do. Modern cameras that seem compatible: Razer Kiyo Pro, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech Brio 300. We’ve pinged Nintendo, and are calling in more cameras. Jay Peters Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing atThe Verge, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better. On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience. Sheena VasaniandBrandon Widder The Switch 2 has finally landed, but it isn’t the only hardware Nintendo is launching this week. The company also introduced a range of new accessories for its new gaming console, the bulk of which are now available online atWalmart,Best Buy,GameStop, andTarget. From aredesigned Pro Controllertoa camera that lets you video chatwith your friends, each is designed to level up your gaming experience. Sadly, President Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policyhas resulted in slight price bumpson several Switch 2 accessories — including the aforementioned Pro 2 Controller. There’s no telling whether we can expect more price hikes down the line, either, meaning if you have secured a Switch 2 and want to pick up a second controller or another accessory to go with it, now might be the time to act. Cameron Faulkner So, you got (or are soon getting) a Nintendo Switch 2. You’re probably ready to throw your original Switch into storage, but before that, you should transfer all of your data to the new console. Good news: it’s easy for those who have a Switch 2. Not only that, it’s easy even if you don’t yet have the new console. Nintendo developed a clever solution for those who haven’t upgrade yet, letting original Switch owners back up their entire account to a remote server, where it will be stored for one year. Cameron Faulkner The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, and so you might be in the market for a microSD card to store more games. While all microSD cards look pretty much the same, only microSD Express cards will work on the Switch 2 for storing and playing games. The microSD card you used in your original Switch or Switch Lite will only offer limited functionality with Nintendo’s new handheld, as it will only let you view screenshots or video clips you captured previously — that’s it. That’s because Nintendo opted for a significantly faster spec in its new handheld console, which boasts an advertised 4.4x improvement in terms of transfer speeds over the microSD cards you might already have lying around. That improvement is signified by a small, easy-to-miss “EX” emblem etched onto the front of the card. Cameron Faulkner Depending on where you are in the US, it hasn’t been easy to grab aNintendo Switch 2(though, our ownDavid Pierce would disagree). In-store and online stock has sold out at most participating retailers, but Target is offering another opportunity, specifically for online shoppers, starting in the “early morning” hours of June 6th. I realize the ambiguity isn’t helpful to those trying to plan their day, but it’s all that Target has shared so far. We’ve reached out to a Target representative to ask for a specific time, and we’ll update this post if we receive any helpful information. According to Target’s product pages, the retailer will have stock of thestandalone Switch 2 consolefor $449.99 and theMario Kart Worldbundlefor $499.99, along with various games and accessories. Jay Peters Nintendo has acknowledged an issue withUltimatewhen a match is played online between people on Switch and Switch 2 and one of them is Mii Fighter,IGNreports. An update is in the works. [ign.com] Sheena Vasani If you missed your chance the first time around, you now have another opportunity to pick up Nintendo’s GameCube Controller for the Switch 2. It’s available once again from theMy Nintendo Storefor $64.99, giving fans another shot at securing the wireless gamepad. To place an order, you’ll need to be logged into your Nintendo Switch Online account, as the controller is currently only available to those with a premium membership (which starts at $19.99 a year). Once you have access to the product landing page, you can complete your purchase, which is limited to one controller per account. Jay Peters Staples (the retailer) isselling the Switch 2 today, but some people getting the console at Gamestop say they had staples (the office equipment) on the front of their console boxes that damaged the screens on their Switch 2s.IGNcovered some of the reports. Andrew Liszewski Belkin has announced a new collection of accessories for the recently launched Switch 2, including acase that does more than protectthe console and keep cartridges organized. There’s also a 10,000mAh battery inside the case that Belkin says has enough capacity to fully charge the console 1.5 times. We haven’treviewed the Switch 2 yetand can’t confirm Nintendo’s claims, but Belkin’s case could more than double the Switch 2’s battery life which is estimated to be between 2 and 6.5 hours. Available now for $69.99 in three color options that include charcoal, sand, and pistachio green, Belkin’s Charging Case for Nintendo Switch 2 also features extra compartments and a zippered pouch for storing charging cables and other accessories. There’s even a small hidden pocket designed to hold an AirTag and increase the chances of finding the case should it go missing. Antonio G. Di Benedetto A Reddit useropened upone of Nintendo’sreissued GameCube controllers for Switch Online membersand discovered the D-pad internals are redesigned. They note the original controller’s D-pad sat further from the board, requiring a shaft to accommodate the gap. The new model’s main board is closer to the surface, which they claim improves accuracy. Nintendo’s other surprise upgrade for its $64.99 controller includesupport for motion controls. David Pierce I drove by Best Buy last night, saw the line, and bailed. But this morning, the Target two doors down just had a bunch of them in stock! I got the second-to-last Mario Kart World bundle, but there was a shelf full of consoles left, and the staff said ithadn’t even been overly busythis morning. Anyone else having a shockinglyeasy time getting a Switch 2, or am I just having a good day? Andrew Liszewski Nintendo Japan’s support sitehas shared how much it’s going to cost to fix the Switch 2 and, not surprisingly, repairs and replacement parts are more expensive. Replacing the Switch 2’s mainboard costs 27,500 yen (~$192) compared to 14,300 yen (~$100) for the original Switch. Screen replacements are 15,400 yen (~$108) while a battery swap will set you back 9,900 yen (~$69). Nintendo is also charging a flat rate of 3,960 yen (~$28) for individual Joy-Con repairs. Andrew Liszewski As most Switch 2 owners eagerly dive intoMario Kart World, some are instead dissecting their consoles to reveal its secrets. Following thefirst teardown yesterday, someone onReddit has disassembledthe new Joy-Cons, asspotted byNintendo Life. Confirming whatNintendo of America’s Nate Bihldorff already said, the joysticks in the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons don’t appear to feature any magnets, which means they’re unfortunately not using drift-resistantHall effect or TMR technology.

    "article_text": "Wolves vs. lambs. Wolves vs. lambs. byJay Peters If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Square Enixjust announcedKiller Inn, a new “murder mystery action” game, as part of Summer Game Fest on Friday. In aKiller Innmatch, 24 players are divided into two teams of “wolves” and “lambs,” and it’s the job of the lambs to discover and kill all the wolves or for the wolves to kill the lambs. (Just to be clear, you play as humans, but with the title of wolves or lambs.) When wolves kill a lamb, they’ll leave clues like a piece of hair or clothing that the lambs can use to try and identify the wolves. Killer Innis coming to PC, and it will be getting a closed beta “soon.” You can apply for the betaon the game’s Steam page. It looks like an interesting take on a murder mystery video game, especially if you are looking for something new to play with your friends after following the popularity ofAmong Us.

    "title": "Supreme Court halts lower court orders requiring DOGE to hand over records",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 4:51 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington —The Supreme Court on Friday halted lower court orders that required the White House'sDepartment of Government Efficiencyto turn over information to a government watchdog groupas part of a lawsuitthat tests whether President Trump's cost-cutting task force has to comply with federal public records law. The order from the high court clears DOGE for now from having to turn over records related to its work and personnel, and keeps Amy Gleason, identified as its acting administrator, from having to answer questions at a deposition. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. \"The portions of the district court's April 15 discovery order that require the government to disclose the content of intra–executive branch USDS recommendations and whether those recommendations were followed are not appropriately tailored,\" the court said in its order. \"Any inquiry into whether an entity is an agency for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act cannot turn on the entity's ability to persuade. Furthermore, separation of powers concerns counsel judicial deference and restraint in the context of discovery regarding internal executive branch communications.\" The Supreme Court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for more proceedings. Chief Justice John Robertstemporarily pausedthe district court's order last month, which allowed the Supreme Court more time to consider the Trump administration's bid for emergency relief. A district judge had ordered DOGE to turn over documents to the group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, by June 3, and for Gleason's deposition to be completed by June 13. The underlying issue in the case involves whether DOGE is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. CREW argues that the cost-cutting task force wields \"substantial independent authority,\" which makes it a de facto agency that must comply with federal public records law. The Justice Department, however, disagrees and instead claims that DOGE is a presidential advisory body housed within the Executive Office of the President that makes recommendations to the president and federal agencies on matters that are important to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. DOGE's agency status was not before the Supreme Court, though the high court may be asked to settle that matter in the future. Instead, the Trump administration had asked the justices to temporarily halt a district court's order that allowed CREW to gather certain information from DOGE as part of its effort to determine whether the task force is an advisory panel that is outside FOIA's scope or is an agency that is subject to the records law. The judge overseeing the dispute, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper, hadordered DOGEto turn over certain documents to the watchdog group by June 3 and to complete all depositions, including of Gleason, by June 13. Mr. Trump ordered the creation of DOGE on his first day back in the White House as part of his initiative to slash the size of the federal government. Since then, DOGE team members have fanned out to agencies across the executive branch and have been part of efforts toshrink the federal workforceand shutter entities like theU.S. Agency for International Developmentandthe U.S. Institute of Peace. DOGE has also attempted to gain access to sensitive databases kept by the Internal Revenue Service,Social Security Administrationand Office of Personnel Management, prompting legal battles. In an effort to learn more about DOGE's structure and operations, CREW submitted an expedited FOIA request to the task force. After it did not respond in a timely manner, CREW filed a lawsuit and sought a preliminary injunction to expedite processing of its records request. The organization argued that DOGE was exercising significant independent authority, which made it an agency subject to FOIA. Cooper granted CREW's request for a preliminary injunction in March and agreed that FOIA likely applies to DOGE because it is \"likely exercising substantial independent authority much greater than other [Executive Office of the President] components held to be covered by FOIA.\" He then allowed CREW to conduct limited information-gathering, which the watchdog group said aimed to determine whether DOGE is exercising substantial authority that would bring it within FOIA's reach. A federal appeals court ultimately declined to pause that order, requiring DOGE to turn over the documents sought by CREW. In seeking the Supreme Court's intervention, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said CREW is conducting a \"fishing expedition\" into DOGE's activities. He warned that if Cooper's order remains in place, several components of the White House, such as the offices of the chief of staff and national security adviser, would be subject to FOIA. \"That untenable result would compromise the provision of candid, confidential advice to the president and disrupt the inner workings of the Executive Branch,\" Sauer wrote. \"Yet, in the decisions below, the court of appeals and district court treated a presidential advisory body as a potential 'agency' based on the persuasive force of its recommendations — threatening opening season for FOIA requests on the president's advisors.\" But lawyers for CREW told the Supreme Court in afilingthat the Justice Department's position \"would require courts to blindly yield to the Executive's characterization\" of the authority and operations of a component of the Executive Office of the President. They said adopting the Trump administration's approach to DOGE would give the president \"free reign\" to create new entities within the Executive Office of the President that exercise substantial independent authority but are shielded from transparency laws. \"Courts would be forced to blindly accept the government's representations about an EOP unit's realworld operations, unable to test those representations through even limited discovery,\" CREW's lawyers wrote. \"It is that extreme position, not the discovery order, that would 'turn[] FOIA on its head.'\" Melissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "How Trump and Musk went from rivals to allies — and now foes again",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  June 6, 2025 / 10:44 AM EDT/ CBS News The alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk went up in flames Thursday, days after the world's richest man left the administration and tried to wield his influence to kill a massive budget bill that is central to enacting the president's top legislative priorities. Their spatplayed out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government. Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here: The Tesla CEO praised Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies as \"the right ones\" in an interviewwithCNBC before the 2016 election. \"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy,\" Musk said of Mr. Trump at the time. \"He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\" \"I don't think this is the finest moment in our democracy,\" Musk added. Shortly after Mr. Trump's first term began, Muskjoineda handful of White House advisory boards, including Mr. Trump's \"manufacturing jobs council.\" But Musk left those roles just months later, citing Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. \"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musktweetedin June 2017. Musk continued to have a close relationship with the federal government, however, as hisrocket company SpaceXhas billions in contracts with NASA and other agencies. Mr. TrumppraisedMusk at a 2020 SpaceX launch in Florida,saying at one point: \"I speak to him all the time. Great guy. He's one of our great brains. We like great brains. And Elon has done a fantastic job.\" In May 2022, Musk said he was ending his support for Democrats because \"they have become the party of division & hate.\" \"So I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" Musktweeted, lateraddingthat he voted for Clinton in 2016 and former President Joe Biden in 2020. But just two months later, Musk suggested he didn't support Mr. Trump launching another run for the White House amid a public spat with the then-former president over the course of several days in July 2022. Mr. Trumpcalledthe Tesla CEO a \"b---s--- artist\" at a rally andsaidhis companies would be \"worthless\" without federal backing, while Musk tweeted Mr. Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\" Later in 2022, Musk purchased Twitter, now known as X, and quicklyreinstatedMr. Trump's account, which had been suspended since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The reinstatement came four days after Mr. Trump announced his third run for the presidency after losing to Biden. In the Republican presidential primary, Muskinitially threw his supportbehind one of Mr. Trump's rivals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In May 2023, the billionaire and the Floridian appeared together on aglitchyTwitter livestream to launch DeSantis' campaign. The tech billionaire formally endorsed Mr. Trump on July 13, 2024, moments after Mr. Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Muskwrotealongside video of the bloodied presidential candidate raising his fist in the air as he was surrounded by Secret Service agents. Musk joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail andspent roughly $277 millionto help elect him and other Republican candidates, mostly through a Musk-backed super PAC called America PAC, campaign finance records show. Mr. Trump shouted Musk out during his election night victory speech: \"A star is born,\" Mr. Trumpsaid. \"He's an amazing guy.\" Before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for a second term, Musk used his political influence inDecember 2024to whip up outrage against a bipartisan spending bill and torpedo it days before a potential government shutdown. Mr. Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency,or DOGE, which was tasked with cutting federal government spending, but fell far short of Musk's $1 trillion goal. Musk quickly became a member of Mr. Trump's inner circle, participating in Cabinet meetings and traveling on Air Force One with his young son. Less than a month into his government service, Muskprofessedon X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\" DOGE quickly gained vast influence within the Trump administration, slashing government staff andnearly dismantling some federal agencies. Musk and Mr. Trumpappeared togetherin the Oval Office in February — with Musk's son in tow — and jointly answered questions from the press. Mr. Trump stood by Musk as some of his efforts drew backlash. In late February, a DOGE-backed email telling federal employees to report what they had accomplished in the preceding week sparkedconfusionin some agencies. During a Cabinet meeting days later, Mr. Trump called Musk \"tremendously successful\" and said people were \"thrilled\" with his performance — and said federal workers who haven't responded to the emails are \"on the bubble.\" When Tesla faced protests from Trump opponents, the president boosted Musk, climbing into a Tesla on the White House South Lawn in March and calling the car \"beautiful.\" Days prior, Mr. Trump said onTruth Socialhe would \"buy a brand new Tesla\" as a show of support for Musk, who the president said was \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB.\" Musk clashed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in April over Mr. Trump's tariff strategy. Musk called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro said Tesla relies on \"cheap foreign parts.\" Mr. Trump's White Housedidn't take sides: \"Boys will be boys,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. In a late April Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump praised and thanked Musk — butsuggestedhis time in government would end soon. \"You're invited to stay as long as you want. At some point, he wants to get back home to his cars,\" Mr. Trump said, as he and his Cabinet led a round of applause for the billionaire. President Trump to@elonmusk: \"We just want to thank you very much. And, you know, you're invited to stay as long as you want. At some point, he wants to get back home to his cars.\"pic.twitter.com/izglwMebKM Days before wrapping up his work for the federal government, Musk began criticizing a massive piece of legislation aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Musk told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" in the price tag of the package, whichwould extendMr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back clean energy tax credits. Musk left his position in the administration on May 30 after reaching the maximum number of days he could serve as a special government employee. Musk, who had a black eye, stood next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president praised the billionaire's government work and called him \"one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.\" \"Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling,\" Mr. Trump said. Musk said he would continue to serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president. In the following days, Musk escalated his criticism of the legislation Mr. Trump has dubbed a \"big, beautiful bill,\" calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" in a lengthy early June tirade on his social media platform. The insults continued through the week,reaching a climaxon June 5 with Mr. Trump threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him. Musk said he would shut down a SpaceX program that NASA relies on to transport astronauts — before later backtracking — andseemed to endorse an X postcalling for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Musk also warnedRepublican lawmakers: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\" During the back-and-forth, Mr. Trump claimed that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with a provision in the budget bill that would end tax credits for electric vehicles. \"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" the presidentwrote. Musk then alleged that Mr. Trump's name appeared in thefiles related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Muskwrote. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\" In response to the spat, Leavitt called it an \"unfortunate episode from Elon.\" Caitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

    "title": "Supreme Court allows DOGE to access Social Security data",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — TheSupreme Courton Friday allowed members of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security Administration data. The conservative-majority court, with its three liberal justices objecting, granted an emergency application filed by the Trump administration asking the justices to lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in Maryland. Theunsigned ordersaid that members of the DOGE team assigned to the Social Security Administration should have \"access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work.\" The lawsuit challenging DOGE’s actions was filed by progressive group Democracy Forward on behalf of two unions — the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the American Federation of Teachers — as well as the Alliance for Retired Americans. \"This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people,\" the groups said in a statement. \"This ruling will enable President Trump and DOGE’s affiliates to steal Americans’ private and personal data.\" The White House praised the ruling. \"The Supreme Court allowing the Trump Administration to carry out commonsense efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse and modernize government information systems is a huge victory for the rule of law,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement. Follow live politics coverage here Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion questioning the need for the court to intervene on an emergency basis. \"In essence, the 'urgency' underlying the government’s stay application is the mere fact that it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before proceeding as it wishes,\" she added. DOGE, set up by billionaire Elon Musk before his falling out with President Donald Trump,says it wants to modernize systems and detect waste and fraud at the agency. The data it seeks includes Social Security numbers, medical records, and tax and banking information. “These teams have a business need to access the data at their assigned agency and subject the government’s records to much-needed scrutiny,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers. The lawsuit alleged that allowing broader access to the personal information would violate a federal law called the Privacy Act as well as the Administrative Procedure Act. \"The agency is obligated by the Privacy Act and its own regulations, practices, and procedures to keep that information secure — and not to share it beyond the circle of those who truly need it,\" the challengers' lawyers wrote in court papers. U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander had ruled that DOGE had no need to access the specific data at issue. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Virginia, declined to block Hollander's decision, leading to the Trump administration to file its emergency request at the Supreme Court. Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano welcomed Friday's ruling by the high court. “The Supreme Court’s ruling is a major victory for American taxpayers. The Social Security Administration will continue driving forward modernization efforts, streamlining government systems, and ensuring improved service and outcomes for our beneficiaries,” Bisignano said in a statement. In aseparate orderissued Friday in another case involving DOGE, the Supreme Court granted another request filed by the Trump administration. That decision allows the Trump administration to, for now, shield DOGE from freedom of information requests seeking thousands of pages of material. The moveformalizes a decisionissued by Chief Justice John Roberts on May 23 that temporarily put lower court decisions on hold while the Supreme Court considered what next steps to take. The court also told lower courts to limit the scope of what material could be disclosed. It means the government will not have to respond to requests for documents and allow for the deposition of the DOGE administrator, Amy Gleason, as a lower court had ruled, while litigation continues. The three liberal justices noted their disagreement with that decision, too. A spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed the lawsuit, said the group was \"obviously disappointed\" with the decision but \"pleased that the court allowed discovery to proceed.\" A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — TheSupreme Courton Friday left in place a longstanding gun restriction in the District of Columbia that bans magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, opting once again to avoid taking up a new gun rights case. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that generally favors gun rights, turned away a challenge to the Washington, D.C., lawjust a few daysafter rejecting an appeal over a similar law in Rhode Island. Then, the court also left in place Maryland's ban on assault-style weapons including the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Follow live politics coverage here The court expanded gun rights in amajor 2022 rulingthat found for the first time that the right to bear arms under the Constitution's Second Amendment extends outside the home. But the court has since frustrated gun owners by declining to take up cases that would expand upon that ruling. The District of Columbia has long been a legal battleground over gun restrictions. The Supreme Court's landmark 2008 ruling that for the first time found that people have an individual right to bear arms in self defense in their homes arose from a challenge to a D.C. law. In the latest case, four gun owners challenged the restriction on large-capacity magazines that was enacted in the aftermath of the 2008 Supreme Court ruling, saying the restriction is unlawful under the later 2022 decision. Both a federal judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the law. The appeals court, in a 2-1 vote, said in a ruling last year that although large-capacity magazines are arms under the Second Amendment and have been in common use for years, they can be regulated because they are \"particularly dangerous.\" Last summer, the Supreme Courtsidestepped multiplegun-related disputes soon after it issued a ruling that upheld a federal law that prohibits people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. In other action on pending appeals Friday, the court decided against taking up a significant election case involving mail-in ballots in the battleground state of Pennsylvania that pitted Republicans against Democrats. The decision leaves intact a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that said voters who send mail-in ballots that are flagged as defective can then file a separate provision in-person ballot. The Republican National Committee was seeking to overturn the 2024 state court decision, while the Democratic National Committee was defending it.",

    "title": "Immigration officials target multiple Los Angeles sites",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — Federal immigration authorities raided three locations across the city on Friday, officials said,in \"chaotic\" action that drew immediate rebuke fromlocal lawmakers and a distanced response from L.A. law enforcement. “Today, ICE officers and agents alongside partner law enforcement agencies, executed four ​federal search warrants at three location in central Los Angeles,\" a statement from the Homeland Security Investigations said. As federal agents — often wearing camouflage and bulletproof vests with their faces covered — burst into buildings, protesters and supporters soon showed up creating tense scenes throughout the city. Witnesses reported tear gas being employed at least one of the locationsto clear a path for federal agents to take in their prisoners. “Approximately 44 people” were administratively arrested ​​and one person was arrested on an obstruction charge, the HSI statement said. Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly denounced the raids. \"Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,\"Newsom saidin a statement. \"Donald Trump’s chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America’s economy.\" Among those arrested was SEIU California President David Huerta, who represents an estimated 750,000 service workers across the state. He was booked by federal law enforcement at the site of one of the raids, according to Bill Essayli, the L.A.-based U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California. “David Huerta deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle,” he said on X Friday night. “He was arrested for interfering with federal officers and will face arraignment in federal court on Monday.” The labor union said Huerta was released from a hospital Friday afternoon after being transported for unknown reaons. He remained in custody early Friday evening, it said in a statement. The union said he was \"exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity\" when he was taken into custody. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass visited Huerta in the hospital and spoke toNBC Los Angelesafterward. \"He is doing OK physically, but I know what really impacted him the most was the emotional trauma of watching parents and kids being separated,\" she said. Among the sites targeted by federal agents was clothing manufacturer, importer and wholesaler Ambiance Apparel in the city's Fashion District, Essayli toldNBC Los Angeles. The agents served a search warrant and were looking for \"fictitious employee documents,\" Essayli said. A representative for Ambiance Apparel could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., called the ICE action \"a continuation of a disturbing pattern of extreme and cruel immigration enforcement.\" \"These indiscriminate raids prove once again that the Trump administration cares about nothing but instilling harm and fear in our communities to drive immigrants into the shadows,\" Padilla, a Los Angeles native andson of Mexican immigrants, said in a statement. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell and Sheriff Robert Luna were both quick to state that their personnel had no role in the federal action. “Today the LAPD became aware that ICE was conducting operations in the City of Los Angeles,\"McDonnell said in a statement. \"I’m aware that these actions cause anxiety for many Angelenos, so I want to make it clear: the LAPD is not involved in civil immigration enforcement.\" Video posted to social mediaby People’s City Council shows LAPD officers outside the Ambiance Apparel location. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Luna acknowledged that raids \"have caused fear\" but asked residents to \"remain calm and peaceful as we continue to place your safety and well-being at the forefront of our efforts.\" On Friday afternoon multiple immigrant rights' groups rallied in downtown Los Angeles to express anger over the raids and Huerta's arrest. Outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal lockup, federal agents stood guard amid shouting protesters and ultimately fired less-lethal rounds to clear the area in front of the structure, according to NBC Los Angeles video and imagery posted to social media verified by NBC News. Yvonne Wheeler, president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, spoke onstage nearby earlier, decrying the raids as a swipe at working class L.A. \"Today was a dark day in Los Angeles,\" she said. \"This administration is cruel and inhumane.\" Protesters held up signs that said, \"Stop Deportations,\" and some chanted, \"Free David, free them all,\" referring to Huerta and the arrested migrants. A spokesperson for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles estimated 1,000 people had gathered following its call for supporters to join the group downtown. LAPD Officer Drake Madison said it was not yet known how many arrests, if any, had taken place as protesters marched to the complex that includes the detention center and the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Los Angles City Council member Ysabel Jurado also took the temporary stage, decrying the raids timing during Pride Month and graduation season. \"It was a calculated attempt to take joy from our community,\" she said. \"I'm heartbroken. But I'm ready to fight.\" She was among the 11 of the city's 15 council members who condemned the federal action. \"This indiscriminate targeting of children and families not only harms the individuals who are directly impacted, but destroys our communities’ sense of trust and safety in their own homes,\" the lawmakers said in a joint statement. \"We condemn this in no uncertain terms: Los Angeles was built by immigrants and it thrives because of immigrants. We will not abide by fear tactics to support extreme political agendas that aim to stoke fear and spread discord in our city.\" Andrew Blankstein and Erick Mendoza reported from Los Angeles and David K.

    "article_text": "Grant Hardin,a former Arkansas police chief convicted of rape and murder, was captured Friday after escaping from prison nearly two weeks ago. Hardin, 56, was taken into custody roughly 1.5 miles west of North Central Unit, the facility he fledwearing what prison officials have describedas a \"makeshift\" law enforcement uniform, the Arkansas Department of Corrections said. U.S. Border Patrol agents and Arkansas law enforcement officers found him near an Izard County creek after tracking dogs picked up his scent in the area, the department said. He was apprehended a short time later. Hardin's identity was confirmed by fingerprint analysis, the Izard County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. “To every one of our Department staff that assisted in this manhunt over the last 13 days, I give my heartfelt thank you for your immeasurable contributions to bring this search to a peaceful conclusion,\" Secretary of Corrections Lindsay Wallace said in a statement. Hardin walked out of the North Central Unit just before 3 p.m. May 25. An affidavit stated that he \"impersonated a corrections officer in dress and manner, causing a corrections officer operating a secure gate to open the gate.\" Authorities released a photo showing him dressed in all black and pushing a wheeled cart with what appeared to be wooden pallets on it. Multiple agencies, including state police, assisted in the search. The FBI, Department of Corrections, Arkansas State Police, and Department of Justice said there was a reward of up to $10,000 for information that led to his arrest. Hardin, who has a background in law enforcement, was in prison for killing Gateway city water employee James Appleton in 2017 and raping teacher Amy Harrison in 1997. He was sentenced to 30 years for Appleton’s murder and 50 years for the sexual assault. Both cases were featured in the 2023 Max documentary \"Devil in the Ozarks.\" Rand Champion, a Corrections Department spokesperson, had said that Hardin's background in law enforcement made the search more difficult. Hardin was the police chief of Gateway, Arkansas, for about four months in early 2016. From August 1990 to May 1991, he worked for the Fayetteville Police Department. A department spokesperson said he was let go while still going through the training program. NBC affiliate KNWA of Fayetteville reported that he also worked as a police officer, county constable, and corrections officer.",

    "title": "Trump can bar The Associated Press from some White House events for now, appeals court rules",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump is free to bar The Associated Press from some White House media events for now, after a U.S. appeals court on Friday paused alower court ruling mandatingthat AP journalists be given access. The divided ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit temporarily blocks an order by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, who ruled on April 8 that the Trump administration must allow AP journalists access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and White House events while the news agency’s lawsuit moves forward. Follow live politics coverage here The2-1 rulingwas written by U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, joined by fellow Trump appointee U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas. Rao wrote that the lower court injunction “impinges on the President’s independence and control over his private workspaces” and that the White House was likely to ultimately defeat the Associated Press’ lawsuit. The Associated Press in a statement said it was disappointed by the decision and weighing its options. A White House spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, in a statement on the social media platform X said the Associated Press has no “right to unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One.” In a dissent, Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of President Barack Obama, said her two colleagues’ ruling cannot be squared with “any sensible understanding of the role of a free press in our constitutional democracy.” The APsuedin February after the White House restricted the news outlet’s access over its decision to continue referring to the Gulf of Mexico in its coverage despite Trump renaming the body of water the Gulf of America. The AP’s lawyers argued the new policy violated the First Amendment of the Constitution, which protects free speech rights. McFadden, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, said in hisrulingthat if the White House opens its doors to some journalists it cannot exclude others based on their viewpoints. Trump administration lawyers said the president has absolute discretion over media access to the White House and that McFadden’s ruling infringed on his ability to decide whom to admit to sensitive spaces. “The Constitution does not prohibit the President from considering a journalist’s prior coverage in evaluating how much access he will grant that journalist,” lawyers for the administration said in a court filing. On April 16, the APaccusedthe Trump administration of defying the court order by continuing to exclude its journalists from some events and thenlimitingaccess to Trump for all news wires, including Reuters and Bloomberg. Reuters and the AP both issued statements denouncing the new policy, which puts wire services in a larger rotation with about 30 other newspaper and print outlets. Other media customers, including local news organizations that have no presence in Washington, rely on the wire services’ real-time reports of presidential statements as do global financial markets. The AP says in its stylebook that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years and, as a global news agency, the AP will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.",

The first trainsfromLAX/Metro Transit Centerrolled out during the early evening rush, connecting travelers to theK or C rail lines, which can then whisk them north in the direction of central Los Angeles, south toward beach cities or east along Interstate 105. The breakthrough is an absolute necessity for organizers of the2028 Olympicsif they're going to fulfill their vow of making it a\"no car Games.\" \"This is a big day for L.A.,\" County Supervisor Janice Hahn said in a statement shortly after a ceremonial ride at the new station.

But here in L.A., we know they have always been: 'Hey, can you give me a ride to LAX?'\" quipped Hahn, the daughter of late political titan Kenneth Hahn who played a key role inbringing the Brooklyn Dodgerswest in 1957. \"Well now — for the first time ever — you can say: 'No way.

    "title": "13 House Republicans urge Senate to scale back clean energy cuts in bill they voted for",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Thirteen House Republicans who voted for President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill”sent a letter Friday urging Senate GOP leaders to scale back some of its clean energy cuts, sparking pushback from conservative hard-liners. The unusual criticism of their own bill indicates a modicum of regret by the GOP lawmakers, whose votes were critical to the billpassing the House by a narrow marginlast month. “While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions,” said the Republicans in the letter, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va. They cited provisions that “abruptly terminate several credits just 60 days after enactment for projects that have not yet begun construction,” and “restrictions to transferability.” “This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,” the group of House Republicans said in criticizing the legislation they voted for, while suggesting some changes to “mitigate” the harm it could cause. Kiggans, like most of the signatories, represents a competitive district that Democrats are targeting in the 2026 election. Other politically vulnerable members include: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz.; Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.; Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Gabe Evans, R-Colo.; Young Kim, R-Calif.; David Valadao, R-Calif.; Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa.; and Tom Kean, R-N.J. The remaining three, who hold comparably safer seats, are Reps. Mark Amodei, R-Nev.; Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.; and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y. The 13 Republicans warned that “the House-passed bill includes a phase out schedule for credits that would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee mocked the letter and said the lawmakers will own their votes for the bill. “These 13 Republicans promised not to support cuts to clean energy tax credits, then cast the deciding votes to raise energy costs on American families, kill tens of thousands of jobs, and undermine our nation’s energy security. They are responsible for this Big, Ugly Bill and all the harm it will cause,” DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton said. “This toothless letter is the worst kind of political hypocrisy and voters will see it for what it is, a lie perpetrated by endangered House Republicans who caved to their D.C. party bosses at the expense of the American people.” Kiggans’ office did not immediately return a request for comment on whether she was aware of the provisions when supporting the bill, or if she’d vote for one that falls short of her new demands. Senate Republicans are eyeing changes to the House bill to ease some of the negative impacts of the funding cuts. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told NBC News her version of the bill will probably relax some of the deadlines to cut off funding. But she said Thursday that there probably won’t be massive changes to the House-passed bill. “I imagine it’s going to track fairly similarly, but I think some of the deadlines are pretty tight in terms of when you have to have construction and those things,” Capito said. “We’ve been approached by several employers who need some of those tax credits.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he’s willing to undo some of the clean energy funding, but he wants to make sure that existing business investments aren’t harmed by the bill. “What we’re trying to focus on is to make sure that if businesses have invested and have projects in progress, that we do everything we can to hold them harmless,” he said. “Whether or not we continue some of these programs out into the future — that’s a separate question that I’m willing to entertain.” Meanwhile, the conservative group Club For Growth is running ads targeting Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., John Curtis, R-Utah, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for backing more modest rollbacks of the clean energy funding, which carries benefits for their states. There’s another reason changing the bill is easier said than done: The speedy cuts to clean energy funding under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were part of a House agreement to win the votes of conservative hard-liners who want to reduce the bill’s red ink. House Republicans have a majority of 220 to 212, meaning they can only spare three “no” votes in their ranks to pass the bill when the Senate sends back its revised version. “You backslide one inch on those IRA subsidies and I’m voting against this bill,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said Friday on the House floor. “So you do what you want to do in the Senate, House of Lords, have your fun. But if you mess up the Inflation Reduction Act, Green New Scam subsidies, I ain’t voting for that bill.”",

    "title": "What comes next in the Trump-Musk feud: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Kristen Welker dives into what comes next in the breakup between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.Plus, our Capitol Hill team examines the senators who could make or break Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”And Shannon Pettypiece answers this week’s reader question on the U.S.-China trade war. Before we dive into all that, two bits of breaking news this Friday afternoon: Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner The feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trumperupted yesterdayin an epic clash between the world’s richest man and the world’s most powerful man — and it’s not clear yet where the confrontation will go next. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told me this morning that there are“no plans” for a phone callbetween Trump and Musk today, despite at least one report that it was a possibility. But just because there’s nothing on the books doesn’t mean the two men won’t have an impromptu call. After all, Trump has a personal cellphone where he often talks to everyone from world leaders to reporters. And one administration official told me anything can happen, and they’d like to “de-escalate a very unfortunate situation.” While the White House may be looking to turn down the temperature, some of the president’s allies were quick to go after Musk. Steve Bannon, a former Trump White House adviser, told me the president should “pull every contract associated with Elon Musk” and start major investigations “immediately.” Bannon also said, “Thus spake the ketamine,” in a sign that some of Trump’s allies are zeroing in on Musk’s alleged drug use. (Musk has saidhe took ketamineto treat depression.) At stake in all of this is the future of Trump’ssignature legislation, which includes tax cut extensions, an elimination of tax on tips and overtime, and cuts and changes to federal programs including Medicaid and food stamps. Musk has trashed the “big, beautiful bill,” arguing that it would balloon the country’s debt. Sources from the White House and on Capitol Hill have told me that while Musk’s opposition might embolden Republican senators who are already opposed to the measure, Musk is not flipping any more votes  to the “no” column at this point. I’m also told that if these senators had to choose between Trump and Musk, they’d choose Trump every time. We’ll talk more about the next steps for Trump’s domestic policy bill on “Meet the Press” this Sunday, with exclusive interviews with Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla. and Cory Booker, D-N.J. Behind the scenes:Trump’s team is taking the feud seriously: White House aides scrambled into at least two closed-door meetings Thursday to strategize about whether and how to respond to Musk’s social media barrage. Vice President JD Vance was with Trump on Thursday when the tweets began and they spoke multiple times in the afternoon, according to a person familiar with the day’s events. Trump encouraged Vance to be diplomatic about Musk if asked about him, the person said. Meanwhile, Trump is considering selling or giving away the red Tesla that he purchased in March, according to a senior White House official. Read more on the Trump-Musk feud → Amid the back-and-forth between Donald Trump and Elon Musk this week, Senate Republican leaders have been juggling a host of competing demands as they prepare to take up — and make changes to — the House-passed “big, beautiful bill.” They can ultimately afford to lose just three GOP votes on the Senate floor, assuming all Democrats oppose the package as expected. Here are the senators who could make or break the bill: Rand Paul:He’s the only Republican senator who has voted against this legislation every step of the way. He has blasted the spike in military spending, the huge increase in deficits and, in particular, the $5 trillion debt limit hike. Paul does support a key part of the package — an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts — but he wants to offset it with trillions of dollars in additional spending cuts, on which the GOP has no hope of finding consensus. Susan Collins:The Maine senator is the sole Republican to represent a state that Democrats consistently win at the presidential level. And she faces re-election this year. Her trajectory has been revealing, from supporting the initial budget resolution to voting against the revised version. A key reason for her opposition? Concerns that the Medicaid cuts would harm low-income and older constituents. Lisa Murkowski:When she voted for the budget blueprint in April that kick-started the process of writing the legislation, the Alaska Republican quickly followed it up with a broad set of grievances that will need to be addressed, or she’ll be “unable to support” the final product. That includes the changes to Medicaid, the cost of the tax cuts and the phaseout of clean energy tax credits that benefit her state. Ron Johnson:The Wisconsin Republican has railed against the bill and itsestimated $2.4 trillioncontribution to the deficit, insisting he can’t vote for it as written. He has slammed the idea of a megabill, calling for breaking it up and limiting the debt ceiling hike. Trump asked him to be “less negative” during a meeting at the White House this week, Johnson said. Read more on the other key senators to watch → Grabbing the third rail:Senate Republicans open the door to cutting Medicare ‘waste’ in Trump agenda bill Thanks to everyone who emailed us! This week’s reader question is on the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. “Who is in worse shape if the two countries don’t trade any longer?” To answer this, we turned to senior policy reporterShannon Pettypiece, who has been covering the ins and outs of Trump’s tariff agenda. Here’s her response: Both the U.S. and China have a lot to lose by cutting off trade ties with each other, but in some ways, not as much as they did before the first wave of China tariffs Trump imposed in 2018. Chinese companies have been shifting production offshore, to neighboring countries like Vietnam and even Mexico, while Chinese officials have worked to boost trade with other trading partners, like the European Union. The share of total Chinese exports to the U.S. has dropped to an estimated 14% in 2024 from 19% in 2018. Across China’s entire economy, U.S. exports account for 3% of China’s gross domestic product, and a sustained U.S. tariff rate of 60% could reduce China’s GDP by 2 percentage points, according to Goldman Sachs. In short, that would be bad for China’s economy, but not entirely crippling. China’s economy isn’t on the strongest footing at the moment. Its growth has slowed since the Covid pandemic and the country is grappling with a collapse in its real estate market, which has wiped out the savings for many Chinese. The U.S. has also been working to lessen its dependence on China in recent years, and U.S. companies have increasingly been shifting their manufacturing out of China. China accounts for about 15% of total U.S. imports, down from about 22% in 2018. But the U.S. is still heavily dependent on China in a number of key areas, like rare earth metals crucial for U.S. manufacturing of cars and defense equipment. About a third of U.S. imports from China are in product categories where the vast majority of those items come from China, according to Goldman Sachs. That means, even a temporary halt to shipments from China could lead to supply chain shortages, like those seen during the Covid pandemic. But who blinks first or offers more concessions in a trade standoff could have just as much to do with politics as economics. China removed term limits on President Xi Jinping in 2018, essentially allowing him to remain in power for life. Meanwhile, the U.S. will have midterm elections next year and another presidential contest in 2028. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

    "title": "What's the CBO? Meet the nonpartisan agency under fire from Republicans.",
    "article_text": "By Barbara Sprunt The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 established the Congressional Budget Office, an agency designed to provide lawmakers with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills. Up until that point, the scorekeeping within the government came from the executive branch.Visual Generation/Getty Imageshide caption As Senate Republicans get to work on making changes to the massive bill filled with top GOP prioritiesthat recently passed the House, you've probably heard a lot of criticism lobbed at the Congressional Budget Office, also known as the CBO. The CBO, which analyzes the budgetary impacts of bills, projected that Congressional Republicans' signature legislation wouldincrease federal deficits by about $2.4 trillion over a decade. That eye-popping figure is drawing a lot of ire from Republicans, from President Trump to top lawmakers in Congress. \"We're not buying the CBO's estimates,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said earlier this week. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., toldFox Businessthe CBO is \"government bean counters based on government rules, not market rules. Never heard of economic growth.\" President Trumpreferredto the agency as \"Democrat controlled\" in a post on his social mediasite, Truth Social. But the CBO's work is nonpartisan. So…what gives? Let's take a closer look at the agency in the hot seat. The CBO was established when Congress passed the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, after increasing tensions between the legislative and executive branches. Up until that point, scorekeeping within the government had come from the executive branch, which by nature has a partisan tilt. Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, said the CBO was designed to provide lawmakers with objective information about the budgetary impacts of proposed bills. \"It is important as a separation of powers for Congress to have their own scorekeeping agency so that they're not dependent on the White House to tell them what the budget looks like and how much legislation will cost,\"  Riedl said. A spokesperson for the CBO declined to comment for this story. The CBO acts as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. Its job is to calculate how much bills would increase or decrease revenues to the U.S. Treasury and how much spending would go out of the Treasury. Think of it like your own household budget, but on steroids. \"You go to the store and they tell you what the prices are. CBO's telling [Congress] what the prices are,\" explained Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as director of the CBO from 2003 to 2005. \"What's the food? What's the gasoline? How much is the rent going to be? How does this add up? Do we make our budget or not?\" Importantly, CBO cost estimates are only advisory. The agency makes no policy recommendations. It's up to lawmakers to decide what to do with the information they receive. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes the budgetary impact of Congressional bills.Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images via Getty Imageshide caption Sometimes, scoring a bill is fairly easy. Say Congress wants to rename a post office. That's pretty straightforward — not something that will keep CBO analysts working overtime. But others are extremely complicated. Holtz-Eakin recalls having to score terrorism risk insurance during his tenure. \"It's a federal backstop to the private property casualty insurance company for losses in the event of an unknown terrorist attack at an unknown time in the future, in an unknown location using an unknown weapon,\" he said. \"How much will that cost? Well, that's just incredibly hard.\" He said a common misconception is that there's already a model for everything. \"Like you just drop the bill into a slot and out comes the answer,\" he said. \"And the problem is the CBO went to the wrong model shop and bought the wrong model — that's not at all what we're doing.\" Around 275 people work at the CBO, including economists, budget analysts, demographers and other experts.Each year, the CBO publishes around a thousand cost estimates. The CBO will at times incorporate tax figures provided by another nonpartisan arm of Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation. Holtz-Eakin, who runs the center-right group, American Action Forum, said CBO reports are \"as fair as they can make it,\" given that  \"predicting the future is really, really hard.\" CBO critics point to the agency underestimating revenues following the passage of the 2017 tax bill by roughly $1.5 trillion. Scorekeeping watchers note that gap is due to the unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic and resulting high inflation. Riedl, who previously worked as chief economist to Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said the CBO is more accurate than critics suggest. \"It's easy to beat up on the CBO and their projections certainly are not perfect but projecting how new tax changes will affect the economic decisions of 330 million Americans is extraordinarily complicated, and there's always going to be a margin of error,\" Riedl said. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) speaks at a press conference following a House Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Imageshide caption Although Republicans are currently the party criticizing the CBO, digs at the agency have come from both sides of the aisle. Democrats pushed back at CBO's scores during the legislative efforts of the Affordable Care Act and Build Back Better. \"The only new thing here is the involvement of the White House so explicitly,\" Holtz-Eakin said, nodding to public criticism from the president and the White House press secretary. \"The White House has often let their congressional allies fight that fight.\" He said while there are \"reasonable criticisms\" on the timeliness of some of the CBO estimates over the years, concerns about partisanship are misplaced. \"[The CBO] has nonpartisanship in its DNA,\" he said. The agency, which hassections on its websiteabout objectivity and transparency, said it enforces strict rules that limit employees' political activities. Riedl compares the agency to the civil service, where nonpartisan staff stay regardless of whether the president is a Democrat or Republican. \"Congress doesn't have a lot of neutral, nonpartisan staffers that stick around regardless of the party in power,\" she said. \"CBO is one of those few offices.\" But in Washington, no one is immune from gripes about partisanship. \"Congress gets to hide behind you and they get to vent at you. Sometimes they're just very frustrated and they scream at the CBO director, and that's just the role you play,\" Holtz-Eakin said. \"It's not personal.\" But eventually, you'd think lawmakers get a score they're happy with and then heap praise on the CBO, right? Holtz-Eakin laughs. \"When they're really happy, they say, 'We did a great job,'\" he said. \"When they're really unhappy, they say, 'CBO screwed this up.' That's how that works.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Supreme Court grants DOGE access to confidential Social Security records",
    "article_text": "By Nina Totenberg , Anuli Ononye The Social Security Administration office in San FranciscoJustin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide caption The Supreme Court, on Friday, for now gave the DOGE team launched by Elon Musk unfettered access to information collected by the Social Security Administration, data that includes Social Security numbers, medical and mental health records, and family court information. In an unsigned order, the court, acting at the request of the Trump administration, temporarily overturned actions by two lower courts that had limited the DOGE team's access to sensitive private information at the Social Security Administration. The high court sent the case back to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond to rule on the merits. The vote was 6 to 3, with the conservative super majority ruling in favor of the DOGE team. The court's three liberals said they would have ruled the other way, temporarily barring the DOGE team's access to Social Security records while the case proceeds through the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing for herself and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, blasted the majority for giving the DOGE team unfettered access to unredacted personal information \"before the courts have time to assess whether DOGE's access is lawful.\" In essence, she said, the government's so-called \"urgency\" about gaining this access \"is the mere fact that it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before proceeding as it wishes. \" That has not been the way the process has worked in the past, she said. \"Once again the this court dons its emergency responder gear, rushes to the scene , and uses its equitable power to fan the flames rather than extinguish them,\" Jackson wrote. Jackson said that rather than the government suffering from the existing stay in the lower courts, it is the nation's citizens who will now see their personal data compromised. \"With today's decision, it seems as if the court has truly lost its moorings,\" she said. In the process, she added, the court is creating \"grave privacy risks for millions of Americans.\" Friday's case began on day one of Trump's second term, when he tasked DOGE, with \"modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\" Acting Social Security Commissioner Michelle King initially blocked the DOGE Team from accessing confidential Social Security records. After a short time, she resigned rather than provide full access to the DOGE team. Her replacement, Leland Dudek, then granted DOGE what opponents called \"unfettered access to SSA data systems.\" Labor unions and a grassroots advocacy organization sued, concerned that SSA was providing personally identifiable information to unauthorized DOGE personnel. The challengers argued that by providing confidential Social Security information to DOGE, SSA violated the federal Fair Privacy Act. The 1974 federal law created a code for the \"collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination\" of personal records and information stored by the federal government. Among other things, the law requires that individuals provide consent before their personal records are shared. The government contends that disclosing secure Social Security documents is permitted through one of the Privacy Act's 12 exceptions: agencies can share information internally when doing so is essential to performing \"official duties.\" Without access to the secure records, the administration argues, DOGE would be unable to \"moderniz[e] the federal government's technology infrastructure\" and \"detect systemic fraud.\" In April, a federal judge temporarilyblocked DOGEfrom accessing the agency's records while lower court litigation continues. Judge Ellen Hollander ordered DOGE administrators to delete all Social Security data that they had previously acquired. DOGE team members were subsequently allowed to access records after they completed mandatory background checks, training and paperwork. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Trump administration's emergency request to overturn Hollander's temporary restraining order, which barred access to SSA records. The appeals court said there is no urgent need for DOGE to access Social Security records in the interim. But on Friday the Supreme Court disagreed, allowing DOGE to access to the sensitive documents. In a second case Friday, the court similarly unblocked DOGE's access under the Freedom of Information Act, ruling that DOGE is not required to provide internal documents to a Washington watchdog group in advance of larger proceedings regarding a FOIA request. Again, the court's three liberals noted dissents. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Cory Turner The Trump administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court intervene and allow it to make personnel cuts at the Education Department.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption The Trump administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and allow the dramatic staffing cuts it has tried to make at the U.S. Department of Education. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the court on Friday to lift an injunction issued last month by a federal judge in Massachusetts and for a broader legal pause until the justices can resolve the matter. At issue is a May 22preliminary injunctionby District Court Judge Myong J. Joun, blocking President Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon from carrying out an executive ordercalling for the closure of the Education Department. Joun also ordered the administration \"to restore the Department to the status quo\" and, more specifically, to reinstate roughly 1,400 employees who were told in March they wouldlose their jobs. Those employees are technically on paid administrative leave until June 9, at which point their employment will be terminated – if the reduction-in-force is allowed. Several hundred additional employees have already chosen to take a voluntary buyout, and, with the additional cuts, the department would then have roughly half the staff it had when Trump took office. \"A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,\" Joun wrote in his May opinion. \"This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department's employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself.\" That injunction also barred Trump from following through on a pledgehe made in the Oval Officeto move management of the entire federal student loan portfolio and the department's \"special needs\" programs to other federal agencies. On June 4, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuitagreed with Joun, that the deep staffing cuts would have made it \"effectively impossible for the Department to carry out its statutory functions.\" In his application to the Supreme Court, Sauer wrote on behalf of the Trump administration that \"the government has been crystal clear in acknowledging that only Congress can eliminate the Department of Education\" and that these staffing cuts were not part of a department gutting but simply an effort at \"streamlining\" and thus well within the Executive's purview. \"The Constitution vests the Executive Branch, not district courts, with the authority to make judgments about how many employees are needed to carry out an agency's statutory functions,\" Sauer wrote. The administration offered, as evidence that it does not intend to close the department without Congressional approval,a $66.7 billion funding requestfor fiscal year 2026. The case is the consolidation of two separate cases, each brought in March in response to the administration's sweeping moves to shrink and eventually close the Education Department. The plaintiffs include 20 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), two school districts and other unions. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Sea turtle Dilly Dally released into the ocean with three flippers after undergoing amputation",
    "article_text": "By Alana Wise An adolescent loggerhead sea turtle named Dilly Dally, whose front flipper was amputated after she was rescued in January suffering from predator wounds, crawls toward the Atlantic Ocean after being released, on the beach in front of Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Fla., Wednesday, June 4, 2025.Rebecca Blackwell/APhide caption Dilly Dally, a loggerhead turtle who survived a run-in with a predator that ultimately cost her a front flipper, has been released from a Florida animal hospital back into the Atlantic Ocean. \"No dallying here! Dilly Dally is back home,\" the Loggerhead Marinelife Center (LMC), a sea turtle conservation institute, wrote in aWednesday poston Facebook. \"We are so happy to see Dilly back in the ocean safe and sound!\" The post included a video of Dilly Dally swimming in a pool,  sans her right front flipper, shortly before veterinary staff transported her to the ocean's shore. Waiting for her at the beach, dozens of supporters watched as the nearly 160-pound reptile was gently placed on the sand, where she slowly pushed herself back into the Atlantic waters. Dilly Dally, an adolescent loggerhead,first arrivedat the LMC back in January after being attacked by a predator. Three weeks after her arrival, Dilly Dally went under the knife to remove the damaged appendage. Despite a few wound complications during her five-month stay at the animal hospital, Dilly Dally now joins fellow rehabilitated loggerheads,Falafel— a fellow amputee — andScout, in their return to the wild. Dilly Dally, like other turtles treated and re-released by the LMC, will be tracked via satellite attached to her shell to chart her movements and monitor her re-acclimation to living in the wild. Organizations like the LMC prioritize helping heal and protect sea turtles like loggerheads, amid ongoing threats to the endangered creatures' dwindling population — estimated at only about6.5 millionleft in the wild. Worldwide, the animals and their eggs face the threat of poaching, accidental catching by fishermen and habitat degradation as a result of climate change, pollution and other factors. TheWorld Wildlife Fundreports that of the seven species of sea turtles across the world, three are endangered — including two that are listed as critically endangered. A 2023 study published in theZoological Society of London's journalAnimal Conservationthat sought to track reproduction among female loggerhead amputees wrote that \"limb amputation is a well-known phenomenon in sea turtles,\" and the creatures are able to recover well and relearn to swim after rehabilitation. The paper concluded that among sea turtles who had suffered amputations, adult females were able to swim ashore in order to nest, but the damaged appendages put them at greater risk from terrestrial threats during the process.

    "title": "He led George W. Bush's PEPFAR program to stop AIDS. Now he fears for its future",
    "article_text": "By Melody Schreiber In this 2007 photograph, President George W. Bush holds Baron Mosima Loyiso Tantoh, 4, whose mother Kunene Tantoh, left, is HIV positive and who worked with a program for mothers with HIV in Cape Town that was supported by U.S. funds. At that time, Bush was asking Congress to approve $30 billion over the next five years for PEPFAR, the program that he'd established in 2003 to combat the spread of AIDS.Carol T. Powers/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption About two decades ago, Namibia was one of the hardest-hit countries in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. More than one in three adults tested positive for HIV. Dr. Mark Dybul remembers visiting a clinic in rural Namibia and meeting a woman and her baby. She was HIV-positive and was terrified of passing the virus on to the child. She named her baby No Hope in the local language. \"That's one of the most devastating things you could ever hear,\" Dybul says. The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, soon changed everything. President George W. Bush created PEPFAR in 2003 and reauthorized it in 2008. Dybul was the principal architect of PEPFAR while he was at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he was later appointed U.S. global AIDS coordinator. PEPFAR has since given out billions every year to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with programs like free drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission and widespread treatment of HIV-positive people to keep the virus from progressing to AIDS and to keep it from being spread to others. The State Department has credited it with saving 26 million lives so far. In an interview with NPR this week, Dybul tells a story about how he went back to Namibia and \"here she was — and here that child was, four years later, because of the support from the American people that provided the antiretroviral therapy to her, which prevented her child from actually getting the virus\" — which can be passed from mother-to-child not only during delivery but with breastfeeding. Dr. Mark Dybul addresses a Senate hearing on global health issues in 2015. He was an architect of PEPFAR, the program created by President George W. Bush to stop the spread of AIDS. Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and brought more stability to countries hard hit by the virus, he says.Alex Wong/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption Now the future of PEPFAR is hazy. On Tuesday, President Trump asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid that lawmakers had already approved in 2024 and 2025 budgets — including $400 million allocated to PEPFAR. The cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases. It's part of an ask, known as a rescission request, that would eliminate a total of $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The move would codify cuts already made by the U.S Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which dismantled USAID and absorbed it into the U.S. State Department in the first months of Trump's term and dramatically reduced PEPFAR's reach. NPR asked the State Department to comment on the impact of aid cuts on PEPFAR. The State Department did not respond in time for our deadline for publication. Congress now has 45 days to respond to Trump's memo. The move comes after a Marchrulingby U.S. District Judge Amir Ali that the Trump administration acted \"unlawfully\" by halting foreign aid without Congress's approval. The rescission request \"put the ball squarely in Congress's court,\" says Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention organization receiving PEPFAR funds that led the lawsuit. \"Congress, at least to date, has moved not at all. The question really is, will they act?\" Warren asks. Some members of Congress have signaled they want to keep PEPFAR from being slashed — so PEPFAR's future is still uncertain. Nonetheless, it has been an up-and-down year for PEPFAR. The program's work wasinitially haltedin the days following Trump's inauguration. A few weeks later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed PEPFAR to resume operations again — but only or treatment of existing HIV-positive patients andHIV preventionmeasures for pregnant and breastfeeding women. That doesn't represent everyone at risk for HIV infection. There are still 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, which means the pool of people who need treatment will grow rapidly without more prevention, Warren says. These cuts do \"exactly the opposite of what this administration says they want to do, which is to get countries to own their AIDS response and own their budget,\" Warren says. \"We all want to see that transition, but we're making it harder for countries by not helping them reduce the burden of treatment programs. And in fact, we're going to add to it.\" Dybul agrees. \"It's important to note that this was never intended to be a forever program,\" he says in his NPR interview. \"But if we don't stay in the game, all of those gains will be lost.\" \"Eventually we should be in a position where there is no PEPFAR. But it can't be done overnight,\" Dybul says. He still remembers how \"absolutely catastrophic\" HIV was only a few decades ago. The epidemic was particularly brutal because HIV often kills young people in the prime of their lives, Dybul says. \"You would have entire villages run by orphans because all the adults were gone. Countries could have ceased to exist. That's how devastating it was.\" Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and made hard-hit countries like Namibia more stable, he says. And U.S. assistance also offered hope, Dybul says. Because of PEPFAR, \"no one would any longer name their child No Hope,\" he says. Without it, there \"is a hopelessness that occurs when you see everyone dying around you, you think you're going to die,\" Dybul says.

    "title": "Anti-vaccine quack hired by RFK Jr. has started work at the health department",
    "article_text": "David Geier was previously disciplined for practicing medicine without a license. Notorious anti-vaccine advocate David Geierhas begun working at the US Department of Health and Human Services and is seeking access to sensitive vaccine safety data that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had previously barred him from accessing—at least twice—according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. Geier and his father, Mark Geier, who died in March, are known for peddling the thoroughly debunked falsehood that vaccines cause autism, publishing a long list of dubious articles in low-quality journals that push the idea. In particular, the two have blamed the mercury-containing vaccine preservative, thimerosal, despitenumerousstudiesfinding no link. Thimerosal was largely abandoned from vaccine formulations in 2001 out of an abundance of caution. In 2011, an investigation by the Maryland State Board of Physicians found that the Geiers were misdiagnosing autistic children and treating them with potent hormone therapies in a treatment they dubbed the \"Lupron Protocol.\" Mark Geier was stripped of his medical license. David Geier, who has no medical or scientific background and holds only a bachelor's degree, was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license. The disciplinary action didn't stop health secretary and fellow anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from hiring David Geier to the health department this year. His employment was initially reported in March by The Washington Post. At the time, reporting indicated that Geier would be involved in leading a federal study on vaccines and autism. However,in a May 14 Senate hearing, Kennedy clarified Geier's role at the health department in response to questions from Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH). Kennedy said Geier wasn't hired to do research, but to examine data collected by theCDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink(VSD). The project studies long-term vaccine safety data, monitoring for severe and rare side effects, via data harvested from electronic medical records at 13 health care sites nationwide. Kennedy alleges that data is missing from the VSD database, alluding to a long-held conspiracy theory among anti-vaccine advocates that the CDC and officials around the world covered up data linking thimerosal to autism. Outside researchers can request access to VSD data by submitting study proposals to the CDC. The Geiers have, in the past, gained access. But, they lost that access at least twice, the Journal reported. In 2004, the CDC kicked the Geiers out after officials determined that they had misrepresented their plans for the data when they initially submitted their proposal to the CDC. They were barred again in 2006. Now an HHS employee, Geier is seeking access to the data once again. The Journal reports that Kennedy has assigned researchers at the National Institutes of Health to assist Geier and that those NIH employees have sent a request to the CDC to hand over all of VSD's data. This request reportedly caused alarm at the CDC and the project's health care sites around the country, which are concerned about protecting the security of private patient data. It's unclear whether Geier has regained access to the data. But people familiar with the matter told the Journal that Geier aims to reanalyze the CDC's data on thimerosal to try to prove a link to autism. The sources also said that Geier is interested in proving that the CDC is corrupt. In the May hearing, Kennedy, who also supports the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, defended Geier. Kennedy said that \"there has been a lot of monkey business with the VSD” and that Geier is \"the only living independent scientist\" who has seen the data and can determine if it has been altered. (Hassan interjected that Geier is not a scientist.) Kennedy also falsely claimed that a court overturned the medical board's finding that he had practiced medicine without a license and awarded Geier $5 million. That did not happen. But Kennedy may have been referring to the fact that Mark Geier filed a lawsuit against the medical board over a 2012 cease-and-desist order that alleged he improperly prescribed medication for himself, his wife, and his son while his medical license was suspended. Mark Geier sued the board, saying the order was malicious because it contained personal information, including the medications Geier had prescribed. A Circuit Court sided with the Geiers, awarding themnearly $5 million in total. But the win and the award wereoverturned on appealin 2019.

    "title": "Anthropic releases custom AI chatbot for classified spy work",
    "article_text": "\"Claude Gov\" is already handling classified information for the US government. On Thursday, Anthropicunveiledspecialized AI models designed for US national security customers. The company released \"Claude Gov\" models that were built in response to direct feedback from government clients to handle operations such as strategic planning, intelligence analysis, and operational support. The custom models reportedly already serve US national security agencies, with access restricted to those working in classified environments. The Claude Gov models differ from Anthropic's consumer and enterprise offerings, also calledClaude, in several ways. They reportedly handle classified material, \"refuse less\" when engaging with classified information, and are customized to handle intelligence and defense documents. The models also feature what Anthropic calls \"enhanced proficiency\" in languages and dialects critical to national security operations. Anthropic says the new models underwent the same \"safety testing\" as all Claude models. The company has been pursuing government contracts as it seeks reliable revenue sources,partnering with Palantirand Amazon Web Services in November to sell AI tools to defense customers. Anthropic is not the first company to offer specialized chatbot services for intelligence agencies. In 2024, Microsoftlaunchedan isolated version of OpenAI's GPT-4 for the US intelligence community after 18 months of work. That system, which operated on a special government-only network without Internet access, became available to about 10,000 individuals in the intelligence community for testing and answering questions. Of course, using AI models for intelligence analysis raises concerns aboutconfabulation, where the models generate plausible-sounding, inaccurate information. Since AI neural networks operate on statistical probabilities rather than functioning as databases, they can potentially misinform intelligence agencies if not used properly. For example, the models may produce convincing but incorrect summaries or analyses of sensitive data, creating risks when accuracy is critical for national security decisions. Anthropic joins other major AI companies competing for lucrative government work,reports TechCrunch. OpenAI is working to build closer ties with the US Defense Department, while Meta recently made its Llama models available to defense partners. Google is developing a version of its Gemini AI model that can operate within classified environments. Business-focused AI company Cohere is also collaborating with Palantir to deploy its models for government use. The push into defense work represents a shift for some AI companies that previously avoided military applications. These specialized government models often require different capabilities than consumer AI tools, including the ability to process classified information and work with sensitive intelligence data without triggering safety restrictions that might block legitimate government operations.

    "title": "Nintendo Switch 2’s faster chip can dramatically improve original Switch games",
    "article_text": "Differences range from \"nonexistent\" to \"subtle\" to \"night and day.\" The Nintendo Switch 2 is launching with a handful of new games, but for many of the people getting one this week, the main thing to play on it is software made for the original Switch. We’veknown for monthsthat the Switch 2 would maintain backward compatibility with the vast majority of Switch games, but one major question was whether the Switch 2’s improved hardware would benefit older Switch games in some way. Especially in recent years, first- and third-party Switch games have struggled with the original system’s aging Nvidia chipset, which was already a bit dated when the system came out in 2017. After a day or so of testing various Switch games on the Switch 2, we can report firsthand that Switch gamescanlook dramatically better on the new system. For games that Nintendo has taken the trouble to update—those with Switch 2 upgrade packs and those with free updates—players can expect higher resolutions, better frame rates, less texture and character pop-in, and smoother animations all around. Even games that haven’t been updated for the Switch 2 can run a bit more consistently on the new systems, though games without Switch 2-specific updates don’t improve as much as games with updates. What follows is far from a comprehensive list of how every Switch game will perform on the Switch 2. But if you were someone frustrated by the Switch’s performance who hoped a new console could help some of these older games, the news for you is almost universally good. Based on what we've played so far, I would separate Nintendo Switch games running on the Switch 2 into four broad categories: We'll go over the kinds of improvements we noticed one category at a time. Video and most screenshots were captured with anElgato 4K XUSB capture device, though some screenshots were taken directly from the console for handheld mode observations. When docked, screenshots and videos are at 4K for the Switch 2 and 1080p for the Switch, and Switch 1 screenshots have been upscaled to show detail. These games cost money and explicitly promise to make huge improvements, so it should be no surprise that running the Switch 2 Edition ofTears of the Kingdomfeels like running a different game. Resolutions are clearly higher, and frame rates, even in challenging sections of the game like Kakariko Village, are stable and smooth, as our captured videos clearly show. I spent the most time looking at three different titles Nintendo updated—Super Mario Odyssey,Pokémon Violet, andLink's Awakening—and what's impressive is that these games also feel kind of like Switch 2 Editions. Pokémonshows the most dramatic improvement, and this free update should probably be considered a Switch 2 Edition upgrade that is being given out for free as an apology for how poorly these games run on the original Switch. Compare our sample footage from the Switch and Switch 2 and you'll immediately notice the difference in frame rate (from sub-30 to a mostly stable 60), resolution, and texture pop-in. Character models in the distance no longer animate at a lower frame rate than those in the foreground. There's still quite a bit of pop-in, and the game's occasionally ugly textures and geometry are still intact, but it's dramatically more pleasant to play than it used to be. For games that ranmostlyfine on the original Switch, the upgrades are more subtle but still impressive. Compare these detailed screenshots from the Switch and Switch 2 runningMario Odyssey. If the Switch isn't running these games at native 4K, it's definitely rendering them at a higher resolution than the Switch is capable of. New texture details in Mario's clothing and furniture are more clearly visible. There's also a screenshot from the Switch 2 running in handheld mode—it's a little harder to tell because the compression artifacts are worse, but if you zoom in on fine details, you can see that the game looks better in handheld mode on Switch 2 than it looks while it's docked on the Switch 1. And the comparison to the 720p Switch 1 in handheld mode is pretty close to night and day. It's pretty much the same story forLink's Awakening. Fine detail is much more visible, and the 3D is less aliased-looking because the Switch 2 is running the game at a higher resolution. Even the fairly aggressive background blur the game uses looks toned down on the Switch 2. The videos of these games aren't quite as obviously impressive as thePokémonones, but they give you a sense of the higher resolution on the Switch 2 and the way that the Switch's small endemic frame rate hiccups are no longer a problem. For the last two categories of games, we won't be waxing as poetic about the graphical improvements because there aren't many. In fact, some of these games we played looked ever-so-subtly worse on the Switch 2 in handheld mode, likely a side effect of a 720p handheld-mode image being upscaled to the Switch 2's 1080p native resolution. That said, we still noticed minor graphical improvements. InKirby Star Allies, for example, the 3D elements in the picture looked mostly the same, with roughly the same resolution, same textures, and similar overall frame rates. But 2D elements of the UI did still seem to be aware that the console is outputting a 4K image and are visibly sharper as a result. If you were hoping that all games would get some kind of \"free\" resolution or frame rate boost from the Switch 2, that mostly doesn't happen. Games likeKirby's Return to Dream Land DeluxeandPokémon Legends Arceus, neither of which got any kind of Switch 2-specific update, look mostly identical on both consoles. If you get right up close and do some pixel peeping, you canoccasionallysee places where outputting a 4K image instead of a 1080p image will look better on a 4K TV, but it's nothing like what we saw in the other games we tested. However, it does seem that the Switch 2mayhelp out somewhat in terms of performance consistency. Observe the footage of a character running around town inPokémon Legends—the resolution, draw distance, and overall frame rate all look pretty much the same. But the minor frame rate dips and hitches you see on the Switch 1 seem to have been at leastpartiallyaddressed on the Switch 2. Your mileage will vary, of course. But youmayencounter cases where a game targeting a stable 30 fps on the Switch 1 will hit that 30 fps with a bit more consistency on the Switch 2. Not all Switch games are handling the transition smoothly; some gameswill need updates before they run at all, to say nothing of visual or functional enhancements. Nintendo has completed basic compatibility testing for the Switch 2 and has posted the resultshere; most games should run fine, but the company has listed those that need fixes. Regardless, it's clear that game developers that put in the work can significantly improve their Switch releases on the Switch 2 without breaking compatibility with the original console. It's unclear how much work it is for a given developer to make these changes, but hopefully, we'll see more third-party releases get updates that take advantage of the new console, since any game made for the original Switch can still net developers a sale if someone buys it for the Switch 2.

    "title": "Ted Cruz bill: States that regulate AI will be cut out of $42B broadband fund",
    "article_text": "Cruz attempt to tie broadband funding to AI laws called \"undemocratic and cruel.\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wants to enforce a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation by making states ineligible for broadband funding if they try to impose any limits on development of artificial intelligence. The House previouslyapproved a budget billthat contained a fairly straightforward provision to banstate AI regulationfor 10 years. Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, yesterday releasedbudget reconciliation textthat takes a different approach to preventing states from regulating AI. Cruz's approach may be an attempt to get around the Senate'sByrd Rule, which limits the inclusion of \"extraneous matter\" in budget reconciliation legislation. He wants to make it impossible for states to receive money from the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program if they try to regulate AI. Cruz released asummarythat says his bill \"forbids states collecting BEAD money from strangling AI deployment with EU-style regulation.\" Thebill textprovides an extra $500 million for the BEAD program, which was created to subsidize the construction of new or expanded broadband networks. Cruz's bill says that BEAD may be used for its original purpose of subsidizing broadband service and \"to construct and deploy infrastructure for the provision of... artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems.\" The bill goes on to say that receipt of BEAD funds is conditioned on compliance with a 10-year moratorium on AI regulation. No money would be given to any state or territory that enforces \"any law or regulation... limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.\" Consumer advocacy group Public Citizensaidthat Cruz's \"attempt to tie broadband funding to AI deregulation is undemocratic and cruel.\" \"Under the committee's proposal, states would be barred from enforcing their own AI protections as a condition of receiving broadband funds meant to expand Internet access to underserved communities,\" the group said. Public Citizen advocate J.B. Branch said that \"with this move, Republicans are telling millions of Americans: 'You can have broadband but only if your state gives up the right to protect you from AI abuses.'\" The BEAD program is separately undergoing an overhaul because Republicans don't like how it was administered by Democrats. The Biden administration spent about three years developing rules and procedures for BEAD and then evaluating plans submitted by each US state and territory, but the Trump administration hasdelayed grantswhile it rewrites the rules. While Biden's Commerce Department decided to prioritize the building of fiber networks, Republicans have pushed for a \"tech-neutral approach\" that would benefit cable companies, fixed wireless providers, and Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnickpreviewed changes in March, and today heannouncedmore details of the overhaul that will eliminate the fiber preference and various requirements imposed on states. One notable but unsurprising change is that the Trump administration won't let states require grant recipients to offer low-cost Internet plans at specific rates to people with low incomes. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) \"will refuse to accept any low-cost service option proposed in a [state or territory's] Final Proposal that attempts to impose a specific rate level (i.e., dollar amount),\" the Trump administrationsaid. Instead, ISPs receiving subsidies will be able to continue offering \"their existing, market driven low-cost plans to meet the statutory low-cost requirement.\" The Benton Institute for Broadband & Societycriticized the overhaul, saying that the Trump administration is investing in the cheapest broadband infrastructure instead of the best. \"Fiber-based broadband networks will last longer, provide better, more reliable service, and scale to meet communities' ever-growing connectivity needs,\" the advocacy group said. \"NTIA's new guidance is shortsighted and will undermine economic development in rural America for decades to come.\" The Trump administration's overhaul drew praise from cable lobby group NCTA-The Internet & Television Association, whose members will find it easier to obtain subsidies. \"We welcome changes to the BEAD program that will make the program more efficient and eliminate onerous requirements, which add unnecessary costs that impede broadband deployment efforts,\" NCTA said. \"These updates are welcome improvements that will make it easier for providers to build faster, especially in hard-to-reach communities, without being bogged down by red tape.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "article_text": "BadBox malware has been menacing low-cost Android devices for nearly a decade. Millions of low-cost devices for media streaming, in-vehicle entertainment, and video projection are infected with malware that turns consumer networks into platforms for distributing malware, concealing nefarious communications, and performing other illicit activities, the FBI has warned. The malware infecting these devices, known as BadBox, is based on Triada, a malware straindiscoveredin 2016 by Kaspersky Lab, which called it \"one of the most advanced mobile Trojans\" the security firm's analysts had ever encountered. It employed an impressive kit of tools, including rooting exploits that bypassed security protections built into Android and functions for modifying the Android OS's all-powerful Zygote process. Google eventually updated Android to block the methods Triada used to infect devices. A year later, Triada returned, only this time, devices came pre-infected before they reached consumers’ hands. In 2019, Googleconfirmedthat the supply-chain attack affected thousands of devices and that the company had once again taken measures to thwart it. In 2023, security firm Human Security reported on BigBox, a Triada-derived backdoor it found preinstalled onthousands of devicesmanufactured in China. The malware, which Human Security estimated was installed on 74,000 devices around the world, facilitated a range of illicit activities, including advertising fraud, residential proxy services, the creation of fake Gmail and WhatsApp accounts, and infecting other Internet-connected devices. In March, Google and a consortium of other Internet organizations took part in acoordinated actionto disrupt BadBox 2.0, a new campaign affecting more than 1 million low-priced, off-brand Android devices. The infected devices were based on the Android Open Source Project, not the Android TV OS. They also weren't certified under Google’s Play Protect security program. Human Security identified more than a dozen TV models that were impacted. It was the second BadBox disruption action in as many years. On Thursday, the FBIwarnedthat the BadBox threat remained and urged consumers to look for signs their devices may be infected. “The public is urged to evaluate IoT devices in their home for any indications of compromise and consider disconnecting suspicious devices from their networks,” the public service announcement stated. Unfortunately, there are few visible signs of such infections that can be spotted by average consumers. The FBI said possible signs are automatic connections to malicious app markets and requests to disable Play Protect. The better course of action is to look for any of the 15 models identified by Human Security and replace any that are found. People should be extra wary of low-cost devices from unknown sources.

As consumers around the world havegotten their hands on the Switch 2in the last day or so, we're still working hard to fully test the system here at the Ars Orbiting HQ. As we do, we thought we'd share some initial impressions after having Nintendo's new console in hand for 48 hours or so. Consider these first thoughts an extended version of our notes from a review in progress and a starting point for discussion of the first completely new Nintendo platform in over eight years. There's something incredibly satisfying about the magnetic \"snap\" when you plug the new Joy-Cons into the Switch 2 horizontally, and the handy release lever makes it much easier to disconnect the controllers from the tablet with one hand. Even without a physical rail holding the Joy-Cons to the system (as on the Switch), the magnetic connection feels remarkably sturdy in portable mode. Though the Switch 2's expanded Joy-Cons generally feel more comfortable for adult hands, I have noticed that the analog stick encroaches a little more on the space for the face buttons on the right Joy-Con. I've found myself accidentally nudging that analog stick with the bottom of my thumb when pressing the lower \"B\" button on the Joy-Con, a problem I never recall encountering on the original Switch. The additional quarter-pound of weight on the Switch 2 over the original Switch (with the Joy-Cons attached) might not sound like much, but I've already started to notice the extra heft during extended portable play sessions. And because the Switch 2 is a lot thinner than heavier systems like the Steam Deck, the added weight ends up digging more into your palms when supporting the system from the (pleasantly rounded) corners. I've already found myself subconsciously hooking my pinkies under the bottom of the Switch 2 tablet to help relieve the pressure on my hands at points. That's not a great sign for a system designed to be held for hours at a time. The most amazing thing about the Joy-Con mouse mode is how it manages to be functional on so many different surfaces. We've tested it on a thigh (both cloth-covered and bare), couch upholstery, a mattress, a lapdesk, and the back of a hardcover book and gotten a usable mouse sensor signal out of each. The only test that failed completely was a glass-covered tabletop, since the clear surface gives the digital camera nothing to pick up. That said, using the mouse on softer and more rounded surfaces leaves something to be desired when it comes to accuracy, especially in games that require quick movements. Mouse mode also tends to get a bit uncomfortable during extended play sessions. The thin side of a Joy-Con is just not wide enough to support your entire palm, meaning you have to force your hand into a claw-like horizontal grip just to get a good hold on the \"mouse.\" While some enterprising users arealready 3D printing solutions to this problem, Nintendo or some smart accessory maker should make a more official mouse holster to support this unique control scheme. Imagine a hybrid Switch 2 sales brochure and detailed manual stretched into a lightly interactive five-hour slog and you'll have something approachingSwitch 2 Welcome Tour. While there are a few interesting tidbits buried in its plethora of informational slides and quizzes—did you know the Switch 2 touchscreen can detect 10 fingers at once?—they're buried in an ocean of self-congratulatory PR speak and technical discussions aimed at people who have never even heard of a CPU. There are a few engaging minigames buried in there as well, including an especially fun one that asks you to mimic on-screen faces in front of an optional webcam. But unlocking those games means going on an especially annoying scavenger hunt for hidden stamps identifying every last little piece of the Switch 2 hardware, which gets incredibly annoying after a while. As an included freebie with the Switch 2 system, this would merely be tedious. As a game with a $10 asking price, it's a little insulting. After a lengthy initial setup, starting a casual GameChat session with people on your Switch 2 friends list is pretty simple (though, oddly, there seems to be no way to add new people to a GameChat after it starts). The system's internal microphone does a pretty good job picking up your voice even across a big room, and the head-tracking feature for the camera does a good job keeping you in frame even as you move. GameChat struggles a bit when it comes to screen sharing, though, sending a grainy video of your gameplay at a rough-to-watch rate of about 10 or 15 fps. This is fine if you're just glancing at what your chatmate is doing occasionally to offer some hints or support. Just don't expect it to replicate the experience of watching your favorite streamer on Twitch or anything of the like. The Switch 2's 256GB of built-in storage is plenty if you're mainly using it to play upgraded old Switch games; even an epic likeTears of the Kingdomis only about 20GB with the upgrade pack. But high-end games designed specifically for the Switch 2 can be a lot bigger: 48GB forStreet Fighter 6, nearly 60GB forCyberpunk 2077, and a whopping 69.2GB forSplit Fiction, to cite a few examples. If you plan to download games like these, you'll need to invest in a MicroSD Express card before too long. We'll have more in-depth coverage of this in the near future, but for now, suffice it to say that Switch 2 upgrades make a lot of the less performant Switch games much more bearable. This can be especially true for late-era Switch software that pushed the old hardware to its limits; after seeingTears of the Kingdomrunning at a silky smooth 60 fps on theSwitch 2, it will be hard to go back to playing the original version ever again.

    "title": "Simulations find ghostly whirls of dark matter trailing galaxy arms",
    "article_text": "Simulations suggest where we might look for the mystery material. Galaxies are far more than the sum of their stars. Long before stars even formed, dark matter clumped up and drew regular matter together with its gravity, providing the invisible scaffolding upon which stars and galaxies eventually grew. Today, nearly all galaxies are still embedded in giant “halos” of dark matter that extend far beyond their visible borders and hold them together, anchoring stars that move so quickly they would otherwise break out of their galaxy’s gravitational grip and spend their lives adrift in intergalactic space. The way dark matter and stars interact influences how galaxies change over time. But until recently, scientists had mainly only examined one side of that relationship, exploring the way dark matter pulls on normal matter. New research probes the reverse effect: whether and how normal matter might influence its dark counterpart in return. The findings could change our understanding of dark matter’s behavior and help scientists figure out how to finally detect it directly. Galaxies like our Milky Way are famous for their sparkling spiral arms, dotted with diamond-like stars and full of glowing gas and dusty tendrils. They may look like sprays of stars that sweep around the galaxy like a pinwheel, but they’re more like galactic traffic jams—pressure waves that stars and gas pass through as they whirl around the galaxy. A new study suggests they may have a ghostly shadow—trailing dark matter spirals hovering above and below them. A team of scientists found them in galaxy simulations by looking for traces of a gravitational wake left by the visible spiral arms. These artist concepts visualize our Milky Way galaxy seen face-on and edge-on. The green dotted outlines on the image at right show the rough locations where Bernet and his team found dark matter spirals in simulated galaxies like the Milky Way—in part of the halo above and below the spiral arms. We’ve known what might cause this for nearly a century. In 1943, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar—a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist—proposed the existence of something called dynamical friction. This effect happens when a massive object passes through an evenly distributed group of lighter objects. “Initially, a large particle moving through a uniform field of small particles wouldn’t feel any gravity since it would be pulled on equally from every direction,” says Marcel Bernet, a PhD candidate at The University of Barcelona. “But as it moves, it creates a wake like one made by a boat, and this wake pulls the particle from behind and slows it down, which we've seen in satellites around the Milky Way. The dwarf galaxies that orbit our own are slowing down as they spiral closer, instead of speeding up like scientists would have normally expected.” Bernet wondered whether galaxies’ spiral arms might cause a similar reaction in the dark matter halo. Others had theorized about this possibility but hadn’t examined it very closely. “For a very long time, astronomers were unaware that baryons (gas and stars) could have such an impact on dark matter, and it led us to conclude that our model for galaxy formation, which included cold dark matter, was wrong,” says Alyson Brooks, an associate professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. Brooks investigates the same kind of phenomenon, but in the cores of dwarf galaxies. “I think we are learning now that if we pay attention to what the baryons are doing, our galaxy formation models are more in agreement with observed galaxies and their mass distribution.” Bernet led a team of scientists in the hunt for this dark matter wake they thought could be hidden in galaxy evolution simulations. These programs trace galaxy behavior over immense timescales—plenty long enough for their spiral arms to rotate and potentially impact their surroundings, both seen and unseen. “Basically what you do is you set up a bunch of particles that represent things like stars, gas, and dark matter, and you let them evolve for millions of years,” Bernet says. “Human lives are much too short to witness this happening in real time. We need simulations to help us see more than the present, which is like a single snapshot of the Universe.” Several other groups already had galaxy simulations they were using to do other science, so the team asked one to see their data. When they found the dark matter imprint they were looking for, they checked for it in another group’s simulation. They found it again, and then in a third simulation as well. The dark matter spirals are much less pronounced than their stellar counterparts, but the team noted a distinct imprint on the motions of dark matter particles in the simulations. The dark spiral arms lag behind the stellar arms, forming a sort of unseen shadow. These findings add a new layer of complexity to our understanding of how galaxies evolve, suggesting that dark matter is more than a passive, invisible scaffolding holding galaxies together. Instead, it appears to react to the gravity from stars in galaxies’ spiral arms in a way that may even influence star formation or galactic rotation over cosmic timescales. It could also explain the relativelynewfound excess massalong a nearby spiral arm in the Milky Way. The fact that they saw the same effect in differently structured simulations suggests that these dark matter spirals may be common in galaxies like the Milky Way. But tracking them down in the real Universe may be tricky. Bernet says scientists could measure dark matter in the Milky Way’s disk. “We can currently measure the density of dark matter close to us with a huge precision,” he says. “If we can extend these measurements to the entire disk with enough precision, spiral patterns should emerge if they exist.” “I think these results are very important because it changes our expectations for where to search for dark matter signals in galaxies,” Brooks says. “I could imagine that this result might influence our expectation for how dense dark matter is near the solar neighborhood and could influence expectations for lab experiments that are trying to directly detect dark matter.” That’s a goal scientists have been chasing for nearly 100 years.

    "title": "A Japanese lander crashed on the Moon after losing track of its location",
    "article_text": "\"It’s not impossible, so how do we overcome our hurdles?\" A robotic lander developed by a Japanese company named ispace plummeted to the Moon's surface Thursday, destroying a small rover and several experiments intended to demonstrate how future missions could mine and harvest lunar resources. Ground teams at ispace's mission control center in Tokyo lost contact with the Resilience lunar lander moments before it was supposed to touch down in a region called Mare Frigoris, or the Sea of Cold, a basaltic plain in the Moon's northern hemisphere. A few hours later, ispace officials confirmed what many observers suspected. The mission was lost. It's the second time ispace has failed to land on the Moon in as many tries. “We wanted to make Mission 2 a success, but unfortunately we haven’t been able to land,\" said Takeshi Hakamada, the company's founder and CEO. Ryo Ujiie, ispace's chief technology officer, said the final data received from the Resilience lander—assuming it was correct—showed it at an altitude of approximately 630 feet (192 meters) and descending too fast for a safe landing. \"The deceleration was not enough. That was a fact,\" Ujiie told reporters in a press conference. \"We failed to land, and we have to analyze the reasons.\" The company said in a press release that a laser rangefinder used to measure the lander's altitude \"experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values.\" The downward-facing laser fires light pulses toward the Moon during descent, and clocks the time it takes to receive a reflection. This time delay at light speed tells the lander's guidance system how far it is above the lunar surface. But something went wrong in the altitude measurement system on Thursday. \"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing,\" ispace said. \"Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\" Controllers sent a command to reboot the lander in hopes of reestablishing communication, but the Resilience spacecraft remained silent. \"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" Hakamada said in a statement. \"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, Hakuto-R partners, government officials, and all supporters of ispace.\" The Hakuto name harkens back to ispace's origin in 2010 as a contender for the Google Lunar X-Prize, a sweepstakes that offered a $20 million grand prize to the first privately funded team to put a lander on the Moon. Hakamada's group was called Hakuto, which means \"white rabbit\" in Japanese. The prize shut down in 2018 without a winner, leading some of the teams to dissolve or find new purpose. Hakamada stayed the course, raised more funding, and rebooted the program under the name Hakuto-R. It's a story of resilience, hence the name of ispace's second lunar lander. The mission made it closer to the Moon than the ispace's first landing attempt in 2023, but Thursday's failure is a blow to Hakamada's project. \"As a fact, we tried twice and we haven’t been able to land on the Moon,\" Hakamada said through an interpreter. \"So we have to say it’s hard to land on the Moon, technically. We know it’s not easy. It’s not something that everyone can do. We know it’s hard, but the important point is it’s not impossible. The US private companies have succeeded in landing, and also JAXA in Japan has succeeded in landing, so it’s not impossible. So how do we overcome our hurdles?\" In April 2023, ispace's first lander crashed on the Moon due to a similar altitude measurement problem. The spacecraft thought it was on the surface of the Moon, but was actually firing its engine to hover at an altitude of 3 miles (5 kilometers). The spacecraft ran out of fuel and went into a free fall before impacting the Moon. Engineers blamed software as the most likely reason for the altitude-measurement problem. During descent, ispace's lander passed over a 10,000-foot-tall (3,000-meter) cliff, and the spacecraft's computer interpreted the sudden altitude change as erroneous. Ujiie, who leads ispace's technical teams, said the failure mode Thursday was \"similar\" to that of the first mission two years ago. But at least in ispace's preliminary data reviews, engineers saw different behavior from the Resilience lander, which flew with a new type of laser rangefinder after ispace's previous supplier stopped producing the device. \"From Mission 1 to Mission 2, we improved the software,\" Ujiie said. \"Also, we improved how to approach the landing site... We see different phenomena from Mission 1, so we have to do more analysis to give you any concrete answers.\" If ispace landed smoothly on Thursday, the Resilience spacecraft would have deployed a small rover developed by ispace's European subsidiary. The rover was partially funded by the Luxembourg Space Agency with support from the European Space Agency. It carried a shovel to scoop up a small amount of lunar soil and a camera to take a photo of the sample. NASA had a contract with ispace to purchase the lunar soil in a symbolic proof of concept to show how the government might acquire material from commercial mining companies in the future. The lander also carried a water electrolyzer experiment to demonstrate technologies that could split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, critical resources for a future Moon base. Other payloads aboard the Resilience spacecraft included cameras, a food production experiment, a radiation monitor, and a Swedish art project called \"MoonHouse.\" The spacecraft chassis used for ispace's first two landing attempts was about the size of a compact car, with a mass of about 1 metric ton (2,200 pounds) when fully fueled. The company's third landing attempt is scheduled for 2027 with a larger lander. Next time, ispace will fly to the Moon in partnership between the company's US subsidiary and Draper Laboratory, which has a contract with NASA to deliver experiments to the lunar surface. The Resilience lander launched in January on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, riding to space in tandem with a commercial Moon lander named Blue Ghost from Firefly Aerospace. Firefly's lander took a more direct journey to the Moon and achieved a soft landing on March 2. Blue Ghost operated on the lunar surface for two weeks and completed all of its objectives. The trajectory of ispace's lander was slower, following a lower-energy, more fuel-efficient path to the Moon before entering lunar orbit last month. Once in orbit, the lander made a few more course corrections to line up with its landing site, then commenced its final descent on Thursday. Thursday's landing attempt was the seventh time a privately developed Moon lander tried to conduct a controlled touchdown on the lunar surface. Two Texas-based companies have had the most success. One of them, Houston-based Intuitive Machines, landed its Odysseus spacecraft on the Moon in February 2024, marking the first time a commercial lander reached the lunar surface intact. But the lander tipped over after touchdown, cutting its mission short after achieving some limited objectives. A second Intuitive Machines lander reached the Moon in one piece in March of this year, but it also fell over and didn't last as long as the company's first mission. Firefly's Blue Ghost operated for two weeks after reaching the lunar surface, accomplishing all of its objectives and becoming the first fully successful privately owned spacecraft to land and operate on the Moon. Intuitive Machines, Firefly, and a third company—Astrobotic Technology—have launched their lunar missions under contract with a NASA program aimed at fostering a commercial marketplace for transportation to the Moon. Astrobotic's first lander failed soon after its departure from Earth. The first two missions launched by ispace were almost fully private ventures, with limited participation from the Japanese space agency, Luxembourg, and NASA. Commercial travel to the Moon only began in 2019, so there's not much of a track record to judge the industry's prospects. When NASA started signing contracts for commercial lunar missions, the then-chief of the agency's science vision, Thomas Zurbuchen, estimated the initial landing attempts would have a 50-50 chance of success. On the whole, NASA's experience with Intuitive Machines, Firefly, and Astrobotic isn't too far off from Zurbuchen's estimate, with one full success and a couple of partial successes. The commercial track record worsens if you include private missions from ispace and Israel's Beresheet lander. But ispace and Hakamada haven't given up on the dream. The company's third mission will launch under the umbrella of the same NASA program that contracted with Intuitive Machines, Firefly, and Astrobotic. Hakamada cited the achievements of Firefly and Intuitive Machines as evidence that the commercial model for lunar missions is a valid one. \"The ones that have the landers, there are two companies I mentioned. Also, Blue Origin maybe coming up. Also, ispace is a possibility,\" Hakamada said. \"So, very few companies. We would like to catch up as soon as possible.\" It's too early to know how the failure on Thursday might impact ispace's next mission with Draper and NASA. \"I have to admit that we are behind,\" said Jumpei Nozaki, director and chief financial officer at ispace. \"But we do not really think we are behind from the leading group yet. It’s too early to decide that. The players in the world that can send landers to the Moon are very few, so we still have some competitive edge.\" \"Honestly, there were some times I almost cried, but I need to lead this company, and I need to have a strong will to move forward, so it’s not time for me to cry,\" Hakamada said.

    "title": "What to expect from Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week",
    "article_text": "We expect to see new designs, new branding, and more at Apple's WWDC 2025. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday with the company's standard keynote presentation—a combination of PR about how great Apple and its existing products are and a first look at the next-generation versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the company's other operating systems. Reporting before the keynote rarely captures everything that Apple has planned at its presentations, but the reliable information we've seen so far is that Apple will keep the focus on its software this year rather than using the keynote to demo splashy new hardware like theVision ProandApple Silicon Mac Pro, which the company introduced at WWDC a couple years back. If you haven't been keeping track, here are a few of the things that are most likely to happen when the pre-recorded announcement videos start rolling next week. Reliable reports from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have been saying for months that Apple's operating systems are getting a design overhaul at WWDC. The company apparently plans to use the design of the Vision Pro's visionOS software as a jumping-off point for the new designs, introducing more transparency and UI elements that appear to be floating on the surface of your screen. Apple's overarching goal, according to Gurman, is to \"simplify the way users navigate and control their devices\" by \"updating the style of icons, menus, apps, windows and system buttons.\" Any good software redesign needs to walk a tightrope between freshening up an old look and solving old problems without changing peoples' devices so much that they become unrecognizable and unfamiliar. The number of people who have complained to me about the iOS 18-era redesign of the Photos app suggests to me that Apple doesn't always strike the right balance. But a new look can also generate excitement and encourage upgrades more readily than some of the low-profile or under-the-hood improvements that these updates normally focus on. The redesigned UI should be released simultaneously for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. The Mac last received a significant facelift back in 2020 with macOS 11 Big Sur, though this was overshadowed at the time by the much more significant shift from Intel's chips to Apple Silicon. The current iOS and iPadOS design has its roots in 2013's iOS 7, though with over a decade's worth of gradual evolution on top. With the new design will apparently come a new naming scheme, shifting from the current version numbers to new numbers based on the year. So we allegedly won't be seeing iOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, or visionOS 3—instead, we'll get iOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26. The new numbers might be a little confusing at first, especially for the period of overlap where Apple is actively supporting (say) macOS 14, macOS 15, and macOS 26. But in the long run, the consistency should make it easier to tell roughly how old your software is and will also make it easier to tell whether your device is running current software without having to remember the number for each of your individual devices. It also unifies the approach to anynewoperating system variants Apple might announce—tvOS starts at version 9 and iPadOS starts at version 13, for example, because they were linked to the then-current iOS release. But visionOS and watchOS both started over from 1.0, and the macOS version is based on the year that Applearbitrarily decided to endthe 20-year-old \"macOS X\" branding and jump up to 11. Note that those numbers will use theupcomingyear rather than the current year—iOS 26 will be Apple's latest and greatest OS for about three months in 2025, assuming the normal September-ish launch, but it will be the main OS for nine months in 2026. Apple usually also waits until later in the fall or winter to start forcing people onto the new OS, issuing at least a handful of security-only updates for the outgoing OS for people who don't want to be guinea pigs for a possibly buggy new release. Gurman hasreportedthat Apple had \"no major new devices ready to ship\" this year. Applegenerallyconcentrates its hardware launches to the spring and fall, with quieter and lower-profile launches in the spring and bigger launches in the fall, anchored by the tentpole that is the iPhone. But WWDC has occasionally been a launching point for new Macs (because Macs are the only systems that run Xcode, Apple's development environment) and occasionally brand-new platforms (because getting developers on board with new platforms is one way to increase their chances of success). But the best available information suggests that neither of those things is happening this time around. There are possibilities, though. Apple has apparently been at work behind the scenes on expanding its smart home footprint, and the eternally neglected Mac Pro is still using an M2 Ultra whenan M3 Ultra already exists. But especially with a new redesign to play up, we'd expect Apple to keep the spotlight on its software this time around. It's been five years since Apple started moving from Intel's chips to its own custom silicon in Macs and two years since Apple sold its last Intel Macs. And since the very start of the transition, Apple has resisted providing a firm answer to the question of when Intel Macs will stop getting new macOS updates. Our analysis of years of support datasuggests two likely possibilities: that Apple releases one more new version of macOS for Intel Macs before shifting to a couple years of security-only updates or that Apple pulls the plug and shifts to security-only updatesthisyear. Rumors suggest that current betas still run on the last couple rounds of Intel Macs, dropping support for some older or slower models introduced between 2018 and 2020. If that's true, there's a pretty good chance it's the last new macOS version to officially support Intel CPUs. Regardless, we'll know more when the first betas drop after the keynote. Even if the new version of macOS supports some Intel Macs, expect the list of features that require Apple Silicon to keep getting longer. The perennial complaint about high-end iPads is that the hardware is a lot more capable than the software allows it to be. And every couple of years, Apple takes another crack at making the iPad a viable laptop replacement by improving the state of multitasking on the platform. This will allegedly beanother one of those years. We don't know much about what form these multitasking improvements will take—whether they're a further refinement of existing features like Stage Manager or something entirely new. The changes have been described as \"more like macOS,\" but that could mean pretty much anything. People play plenty of games on Apple's devices, but they still aren't really a \"destination\" for gaming in the same way that a dedicated console or Windows PC is. The company is apparently hoping to change that with a newunified appfor games. Like Valve's Steam, the app will reportedly serve as a storefront, launcher, and achievement tracker, and will also facilitate communication between friends playing the same game. Apple took a similar stab at this idea in the early days of the iPhone with Game Center, which still exists as a service in the background on modern Apple devices but was discontinued as a standalone app quite a few years ago. Apple has been trying for a few years now to make its operating systems more hospitable to gaming, especially in macOS. The company has added a low-latency Game Mode to macOS and comprehensive support for modern wireless gamepads from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. The company'sGame Porting Toolkitstops short of being a consumer-friendly way to run Windows games on macOS, but it does give developers of Windows games an easier on-ramp for testing and porting their games to Apple's platforms. We'll see whether a unified app can help any of these other gaming features gel into something that feels cohesive. One of Apple's long-simmering behind-the-scenes hardware projects is apparentlya new kind of smart home devicethat weds the HomePod's current capabilities with a vaguely Apple TV-like touchscreen interface. In theory, this device would compete with the likes of Amazon's Echo Show devices. Part of those plans involve a \"new\" operating system to replace what is known to the public as \"HomePod Software\" (and internally as audioOS). This so-called \"homeOS\" has been rumored for a bit, andsome circumstantial evidencepoints to some possible pre-WWDC trademark activity around that name. Like the current HomePod software—and just about every other OS Apple maintains—homeOS would likely be a specialized offshoot of iOS. But even if it doesn't come with new hardware right away, new branding could suggest that Apple is getting ready to expand its smart home ambitions. Finally, it wouldn't be a mid-2020s tech keynote without some kind of pronouncements about AI. Last year's WWDC was the big public unveiling of Apple Intelligence, and (nearly) every one of Apple's product announcements since then has made a point of highlighting the hardware's AI capabilities. We'd definitely expect Apple to devote some time to Apple Intelligence, but the company may be more hesitant to announce big new features in advance, following a news cycle where even normally sympathetic Apple boosters like Daring Fireball's John Gruberexcoriated the companyfor promising AI features that it was nowhere near ready to launch—or even to demo to the public. The executives handling Apple's AI effortswere reshuffledfollowing that news cycle; whether it was due to Gruber's piece or the underlying problems outlined in the article is anyone's guess. Apple will probably try to find a middle road, torn between not wanting to overpromise and underdeliver and not wanting to seem \"behind\" on the tech industry's biggest craze. There's a decent chance that the new \"more personalized\" version of Siri will finally make a public appearance. But I'd guess that Apple will focus more on iterations of existing Apple Intelligence features like summaries or Writing Tools rather than big swings.

    "article_text": "“A tale of shakedowns, sex, and vengeance that expose[s] tensions between the church and England’s elite.\" In 2019, we told you abouta new interactive digital \"murder map\"of London compiled by University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner.

The Medieval Murder Maps project has since expanded to include maps of York and Oxford homicides, as well as podcast episodes focusing on individual cases. It's easy to lose oneself down the rabbit hole of medieval murder for hours, filtering the killings by year, choice of weapon, and location. Think of it as a kind of 14th-century version ofClue: It was the noblewoman's hired assassins armed with daggers in the streets of Cheapside near St. Paul's Cathedral. And that's just the juiciest of the various cases described ina new paperpublished in the journal Criminal Law Forum. The noblewoman was Ela Fitzpayne, wife of a knight named Sir Robert Fitzpayne, lord of Stogursey. The victim was a priest and her erstwhile lover, John Forde, who was stabbed to death in the streets of Cheapside on May 3, 1337. “We are looking at a murder commissioned by a leading figure of the English aristocracy,\"said University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner, who heads the Medieval Murder Maps project. \"It is planned and cold-blooded, with a family member and close associates carrying it out, all of which suggests a revenge motive.\" Members of the mapping project geocoded all the cases after determining approximate locations for the crime scenes. Written in Latin, the coroners' rolls are records of sudden or suspicious deaths as investigated by a jury of local men, called together by the coroner to establish facts and reach a verdict. Those records contain such relevant information as where the body was found and by whom; the nature of the wounds; the jury's verdict on cause of death; the weapon used and how much it was worth; the time, location, and witness accounts; whether the perpetrator was arrested, escaped, or sought sanctuary; and any legal measures taken. The murder of Forde was one of several premeditated revenge killings recorded in the area of Westcheap. Forde was walking on the street when another priest, Hascup Neville, caught up to him, ostensibly for a casual chat, just after Vespers but before sunset. As they approached Foster Lane, Neville's four co-conspirators attacked: Ela Fitzpayne's brother, Hugh Lovell; two of her former servants, Hugh of Colne and John Strong; and a man called John of Tindale. One of them cut Ford's throat with a 12-inch dagger, while two others stabbed him in the stomach with long fighting knives. At the inquest, the jury identified the assassins, but that didn't result in justice. “Despite naming the killers and clear knowledge of the instigator, when it comes to pursuing the perpetrators, the jury turn a blind eye,” said Eisner. “A household of the highest nobility, and apparently no one knows where they are to bring them to trial. They claim Ela’s brother has no belongings to confiscate. All implausible. This was typical of the class-based justice of the day.” Colne, the former servant, was eventually charged and imprisoned for the crime some five years later in 1342, but the other perpetrators essentially got away with it. Eisner et al. uncovered additional historical records that shed more light on the complicated history and ensuing feud between the Fitzpaynes and Forde. One was an indictment in the Calendar of Patent Rolls of Edward III, detailing how Ela and her husband, Forde, and several other accomplices raided a Benedictine priory in 1321. Among other crimes, the intruders \"broke [the prior's] houses, chests and gates, took away a horse, a colt and a boar... felled his trees, dug in his quarry, and carried away the stone and trees.\" The gang also stole 18 oxen, 30 pigs, and about 200 sheep and lambs. There were also letters that the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to the Bishop of Winchester. Translations of the letters are published for the first time on the project's website. The archbishop called out Ela by name for her many sins, including adultery \"with knights and others, single and married, and even with clerics and holy orders,\" and devised a punishment. This included not wearing any gold, pearls, or precious stones and giving money to the poor and to monasteries, plus a dash of public humiliation. Ela was ordered to perform a \"walk of shame\"—a tamer version thanCersei's walk inGame of Thrones—every fall for seven years, carrying a four-pound wax candle to the altar of Salisbury Cathedral. Ela outright refused to do any of that, instead flaunting \"her usual insolence.\" Naturally, the archbishop had no choice but to excommunicate her. But Eisner speculates that this may have festered within Ela over the ensuing years, thereby sparking her desire for vengeance on Forde—who may have confessed to his affair with Ela to avoid being prosecuted for the 1321 raid. The archbishop died in 1333, four years before Forde's murder, so Ela was clearly a formidable person with the patience and discipline to serve her revenge dish cold. Her marriage to Robert (her second husband) endured despite her seemingly constant infidelity, and she inherited his property when he died in 1354. “Attempts to publicly humiliate Ela Fitzpayne may have been part of a political game, as the church used morality to stamp its authority on the nobility, with John Forde caught between masters,”said Eisner. “Taken together, these records suggest a tale of shakedowns, sex, and vengeance that expose tensions between the church and England’s elites, culminating in a mafia-style assassination of a fallen man of god by a gang of medieval hitmen.” I, for one, am here for the Netflix true crime documentary on Ela Fitzpayne, “a woman in 14th century England who raided priories, openly defied the Archbishop of Canterbury, and planned the assassination of a priest,\"per Eisner. The ultimate objective of the Medieval Murder Maps project is to learn more about how public spaces shaped urban violence historically, the authors said. There were some interesting initial revelations back in 2019. For instance, the murders usually occurred in public streets or squares, and Eisner identified a couple of \"hot spots\" with higher concentrations than other parts of London. One was that particular stretch of Cheapside running from St Mary-le-Bow church to St. Paul's Cathedral, where John Forde met his grisly end. The other was a triangular area spanning Gracechurch, Lombard, and Cornhill, radiating out from Leadenhall Market. The perpetrators were mostly men (in only four cases were women the only suspects). As for weapons, knives and swords of varying types were the ones most frequently used, accounting for 68 percent of all the murders. The greatest risk of violent death in London was on weekends (especially Sundays), between early evening and the first few hours after curfew. Eisner et al. have now extended their spatial analysis to include homicides committed in York and London in the 14th century with similar conclusions. Murders most often took place in markets, squares, and thoroughfares—all key nodes of medieval urban life—in the evenings or on weekends. Oxford had significantly higher murder rates than York or London and also more organized group violence, \"suggestive of high levels of social disorganization and impunity.\" London, meanwhile, showed distinct clusters of homicides, \"which reflect differences in economic and social functions,\" the authors wrote. \"In all three cities, some homicides were committed in spaces of high visibility and symbolic significance.\" Criminal Law Forum, 2025.

    "title": "Startup puts a logical qubit in a single piece of hardware",
    "article_text": "Nord Quantique's plan for error correction involves far less hardware. Everyone in quantum computing agrees that error correction will be the key to doing a broad range of useful calculations. But early every company in the field seems to have a different vision of how best to get there. Almost all of their plans share a key feature: some variation on logical qubits built by linking together multiple hardware qubits. A key exception isNord Quantique, which aims to dramatically cut the amount of hardware needed to support an error-corrected quantum computer. It does this by putting enough quantum states into a single piece of hardware, allowing each of those pieces to hold an error-corrected qubit. Last week, the company shared results showing that it could make hardware that used photons at two different frequencies to successfully identify every case where a logical qubit lost its state. That still doesn't provide error correction, and they didn't use the logical qubit to perform operations. But it's an important validation of the company's approach. Nord Quantique's hardware is similar to what we describedin a recent articleabout using a single piece of hardware to host quantum systems that store information in three or more states. It involves putting a bunch of microwave photons into a resonator and creating a quantum oscillator with multiple modes, which allows information to be stored in those modes. In the earlier work, researchers used these modes to create a system that could be in as many as four states—instead of the hardware hosting a qubit, it was used to hold either a qutrit or ququart. The state of this sort of system is monitored using a different type of qubit, called a transmon, that is physically linked to the resonator. A bit over a year ago, Nord Quantique used a similar setup to show that it could be used toidentify the most common form of errorin these devices, one in which the system loses one of its photons. \"We can store multiple microwave photons into each of these cavities, and the fact that we have redundancy in the system comes exactly from this,\" said Nord Quantique's CTO, Julien Camirand Lemyre. However, this system was unable to handle many of the less common errors that might also occur. This time around, the company is showing that it can get an actual logical qubit into a variant of the same hardware. In the earlier version of its equipment, the resonator cavity had a single post and supported a single frequency. In the newer iteration, there were two posts and two frequencies. Each of those frequencies creates its own quantum resonator in the same cavity, with its own set of modes. \"It's this ensemble of photons inside this cavity that creates the logical qubit,\" Lemyre told Ars. The additional quantum information that can now be stored in the system enables it to identify more complex errors than the loss of a photon. The company did two experiments with this new hardware. First, it ran multiple rounds of error detection on data stored in the logical qubit, essentially testing its ability to act like a quantum memory and retain the information stored there. Without correcting errors, the system rapidly decayed, with an error probability in each round of measurement of about 12 percent. By the time the system reached the 25th measurement, almost every instance had already encountered an error. The second time through, the company repeated the process, discarding any instances in which an error occurred. In almost every instance, that meant the results were discarded long before they got through two dozen rounds of measurement. But at these later stages, none of the remaining instances were in an erroneous state. That indicates that a successful correction of the errors—something the team didn't try—would be able to fix all the detected problems. \"When we do this, we don't have any errors left,\" Lemyre said. \"And this builds confidence into this approach, meaning that if we build the next generation of codes that is now able to correct these errors that were detected in this two-mode approach, we should have that flat line of no errors occurring over a long period of time.\" Several other companies have already performed experiments in which errors were detected—and corrected. In a few instances, companies have even performed operations with logical qubits, although these were not sophisticated calculations. Nord Quantique, in contrast, is only showing the operation of a single logical qubit, so it's not even possible to test a two-qubit gate operation using the hardware it has described so far. So simply being able to identify the occurrence of errors is not on the cutting edge. Why is this notable? All the other companies require multiple hardware qubits to host a single logical qubit. Since building many hardware qubits has been an ongoing challenge, most researchers have plans to minimize the number of hardware qubits needed to support a logical qubit—some combination of high-quality hardware, a clever error correction scheme, and/or a hardware-specific feature that catches the most common errors. You can view Nord Quantique's approach as being at the extreme end of the spectrum of solutions, where the number of hardware qubits required is simply one. From Nord Quantique's perspective, that's significant because it means that its hardware will ultimately occupy less space and have lower power and cooling requirements than some of its competitors. (Other hardware, like neutral atoms, requires lots of lasers and a high vacuum, so the needs are difficult to compare.) But it also means that, should it become technically difficult to get large numbers of qubits to operate as a coherent whole, Nord Quantique's approach may ultimately help us overcome some of these limits.

    "title": "GOP intensifies war against EVs and efficient cars",
    "article_text": "Get ready for less-efficient and more-polluting vehicles in the US. This week, Republicans in Congress and the executive branch stepped up their efforts to roll back clean vehicle legislation and regulations.Antipathy toward environmental protectionswas a hallmark of the first Trump administration, but in his second term, the president and his congressional allies are redoubling their efforts to allow cars to pollute more and limit the adoption of electric vehicles. Congressional republicans have been working on a budget bill that would radically transform many aspects of American life. Among the environmental protections being stripped away in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (yes, that's what it's called) is a repeal of the US Environmental Protection Agency's rules on \"greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emissions standards.\" These regulations are meant to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the US vehicle fleet, a major driver of climate change, as well as the noxious pollutants containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds that havemore immediate and deleterious effectson human health. And if the budget bill is sent to Trump to sign, the existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, implemented in 2022, andthe future rules meant to take effect next yearwill be no more. The House bill also eliminates theIRS clean vehicle tax credit, which provides up to $7,500 for buyers of some new EVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell EVs; $4,000 for buyers of some used EVs; and the commercial vehicle tax credit of $7,500 that applied to any leased EV. Tesla CEO Elon Muskis on record as supportingthe repeal of the EV tax credit, as it would hurt his rivals more than Tesla. But yesterday,Musk decriedthe fact that the spending bill does not cut subsidies for oil and gas, just EVs and solar. Yesterday in the Senate, Republicans proposed another new measure that can only be seen as pro-pollution. Should it pass, the EPA wouldno longer be able to levy finesagainst carmakers that exceed fleet averages set out in the CAFE regulations. OEMs have paid the government hundreds of millions of dollars in these fines over the past decade. (Note that these fines are different from those imposed onVolkswagenandother automakersfor circumventing efficiency standards.) This would allow OEMs to save money by removing emissions equipment from their products, and it could potentially bring back older powertrains that would otherwise be prohibited on the roads. Tesla may well be the biggest loser here, as the bill removes incentives for other automakers to purchase carbon credits. The GOP is also attacking California's ability to set its own emissions standards. That would remove another major source of emissions credits for Tesla, which are,again, increasingly importantin keeping the company's booksout of the red. Over at the Department of Transportation, similar efforts are underway. Secretary Sean Duffy'sfirst action as the head of DOTwas to begin reviewing Biden-era fuel efficiency regulations, andtoday, the department decided that it makes no sense toinclude EVs as part of its CAFE rules. At this rate, it's a wonder they're not trying to mandate coal-fired steam engines as an alternative. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "OpenAI is retaining all ChatGPT logs “indefinitely.” Here’s who’s affected.",
    "article_text": "OpenAI explains how deleted ChatGPT logs may be accessed in court battle. Late Thursday, OpenAI confronted user panic over asweeping court order requiring widespread chat log retention—including users' deleted chats—after moving to appeal the order that allegedly impacts the privacy of hundreds of millions of ChatGPT users globally. In astatement, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap explained that the court order came in a lawsuit with The New York Times and other news organizations, which alleged that deleted chats may contain evidence of users prompting ChatGPT to generate copyrighted news articles. To comply with the order, OpenAI must \"retain all user content indefinitely going forward, based on speculation\" that the news plaintiffs \"might find something that supports their case,\" OpenAI's statement alleged. The order impacts users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro, as well as users of OpenAI’s application programming interface (API), OpenAI specified in a court filing this week. But \"this does not impact ChatGPT Enterprise or ChatGPT Edu customers,\" OpenAI emphasized in its more recent statement. It also doesn't impact any user with a Zero Data Retention agreement. OpenAI plans to challenge the order and is currently pushing for oral arguments, hoping that user testimony will help sway the court to set it aside. But for now, the company claims it's forced to abandon \"long-standing privacy norms\" and weaken privacy protections that users expect based on ChatGPT's terms of service. The statement suggested that OpenAI isn't even sure if it can comply with the European Union's strict data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives users the\"right to be forgotten.\"All OpenAI could offer to reassure EU users was a note that \"we are taking steps to comply at this time because we must follow the law.\" In the copyright fight, Magistrate Judge Ona Wang granted the order within one day of the NYT's request. She agreed with news plaintiffs that it seemed likely that ChatGPT users may be spooked by the lawsuit and possibly set their chats to delete when using the chatbot to skirt NYT paywalls. Because OpenAI wasn't sharing deleted chat logs, the news plaintiffs had no way of proving that, she suggested. Now, OpenAI is not only asking Wang to reconsider but has \"also appealed this order with the District Court Judge,\" the Thursday statement said. \"We strongly believe this is an overreach by the New York Times,\" Lightcap said. \"We’re continuing to appeal this order so we can keep putting your trust and privacy first.\" To protect users, OpenAI provides anFAQthat clearly explains why their data is being retained and how it could be exposed. For example, the statement noted that the order doesn’t impact OpenAI API business customers under Zero Data Retention agreements because their data is never stored. And for users whose data is affected, OpenAI noted that their deleted chats could be accessed, but they won't \"automatically\" be shared with The New York Times. Instead, the retained data will be \"stored separately in a secure system\" and \"protected under legal hold, meaning it can’t be accessed or used for purposes other than meeting legal obligations,\" OpenAI explained. Of course, with the court battle ongoing, the FAQ did not have all the answers. Nobody knows how long OpenAI may be required to retain the deleted chats. Likely seeking to reassure users—some of which appeared to be considering switching to a rival service until the order lifts—OpenAI noted that \"only a small, audited OpenAI legal and security team would be able to access this data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "DOGE used flawed AI tool to “munch” Veterans Affairs contracts",
    "article_text": "Staffer had no medical experience, and the results were predictably, spectacularly bad. As the Trump administration prepared to cancel contracts at the Department of Veterans Affairs this year, officials turned to a software engineer with no health care or government experience to guide them. The engineer, working for the Department of Government Efficiency, quickly built an artificial intelligence tool to identify which services from private companies were not essential. He labeled those contracts “MUNCHABLE.” The code, using outdated and inexpensive AI models, produced results with glaring mistakes. For instance, it hallucinated the size of contracts, frequently misreading them and inflating their value. It concluded more than a thousand were each worth $34 million, when in fact some were for as little as $35,000. The DOGE AI tool flagged more than 2,000 contracts for “munching.” It’s unclear how many have been or are on track to be canceled—the Trump administration’s decisions on VA contracts have largely been a black box. The VA uses contractors for many reasons, including to support hospitals, research, and other services aimed at caring for ailing veterans. VA officials have said they’ve killed nearly 600 contracts overall. Congressional Democrats have been pressing VA leaders for specific details of what’s been canceled without success. We identified at least two dozen on the DOGE list that have been canceled so far. Among the canceled contracts was one to maintain a gene sequencing device used to develop better cancer treatments. Another was for blood sample analysis in support of a VA research project. Another was to provide additional tools to measure and improve the care nurses provide. ProPublica obtained the code and the contracts it flagged from a source and shared them with a half-dozen AI and procurement experts. All said the script was flawed. Many criticized the concept of using AI to guide budgetary cuts at the VA, with one calling it “deeply problematic.” Cary Coglianese, professor of law and of political science at the University of Pennsylvania who studies the governmental use and regulation of artificial intelligence, said he was troubled by the use of these general-purpose large language models, or LLMs. “I don’t think off-the-shelf LLMs have a great deal of reliability for something as complex and involved as this,” he said. Sahil Lavingia, the programmer enlisted by DOGE, which was then run by Elon Musk, acknowledged flaws in the code. “I think that mistakes were made,” said Lavingia, who worked at DOGE for nearly two months. “I’m sure mistakes were made. Mistakes are always made. I would never recommend someone run my code and do what it says. It’s like that ‘Office’ episode where Steve Carell drives into the lake because Google Maps says drive into the lake. Do not drive into the lake.” Though Lavingia has talked about his time at DOGE previously, this is the first time his work has been examined in detail and the first time he’s publicly explained his process, down to specific lines of code. Lavingia has nearly 15 years of experience as a software engineer and entrepreneur but no formal training in AI. He briefly worked at Pinterest before starting Gumroad, a small e-commerce company that nearly collapsed in 2015. “I laid off 75 percent of my company—including many of my best friends. It really sucked,” he said. Lavingia kept the company afloat by “replacing every manual process with an automated one,” according toa post on his personal blog. Lavingia did not have much time to immerse himself in how the VA handles veterans’ care between starting on March 17 and writing the tool on the following day. Yet his experience with his own company aligned with the direction of the Trump administration, which has embraced the use of AI across government to streamline operations and save money. Lavingia said the quick timeline ofTrump’s February executive order, which gave agencies 30 days to complete a review of contracts and grants, was too short to do the job manually. “That’s not possible—you have 90,000 contracts,” he said. “Unless you write some code. But even then it’s not really possible.” Under a time crunch, Lavingia said he finished the first version of his contract-munching tool on his second day on the job—using AI to help write the code for him. He told ProPublica he then spent his first week downloading VA contracts to his laptop and analyzing them. VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz lauded DOGE’s work on vetting contracts in a statement to ProPublica. “As far as we know, this sort of review has never been done before, but we are happy to set this commonsense precedent,” he said. The VA is reviewing all of its 76,000 contracts to ensure each of them benefits veterans and is a good use of taxpayer money, he said. Decisions to cancel or reduce the size of contracts are made after multiple reviews by VA employees, including agency contracting experts and senior staff, he wrote. Kasperowicz said that the VA will not cancel contracts for work that provides services to veterans or that the agency cannot do itself without a contingency plan in place. He added that contracts that are “wasteful, duplicative, or involve services VA has the ability to perform itself” will typically be terminated. Trump officials have said they are working toward a“goal” of cuttingaround 80,000 people from the VA’s workforce of nearly 500,000. Most employees work in one of the VA’s 170 hospitals and nearly 1,200 clinics. The VA has said it would avoid cutting contracts that directly impact care out of fear that it would cause harm to veterans. ProPublica recently reported that relatively small cuts at the agency have alreadybeen jeopardizing veterans’ care. The VA has not explained how it plans to simultaneously move services in-house, as Lavingia’s code suggested was the plan, while also slashing staff. Many inside the VA told ProPublica the process for reviewing contracts was so opaque they couldn’t even see who made the ultimate decisions to kill specific contracts. Once the “munching” script had selected a list of contracts, Lavingia said he would pass it off to others who would decide what to cancel and what to keep. No contracts, he said, were terminated “without human review.” “I just delivered the [list of contracts] to the VA employees,” he said. “I basically put munchable at the top and then the others below.” VA staffers told ProPublica that when DOGE identified contracts to be canceled early this year—before Lavingia was brought on—employees sometimes were given little time to justify retaining the service. One recalled being given just a few hours. The staffers asked not to be named because they feared losing their jobs for talking to reporters. According to one internal email that predated Lavingia’s AI analysis, staff members had to respond in 255 characters or fewer—just shy of the 280 character limit on Musk’s X social media platform. Once he started on DOGE’s contract analysis, Lavingia said he was confronted with technological limitations. At least some of the errors produced by his code can be traced to using older versions of OpenAI models available through the VA—models not capable of solving complex tasks, according to the experts consulted by ProPublica. Moreover, the tool’s underlying instructions were deeply flawed. Records show Lavingia programmed the AI system to make intricate judgments based on the first few pages of each contract—about the first 2,500 words—which contain only sparse summary information. “AI is absolutely the wrong tool for this,” said Waldo Jaquith, a former Obama appointee who oversaw IT contracting at the Treasury Department. “AI gives convincing looking answers that are frequently wrong. There needs to be humans whose job it is to do this work.” Lavingia’s prompts did not include context about how the VA operates, what contracts are essential, or which ones are required by federal law. This led AI to determine a core piece of the agency’s own contract procurement system was “munchable.” At the core of Lavingia’s prompt is the direction to spare contracts involved in “direct patient care.” Such an approach, experts said, doesn’t grapple with the reality that the work done by doctors and nurses to care for veterans in hospitals is only possible with significant support around them. Lavingia’s system also used AI to extract details like the contract number and “total contract value.” This led to avoidable errors, where AI returned the wrong dollar value when multiple were found in a contract. Experts said the correct information was readily available from public databases. Lavingia acknowledged that errors resulted from this approach but said those errors were later corrected by VA staff. In late March, Lavingia published a version of the “munchable” scripton his GitHub accountto invite others to use and improve it, he told ProPublica. “It would have been cool if the entire federal government used this script and anyone in the public could see that this is how the VA is thinking about cutting contracts.” Accordingto a post on his blog, this was done with the approval of Musk before he left DOGE. “When he asked the room about improving DOGE’s public perception, I asked if I could open-source the code I’d been writing,” Lavingia said. “He said yes—it aligned with DOGE’s goal of maximum transparency.” That openness may have eventually led to Lavingia’s dismissal. Lavingia confirmed he wasterminated from DOGEafter givingan interview to Fast Company magazineabout his work with the department. A VA spokesperson declined to comment on Lavingia’s dismissal. VA officials have declined to say whether they will continue to use the “munchable” tool moving forward. But the administration may deploy AI to help the agency replace employees. Documents previously obtained by ProPublica show DOGE officials proposed in March consolidating the benefits claims department by relying more on AI. And the government’s contractors are paying attention. After Lavingia posted his code, he said he heard from people trying to understand how to keep the money flowing. “I got a couple DMs from VA contractors who had questions when they saw this code,” he said. “They were trying to make sure that their contracts don’t get cut. Or learn why they got cut. “At the end of the day, humans are the ones terminating the contracts, but it is helpful for them to see how DOGE or Trump or the agency heads are thinking about what contracts they are going to munch. Transparency is a good thing.” If you have any information about the misuse or abuse of AI within government agencies, Brandon Roberts is an investigative journalist on the news applications team and has a wealth of experience using and dissecting artificial intelligence.

At other times, the vehicles are more anonymous, and I'm not sure this ADX sparked any community discussions. Compact crossovers are a popular breed and blend into the background—particularly when they're painted an unobtrusive shade. Which is not to say the ADX is not handsome; the Urban Gray Pearl paint looked good even in the near-constant rain (which explains the Acura-supplied images rather than my own) that coincided with our time with the tester. And from the driver's seat, the view down the hood, along those creases, is a lot more interesting than most comparable crossovers, considering the ADX's $35,000 starting price. It's built in Mexico alongside the Honda HR-V and shares a platform with the Acura Integra andHonda Civic. Like the HR-V, there's no hybrid option, just a 1.5 L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with 190 hp (142 kW) and 179 lb-ft (243 Nm). There's also only one choice of transmission—a continuously variable transmission. This has preprogrammed \"shift points\" that simulate the gears of a more conventional transmission. Acura says it has been programmed for performance, and you can use the steering wheel's paddles to change up or down a virtual gear. The turbocharged engine starts making all its torque from 1,700 rpm, but if you're in a hurry, you'll first hear the revs rise out of proportion to the initial increase in speed, and full power doesn't arrive until 6,000 rpm, with the redline 500 rpm further north. It's not the best-sounding engine in the world when it's revved up, either. As standard, the ADX is just front-wheel drive, but all-wheel drive is available for an additional $2,000. This can send up to half the engine's available torque to the rear wheels, but expect it to be front-biased in day-to-day driving conditions. Fuel efficiency is not remarkable, but here it's about average for the class. With all-wheel drive, as tested, the EPA estimates 27 mpg combined (8.7 L/100 km); I actually returned a slightly better 28 mpg (8.4 L/100 km) across the week. It's also going to be slower than most comparable crossovers: at 8.7 seconds, its 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time is glacial compared to something like BMW's X1, but evena non-turbocharged Mazda CX-30will outdo the Acura. Despite that, I found the ADX a rather pleasant car to drive. It corners without much roll despite being loftier than a sedan, and bad road imperfections are handled by the ADX's suspension without bothering the occupants much. I should commend the steering, which is relatively quick with just 2.4 turns lock-to-lock and is well-weighted, even in Sport mode. In fact, this is a crossover that might well prompt me to take the longer way home, although I wouldn't put the handling ahead of the aforementioned CX-30, which remains the pick of the class in terms of driver engagement. If you know where to look, you'll recognize bits from the Honda parts bin in the ADX's interior—the digital main instrument display seems pretty familiar. The good news is that there are plenty of physical controls, with dials and buttons for the temperature and fans. The big gear lever feels a little incongruous, as most other Honda and Acura models have adopted three buttons for the transmission, but I think that's consistent with its factory sibling, the Honda HR-V. The ADX is relatively well-appointed, particularly in the $44,000 A-Spec with Advance trim as tested. However, even the entry-level ADX comes with a powered tailgate, heated front seats, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and wireless charging as well as USB-C ports. You also get a full complement of Honda and Acura's advanced driver assistance systems and safety tech, although, as usual, the collision warnings are a little too eager, and you can expect a few false positives a week. But given the recent news about Acurakilling off connected car servicesfor cars that are only slightly older, I'm not sure I'd get too dependent on any smartphone integration or remote apps. The market for a compact crossover at or around $40,000 is one of the most crowded, with plenty of options for buyers to choose from. A German alternative might be faster, but not necessarily better to drive, and you'll probably have to spend more to get an equivalent equipment level. My pick probably remains the CX-30 because it drives so well, and that's important to me, but this Acura is a decent middle ground if you're looking for a more premium badge while still balancing the budget and spirit.

    "title": "Rocket Report: SpaceX’s 500th Falcon launch; why did UK’s Reaction Engines fail?",
    "article_text": "SpaceX's rockets make a lot more noise, but the machinations of Texas' newest city are underway. Welcome to Edition 7.47 of the Rocket Report! Let's hope not, but the quarrel between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk may be remembered as \"Black Thursday\" for the US space program. A simmering disagreement over Trump's signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" coursing its way through Congress erupted into public view, with two of the most powerful Americans trading insults and threats on social media. Trump suggested the government should terminate \"Elon's governmental contracts and subsidies.\" Musk responded with a post saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning the Dragon spacecraft used to transport crew and cargo to the International Space Station. This could go a number of ways, but it's hard to think anything good will come of it. As always, wewelcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Blue Origin aces suborbital space shot.Blue Origin, the space company founded and owned by Jeff Bezos, launched six people to the edge of space Saturday, May 31, from Bezos' ranch in West Texas,CBS News reports. A hydrogen-fueled New Shepard booster propelled a crew capsule, equipped with the largest windows of any operational spaceship, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles (105 kilometers), just above the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space, before beginning the descent to landing. The passengers included three Americans—Aymette Medina Jorge, Gretchen Green, and Paul Jeris—along with Canadian Jesse Williams, New Zealand's Mark Rocket, and Panamanian Jaime Alemán, who served as his country's ambassador to the United States. If you missed it... You wouldn't be alone. This was the 32nd flight of Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, and the company's 12th human flight. From a technical perspective, these flights aren't breaking any new ground in human spaceflight or rocketry. However, each flight provides an opportunity for wealthy or well-connected passengers to view Earth from a perspective only about 700 people have seen before. That's really cool, but most of these launches are no longer newsworthy, and it takes a devoted fan of spaceflight to tune in to a New Shepard flight on a summertime Saturday morning. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Momentum for Amentum.The US Space Force awarded Jacobs Technology a contract worth up to $4 billion over 10 years to provide engineering and technical services at the nation’s primary space launch ranges, as the military seeks to modernize aging infrastructure and boost capacity amid a surge in commercial space activity,Space News reports. Jacobs Technology is now part of Amentum, a defense contractor based in Chantilly, Virginia. Amentum merged with Jacobs in September 2024. The so-called \"Space Force Range Contract\" covers maintenance, sustainment, systems engineering and integration services for the Eastern and Western ranges until 2035. The Eastern Range operates from Patrick Space Force Base in Florida, while the Western Range is based at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Picking from the menu... The contract represents a significant shift in how space launch infrastructure is funded. Under the new arrangement, commercial launch service providers—which now account for the majority of launches at both ranges—can request services or upgrades and pay for them directly, rather than having the government bear the costs upfront. This arrangement would create a more market-driven approach to range operations and potentially accelerate modernization. \"Historically, the government has fronted these costs,\" Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space Launch Delta 45 Commander and Eastern Range Director, said June 3 in a news release. \"The ability of our commercial partners to directly fund their own task order will lessen the financial and administrative burden on the government and is in line with congressionally mandated financial improvement and audit readiness requirements.\" Impulse Space rakes in more cash.This week, an in-space propulsion company, Impulse Space, announced that it had raised a significant amount of money, $300 million,Ars reports. This follows a fundraising round just last year in which the Southern California-based company raised $150 million. This is one of the largest capital raises in space in a while, especially for a non-launch company. Founded by Tom Mueller, a former propulsion guru at SpaceX, Impulse Space has test-flown an orbital maneuvering vehicle called Mira on two flights over the last couple of years. The company is developing a larger vehicle, named Helios, that could meaningfully improve the ability of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy to transport large payloads to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations in the Solar System. Reacting to the market... The Mira vehicle was originally intended to provide \"last-mile\" services for spacecraft launched as part of rideshare missions. \"The reality is the market for that is not very good,\" said Eric Romo, the company's CEO. Instead, Impulse Space found interest from the Space Force to use Mira as an agile platform for hosting electronic warfare payloads and other military instrumentation in orbit. \"Mira wasn't necessarily designed out of the gate for that, but what we found out after we flew it successfully was, the Space Force said, 'Hey, we know what that thing's for,'\" Romo said. Helios is a larger beast, with an engine capable of producing 15,000 pounds of thrust and the ability to move a multi-ton payload from low-Earth orbit to geostationary space in less than a day. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Falcon rockets surpass 500 flights.SpaceX was back at the launch pad for a midweek flight from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. This particular flight, designated Starlink 11-22, marked the company's 500th orbital launch attempt with a Falcon rocket, including Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy,Spaceflight Now reports. This milestone coincided with the 15th anniversary of the first Falcon 9 launch on June 4, 2010. The day before, SpaceX launched the 500th Falcon rocket overall, counting a single suborbital flight in 2020 that tested the Dragon spacecraft's abort system. The launch on Wednesday from California was the 68th Falcon 9 launch of the year. Chasing Atlas... The soon-to-be-retired Atlas rocket holds the record for the most-flown family of space launchers in the United States, with 684 launches to date, beginning with Atlas ICBMs in the Cold War to the Atlas V rocket flying today. In reality, however, the Atlas V shares virtually nothing in common with the Atlas ICBM, other than its name. The Atlas V has new engines, more modern computers, and a redesigned booster stage that ended the line of pressure-stabilized \"balloon tanks\" that flew on Atlas rockets from 1957 until 2005. The Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy share more heritage, all using variants of SpaceX's Merlin engine. If you consider the Atlas rocket as the US record-holder for most space launches, SpaceX's Falcon family is on pace to reach 684 flights before the end of 2026. SpaceX delivers again for GPS.The Space Force successfully sent its latest GPS III satellite to orbit Friday, May 30, demonstrating the ability to prepare and launch a military spacecraft on condensed timelines,Defense News reports. The satellite flew on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida. GPS III, built by Lockheed Martin, is the latest version of the navigation and timing system and is designed to provide improved anti-jamming capabilities. It will broadcast additional military and civilian signals. More anti-jamming capability... The launch was the second in a series of Rapid Response Trailblazer missions the Space Force is running to test whether it can quickly launch high-value satellites in response to national security needs. The goal is to condense a process that can take up to two years down to a handful of months. The first mission, which flew in December, reduced the time between launch notification and lift off to around five months—and the May 30 mission shortened it even further, to around 90 days. In addition to demonstrating the launch could be done on an accelerated timeline, Space Force officials were motivated to swap this satellite from United Launch Alliance's long-delayed Vulcan rocket to SpaceX's Falcon 9 in order to add more tech to the GPS constellation to counter jamming and spoofing. (submitted by EllPeaTea) An autopsy on Reaction Engines.An articlepublished by the BBCthis week recounts some of the backstory behind the bankruptcy of Reaction Engines, a British company that labored for 35 years to develop a revolutionary air-breathing rocket engine. According to the vision of the company's leaders, the new engine, called SABRE, could have powered a single-stage-to-orbit spaceplane or hypersonic vehicles within the atmosphere. If an engine like SABRE could ever be mastered, it could usher in a new era of spaceplanes that can take off and land horizontally on a runway, instead of launching vertically like a rocket. A little too quixotic... But Reaction Engines started in an era too soon for true commercial spaceflight and couldn't convince enough venture capital investors that the idea could compete with the likes of SpaceX. Instead, the company secured a handful of investments from large aerospace companies like Boeing, BAE Systems, and Rolls-Royce. This money allowed Reaction Engines to grow to a staff of approximately 200 employees and kept it afloat until last October, when the company went into administration and laid off its workforce. \"A few people were in tears,\" Richard Varvill, the company's chief engineer, told the BBC. \"A lot of them were shocked and upset because they'd hoped we could pull it off right up to the end.\" It was galling for Varvill \"because we were turning it around with an improved engine. Just as we were getting close to succeeding, we failed. That's a uniquely British characteristic.\" (submitted by ShuggyCoUk) Draconian implications for Trump's budget.New details of the Trump administration's plans for NASA, released Friday, May 30, revealed the White House's desire to end the development of an experimental nuclear thermal rocket engine that could have shown a new way of exploring the Solar System,Ars reports. The budget proposal's impacts on human spaceflight and space science have been widely reported, but Trump's plan would cut NASA's space technology budget in half. One of the victims would be DRACO, a partnership with DARPA to develop and test the first nuclear thermal rocket engine in space. But wait, there's more ...The budget proposal not only cancels DRACO, but it also zeros out funding for all of NASA's nuclear propulsion projects. Proponents of nuclear propulsion say it offers several key advantages for sending heavy cargo and humans to deep space destinations, like Mars. \"This budget provides no funding for Nuclear Thermal Propulsion and Nuclear Electric Propulsion projects,\" officials wrote in the NASA budget request. \"These efforts are costly investments, would take many years to develop, and have not been identified as the propulsion mode for deep space missions. The nuclear propulsion projects are terminated to achieve cost savings and because there are other nearer-term propulsion alternatives for Mars transit.\" Trump's budget request isn't final. Both Republican-controlled houses of Congress will write their own versions of the NASA budget, which must be reconciled before going to the White House for President Trump's signature. Blue Origin CEO says government should get out of the launch business.Eighteen months after leaving his job as a vice president at Amazon to take over as Blue Origin's chief executive, Dave Limp has some thoughts on how commercial companies and government agencies like NASA should explore the Solar System together. First, the government should leave launching things into space to private industry. \"I think commercial folks can worry about the infrastructure,\" he said. \"We can do the launch. We can build the satellite buses that can get you to Mars much more frequently, that don't cost billions of dollars. We can take a zero, and over time, maybe two zeros off of that. And if the governments around the world leave that to the commercial side, then there are a lot more resources that are freed up for the science side, for the national prestige side, and those types of things.\" Do the exotic ...While commercial companies should drive the proverbial bus into the Solar System, NASA should get back to its roots in research and exploration, Limp said. \"I would say, and it might be a little provocative, let's have those smart brains look on the forward-thinking types of things, the really edge of science, planning the really exotic missions, figuring out how to get to planetary bodies we haven't gotten to before, and staying there.\" But Limp highlighted one area where he thinks government investment is needed: the Moon. He said there's currently no commercial business case for sending people to the Moon, and the government should continue backing those efforts. Hurdles ahead for Rocket Cargo.The Center for Biological Diversity is suing the military for details on a proposal to build a rocket test site in a remote wildlife refuge less than 900 miles from Hawaiʻi Island,Hawaiʻi Public Radio reports. The Air Force announced in March that it planned to prepare an environmental assessment for the construction and operation of two landing pads on Johnston Atoll to test the viability of using rockets to deliver military cargo loads. While the announcement didn't mention SpaceX, that company's Starship rocket is on contract with the Air Force Research Laboratory to work on delivering cargo anywhere in the world within an hour. Now, several conservationists have spoken out against the proposal, pointing out that Johnston is an important habitat for birds and marine species. Scarred territory ...For nearly a century, Johnston Atoll has served dual roles as a wildlife refuge and a base for US military operations, including as a nuclear test site between 1958 and 1963. In March, the Air Force said it anticipated an environmental assessment for its plans on Johnston Atoll would be available for public review in early April. So far, it has not been released. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a Freedom of Information Act request about the project. They say a determination on their request was due by May 19, but they have not received a response. The center filed a lawsuit last week to compel the military to rule on their request and release information about the project. Getting down to business at Starbase.SpaceX's rockets make a lot of noise at Starbase, but the machinations of setting up Texas' newest city are in motion, too. After months of planning, SpaceX launched the city of Starbase on May 29 with its first public meeting chaired by Mayor Robert Peden and the City Commission at The Hub, a building owned by SpaceX,ValleyCentral.com reports. During the meeting, which lasted about 80 minutes, they hired a city administrator, approved standard regulations for new construction, and created a committee to guide the community’s long-term development. Voters approved the creation of Starbase on May 3, incorporating territory around SpaceX's remote rocket factory and launch site near the US-Mexico border. SpaceX owns most of the land in Starbase and employs nearly everyone in the tiny town, including the mayor. Property rights and zoning ...\"The new city's leaders have told landowners they plan to introduce land use rules that could result in changes for some residents,\"KUT reports. In a letter, Starbase's first city administrator, Kent Myers, warned local landowners that they may lose the right to continue using their property for its current use under the city’s new zoning plan. \"Our goal is to ensure that the zoning plan reflects the City’s vision for balanced growth, protecting critical economic drivers, ensuring public safety, and preserving green spaces,\" the letter, dated May 21, reads. This is a normal process when a city creates new zoning rules, and a new city is required by state law to notify landowners—most of which are SpaceX or its employees—of potential zoning changes so they can ask questions in a public setting. A public meeting to discuss the zoning ordinance at Starbase is scheduled for June 23.

    "title": "Google’s nightmare: How a search spinoff could remake the web",
    "article_text": "Google has shaped the Internet as we know it, and unleashing its index could change everything. Google wasn't around for the advent of the World Wide Web, but it successfully remade the web on its own terms. Today, any website that wants to be findable has to play by Google's rules, and after years of search dominance, the company haslost a major antitrust casethat could reshape both it and the web. The closing arguments in the casejust wrapped up last week, and Google could be facing serious consequences when the ruling comes down in August.Losing Chromewould certainly change things for Google, but the Department of Justice is pursuing other remedies that could have even more lasting impacts. During his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai seemed genuinely alarmed at the prospect of being forced to license Google's search index and algorithm, the so-called data remedies in the case. He claimed this would beno better than a spinoff of Google Search. The company's statements have sometimes derisively referred to this process as \"white labeling\" Google Search. But does a white label Google Search sound so bad? Google has built an unrivaled index of the web, but the way it shows results has become increasingly frustrating. A handful of smaller players in search have tried to offer alternatives to Google's search tools. They all have different approaches to retrieving information for you, but they agree that spinning off Google Search could change the web again. Whether or not those changes are positive depends on who you ask. As Google's search results have changed over the years, more people have been open to other options. Some have simply moved to AI chatbots to answer their questions, hallucinations be damned. But for most people, it's still about the 10 blue links (for now). Because of the scale of the Internet, there are only three general web search indexes: Google, Bing, and Brave. Every search product (including AI tools) relies on one or more of these indexes to probe the web. But what does that mean? \"Generally, a search index is a service that, when given a query, is able to find relevant documents published on the Internet,\" said Brave's search head Josep Pujol. A search index is essentially a big database, and that's not the same as search results. According to JP Schmetz, Brave's chief of ads, it's entirely possible to have the best and most complete search index in the world and still show poor results for a given query. Sound like anyone you know? Google's technological lead has allowed it to crawl more websites than anyone else. It has all the important parts of the web, plus niche sites, abandoned blogs, sketchy copies of legitimate websites, copies of those copies, and AI-rephrased copies of the copied copies—basicallyeverything. And the result of this Herculean digital inventory is a search experience that feels increasingly discombobulated. \"Google is running large-scale experiments in ways that no rival can because we’re effectively blinded,\" said Kamyl Bazbaz, head of public affairs atDuckDuckGo, which uses the Bing index. \"Google’s scale advantage fuels a powerful feedback loop of different network effects that ensure a perpetual scale and quality deficit for rivals that locks in Google’s advantage.\" The size of the index may not be the only factor that matters, though. Brave, which is perhaps best known for its browser, also has a search engine.Brave Searchis the default in its browser, but you can also just go to the URL in your current browser. Unlike most other search engines, Brave doesn't need to go to anyone else for results. Pujol suggested that Brave doesn't need the scale of Google's index to find what you need. And admittedly, Brave's search results don't feel meaningfully worse than Google's—they may even be better when you consider the way that Googletries to keep you from clicking. Brave's index spans around 25 billion pages, but it leaves plenty of the web uncrawled. \"We could be indexing five to 10 times more pages, but we choose not to because not all the web has signal. Most web pages are basically noise,\" said Pujol. The freemium search engineKagiisn't worried about having the most comprehensive index. Kagi is a meta search engine. It pulls in data from multiple indexes, like Bing and Brave, but it has a custom index of what founder and CEO Vladimir Prelovac calls the \"non-commercial web.\" When you search with Kagi, some of the results (it tells you the proportion) come from its custom index of personal blogs, hobbyist sites, and other content that is poorly represented on other search engines. It's reminiscent of the days when huge brands weren't always clustered at the top of Google—but even these results are being pushed out of reach in favor of AI, ads, Knowledge Graph content, and other Google widgets. That's a big part of why Kagi exists, according to Prelovac. We've all noticed the changes in Google's approach to search, and most would agree that they have made finding reliable and accurate information harder. Regardless, Google's incredibly deep and broad index of the Internet is in demand. Even with Bing and Brave available, companies are going to extremes to syndicate Google Search results. A cottage industry has emerged to scrape Google searches as a stand-in for an official index. These companies are violating Google's terms, yet they appear in Google Search results themselves. Google could surely do something about this if it wanted to. The DOJ calls Google's mountain of data the \"essential raw material\" for building a general search engine, and it believes forcing the firm to license that material is key to breaking its monopoly. The sketchy syndication firms will evaporate if the DOJ's data remedies are implemented, which would give competitors an official way to utilize Google's index. And utilize it they will. According to Prelovac, this could lead to an explosion in search choices. \"The whole purpose of the Sherman Act is to proliferate a healthy, competitive marketplace. Once you have access to a search index, then you can have thousands of search startups,\" said Prelovac. The Kagi founder suggested that licensing Google Search could allow entities of all sizes to have genuinely useful custom search tools. Cities could use the data to create deep, hyper-local search, and people who love cats could make a cat-specific search engine, in both cases pulling what they want from the most complete database of online content. And, of course, general search products like Kagi would be able to license Google's tech for a \"nominal fee,\" as the DOJ puts it. Prelovac didn't hesitate when asked if Kagi, which offers a limited number of free searches before asking users to subscribe, would integrate Google's index. \"Yes, that is something we would do,\" he said. \"And that's what I believe should happen.\" There may be some drawbacks to unleashing Google's search services. Judge Amit Mehta hasexpressed concern that blocking Google's search placement dealscould reduce browser choice, and there isa similar issue with the data remedies. If Google is forced to license search as an API, its few competitors in web indexing could struggle to remain afloat. In a roundabout way, giving away Google's search tech could actually increase its influence. The Brave team worries about how open access to Google's search technology could impact diversity on the web. \"If implemented naively, it's a big problem,\" said Brave's ad chief JP Schmetz, \"If the court forces Google to provide search at a marginal cost, it will not be possible for Bing or Brave to survive until the remedy ends.\" The landscape of AI-based search could also change. We know from testimony given during the remedy trial by OpenAI's Nick Turley that the ChatGPT maker tried andfailed to get accessto Google Search to ground its AI models—it currently uses Bing. If Google were suddenly an option, you can be sure OpenAI and others would rush to connect Google's web data to their large language models (LLMs). The attempt to reduce Google's power could actually grant it new monopolies in AI, according to Brave Chief Business Officer Brian Brown. \"All of a sudden, you would have a single monolithic voice of truth across all the LLMs, across all the web,\" Brown said. If white labeling Google does expand choice, even at the expense of other indexes, it will give more kinds of search products a chance in the market—maybe even some that shun Google's focus on advertising. You don't see much of that right now. For most people, web search is and always has been a free service supported by ads. Google, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and Bing offer all the search queries you want for free because they want eyeballs. It's been said often, but it's true: If you're not paying for it,you'rethe product. This is an arrangement that bothers Kagi's founder. \"For something as important as information consumption, there should not be an intermediary between me and the information, especially one that is trying to sell me something,\" said Prelovac. Kagi search results acknowledge the negative impact of today's advertising regime. Kagi users see a warning next to results with a high number of ads and trackers. According to Prelovac, that is by far the strongest indication that a result is of low quality. That icon also lets you adjust the prevalence of such sites in your personal results. You can demote a site or completely hide it, which is a valuable option in the age of clickbait. Kagi's paid approach to search changes its relationship with your data. \"We literally don't need user data,\" Prelovac said. \"But it's not only that we don't need it. It's a liability.\" Prelovac admitted that getting people to pay for search is \"really hard.\" Nevertheless, he believes ad-supported search is a dead end. So Kagi is planning for a future in five or 10 years when more people have realized they're still \"paying\" for ad-based search with lost productivity time and personal data, he said. We know how Google handles user data (it collects a lot of it), but what does that mean for smaller search engines like Brave and DuckDuckGo that rely on ads? \"I'm sure they mean well,\" said Prelovac. Brave said that it shields user data from advertisers, relying on first-party tracking to attribute clicks to Brave without touching the user. \"They cannot retarget people later; none of that is happening,\" said Brave's JP Schmetz. DuckDuckGo is a bit of an odd duck—it relies on Bing's general search index, but it adds a layer of privacy tools on top. It's free and ad-supported like Google and Brave, but the company says it takes user privacy seriously. \"Viewing ads is privacy protected by DuckDuckGo, and most ad clicks are managed by Microsoft’s ad network,\" DuckDuckGo's Kamyl Bazbaz said. He explained that DuckDuckGo has worked with Microsoft to ensure its network does not track users or create any profiles based on clicks. He added that the company has a similar privacy arrangement with TripAdvisor for travel-related ads. We can't talk about the future of search without acknowledging the artificially intelligent elephant in the room. As Google continues its shift to AI-based search, it's tempting to think of the potential search spin-off as a way to escape that trend. However, you may find few refuges in the coming years. There's a real possibility that search is evolving beyond the 10 blue links and toward an AI assistant model. All non-Google search engines have AI integrations, with the most prominent being Microsoft Bing, which has a partnership with OpenAI. But smaller players have AI search features, too. The folks working on these products agree with Microsoft and Google on one important point: They see AI as inevitable. Today's Google alternatives all have their own take on AI Overviews, which generates responses to queries based on search results. They're generally not as in-your-face as Google AI, though. While Google and Microsoft are intensely focused on increasing the usage of AI search, other search operators aren't pushing for that future. They are along for the ride, though. \"We’re finding that some people prefer to start in chat mode and then jump into more traditional search results when needed, while others prefer the opposite,\" Bazbaz said. \"So we thought the best thing to do was offer both. We made it easy to move between them, and we included an off switch for those who’d like to avoid AI altogether.\" The team at Brave views AI as a core means of accessing search and one that will continue to grow. Brave generates AI answers for many searches and prominently cites sources. You can also disable Brave's AI if you prefer. But according to search chief Josep Pujol, the move to AI search is inevitable for a pretty simple reason: It's convenient, and people will always choose convenience. So AI is changing the web as we know it, for better or worse, because LLMs can save a smidge of time, especially for more detailed \"long-tail\" queries. These AI features may give you false information while they do it, but that's not always apparent. This is very similar to the language Google uses when discussing agentic search, although it expresses it in a more nuanced way. Byunderstanding the task behind a query, Google hopes to provide AI answers that save people time, even if the model needs a few ticks to fan out and run multiple searches to generate a more comprehensive report on a topic. That's probably still faster than running multiple searches and manually reviewing the results, and it could leave traditional search as an increasingly niche service, even in a world with more choices. \"Will the 10 blue links continue to exist in 10 years?\" Pujol asked. \"Actually, one question would be, does it even exist now? In 10 years, [search] will have evolved into more of an AI conversation behavior or even agentic. That is probably the case. What, for sure, will continue to exist is the need to search. Search is a verb, an action that you do, and whether you will do it directly or whether it will be done through an agent, it's a search engine.\" Vlad from Kagi sees AI becoming the default way we access information in the long term, but his search engine doesn't force you to use it. On Kagi, you can expand the AI box for your searches and ask follow-ups, and the AI will open automatically if you use a question mark in your search. But that's just the start. \"You watch Star Trek, nobody's clicking on links there—I do believe in that vision in science fiction movies,\" Prelovac said. \"I don't think my daughter will be clicking links in 10 years. The only question is if the current technology will be the one that gets us there. LLMs have inherent flaws. I would even tend to say it's likely not going to get us to Star Trek.\" If we think of AI mainly as a way to search for information, the future becomes murky. With generative AI in the driver's seat, questions of authority and accuracy may be left to language models that often behave in unpredictable and difficult-to-understand ways. Whether we're headed for an AI boom or bust—for continued Google dominance or a new era of choice—we're facing fundamental changes to how we access information. Maybe if we get those thousands of search startups, there will be a few that specialize in 10 blue links. We can only hope.

    "title": "How Trump Fumbled the Jeffrey Epstein Problem",
    "article_text": "Ever since 2016, when he rode down a golden escalator and took his first steps into the U.S. political arena, Donald Trump has had a problem: For thebetter part of a decade, he enjoyed a close (and quite public) friendship with a man who would later go on to be known as one of the most notorious sexual predators in modern American history. That man, of course, was Jeffrey Epstein. A supposed billionaire, Epstein would befriend many wealthy and powerful individuals before he died in a prison cell in 2019. Among his associations, however, few have loomed larger or been more publicly speculated about than the one he shared with the current U.S. president. It can now be said that Trump has definitively fumbled this problem. His second term in the White House was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to use the gears of power to stage-manage away his association with the dead pedophile. Instead, he has bungled the opportunity, falling prey to a weakness in his leadership style that has long been obvious: talking too much and doing too little. While campaigning, Trump signaled to voters that he would bring newfound transparency to the Epstein issue. However, his administration has done little since he took office except disclose a dump of old documents in a much-maligned eventthat was swiftly dismissed as a “publicity stunt.”The administration may have underestimated the degree to which MAGA actually cares about this issue, and seems to have thought that Trumpers would be satisfied with the limited media antics it could provide. They haven’t been. Indeed, voters have become increasingly incensed over the last few months, as the government has weirdly stalled the release of further information. This week, Trump’s former buddy, Elon Musk,brought the issue backto national attention when he accused the government of not releasing more information about Epstein because of Trump’s ties to the dead pedophile. Amidst a very public breakup between the Tesla CEO and the President, Musk tweeted: âTime to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!â MuskÂwrote on X. Musk’s jab was a juvenile attack, but it nevertheless puts the President in a precarious position. Because he has ignored his constituents’ calls for transparency around Epstein, Trump has now allowed the issue to fall into the hands of his enemies. FollowingMusk’s viral remarkon Thursday, Democratic lawmakers seized on the issue as a way to further dig the knife in. Several Democratssent a letterto Trump’s Attorney General, Pam Bondi, asking her to immediately look into Musk’s claims. âWe write with profound alarm at allegations that files relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have not been declassified and released to the American public because they personally implicate President Trump,” the letter, signed by Rep. Robert Garcia, and Rep. Stephen F. Lynch, reads. “We ask that you immediately clarify whether this allegation is true and respond to this letter with the requested information and documentation.â Both Garcia and Lynch are on committees devoted to government transparency and oversight. Breaking! FBI Director Kash Patel Asked by Joe Rogan If Elon Had Access To The Epstein Files In Reference To Trump / Musk Online Feud. Kash won't comment \"I know my lane and that ain't it\"pic.twitter.com/pxNvlvVPHl — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones)June 6, 2025 At the same time, another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Dan Goldberg, of New York,sent a letter to Bondi, in which he harangued her for delaying the release of the files. “I write to express my grave concern about what appears to be a concerted effort by you to delay and even prevent the release of the Jeffrey Epstein Files in their entirety â potentially at the direction of the sitting President of the United States, Donald J. Trump,” Goldberg wrote. Were the Democrats to really dig in on the Epstein issue, it could prove disastrous for the Trump administration. Having clearly disappointed Trump’s own base with his inability to satisfyingly answer their questions about the pedophile, it’s not out of the question that they might turn to anyone else who seems interested in shedding further light on the case. That could end up being really bad for the Trump camp since the ties between some of its members and Epstein have always been problematic. Trump’s longtime ally, Steve Bannon,has been accusedof being “friends” with Epstein. This week, the New York Times reported that Epstein invested $40 million in a company co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of Trump’s earliest backers. Thiel, whose secretive firm Palantirhas taken a central rolein the new Trump administration, alsomet with the pedophileseveral times in 2014. Even Musk, himself,was subpoenaedin a court case involving Epstein. Epstein is the problem that won’t go away. He is also a problem that is abstract and intangible enough to seem small to a politician beset by more immediate and pressing concerns. But Epstein has never been a small problem. As an avatar for the darkness and corruption endemic to the current political order, he looms large over the national consciousnessâa smirking ghost intent on haunting whatever wealthy men were ever foolish enough to take a call or a lunch with him or, in Trump’s case, to party with in dimly lit nightclubs.

    "title": "Where Does ‘Doctor Who’ Go From Here?",
    "article_text": "The end of the latest season ofÂDoctor Whowould be controversial for a good many reasons beyond itsshocking cliffhanger endingâfrom itsconfounding narrative choicesto itscomplete character re-writingof its latest companionâbut perhaps what has made it reach another level of ire is that, for the foreseeable future, this might be it. Right now, the continuation ofDoctor Whoon TV is in about as unsure a place as it can be for the first time in 20 years. Of course, the show has contemplated disaster across those two decades, but we mostly learned of those moments well after the fact: on the public front,Doctor Whopersisted into the institution it has become, in spite of it all. ButÂDoctor Whoends its latest run of episodes without that public acknowledgement of its own inevitability. For all the talk of scripts and eventual, possible continuity, right now there is currently no furtherÂDoctor Whoconfirmed beyond a five-episode spinoff series,ÂWar Between the Land and the Sea. The show will not air this holiday season; for the first time since it returned, a third season of this Disney-BBC partnership era hasnot been commissioned.ÂDoctor Who, on-screen at least, is currently standing on the edge of a proverbial cliff. That does not mean thatDoctor Whois necessarily dead.ÂDoctor Whowill always live on in some form or another: it did back in 1989 when itwas first cancelled, thriving in books, audio dramas, the brief spike of the 1996 TV movie, all before it came roaring back to life again in 2005. It also doesn’t mean that there aren’tÂoptionsfor the series, either, even in this moment of uncertainty. Let’s explore a few of them. Of all the options on the table right now, this seems like the least likely. Not because of the perspective ofDoctor Who‘s shaky reputation coming out if its finale, and its wild stunt-casting Hail Mary to close out Ncuti Gatwa’s time on the show (it’s currently unclear whether or not Billie Piper is going to be a full-fledged 16th incarnation of the Doctor; much like the show’s current status, details about that are still up the air), but because at this point it’s pretty much logistically impossible for the series to make a return any time soon unless it enters productionimmediately. A week out from the finale and with no official statement on the renewal of the BBC’slicensing partnership with Disneyâwith the latter already having made it clear that there was going to be a review ofDoctor Who‘s viewership across the latest season before any decision about the dealâit seems unlikely that we’re going to hear anything soon, whether Disney backs out or carries on financially supporting the series. A Christmas special for 2025 is already out of the picture at this point; one was not included in the original agreement. And even if we got news of a deal imminently, the likeliness of a new season ofDoctor Whobeing broadcast before 2027 narrows to the point of impossibility with each passing day. The question is, however, even ifÂDoctor Whowas renewed in the immediate future,Âshouldit continue as-is? It’s become clearâand it’s also clearly part of the reason why an official renewal didn’t come with the conclusion of the latest seasonâthatDoctor Whohasstruggled in the past few yearsto reclaim a wider audience again. Putting aside right-wing culture waraccusations of overt “wokeness”in the series (it has arguably been an era whereDoctor Who‘s long-standing progressive themes have never beenso purely surface-level), a mix of a streaming-first approach that has shaken up broadcast times inÂDoctor Who‘s home nation and plotlines that are failing to energize either diehard fans or new audiences has led to the series being on a ratings decline. In a period that was meant to be a new onboarding point for curious global audiencesâa new Doctor, a new companion, a distancing for recent and further flung continuity threadsâthe series has instead wrapped itself in increasing insularity, building its dramatic climaxes on arcane connections toWho‘s past and season arcs that build towards the return of increasingly obscure old villains, while also paradoxically failing to capitalize on those returning characters. Even ifÂDoctor Whowas greenlit for more seasons, whether or not its current self is working would remain uncertain. So maybe the show takes a break that’s longer than the logistically enforced couple of years it would take to continue on as it has been. Whether that’s three years rather than two, whether it’s three or four or even five, it would give the show the chance to have a creative reset behind the scenes and return with a renewed plan for its future and a renewed energy with a completely new Doctor and companion. That doesn’t necessarily mean that much changes behind the scenes, but itcoulddepending on the length of the break. We have, at least, the upcomingWar Between the Land and the Seato act as something already made that could be broadcast in the place of a traditional season. But given the current uncertainty as to what Billie Piper’s role in this transitional period could beâwhether she’s the Doctor at all, whether she’s a regeneration similar to David Tennant’s 14th and won’t stick around long, or whether she is indeed a fully-fledged incarnation that will stay as the face of the series for multiple seasonsâperhaps we could even see something akin to what happened withDoctor Whoin 2009. Then, as the series prepared to transition between the exit of both its main star in David Tennant and its creative leadership in showrunner Russell T Davies,ÂWhowent on a quasi-break for the year, instead broadcasting four one-off special episodes throughout 2009, while a new creative team under Steven Moffat began working on getting the next era of the show ready for broadcast in 2010. Maybe afterWar Between the Land and the Seawe’ll see a similar “specials” era for Piper, before a return to regular seasons with a new incarnation of the Doctor. Regardless, it would give time forDoctor Who‘s creative team to take a look at the last couple of years of the show, see what’s working and what isn’t, and lay out a new plan for what the series could eventually look like upon its return. Or maybe, this is it. In not having a deal renewed at all, whether with Disney’s help or without it,ÂDoctor Whois effectively cancelled as it was back in 1989. On screenÂWhogoes out with Piper’s smiling face cutting to credits, a more open-ended but similar conclusion akin to the Seventh Doctor and Ace walking off into adventures unseen at the end of “Survival.” Of course, this means that we know that even ifÂDoctor Whoon TV is dead, it really isn’t dead at all. Just as was the case nearly 40 years ago, the show’s first wandering into “The Wilderness Years,” as they came to be known inDoctor Whofandom, didn’t really mean thatÂWhoceased to exist. Virgin’sÂNew Adventuresnovels carried on the stories of the Doctor and Ace, and yet further beyond, providing a treasure trove of stories pushing the world ofÂDoctor Whobeyond the imaginings of its televised self. The Big Finish audio drama series began in 1999 and continues to this day, simultaneously giving Paul McGann’s Eighth Doctor from the TV movie a whole life of adventures while also revisiting Doctors past, enriching their own histories with more stories and spinoffs. In fits and starts, we did still get glimpses of newDoctor Whomedia, from the cheesy reunions ofÂDimensions in Time, to the aforementioned attempted revival with the 1996 movie, and then things like the online web animationÂScream of the Shalkain 2003. But whileÂDoctor Whowasn’t regularly on TV any more, it was far from dormant. We’ve already seen the series survive one such period, only to come back and change the face of genre television all over again. Who’s to say it couldn’t do the same again?

    "title": "In the Feud Between Trump and Musk, NASA Has a Lot to Lose",
    "article_text": "In the heat of the moment, Elon Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and then he took it back. In doing so, however, the rocket billionaire dragged NASA into his messy breakup with Donald Trump, with the agency’s access to orbit now at stake. Musk and Trump parted ways earlier this week, and their breakup has been very messy. Shortly after leaving the administration, Musk began criticizing the budget bill passed by Republicans in the U.S. House, instigating a public feud between the president and the billionaire oligarch. The childish back-and-forth was entertaining, until it wasn’t. “SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” Musk threatened on X. He later took another X user’s advice to “cool off,” andwrote, “Ok, we wonât decommission Dragon.” Although short-lived, the threat put the International Space Station (ISS) at risk. NASA relies heavily on SpaceX’s Dragon to transport its astronauts and cargo supplies to the orbiting lab, having weaned itself from hitching rides aboardÂ Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. SpaceX’s closest alternative, Boeing,failed miserablyat proving its vehicle’s capability to reach the ISS safely. Without Dragon, NASA would lose its access to low Earth orbit and not be able to operate the space station at the same capacity. It’s not clear how serious Musk was in his threat, but it was a serious display of leverage on his part. SpaceX is no doubt a leader in the industry, and canceling its government contracts would hurt the national space program, which has come to rely on the private sector in recent years. In response to Musk’s clear advantage, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, called on the president to nationalize SpaceX under a 1950 law known as the Defense Production Act, according toThe Wall Street Journal. During his show,War Room Live, Bannon urged the use of the Korean War-era law which grants the president powers to prioritize national defense. The plan might seem outrageous now, but the current administration is unpredictable. Trump has yet to respond to Bannon’s call. If he doesn’t move to nationalize SpaceX, Trump could also sacrifice NASA for the sake of proving a point against his now opponent, Musk. On Thursday, Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to SpaceX. Aside from Dragon, NASA also plans on using SpaceX’s Starship rocket to launch astronauts to the Moon as part of the Artemis program. The agency has already invested $4 billion into the rocket’s development, and canceling its contract with SpaceX would leave it without a viable alternative. In short, NASA needs SpaceX and canceling the company’s government contracts would affect the national space program as a whole. At this point, it comes down to how much Trump is willing to sacrifice in order to gain the upper hand in his ongoing feud with Musk while NASA is caught in the middle.

    "title": "Live Updates From Apple WWDC 2025 🔴",
    "article_text": "On Monday, June 9 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT, Apple will announce an avalanche of software updates for all of its platforms at its annual WWDC 2025 developer conference. We’ll see new versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS—all of which arerumored to jump straight to version “26.” Apple is expected to introduce all-new visual looks, inspired by theVision Pro’sglassy and translucent visionOS, to unify the interfaces and make them more consistent across devices. For its largest and most important platform—iPhone—that means the first major software facelift sinceJony Ive’s iOS 7 flattened software in 2013. The elephant in the room is going to be AI—specifically, Apple’s brand of artificial intelligence called Apple Intelligence. Will Apple address itsbig fumbling of its next-gen Siri voice assistantthat was supposed to have arrived by nowbut still hasn’t? Or will it downplay its lagging AI features as Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other major AI companies drop new and more advanced LLM-powered chatbot and generative features at a seemingly rapid-fire pace? Senior Consumer Tech Editor Raymond Wong will be in Cupertino, Calif. to bring live WWDC 2025 coverage from Apple’s spaceship-shaped Apple Park. The Gizmodo consumer tech team, including Senior Writer James and Staff Reporter Kyle Barr, will be on deck breaking down the news announcements, too. Be sure to come back on Monday for live updates! There’s a light at the end of the long, long tunnel. Apple will finally let us peep its next slate of software updates. If the rumors are to be believed, every OS is jumping to “26,” and instead of iOS 19 or macOS 16, we’ll get iOS 26 and macOS 26. The new naming convention hints that Apple may try to unify the design of all its software, which is supposedly inspired by the Vision Pro’s glassy visionOS. The Mac menu bar, your iPhone’s app icons, and widgets will also have a glassy appearance. Beyond the changes to the UI, Apple may introduce a few more features, like a Preview-type app for iPhone and iPad. We may also see a section on gaming with an all-new “Gaming” app for mobile. Just don’t expect too much in the way of “Apple Intelligence” updates save for new live translation features for phone calls and texts. Everything We Expect Apple to Announce at WWDC25 on June 9 Simultaneously, one of the biggest but also the most superficial changes at WWDC 2025 could be with Apple’s naming conventions. As reported byBloomberg’s Mark Gurman, all of Apple’s software—that’s iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and visionOS—may jump from their respective numbers, 18, 16, 18, 11, and 2, respectively, to… 26. That shift changes the year-over-year system from chronological numbers to the year it’s released plus one, like a Toyota or whatever. In a way, it won’t really mean much of anything, but in another way, it signifies a big change and might actually match the major vibe shift we’re expecting with the new version of iOS. It’ll make things simpler, I suppose, but poor visionOS might have some whiplash. Apple Reportedly Says ‘Screw It’ and Jumps From iOS 19 to iOS 26 Apple announcedApple Intelligence at last year’s WWDC. Generative AI features likeGenmoji,notification summaries, and writing tools rolled out, but the big one—a revamped Siri with on-screen awareness and agentic functionality to help do things on your behalf—failed to materialize evenafter months of delay.Reports have claimed that the new Siri features were fictitious and Apple’s marketing had pushed for them to be shown off before the Siri team had even gotten them working. Our Senior Writer James Pero thinks Monday is going to be looked upon as Apple’s make-or-break AI—it’ll be largely about optics. Will Apple emerge as an innovator or a laggard?

Apple's iOS 26 (yes, you read that right) may feature the same see-through bubble UI as the rest of Apple's ecosystem.

    "title": "The Long-Awaited First Look at Andy Serkis’ ‘Animal Farm’ Teases Seth Rogen’s Barnyard Boss",
    "article_text": "While theGeorge Orwelltale with the most resonance in 2025 is undoubtedly1984,Animal Farmâfirst published in 1945 as a comment on the Russian Revolution of 1917âstill has plenty to say in the present day. The very first clip from Andy Serkis’long-anticipatedanimated version of the storyÂ is here, and it gives us a first look atSeth Rogen‘s Napoleon informing the younger pig Lucky (voiced byStranger Things‘ Gaten Matarazzo) that “Things aren’t always what they seem, and I’ll help you decide what’s right!” Given that Napoleon is a stand-in for Stalin in Orwell’s story, that doesn’t bode well for the future of the barnyard. (Kieran Culkin’s Squealer gets a little comic relief moment at the very end of the scene.) Check out the clip, debuted byVarietyahead ofAnimal Farm‘s premiere next week at the Annecy Animated Film Festival. DespiteAnimal Farm‘s well-known origins as a political satire, Serkisnoted back in 2012when this project was first revealed that “Weâre keeping it fable-istic and [aimed at] a family audience. We are not going to handle the politics in a heavy-handed fashion. It is going to be emotionally centered in a way that I donât think has been seen before. The point of view that we take will be slightly different to how it is normally portrayed and the characters. We are examining this in a new light.â That said, 13 years is a long time ago. Evolution happens. Revolution becomes more urgent. After all,Animal Farmwas initially touted as being a motion-capture production; as you can see from the clip, the finished product is CG animated instead. Quoting from the film’s press materials, Variety notes that Serkis explained “I didnât want pantomime performances. I wanted internalized emotion, each close-up had to carry weight … Itâs a political fairytale that needed to feel both painterly and real.â And the themes indeed may be edgier than Serkis initially teased; theAnimal Farmpress notes have him describe his film as “Wolf of Wall StreetmeetsBronx Tale, through the eyes of a pig.” The official synopsis: “When a group of farm animals rebel and kick their neglectful farmer off the land, life is good and the dream of a free, equitable future is within sight. But power struggles among some of literatureâs most infamous characters ensue, and the realities of living in a world designed for mankind complicate and corrupt the satirical and allegorical, Animal Farm.â The rest of theAnimal Farmcast includes Serkis himself, as well as Woody Harrelson, Glenn Close, Steve Buscemi, Laverne Cox, Jim Parsons, Kathleen Turner, and Iman Vellani. There’s no theatrical date set yet, but later in 2025 feels like a safe bet. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Conspiracy Theorists Think the Elon-Trump Feud Is Just a Ruse to Expose the Real Pedophiles",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk dropped a bombshell in his new feud with Donald Trump on Thursday, claiming the president is “in the Epstein files,” a reference to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The billionaire claimed it was why the files hadn’t yet been released, despite ongoing and increasingly desperate promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi. But conspiracy theorists are too smart to believe Trump was actually in cahoots with Epstein. In fact, they believe the entire war of words between the president and the Tesla CEO is all a ruse to finally expose the real pedophiles. Or something. Conspiracy theorist Dinesh D’Souza, the director of the discredited “documentary”2000 Mules, posted to X on Thursday that perhaps the fight between these two men was actually the start of something much bigger. “Is this some sort of perverse scheme to force the release of the Epstein files?” D’Souzawrote. “How great it would be to have a horde of bad guys publicly exposed. Then Trump and Elon break out the champagne. Elon says, ‘Told you I could get Democrats to scream for that list.’ Laughter!” Obviously, D’Souza’s logic here doesn’t make any sense. The Trump administration doesn’t need Democrats to get upset for any files to be released. The attorney general said they would be released, and instead, she invited a bunch of far-right weirdos to the White House back in February tohold up binderswith no new information in them. D’Souza was granted a pardon by Trump in 2018 after he was convicted for illegal campaign contributions, but he’s one of the relatively mainstream pundits who all think Musk and Trump are playing 10D chess. There’s also an army of absolute dipshits who believe in the QAnon conspiracy theory currently insisting on social media that it’s all a ruse. And they’re pointing to tweets from Democrats as proof that it’s the other side who should be worried. The Democratic Party’s X account seized on the dispute Thursday,writing, “What is Trump hiding? Release the Epstein files.”And that caused people like Liz Crokin, a journalist-turned-QAnon lunatic, toinsist, “They already took the bait hook line & sinker!” In another tweet, Crokincalled itthe “fake Trump-Elon feud” referring to it as kayfabe, the wrestling term for portraying staged events as real. Crokin joined the likes of fellow conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in arguing that there’s no evidence Trump was doing anything nefariouswith Epstein:“Iâve also been investigating President@realDonaldTrumpties to Jeffrey Epstein for the past decade and came to the same conclusion @AlexJones has. Thereâs zero evidence implicating Trump in any crimes!” Jones initially seemed open to the idea that Trump was doing something sketchy with Epstein on Thursday but later framed his tweets as just asking questions. By Friday, Jones was on his showInfoWarsputting his finger to the wind trying to defend both men, while insisting the Democrats were the real criminals. “Almost everybody was asking are you on Trump’s side or Musk’s side and I said I’m on neither side. I’m on team humanity, which means I’m on the side of truth,” Jones said on his show Friday. “If the Democrats had any real proof of Trump involved with underage girls with Epstein you’d heard about it nine years ago.” The people who believe in conspiracy theories like QAnon are firmly planted in the MAGA camp and need to accomplish some incredible feats of mental gymnastics to hold the beliefs that they do. Jeffrey Epstein was well known as a friend of Trump’s when the two lived in Palm Beach. And Epstein told a journalist over the course of100 hoursof discussion that he had photos of Trump with “young girls” who were “topless.” The way Trump supporters rationalize all of this is they insist Trumpdistanced himselffrom Epstein because the late pedophile tried to hit on the daughter of a club member at Mar-a-Lago. But other reports suggest their friendship actually ended over a real estate deal thatwent south. Whatever happened, there’s no question that Trump and Epstein were very close, something the president has previously acknowledged in a2002 interviewthat he was “fun” and a “terrific guy.” Conservative media has long tried to distance Trump from Epstein, with a Fox News segment in 2020 even editing the presidentout of a photowith the notorious sex criminal. And Fox News was clearly off balance on Thursday night, unsure who to root for. Musk also has his connections to Epstein, even if they’re not quite so direct as an open friendship. Business Insider reportedback in 2020that Epstein set up Musk’s brother Kimball with a girlfriend. And, of course, there’s that infamous picture of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell with Musk at a party in 2014. The billionaire has tried to say she just photobombed him but it’s not clear what was actually happening there, since other reports have come out thatthey talked. For his part, Trump said in 2020 that he “wished her well” when Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking. But people who have previously celebrated both Musk and Trump seem to be forced into choosing a side. One of the things that’s getting lost in the fight between Trump and Musk is that Musk seems to be admitting he somehow had access to tightly held files at the U.S. Department of Justice. And that’s certainly believable, given Musk’s access to the private data of American citizens over recent months. Among all the conspiracy theories online, there were also jokes. So many jokes. As social media’s most legendary account @drilput it, “the president wont see your cheap dunks against jeffery epstein. But your friends who have ties to state sponsored pedophilia will.” And then there were the memes. Justendless memes. It remains to be seen what impact this fight may have on the real world, from Musk’s contracts with the federal government to all those DOGE staffers who’ve wedged themselves into the nooks and crannies of the federal government. As Wired reportedthis week, guys like 19-year-old Edward “Big Balls” Coristine went from Special Government Employees to full-time government staff raking in some of the highest possible salaries. There are plenty of people who are insisting Trump and Musk could quickly reconcile and all of this could be old news by next week. And that’s entirely possible. But it’s really hard to just go back to being best friends after you play the pedo card, something that Musk likes to do frequently. Remember when Musk got upset at the cave diver in Thailand after that soccer team got stuck in a cave? The diver said Musk’s idea for a rescue submarine wouldn’t work, which incensed the billionaire. Incredibly, Musk won a defamation suit filed by the diver after the Tesla CEO said he didn’tliterallymean to call him a pedophile. It doesn’t seem like either man is going to file any lawsuits over their current spat, but they’re both extremely litigious. And if Trump makes good on his threats to pull NASA contracts from SpaceX, you can bet Musk will try to retaliate in any way he can. These guys love their retribution, which is good for them when they’re working together on the same team. But aiming that hatred at each other could get messy very quickly.

    "title": "The ‘Wheel of Time’ Showrunner Still Hopes Its Story Continues Elsewhere",
    "article_text": "Fans haven’t given uponThe Wheel of Timeâthe Robert Jordan epic fantasy adaptation that wasjust abruptly cancelledby Amazon after three seasonsâand neither hasshowrunner Rafe Judkins. Prior to what turned out to be the show’s final outingon Prime Video, Judkins spoke abouthis commitment to finishingThe Wheel of Time‘s story, and he’s renewing that vow in a new social media post. Judkins took toInstagramto share his reaction to the cancellation (he feels fans’ pain, that much is clear), praise his collaborators, and weigh in on the current state of the TV industry. Here’s the full statement: “I’ve been asked the same questions many times the last weekâwhy wasThe Wheel of Timecancelled? And the truth is, I don’t know. I wish I could say something clear and tidy that explains to all of us who love it why it’s coming to an end, but sadly, I can’t. What I can say is that the actors and crew on our show are the most talented and wonderful group of people I’ve ever had the pleasure to work with. And we’ve all been incredibly lucky to make something that not only was beloved by fans (and even critics! ha!), but was also watched by huge numbers of people all over the world, appearing in the Nielsen Top 10 for nearly 20 weeks, a feat very few shows have been able to match in the last decade. One of my core goals in making this show, even from the earliest crafting of the pitch, has been to tell the whole story. Because the Wheel of Time books do what television has always done bestâget better as they go. And as our actors and team came on board, they too could see the potential if we were allowed to finish this incredible story. We made many sacrifices, both personal and creative, along the way to get to that ending, so coming up short feels like a devastating blow for all of us. Much has been written about this larger trend in TV toward fewer seasons with less episodes and finding quicker ways to acquire additional streaming subscribers. But I genuinely believe this goes against the fundamental strength of televisionâlong-form storytelling. It is an art form, much like epic fantasy, which at its very best, gives people a place to go and spend time with the characters that they love year after year. And I believe there are executives, studios, and networks who know that. I believe that we will find our way through this current iteration of the industry and back to what we do bestâbringing great characters into people’s living rooms and lives every week.” Finally, Judkins offered some hope forWheel of Time‘s future, referencing another fan-favorite series that got a joyfully unexpected resurrection after being cancelled. “WillWheel of Timeget to do that with another network and finish the story? Sadly, it’s not something that happens often. But it does happen. In fact, one of the reasons we first chose Amazon as a home for the show was because they were in the midst of picking upThe Expanseafter SYFY cancelled it. So, who knows, perhaps theWheel of Timeshow will do what the books have always managed to do since day oneâdefy the traditional definitions of ‘beginnings’ and ‘ends’. I certainly hope it doesâbecause this book series and these fans deserve to see the story finished.” We’ll keep you posted if and whenThe Wheel of Timedoes indeed find a new home on a different streamer. Considering the reason given for theWheel of Timebeing cancelled was financial concerns, it’d have to be a deep-pocketed outlet. Maybe Netflix will pull aLucifer-style rescue and add another fantasy title to its library, especially now thatThe Sandmanis ending soon? Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Everything We Expect Apple to Announce at WWDC25 on June 9",
    "article_text": "Apple is planning to completely rejigger the software on all its biggest products, from the iPhone and Mac all the way down to theVision Pro. To promote this rapid maturation across the Apple ecosystem, every OS will reportedly experience a growth spurt andjump from whatever number it’s on to â26,â according to Bloomberg. Appleâs first major overhaul of all its software offerings in years may be more subtle than you might expect when they debut next week atWWDC25Â on June 9 at10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET. Thereâs a whole host of visual changes coming to the alleged iOS 26, macOS 26 (reportedly dubbed “Tahoe” in honor of the famed freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains), iPadOS 26, and all the rest. The most immediate differences are said to be purely visual. Bloombergâs Mark Gurman has suggested in multiple reports that iOS and the family of Appleâs products will sport new bubbles inspired by the glassy, transparent windowsfound in the Vision Pro’s visionOS. According to reports, this new look will be the new unifying theme for all of Appleâs ecosystem. Several sources have referred to this design as âSolarium,â effectively a sunroom that allows light to pass through at multiple angles. Imagine all your app icons with transparent or translucent, glass-like textures, and you probably wonât be far from the mark next week. Despite the big talk, we donât expect it to be so outside the norm ofwhat we had with iOS 18. The last big OS update included customizable app icons and widgets, and we expect those to remain if Apple takes the âbubbleâ route with its new UX. Knowing Appleâs normal slow pace of OS software updates, iOS 26 will likely be far less zany thanAndroid 16âs recent Material 3 Expressive redesign. Appleâs smaller product portfolio, includingCarPlayand tvOS, could bear many of these design elements. The Apple Watch interfacemay look differentin the coming months with this upcoming software revamp. Apple may add more health and fitness features to its smartwatches, though the rumored âAI Doctor,” which would offer insights based on the data your watch collects from you, may not receive its license to practice in time for WWDC25. More of Gurmanâs recent deluge of leaks suggested Apple may finally add more Mac features to iPadOS to make it far better at multitasking, beyond its current Stage Manager mode. Current reports from usually accurate sources donât exactly have us pounding at the gates of Apple Park to see whatâs in store.9to5Macreported this week the Messages app may finally be able to access an automated text translation similar to whatâs been around onSamsung Galaxy phonesfor the last two years. The Apple Music app may showcase the album art on your phoneâs lock screen while playing tunes. With a little more than a weekend out from WWDC25, Gurman shared all-new details about how Macs will brandish this new “Solarium” redesign. MacOS 26, or “Tahoe,” will showcase a redesigned menu bar and window buttons. This should include some of these see-through elements, though none of your app icons will migrate far from where they currently sit on your desktop screen. What will reportedly be different is the new focus on “pop-out menus,” which Gurman highlighted as a continuous design across Apple’s entire ecosystem. Additionally, all of Apple’s operating systems will include customizable views for the weather, stock, and appointment widgets. The Preview app, which on Mac is used to quickly see your files, pictures, or videos, is said to be coming to iPads and iPhones as well. Not too long ago, just a single trip around the sun, Apple promised it would launch its big AI overhaul on iPhone, Mac, and practically every other device. Apple Intelligence was supposed to transform Siri from a know-nothing bonehead into a sophisticated chatbot capable of doing more than merely setting timers and alarms. After a year of badâthough often hilariousâAI summaries andlimited use cases, numerous reportsbased on leaks from inside Applesuggest the companytook a big step backfrom its AI ambitions. Gurman has suggested Apple may entice more outside AI companies beyond OpenAI, like Anthropicâthe makers of Claudeâand even Google’s Gemini to promote their models on Appleâs software ecosystem. Apple may also offer its foundation models to third-party developers to let app makers design their own text summary machines. The big “AI” upgrade for iOS 26 will reportedly be a live translation for phone calls and text messages. This means as you talk, you’ll be able to read the translation on your phone. Other than that, Gurman says Genmoji will allow you to combine two standard emojis into one homunculus emoji. GurmansuggestedApple will stay relatively mum about its Apple Intelligence snafu at WWDC25. The company had previously hinted we would have seen the AI-enhanced Siri before this summer, but now thereâs no sign it will arrive in 2025. Bloomberg said some people inside Apple hope to make up for lost time in 2026. By then, maybe weâll have AI features that move beyond the hype bubble and offer something truly useful. Weâre expecting Apple to reveal a few unexpected surprises come June 9. Thereâs a chance Apple could make another big push into gaming with adedicated video game appon its devices.Reportssuggest this app could incorporate Apple Arcade and the select few games that have been ported to Appleâs ecosystem in recent years. It also could include achievement-like emblems for completing in-game tasks and leaderboards. Appleâs visionOS 26 may also increase its gaming capabilities, perhaps withthird-party controller connectivity. As much as we may want it, Apple probably wonât offer its own first-party controllers or share details of any new hardware at all. This “Games” app, as Gurman claimed, will have tabs for “Play Together. This feature will likely try to push multiplayer-centric games with other people in your contacts. The most exciting gaming announcement for all of Apple’s ecosystem may be the addition of support for third-party VR controllers. Gurman highlighted the PlayStation VR2 controllers. Perhaps it may finally facilitate traditional VR games on the Apple Vision Pro. If Valve could make a Steam Link app for Vision Pro, it may become the most-premium way to playHalf-Life Alyx. iPhones are getting the lion’s share of new features, as per usual. Gurman suggested the update to the Camera app is supposed to make its already simple interface even simpler. In addition to the previously mentioned Preview app coming to iPhones, iOS 26 will reportedly add a new view for the Phone app that brings together all your most recent calls, voicemails, and favorite contacts. Apple doesn’t typically announce new hardware at WWDC25, and there’s no indication that it will do so this year. If you want to see thatrumored iPhone 17 Airor the rest of the iPhone 17 family, new Apple Watch, and AirPods, youâll have to sit on your hands until September, just like always.

    "title": "‘The Life of Chuck’ May Change the Way You Look at Movies and Yourself",
    "article_text": "This review ofThe Life of Chuck,the new film by Mike Flanaganbased on anovella by Stephen King, starts in 1994. I was only 14 years old, still educating myself in the world of movies, when I found myself sitting down to see this new one everyone was talking about calledPulp Fiction. As it got toward the end, however, I found myself incredibly confused. Wasn’tJohn Travolta’s characterdead? How was he back? I may have only been a kid, but I knew I’d watched him die, and now he was alive again. It wasn’t until a little later when my formative teenage brain realized director Quentin Tarantino was telling his story out of order that I began to understand. That was something I had yet to encounter in burgeoning film fandom, and it helped turnPulp Fictioninto one of my favorite films ever. I mention this in a review ofThe Life of Chuckbecause the first time I saw it, I had a similar reaction.The Life of Chuckis very purposefully told backwards, and when characters from the third act (which you see first) appeared in illogical ways in the first act (which you see third), it didn’t quite click. I was absolutely loving the movie, but one tiny piece was missing. Then, once that piece clicked for me, everything came together. It was a perfect puzzle that needed a touch more effort than most movies do. That’s not to sayThe Life of Chuckwill have the kind of infinite cultural impactPulp Fictiondid, but both films are beautiful in part because of their faith in the audience. Both are films bold enough to leave things to the imagination, to not connect every dot, and then let you figure it out for yourself. And, likePulp Fiction, when you watchThe Life of Chucka second timeâwhich I had the privilege of doing before writing this reviewâit’s like watching a new movie. You can see every piece of foreshadowing in the story. Every clue that’s subtly laced in there. And absent from any confusion, you can think about the film’s bigger intentions and choices, which is whereThe Life of Chucktruly shines. The Life of Chuckstars Tom Hiddleston as the title character, Charles “Chuck” Kranz, who in the first part of the film is described as “Oz of the apocalypse.”Chiwetel Ejiofor and Karen Gillanlead a wholly intriguing, provocative, and terrifying story of the end of the world, where Chuck’s image just so happens to keep popping up. Hiddleston takes over the role in the second act, which dramatizes a short but memorable moment in his life, and then the role is passed to three young actorsâCody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, and Jacob Tremblayâin the last third, as we see Chuck’s childhood. As the story dives deeper into who Chuck really was, Flanagan lets both the character and the audience consider the universe and our place in it. The film is filled with mind-bending philosophical conversations about dancing, math, the universe, and more, most of which we learn as Chuck does. It’s funny, it’s sweet, and it continually keeps you on your toes. Along the way, the film asks us to never forget the first third of the movie where Chuck was the star of another story, and slowly start to work it all out. We’re watching this beautiful rumination on the simple pleasures of life, all while this large mystery of “What the hell was that?” looms over it like a cloud. Flanagan fills his story with fantastic actors giving career-best performances. There’s Ejiofor and Gillan of course, but also Mia Sara(Ferris Bueller’s Day Off), Carl Lumbly(Captain America: Brave New World), and even Mark Freaking Hamill. All of the actors playing Chuck are delightful too, with Pajak having the largest role and thereby making the most impact. Some of these characters appear in more than one segment, but most don’t, a choice that makes a lot of sense once you understand what the film is actually doing. But, I have to admit, without piecing that puzzle together,The Life of Chuckdoes feel a little empty. It may, in fact, but a little too subtle with its intentions on a first pass. There’s a fine line with making your narrative too obvious to be powerful and too subtle to be clear, and Flanagan walks that line throughout the whole movie. However, if you watch the movie a second time, you can see it’s much less subtle than you thought on a first watch. It’s just about paying attention and remaining engaged. The Life of Chuckis a powerful and beautiful movie. It’s filled with humor and heart, as well as incredible conversations and revelations. It’s also more than a little out there, and certainly not for everyone. When you see it for what it truly is, though, it may change not just how you look at movies, but your own life as well. The Life of Chuckis now playing in limited release and opens wide June 13. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Apple Has a Huge Siri Problem That WWDC 2025 Probably Won’t Fix",
    "article_text": "Apple’s annual WWDC developer conference is almost here, and it’s shaping up to be an important one. Not just for iOS, which is taking another step forward into a rumored redesignediOS 19âerâiOS 26, or for iPadOS, which just gotWhatsApp right on time, or even for visionOS, the operating system for Apple’s seemingly sidelinedVision Pro headsetthat is still awaiting a rumored cheaper version. Put all of those expected updates aside for a moment, because Apple actually has bigger fish to fry this year, and no iOS redesign will be enough to distract from the big, pink, AI-shaped elephant in the room. It’s time to talk about AI Siri, or the lack thereof. In case you haven’t been keeping track,Apple Intelligence has had some strugglessince Apple’s launch in October 2024, and the most notable of those stumbles is arguably its LLM-powered Siri voice assistant, which, to date, still hasn’t made its debut. As Bloomberg’sMark Gurman reported in March, Apple has delayed its Siri upgrade indefinitely after trying and failing to get its Apple Intelligence centerpiece up to snuff. “…Apple was struggling to finish developing the features and the enhancements would be postponed until at least May when iOS 18.5 is due to arrive,” Bloomberg wrote in March. “Since then, Apple engineers have been racing to fix a rash of bugs in the project. The work has been unsuccessful, according to people involved in the efforts, and they now believe the features wonât be released until next year at the earliest.” Listen, things happen, products get delayed, and plans go awry, but that’s not necessarily what makes Apple’s Siri stumble interesting; it’s that the issue may be indicative of the company’s struggles with developing next-gen AI in general, and given the way things are going in the tech world right now, that’s decidedly bad for business. Apple has already started its journey into integrating generative AI and LLM-powered features into its products from a position that’s well behind competitors. That’s not unusualâApple is known for a more wait-and-see approachâbut when the wait-and-see is coupled with struggles out of the gate, eyebrows tend to raise. That’s exactly where we’re at now. And given those very public struggles and the pressure to amend them, WWDC 2025 may come with higher stakes than usual, not just to move the entire iOS ecosystem forward in a substantive way, but to set the record straight on Apple’s acumen in the still very volatile world of AI. Does Apple have the brainpower and vision to set a course for Apple Intelligence, or has the AI/ML team in charge of the features earned the internalnickname reportedly bestowed by the company’s fellow engineers? That nickname, by the way, is AIMLess. Ouch… The good news for Apple is that, for the most part, the pressure is more optical than consequential at this point. Most people, despite the business emphasis on generative AI and LLMs, aren’t fixated on their phones, laptops, or tablets having those AI features. In fact,recent polling from CNETabout whether people with iPhones or Samsung phones actually use or want AI features seems to suggest that interest is tepid at best. According to a poll from December 2024, an overwhelming number of people (73% of iPhone users and 87% of Samsung users, to be exact) who can use AI on their devices say that they think the features add little to no value to their general phone experience. For that reason, I’m not going to call WWDC 2025 a make-or-break moment for Apple’s AI features by any means, but it’s also not a complete write-off either. While Apple figures out a way to set its course straight, other competitors like Samsung and Google seem to be plowing ahead and throwing AI features at the wall. Most of those are frankly small potatoes right now, but that may not be the case for long. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still skeptical of AI’s long-term impact on our gadgets and lives in general, but given the amount of capital and attention on AI, that could all soon change. And if Apple is behind foranother year,then that makes it even harder to catch up. Still, it’s more about optics, and if I were a betting man, I’d put money on Apple shifting the emphasis on its alleged flashy redesign of iOS and hoping the attention stays on the things that itisdoing as opposed to what’s missing. And maybe iOS will be enough to steal the show. Early rumors suggestthere’s a big visual overhaulcoming that’s inspired by visionOS, and lord knows I’m a sucker for a vibe shift. There are also rumors of agaming hubthat unifies Apple gaming across platforms and features like improved battery management that may give your device some extra juice. I’m sure there will be a lot to sort through once WWDC 2025 is actually underway next week, and I’m sure much of it will be additive and maybe even fun, but the fact remains: Apple won’t be able to hide from its AI missteps for long, and the developer conference may be the perfect time to rip that Siri-shaped band-aid off.

    "title": "Trump Could Be the First Person to Turn a Profit on a Used Tesla in Years",
    "article_text": "It appears Donald Trump has moved to the “getting rid of your ex’s stuff” portion of his breakup with Elon Musk. White House officialsconfirmed to the New York Poston Friday that Trump plans to sell his recently purchased Tesla. Given the potential collector’s value of the car, it could be the first used Tesla to actually be sold for a profit in a hot minute. Trump bought the red Model S back in March during what could be described as a thinly disguised Tesla advertisement shot in front of the White House. Back then, Tesla was the subject ofmass protests across the country, a response to Musk’s efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire federal employees and cancel contracts for things like housing assistance and cancer research. At the time, Tesla’s stock price was starting to feel the crunch of public pressure, and Trump threw Musk a bone by giving his company avery public vote of confidence. Since then, the car has mostly sat in the White House parking lot, available for staffers to use,per the Post. Trump hasn’t driven it due to security concerns, and also because he just doesn’t drive much other than a golf cart. So hey, at least the buyer knows there aren’t many miles on the thing. The down side for Trump is there islots of competition on the secondary market, as people have ditched the brand in recent months and theresale value has tanked. Frankly, compared to the way the rest of the very public split has played out, Trump’s decision to quietly sell the Tesla rather than making a big spectacle of it (so far, at least) seems almost mature. Of course, when the bar is set atimplying your ex-partner is a pedophile, it’s not hard to come off as the more reasonable one. There was evenword last night from Politicothat Trump might be open to sitting down with Musk to repair the relationship, but that window appears closed on Friday, asNBC reportedTrump is not interested in taking Musk’s calls. Musk has largely quieted down since he dropped his “bomb” on Trump, accusing him of being in the Epstein filesâlikely not based on any actual new information that he has, but the fact that numbers and addressesassociated with Trumpappeared in Jeffery Epstein’s “Little Black Book” that waspublished by Gawker in 2015. But the fallout of the split has hit right-wing influencers hard, forcing them to pick a side or try fence-sitting for as long as their audience will allow them to. Things are still shaking out, but it looks likeTrump got CatTurdin the divorce, whileMusk got Ian Miles Cheong.

    "article_text": "The Disneyland Resort is officiallytrading one Sullyfor another.At the D23 Expo last year, Disney confirmed James Cameron’s world ofAvatarwould be coming to its California Adventuretheme park in Anaheim, as well as a new ride based on Pixar’sCoco. What the company didn’t reveal at the time was where the heck those things would fit into the already crowded area. Well, Thursday night, Disney announced those locations and revealed that the addition of Na’vi leader Jake Sully meanteveryone’s favorite blue monster, Sulley, would be saying goodbye Monsters Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!, a family-friendly ride which opened at Disney California Adventure in 2005, is officially closing in early 2026 to make way for this newAvatar“experience.”Avatarwill also take over the majority of that area of the park, the Hollywood Backlot, meaning a signature California area will be leaving California Adventure. As forCoco, that ride will be going on the other side of the park near Paradise Gardens Park and Pixar Pier. Which is fitting, as that’s where many other Pixar-themed rides reside. Nothing will be leaving for that, though, as it’ll largely take over “backstage” areas. Construction onCocowill begin this fall.Avataris “still in the early stages of development,” so we still don’t know what, specifically, it’s even going to be or when it’s going to start construction. Just that to do so,Monsters Inc.will permanently close in 2026. Of course, withMonsters Inc.leaving the West Coast, we should mention it’s being reborn on the East Coast. Don’t forget thatback at the D23 Expo, it was also announced a fullMonsters Inc.land was coming to Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida, highlighted by a wild-looking roller coaster. So, the hit Pixar franchise isn’t being totally shafted, just shifted. Finally, in a piece of news that is basically just for people who live on the West Coast, with Disneyland doing all of this construction, it will also be adding a new transportation hub and parking lot. Which, we know, doesn’t sound all that exciting. But if you’ve ever driven to Disneyland and been stuck in traffic at one of its two giant parking lots, anything to alleviate that pressure is a big deal. It’ll be on the east side of the park, behind Tomorrowland, and will offer all manner of improved transportation solutions.

    "title": "OpenAI Appeals ‘Sweeping, Unprecedented Order’ Requiring It Maintain All ChatGPT Logs",
    "article_text": "Last month, a federal judge ordered OpenAI to indefinitely maintain all of ChatGPT’s data as part of an ongoing copyright lawsuit. In response, OpenAI has filed an appeal to overturn the decision stating that the “sweeping, unprecedented order” violates its users’ privacy. The New York Timessuedboth OpenAI and Microsoft in 2023 claiming that the companies violated copyrights by using its articles to train their language models. However, OpenAIsaidthe Times’ case is “without merit” and argued that the training falls under “fair use”. Previously, OpenAI only kept chat logs for users of ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro who didn’t opt out. However, in May, the Times and other news organizationsclaimedthat OpenAI was engaging in a “substantial, ongoing” destruction of chat logs that could contain evidence of copyright violations. Judge Ona Wang responded by ordering ChatGPT to maintain and segregate all ChatGPT logs that would otherwise be deleted. In a court appeal, OpenAI argued that Wang’s order “prevent[s] OpenAI from respecting its users’ privacy decisions.” According to Ars Technica, the company also claimed that the Times’ accusations were “unfounded”, writing, “OpenAI did not ‘destroy’ any data, and certainly did not delete any data in response to litigation events. The order appears to have incorrectly assumed the contrary.” “The [Times] and other plaintiffs have made a sweeping and unnecessary demand in their baseless lawsuit against us,” COO Brad Lightcapsaidin a statement. He added that the demand for OpenAI to retain all data “abandons long-standing privacy norms and weakens privacy protections.” On X, CEO Sam Altman wrote that the “inappropriate request…sets a bad precedent.” He also added that the case highlights the need for “AI privilege” where “talking to an AI should be like talking to a lawyer or a doctor.” we have been thinking recently about the need for something like \"AI privilege\"; this really accelerates the need to have the conversation. imo talking to an AI should be like talking to a lawyer or a doctor. i hope society will figure this out soon. — Sam Altman (@sama)June 6, 2025 The court order triggered an initial wave of panic. Per Ars Technica, OpenAI’s court filing cited social media posts from LinkedIn and X where users expressed concerns about their privacy. On LinkedIn, one person warned their clients to be “extra careful” about what information they shared with ChatGPT. In another example, someone tweeted, “Wang apparently thinks the NY Times’ boomer copyright concerns trump the privacy of EVERY @OPENAI USER – insane!!!” On one hand, I couldn’t imagine having a ChatGPT log sensitive enough data that I’d care if someone else read it.However, people do use ChatGPT as a therapist, for life advice, and even treat it as aromantic partner. Regardless of whether I’d personally do the same, they deserve the right to keep that content private.Â At the same time, the Times’ case isn’t as baseless as OpenAI claims. It is absolutely worth discussing how artificial intelligence is trained. Remember when Clearview AIscraped 30 billion imagesfrom Facebook to train its facial recognition? Or reports that the federal government uses images of vulnerable peopleto test facial recognition software? Yes, those examples exist outside of journalism and copyright law. However, it highlights the need for conversations about whether companies like OpenAI should need explicit consent to utilize content rather than scraping whatever they want from the internet.

He needs co-stars, aliens, droids, and now the very first of those has come into view. The InSneider reports, and io9 has confirmed, that Mia Goth, the actress best known for her roles inPearl, X,andMaXXXine, who’ll soon appear Guillermo del Toro’sFrankensteinand Christopher Nolan’sThe Odyssey, has been cast in the upcomingStar Warsfilm. No word on what the role is specifically, but it is a villain according tothe Hollywood Reporter, and the same oneAnorastar and Oscar-winner Mikey Madison was circling before moving along due to money issues. Shawn Levy(Stranger Things, Night at the Museum)is directing and has been attached toStar Warssince 2022.In the meantime, he went off and made a little movie calledDeadpool &Wolverine, and eventually Jonathan Tropper (who worked with Levy onThe Adam Project) was brought on towrite the script. Then,Âearlier this year, Gosling was attached to the project before finally, atStar WarsCelebration Japan, we gotthe official news, title, and release dateof May 28, 2027. The film is set five years after the events ofThe Rise of Skywalkermeaning it’ll be our first look at life after the ultimate defeat of Emperor Palpatine. However, it’s standalone, so expect all new characters. Goth has been acting since 2013, working with some of the most interesting filmmakers in the business. Her most commercial role, however, came in 2022’sXfrom Ti West, where she played an adult film actress who survives a horrible series of murders. That film was followed byPearlandMaXXXine, meaning that Goth now had her own franchise and trilogy. Hollywood took notice and, in recent years, she’s upped her game even more, working onFrankenstein, The Odyssey,and nowStar Wars. We still don’t know whatStarfighteris about, but rumors are that it may involve some sort of mentor/mentee relationship between Gosling’s pilot and a younger character, potentially his nephew.

It’s seeded pretty early on that Ursa, the Viking warrior voiced by Lindsay LaVanchy; Kenji, the feudal ninja voiced by Louis Ozawa; and Torres, the World War II pilot voiced by Rick Gonzalez, who have all killed a Predator, have been subsequently captured and brought to an alien planet. And to answer your first question, no, this did not involve time travel. Each character is frozen in their time and then awoken when they are needed. “That’s why we specifically put in the line that Torres says ‘I feel like I’ve been asleep forever,’ to try to help because I know it certainly could be misconstrued,” director Dan Trachtenberg told io9. So they wake up, have to fight some Predator creatures, and each manages to escape in their own unique ways. For Torres and Kenji it’s a literal escape, at least for now. Don’t forget, they are on an alien planet, in a spaceship, and neither has been alive in an era where space travel has been a reality. So you can’t imagine even if they get off the planet, they’d have any idea get back to Earth. Plus, last we saw them, they were again being hunted by probably hundreds of Predators, so we have to assume they are going to get caught at some point. As for Ursa, her sacrifice is the only thing that gives Torres and Kenji a fighting chance and, as a reward, she’s once again put into that frozen stasis. A tactic which, it’s revealed, the Predators have used a lot. Ursa is moved into an almostRaiders of the Lost Arkstorage facility filled with pods. Pods as far as the eye can see. And, one of them, the last one we see, contains Naru, the star of the moviePreyplayed by Amber Midthunder. “Holy shit!” This reveal, of course, raises so many questions, one of which we can answer definitively. “I think now we can say people who defeat the Predator get captured and are frozen,” Trachtenberg told io9. Which indirectly implies that, yes, Mike Harrigan fromPredator 2might be there or even Dutch fromPredator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. We don’t see them, of course, but they, and seemingly thousands of other species that have beaten a Predator, were then captured. (Another link: Torres is also given the gun Harrigan had inPredator 2.One we also saw inPrey.) On a larger scale, this revelation gives us some fascinating insights into Predator culture. For one thing, they can be defeated and have been many times. And yet, they treat those defeats as lessons, taking the victors to their planet. But why? Do they all get to fight the Warlord Predator? Are they just there for entertainment? Are they studied? None of that is clear but, maybe, will become so in the future. On a more specific scale, the tease raises some questions about a potentialPrey 2. Is a second movie starring Naru about how she is captured? Or was she captured after the events in the film, and any future stories will now take place in the future? Plus, when is that future, specifically? Naru’s story, as well as Kenji’s and Ursa’s, all took place years before Torres’. So while this could all be happening in the 1940s on Earth, it could also be the 4040s or something. We don’t know for sure. Nevertheless, reintroducing Naru was a decision that was made early on, and with great anticipation. “It was thrilling,” co-director Josh Wassung saidÂ about the Naru reveal. “We just knew it would be something that fans would get so excited for. And… Dan alluded to he just wanted to make sure the fans knew that he was still thinking about that character.” So what are your thoughts here? Are we gearing up for anAvengers: Endgamemega-crossover event? Can the Predators ever truly be defeated? And how does the fact that the next movie,Predator: Badlands,stars a Predator as the hero, change things? All very, very fun to think about. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "Think a whimsical The Witness, with collaborative puzzle-solving, discos and basketball. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The team behind Untitled Goose Game announced Big Walk in late 2023, and even though its description was pretty straightforward—\"a cooperative multiplayer adventure about teamwork and talking\" —there's still a lot of mystery around it. What kind of teamwork will it require? Are there any goals? What are those weird wobbly spheric creatures, and can theyhonk? Big Walk got a big showing at today's Day of the Devs showcase, and what struck me in 2023 as a niche amusement now feels quite ambitious: it's a bit like a cooperative sandbox take on The Witness. In a big open world that resembles the Australian outback (House House is from Melbourne) you and a group of friends will \"walk\" and \"talk\". The latter utilises a proximity chat system that works as you'd expect: the further away your friend is on the map, the fainter their voice will be. This is important, because you can lose your friends in Big Walk, which is possibly annoying if you're focusing on completing the game's challenges. In the video above a few examples of those challenges are provided: Some involve miming, or collaborative code decryption, and one even involves singing. There's also more physical activities like platforming, and basketball. The puzzles are many and varied, and can be approached in any order. Or, you can just mess around. Some examples of messing around include going to a disco or throwing your friend's binoculars into the sea. Let's face it: with four players in a big feature-packed open world, that's probably what the main activity will be for most. I love the idea that I can lose my friends in Big Walk if I'm not paying attention, and I especially love that if I do, I can't just bark over my mic for directions: I'll need to use a megaphone, or one of my friends will need to use a flare (if they want me to find them). The thought of navigating an open world with buddies under restrictions similar to the real world is exciting to me. Big Walk is scheduled to release in 2026.

    "article_text": "Benevolent yoinking. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At today's Day of the Devs stream, Sithe Ncube, producer at South African game studio Nyamakop, shared a sobering statistic. \"A French government report estimated that 90% of sub-Saharan African cultural heritage is in the possession of Western collections,\" Ncube said. \"That is millions upon millions of deeply important cultural, spiritual, and personal artifacts—including human remains—that aren't in their rightful place.\" In Relooted, Nyamakop's upcoming puzzle platformer, you'll be staging high-tech heists for 70 of those very real artifacts to return them to the country and people where they belong. Relooted is set in a near future where a new international treaty stipulates that all African artifacts on public display in Western museums must be returned to their country of origin. Unfortunately, the \"public\" in that statement has provided those museums with a convenient loophole: By relegating pieces of African heritage to private collections, they've been able to maintain possession.In theory.You'll coordinate a crew of repatriating vigilante-thieves operating out of a hidden base in South Africa. From there, you'll select which artifacts to reacquire from Western collections abroad, so that you can restore them to the nations where they were first taken. Those heists will consist of three phases: In the first, you'll scope out the facility where your target artifact is kept, mapping out cameras and security features you'll have to navigate. In phase two, you'll prowl the premises, avoiding raising any alerts as you carefully construct an exit route by pushing objects and practicing your imminent escape. And then, of course, there's phase three, where you'll grab the artifact, trigger the alarm, and run your escape route in (hopelessly) flawless fashion before security forces descend. In motion it looks excellent. In the Day of the Devs trailer, the player had essentially constructed their own platforming speedrun on the fly, carefully nudging bits of the environment so they could escape in a smooth sequence of sprinting, vaulting, rolling, grappling, wall-jumping, and—of course—doing cool slides beneath closing security doors. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Project Century finally has a name, though it's set in a different World War than last year's teaser. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The next game from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio wasoriginally teasedat the last Game Awards show, and back then it stood out for taking place in 1915 Japan. The trailer that just dropped at the Summer Game Fest showcase names the game at last: Stranger Than Heaven. But given that it's a noir thriller set in WW2-era Japan, I walked away as confused as I did excited. Swingin' jazz clubs, molotov cocktails, bustling city streets and an inventory packed to the gills with hand-rolled cigarettes: the game is 1943 to a T, three decades removed from what we saw 6 months ago. It might seem like they fully switched tracks, but adifferent trailerjust released in Japanese takes place in 1915, just like the old one. It seems like this game is partially set in both World Wars. As someone who loves Shenmue and mostly appreciates Yakuza's wacky antics from afar, it's hard to imagine a more tantalizing prospect than a darker, more intense RGG game that homages classic cinema. When one character asks our protagonist what kind of person he is and he responds, \"I've been asking myself the same thing,\" it gets me right in the mood for some whiskey-chugging, cigar-smoking, gritty noir goodness. I'd be in if it was only set in the '40s; given its duality, I'm doubly in. There are only brief snippets of gameplay—chucking a man off a bridge, a QTE offering the choice to show someone \"mercy\" or \"no mercy\"—but it all looks glossy and detailed as ever. Given that RGG has been on a tear ofexcellent gamesthat arestarting to blend togethera bit, I'm eager to see what they can do with a concept as ambitious as Stranger Than Heaven seems to be.

    "article_text": "Splitgate 2's battle royale mode is live now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx took the stage at Summer Game Fest today to reveal a surprise forSplitgate 2that players have been accurately guessing for a week now: Yes, Splitgate 2 has a battle royale mode, and it's out now. Sporting a questionable \"MAKE FPS GREAT AGAIN\" hat, Proulx lamented the current state of online shooters before he introduced the trailer for Splitgate 2 battle royale. \"I grew up playing Halo, and I'm tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year. And I wish we could have Titanfall 3,\" he said. \"With Splitgate 2, we asked ourselves how we can take portals to the next level. \"What if you could portal to entirely different worlds? So we combined the action, movement, and gunplay of arena shooters with the scale and intensity of something much bigger. Splitgate Battle Royale launches free right now, and it's fucking awesome.\" It's true that Splitgate 2 nods to an older era of FPS with its mode variety, simplistic guns, and presence of Halo-like power weapons—though a battle royale mode is the sort of trendy addition to a modern FPS that seemingly contradicts Proulx's longing for the social FPS bliss of the early '00s. That and the hat had me wincing at the whole thing. But I'm not wincing at Splitgate 2, which officially \"launches\" now after entering open beta a few weeks ago. It's pretty good, but itsround-based modes are decidedly less casual (and fun) than the classics it draws inspiration from. There's an awkwardness to the way 1047 is pulling Splitgate 2 in every direction at once: It's Halo, it's Call of Duty, and now it's also Apex Legends.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's not often that a game's name really and fully nails down the vibe, especially when it's only three characters. But a new trailer for the survival-horror shooter ILL showed up at the Summer Game Fest tonight, and yes indeed, that is what I am now feeling. First and foremost, we're doing it all-caps—ILL—because otherwise it becomes \"Ill,\" which is just about impossible to parse. Second, to the nature of the title itself, a few reactions to the new trailer from the PC Gamer crew: But look, you be the judge: Zombie games are a dime a dozen, but ILL looks set to raise the bar, at least in terms of uncomfortable visuals. Just in case it didn't come across adequately in the trailer, the game promises \"intense body horror with an advanced dismemberment system,\" experienced on \"a dark trip through an enthralling storyline and the heart-pounding horror of a once peaceful town.\" \"Prepare to embrace new boundaries of horror,\" theSteam pagesays. \"ILL offers a visceral and realistic depiction of body horror: disgusting, monstrous creatures can be gruesomely dismembered and traumatized. Torn flesh, exposed bones, and gutted organs—all combine to create an unprecedented and vicious experience that will leave you breathless.\" I honestly can't say that sounds like something I'm super into, and yet the trailer, while being extremely off-putting, is also captivating. I want to look away, and yet I can't. I think that comes in part from the fact that somehow, the video keeps upping the ante right to the very end—something genuinely goddamn awful happens, the title text pops up and for a split-second you think, whew it's over. But no—because then somethingeven more awfulhappens! And I don't like it—but I kinda like it, if you know what I mean. Honestly, I'm not even sure what I mean. But as much as I don't care for this sort of thing—I'm really not a body horror fan—I have to play this. I have to at least try it.

    "title": "RE9 is real: Resident Evil Requiem just got a surprise SGF reveal, and it's launching in February",
    "article_text": "Tragically, there's no giant vampire lady in sight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today at Summer Game Fest, Capcom brought a surprise gift for everyone: An announcement of a new Resident Evil, featuring a hell of a lot of unsettling hallways and what seems like the aftermath of a nuclear strike (you'll never guess where). You know, normal Resident Evil stuff. Resident Evil Requiem looks fascinatingly confusing and as upsetting as you'd want it to be, and it's launching in less than a year on February 27, 2026. But the reveal isn't all good news: Breaking the hearts of roughly half the internet, there's no giant vampire lady anywhere in the trailer. Ah, well. They can't all be Resident Evil Village. Rumors had been circulating about a possible RE9 appearance at the showcase in the run-up to the event—rumors that Capcom itself even attempted to misdirect right up until the last minute of the show. Earlier in the program, after an introduction from Lady Dimitrescu actress Maggie Robertson, Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi briefly appeared in a brief clip to thank the audience for supporting Resident Evil as it approached its 30th anniversary in March 2026. With a very brief statement, he seemed to dash any hopes that RE9 would be in tonight's show. \"Now, about the latest Resident Evil game you've all been waiting for, bear with us a little longer,\" Takeuchi said. \"Just a blink of an eye more, and it'll be ready.\" Takeuchi is, evidently, a bit of a stinker. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Capcom's clever ploy when Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley introduced the final game reveal of the show, which slowly revealed itself as—surprise—Resident Evil Requiem. The trailer, embedded above, has an intense energy from the start, as a man marches through an FBI field office to request input from one Grace Ashcroft, a flustered young FBI technical analyst, on a case report about an incident at a \"Wremwood Hotel\"—evidently the place where Grace's mother was murdered. \"Alyssa died eight years ago,\" the man, seemingly Ashcroft's director, says. At this point, with the power of frantic Googling, I deduced that Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, one of the player characters from Resident Evil Outbreak and Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2. Things seemingly did not end up well for Alyssa. Seeing the report triggers what at first seems like flashbacks for Grace, as the trailer starts showing flashes of ruined, rusted hallways, abandoned buildings, hooded figures, and medical procedures. But then those flashbacks become something else, as Grace suddenly awakens, drenched in sweat, hanging upside down in a suspended hospital gurney with a bloody bandage on her chest. And then things get stranger! We're shown glimpses of walls coated in wanted posters, cryptic statements from a man sitting in a ruined room about \"searching for a special one, a Chosen one,\" and—to cap everything off—an aerial shot of a cityscape that's been hollowed out by the crater from a massive explosion. If you can't guess which city we're working with here, you get an answer pretty quick. The camera then drops to the city's streets, working its way between rubble and abandoned vehicles to show us the ruined gates of the Raccoon City Police Department. And then, to cap things off, we get a few shots of people who have been, are currently being, or are about to be brutalized by murderers and mutated creatures. Again, normal Resident Evil stuff. If, like me, you aren't even sure where to begin with piecing this stuff together, we don't have all that long to wait. Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026.

If there's one thing everyone loves, it's crewing a pirate ship and causing chaos with your friends. Putting that ship in space can only improve things—until you're vented into the vacuum at least. That's the logic behind Wildgate, the match-based space piracy game from ex-Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime's game company Dreamhaven, which revealed at today's Summer Game Fest that the Sea of Thieves-in-space game launches on July 22. In Wildgate, you and your crew of fellow space pirates will race rival ships to be the first to claim the Artifact, a valuable relic drawing the galaxy's nastiest ne'er-do-wells to this treacherous sector full of life-threatening cosmic perils. And because your pirates, that race for the relic isn't a friendly one. While you and your team can choose from different ships with varying levels of armor, maneuverability, and shields, they all share one thing: big spaceship guns. And you'll have to put them to good use as you attempt to shell your competitors to keep them from absconding with the Artifact. Or you can forego the cannons and board the enemy ships yourself, ripping them apart from the inside. Up to you. There are other treasures to find throughout the sector, too—treasures like even bigger, better guns for you and your vessel. It's not a friendly business. The release date wasn't the only Wildgate news that accompanied the Summer Game Fest trailer above. If you want to try Wildgate before you buy, you'll have your chance very soon: Wildgate's open beta launches next week during Steam Next Fest, and you'll be able to access it from theWildgate Steam page.

We were all comfortable with Hitman going dark while IO Interactive puts the finishing touches on 007: First Light, but Agent 47 has a bit more gas in the tank. In a surprise collaboration with 007, Mads Mikkelsen has reprised his role as Casino Royale's LeChiffre to become the next elusive target. As announced at the Summer Game Fest showcase, Mikkelsen is The Banker. He needs to die, and his contract starts right now. In keeping with Hitman's elusive targets, the LeChiffre contract takes place on an existing map: A casino-themed makeover of Paris from Hitman 2016. IO and Mikkelsen himself took the stage to talk about the collaboration, which includes custom poker mechanics designed for the mission. Mikkelsen said it was an honor to return to a role that's near and dear to him, even if it means getting shot in the head with Agent 47's Silverballers. Hitman's LeChiffre contract is live now and runs through July 6. Then it'll be gone (elusively), but probably not forever: IOI has a habit of bringing elusive targets back for a limited time, even special ones like Sean Bean.

    "title": "The CTF shooter is making a comeback thanks to the manager and lead singer of Imagine Dragons, who 'grew up playing capture the flag in the woods at night with flashlights'",
    "article_text": "Last Flag is a 5v5 CTF shooter with some neat twists. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Capture the flag is my favorite shooter mode—shoutout to Quake 2 CTF—and who knew that I'd find kindred spirits in Mac and Dan Reynolds, respectively the manager and lead singer of pop rock band Imagine Dragons? At Summer Game Fest today, the Reynolds (who are brothers) and their new studio Night Street Games announced Last Flag, a 5v5 CTF shooter that looks superficially a bit like Team Fortress 2, although it's third-person. \"Dan and I grew up playing capture the flag in the woods at night with flashlights, friends, and lots of adrenaline,\" says Mac Reynolds. \"Last Flag is our attempt to honor the purity and magic of that hide and seek experience—brought to life by the incredible team of developers we're lucky enough to stand beside.\" I got to play a few rounds of Last Flag in a recent media playtest. The third-person shooting wasn't quite my style, but the design of the mode is great. At the start of a match, one player on each team is tasked with \"hiding\" their team's flag. On the map we played, that meant finding a spot anywhere within in a hilly region on my team's side of the map, which included a network of shallow mining tunnels. When the game starts, both teams emerge from subterranean spawn bunkers and, rather than rushing immediately into each other's bases like in a game of Tribes, they collide at three capture points that form a line across the center of the map. You can ignore these radar tower sub-objectives, but they're important: Once you capture a point, it provides passive healing, you can rapidly travel to it from your spawn, and best of all, it will gradually give you intel about the location of the enemy flag, eliminating regions on your team's minimap to show you where not to look. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As valuable as that intel is, I mostly opted to let my teammates fight in the center while I ran directly into enemy territory to manually search for the flag. Once you find it, even if you're immediately killed, it'll appear on your team's minimap, so the search is over. I imagine that, as players gain experience with the characters, their abilities, and the best tactics, it won't be so easy to saunter across the enemy border. One character has a recon bird for spotting enemies, and that could've stifled my infiltration. Your next goal is (of course) to bring the enemy flag back to your base and plant it in a gazebo. There's another little twist on the CFT formula here: Rather than immediately scoring a point, you have to defend the planted flag from the other team for a brief period, giving them a chance to make a clutch save by breaking through your defenses. One capture wins the match, so it's like you're always in sudden death overtime, although there is an actual OT mode that kicks in if the match runs long, tweaking the rules to encourage a speedy conclusion. It's a great concept, but I wasn't as convinced by the movement and shooting. Part of that is just personal preference borne of all those Quake hours: I like first-person shooters. But I also found it somewhat frustrating to keep my sights on enemies who were flitting around my screen erratically thanks to their special movement abilities. I sensed at times that my difficulty tracking them was made worse by lag, which was perhaps just a symptom of the playtest environment. I could also take or leave the '70s game show theme. It keeps showing up in games and I've got no particular love for the aesthetic, although the similarities to TF2 did bring back some fond memories. The soundtrack is said to feature \"fuzzy guitars, analog synths, and legit 1970s studio magic, crafted with real vintage gear,\" and I've got no complaints about that aspect of the retro theme. Last Flag is a promising game, and there's one more detail that I always like to hear: Night Street plans to release it as a paid game, with all characters and other content available to all players. I'm not against the free-to-play model in general, but I do usually prefer the overall experience of competitive games which eschew it and don't have to be stuffed with roadblocks to encourage spending. Granted, there's nothing to stop paid games from also getting too into currencies and microtransactions, but Night Street is going with the phrase \"everything included at launch,\" which sounds positive. Last Flag will come to Steam and the Epic Games Store, and there are plans for an alpha later in 2025. I definitely recommend trying it out whenever testing goes public. I'm not sure it'll give Tribes fans the medicine they're looking for—I did wish I could ski down those hills, as I gotta go fast—but getting any kind of new CTF shooter here in 2025 is a happy thing to me.

    "title": "There's a new Scott Pilgrim brawler coming from the makers of… the old Scott Pilgrim brawler (and TMNT: Shredder's Revenge)",
    "article_text": "The gang's all here (including Anamanaguchi) for Scott Pilgrim EX. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As a lifelong genre aficionado, I am downright giddy at the resurgence of the side-scrolling brawler, which wouldn't be happening without the likes ofCastle CrashersandScott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Gamekicking things off many moons ago. But time is a flat circle, so new Castle Crashers DLC is coming and we're getting another Scott Pilgrim game—the cleverly titledScott Pilgrim EX. Better yet, it's coming from Tribute Games, the crew who most recently gave us the satisfyingTMNT: Shredder's Revenge. Scott Pilgrim EX looks to be a successor to the original game, with an all-new story overseen by original comic author Bryan Lee O’Malley (also in charge of Netflix's recent Scott Pilgrim Takes Off series) and sprite by returning artist Paul Robertson, who has been busy with anarchic (and slightly NSFW) cartoon silliness likeJimmy & Baby here on Youtube. Tribute was founded by devs from the 2010 Scott Pilgrim game too, so the gang's all here, and firing on all cylinders if the reveal trailer below is any indication. Yep, that's Scott Pilgrim alright, down to the soundtrack from chiptune-rock outfit Anamanaguchi. It also appears to be doubling down on the River City Ransom inspirations, with an explorable town (Toronto, specifically), light RPG elements and enemies that you beat until they go BARF and drop their spare change on the ground to fuel your endless hunger for upgrades. The enemies are also playfully riffing off the enemies from the original, with gangs of militant vegans, demons and robots causing a ruckus. As someone who has mixed feelings on the original Scott Pilgrim brawler, I'm hoping that Tribute have learned some lessons over the years. The first game had notably wonky balance, a flaw that it partially inherited from NES classic River City Ransom: RPG elements bogged down the action potentially breaking it either in your or the enemy's favor depending on whether you were min-maxing your character builds right. It looked and sounded a treat, but could be a bit of a slog to play. But that was fifteen years ago, and Tribute have proven that they know what makes a good, fast arcade brawler tick with Shredder's Revenge. The music and art are every bit as on point as ever, and it's interesting that the trailer only shows two-player action. The original supported up to four, but it made for a very messy experience, so perhaps it's an indication of further restraint and lessons learnt. While Scott & Ramona are the only playable characters shown, others have been confirmed, and I've got my fingers crossed for a good range of movesets to differentiate them. There's a lot of potential here, and while there's been a good number of brawlers released in recent years, the number of genuinelygreatones has been somewhat smaller. Scott Pilgrim EX won't be out until next year, but you can wishlist iton Steam here. Those hankering for an arcade brawling fix from the studio won't have to wait quite that long, though, as Tribute are also working onMarvel Cosmic Invasion, a faster, scrappier looking arcade beat-em-up due later this year.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's no party like an apocalypse, and though Atomic Heartmight not have been a perfect game, it certainly held a zany lens up to the world's end with what reviewer Rich Stanton identified as \"Russian Westworld\" vibes. If you weren't taken with its BioShocky aesthetic palette, though, you might want to take a peek at the trailer that just dropped for Atomic Heart 2—it's a mad dash from mood to mood that has me wondering if I shouldn't have skipped the first one. The teaser is light on gameplay, but it's all over the place in a way I kind of dug. One second, bulbous ATVs are speeding over a beach, and the next, we're in a Cyberpunk-y nightclub where shady deals are going down. It looks snazzy, and in casting a wider net than its predecessor, might aim to claw its way out of BioShock's shadow a bit. In the gunfighting snippets they do show, there's all sorts of wallrunning, telekinetic nonsense that feels appropriately explosive for a game evoking the atomic age. There's also a bit where a giant needle gets poked into a huge flesh monster, so I'm not worried it won't be as weird as the first. Set to \"Don't Stop Me Now,\" it's as indulgently hectic as you could want. In the stream, Geoff Keighley called the game a \"spiritual successor\" to the first—whatever that means—and stressed a bigger emphasis on \"player agency\" and a \"global scale.\" The description on the game's Steam page boasts it'll \"raise the bar for what an open-world action RPG can do;\" whether it hits that ambitious target or not, it's nice to see Atomic Heart isn't ready to fade into memory just yet.

    "article_text": "The DLC-turned-standalone game dropped a new trailer at tonight's Summer Game fest showcase. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It took longer than anyone likely expected, butDying Light: The Beast—no, no, calm down, it's not actually here, but it does finally have a release date. Developer Techland revealed during today's Summer Game Fest showcase that the new addition to its popular series of zombie-stompers will be out on August 22. Dying Light: The Beast brings back Kyle Crane, the lead in the original game, who's had a rougher go of things than most videogame heroes. Instead of kicking back and enjoying the post-game fruits of his labors, Crane spent 13 years enduring horrific experiments at the hands of some creepo calling himself The Baron, who seems to be putting together a zombie army for what I imagine are not-great plans for the rest of the world. Having finally escaped, Crane is looking for some payback, and it turns out that despite some clear ethical concerns, The Baron's experiments had an upside: Zombie DNA is now inextricably intertwined with his own, enabling him to—wait for it—unleash the beast. (You're the beast in the title, see, it's a clever and unexpected twist.) What exactly your beast mode brings to the table hasn't been specified but I would assume it involves feats of great strength, durability, and so forth: At one point in the trailer, for instance, we see Kyle catch what appears to be a large boulder-club that's being swung at his face, after which he uses it himself to turn several nearby zombies into goo. He also seems unexpectedly eager to fistfight a zombie that looks like four Lou Ferrignos stuffed into a sausage casing—not the sort of guy one would typically want to throw hands with. The Beast was originallyenvisioned as DLC for Dying Light 2, but Techland eventually decided that it had evolved too far beyond the base game to work within those limits and thus opted to turn it into a standalone game. That's mainly why it's taken so long to get here, but the good news for patient fans is that Dying Light: The Beast will be free for owners of the Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition: A Techland rep told PC Gamer the game will appear in their libraries automatically when The Beast launches on August 22.

Lies of P, an excellent little Sekiro-like, just got its first major DLC. No, really—Overture is available to purchase now, as announced duringSummer Game Fest 2025's lineup of trailers and previews. Round 8 and Neowiz's next expansion takes players to \"the city of Krat in its final days of haunting\", as per itsSteam page. Overture is a prequel to the main game, following Mr. P himself as he takes his twinkish, automaton frame through a setting overdue for a puppet massacre or two. The DLC contains a far more lively Krat—which already has me sold, being honest. While a good ruin is sort of the point of a soulslike game (they mostly tend to exist in some kind of post-or-pre apocalypse), the downright gorgeous streets of Lies of P were so enchanting I kinda wished I could've seen them before everything went to hell. Well, now I can: \"Venture into a past Krat,\" the Steam page continues, \"When its Belle Époque elegance faces impending ruin. Explore majestic, never-before-seen locations, from extravagant landmarks on its outskirts to opulent mansions and eerie, haunted ruins.\" As shown off in the trailer, Pinocchio will gain access to variety of new weapons, including what looks like a sawed-off gauntlet, a straight-up bow and arrow, some messed up wolverine claws, a straight-up Final Fantasy gunblade, and more. There'll naturally be a variety of beasties to fight, too. Lies of P had a bunch of stellar bosses, so I'm keen to see Neowiz continue on its proud tradition of kicking my sorry butt seven days from Wednesday. As mentioned, Lies of P: Overture is available—well, right now. So if you enjoyed the base game, you can settle back into the shoes of Pinocchio and take to the pre-apocalypse street of Krat immediately. You've got no release dates to hold you down.

Mina the Hollower speaks to me much louder than Shovel Knight ever did. Yacht Club Games' newest retro action game is basically Zelda with a mouse, and it's exactly the type of game a younger me would've played on my Game Boy Advance until the batteries died. Yacht Club GamesKickstartedMina the Hollower in 2022, raising over $1.2M, and today it's dropping a demo you can play onSteambefore it fully releases on October 31. From moment one, Mina the Hollower screams 2001 with a gloomy 8-bit kingdom sliding onto the screen and our mouse heroine poised to cleanse it of beasts in its intro. There's a little Castlevania in here and some Bloodborne too—which I'll get to in a second. Not much else is explained before you start a new save and wake up on a ship under attack by a leviathan. I picked up two daggers and started slashing my way through monsters, hopping over obstacles and finding secret rooms on my way deeper into the cursed island it takes place on. There are throwing axes and other projectiles you can pick up that help take care of flying creatures, and Mina can burrow underground to avoid attacks. Burrowing can also get you past gates and underneath boulders to toss at stronger enemies, and a boss later in the demo hits so hard that burrowing becomes the best tactic to avoid getting your entire health bar shaved off. Mina's health can be replenished by chugging a healing vial. Hear that? TheFromSoftwarealarms are going off. That mechanic works just like Bloodborne, where vials are a quick fix but you can also earn HP back by retaliating after taking damage. Mina the Hollower is also pretty tough like Bloodborne: Monsters dart around quickly and Mina doesn't have a dodge roll or anything to avoid them. There are checkpoints, at least, that let you spend the bones you collect from monsters and turn them into upgrades for your defense and damage. The environments are dense with hidden passageways and ropes that lead to upper levels. In the 30 minutes I spent with the demo, I was stumbling into secrets all over the place. There's a list of tips in the menus and it mentions that after taking damage you can use your brief invulnerability to pass through harmful barriers, which tells me there will be lots of tricky spots to squeeze into in the final game. And that is exactly the type of game I would play on my purple GBA as a kid. If it wasn't Pokémon, I was running around swiping at grass in A Link to the Past for rupees. Each level in Mina the Hollower is packed with so many things to break and climb and burrow under that I was spending more time poking at everything than actually making forward progress. It's just fun to see what's possible and where things lead, and the game doesn't hesitate to reward you for doing so.The Mina the Hollower demo rules and is playable right now onSteam.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Battleworld, in the original Secret Wars comic books, was a patchwork planet that had been smushed together by a cosmic entity called The Beyonder. As it was built from chunks of other planets, wandering every couple miles was like entering a completely new biome. (It even contained a chunk of downtown Denver.) In MMO shooter The Cube, which was announced today at Summer Game Fest, the titular Cube you fight across reminds me a bit of Battleworld—except it's like a giant Rubik's Cube, so its edges and rows rotate, creating new combinations of environments at every turn. Also, The Cube is a new game from Mundfish, makers of Atomic Heart (Atomic Heart 2 wasalsoannounced during the show) so the reveal trailer is completely unhinged—a non-stop barrage of different sci-fi aesthetics crammed into every frame: leggy gold-plated androids, ogres wearing scuba masks, bird-face ruffians with baseball bats, snipers in space helmets, assassins in miniskirts... just as you'd expect from a multiplayer shooter taking place in the Atomic Heart universe. \"The CUBE is a multiplayer RPG-shooter that blends unique world-building, an intriguing narrative, and exciting quests into one game. A living world full of memorable characters, diverse biomes, and tons of enemies, including powerful bosses, awaits you,\" the game'sSteam page reads. In The Cube, players undertake expeditions to the bizarre anomaly (alone or as part of a cooperative, the Steam page says) to investigate the structure (shoot and stab and smash everything on it) and collect \"punch cards\" that can be used to \"create or upgrade\" equipment for their next run. \"Every voyage to the Cube is not just a misson but a step into the unknown,\" says Mundfish.

All I know about the Onimusha series is that they were beloved action games from a time when I was too young and dumb to play them. After watching thenew trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, just premiered at Summer Game Fest, I now know I have some catching up to do. The new trailer, titled \"Formidable Foes Emerge,\" gives us our best look yet at Way of the Sword's swordplay. I wouldn't dare say Capcom's making its own Sekiro just because katanas are present, but I do detect an amazing physicality with its sword clashes that I associate with the best action RPGs around. It's an impressive showcase at a time when Capcom is on top of the world, what with Monster Hunter: Wilds instantly becoming a bestseller and the company posting itseighth consecutive year of profitsat a time when every publisher is tightening its purse strings. It sounds like there's more coming from Capcom on Onimusha before the Summer Game Fest weekend is through. \"Stay tuned as new information continues to be revealed, including more details on new characters such as Sasaki Ganryu, who wields an Oni Gauntlet, as well as scenes showcasing the nail-biting gameplay,\" reads the trailer's description on YouTube.

    "title": "Chronicles: Medieval is a stunning sandbox RPG coming in 2026—despite a past commitment to using generative AI, the studio now says the game is '100% handcrafted'",
    "article_text": "A new Danish studio, Raw Power Games, is behind the medieval sandbox RPG shown early in this year's Summer Game Fest stream. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I noticed earlier this week that there was a studio I hadn't heard of among theSummer Game Festpartners, Raw Power Games, which said it was building a \"vast medieval sandbox.\" Sure enough, we got a glimpse of that game, called Chronicles: Medieval, at Geoff Keighley's showcase today. With the caveat that trailers don't always reflect the final product, it sure looks pretty. I especially like the colorful scene of what is apparently gameplay at the end—some contrast to the standard dark ages gloom and muck that comes before it. When I looked into Raw Power earlier this week, Idiscovered a 2022 interview with two studio headsin which they showed off AI-generated concept art and discussed how excited they were about using the technology to make games. Apparently, that attitude has since changed. Every asset in the game is built by our extremely talented team of passionate developers. It is not generated by AI. In a statement shared with PC Gamer this morning, Raw Power CTO Caspar Strandbygaard said that Chronicles: Medieval is \"100% handcrafted with no use of generative AI.\" \"To elaborate: We are curious about new technology and keeping up with the latest tools,\" said the Strandbygaard. \"That said, our upcoming medieval debut title is all about handcrafted experiences. Every asset in the game is built by our extremely talented team of passionate developers. It is not generated by AI.\" Raw Power's AI tools division is working on AI tools (naturally), but not on AI tools for Chronicles: Medieval, according to Strandbygaard, though he did say that the development team employs AI in less controversial ways. \"As a techsavvy workplace, we too embrace AI-tools where it helps make our work smoother,\" said Strandbygaard. \"Like testing or optimizing performance. But when it comes to creating the world you'll dive into as a gamer, that's 100% human creativity.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That's very different from what Strandbygaardsaid in 2022, when he stated that the studio's 10-year-goal was to become so reliant on AI that its job would become \"almost to make tools that will generate the game—rather than to make the game ourselves.\" Perhaps the plan changed; the gaming public's perception of generative AI has certainly soured since 2022, although it was already controversial at the time. Chronicles: Medieval is due to release in early access onSteamin 2026. Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs. He was later captivated by Myst, SimCity, Civilization, Command & Conquer, all the shooters they call \"boomer shooters\" now, and PS1 classic Bushido Blade (that's right: he had Bleem!).

    "title": "Go to war for Westeros in a new Game of Thrones RTS coming in 2026",
    "article_text": "Fight for the Iron Throne at the head of one of the Great Houses, or the armies of the Night King. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I never watched the Game of Thrones series on HBO because, frankly, I get my fill of political awfulness from the real world in which I live. But even without being immersed in the scene, I was surprised how quickly everyone stopped talking about it: It was like the last season rolled and everyone immediately decided to pretend the whole thing had never happened. There's something of a comeback happening on the videogame front, though. The action RPGGame of Thrones: Kingsroadlaunched on Steam in March, and tonight at the Summer Game Fest we got our first look at Game of Thrones: War for Westeros, a new RTS being developed by PlaySide Studios. As you might expect from the title and the fact that it's an RTS, players will take command of the armies of House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen, or the Night King, and go to war for control of the Iron Throne in either a singleplayer campaign or \"free-for-all multiplayer.\" From the press blast: Engaging in epic real-time strategy battles, forging strategic alliances, and weaving deceit against rival forces will be key. Each faction offers deeply asymmetric strategies, with signature heroes, armies, and mechanics forged from the brutal legacy of Westeros. Players can deploy infantry, cavalry, siege engines, giants, and dragons to break enemy lines as they work to outplay and outmaneuver rivals with inspiring hero abilities and the ruthless instincts of a true war commander. And a handful of screens: It'll be very interesting to see how War for Westeros fares when it arrives. It may be a very good RTS and you can never have too many of those, but I wonder how much the Game of Thrones license really brings to the table, and whether it will attract many gamers who wouldn't otherwise be interested in a \"classic\" fantasy RTS in the first place. Do we really still care that much about Jon Snow and the gang? Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We'll find out next year: Game of Thrones: War for Westeros is currently slated to launch sometime in 2026 and available to wishlist now onSteam.

    "article_text": "A new challenger approaches. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At today's Summer Game Fest showcase, Sega showed anew trailer for Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, its latest kart racer starring hedgehogs and their various friends who, despite being extremely fast as their whole deal, still apparently need cars sometimes. The trailer, which you can watch embedded above, isn't just the latest look at Crossworlds gameplay: It's Sega throwing down a gauntlet. Sure, the Sonic-starring racer might be releasing in the same year as Mario Kart hits Switch 2, but this time the hedgehog's brought backup. And yes, that is Hatsune Miku behind the wheel. Sega is essentially positioning Sonic Racing as the Smash Bros. of kart racers. While Sonic and friends raced through gravity-defying crossing cityscapes and waterways, they were soon joined by Joker from Persona 5, Like a Dragon successor protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, and—hold your applause—global vocaloid sensation Hatsune Miku. Unlike other kart racing games, this game will have online cross-platform matchmaking. Following the trailer, Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley welcomed Takashi Iizuka, head of Sonic Team, to the stage, and he wasted no time in doubling down on the kart racing beef. \"Unlike other kart racing games,\" Iizuka said, this game will have online cross-platform matchmaking.\" I'm sure I don't need to tell you that the crowd enjoyed the jab. But Iizuka had more. Giving one last glimpse at Crossworlds, he played a second teaser showing that one more guest racer is coming to Sonic Racing: Steve from Minecraft.

    "title": "Square Enix just revealed a 'murder mystery action game' and as far as I can tell it's like Among Us in a spooky mansion full of hot people",
    "article_text": "You put enough pretty people in the same space, and this kind of thing is bound to happen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At today's Summer Game Fest, Square Enix joined the celebration of Geoff Keighley's birthday [Editor's note: It's not his birthday] by revealing Killer Inn, a \"murder mystery action game\" of social deduction in the vein of Mafia, Town of Salem, and Among Us. Except, like, with a couple of e-girls in there. The \"asymmetrical team battle steeped in blood and suspicion\" takes place in a secret castle that exists on no map, is detectable by no satellite, and can apparently only be visited by people who've been selected from around the world for a 24-person murder mystery party with real, actual deaths. Based on the trailer, being conventionally attractive seems to help your odds of getting picked. Murder's more compelling when it's hot people, I guess. There's also a literal pirate in the mix, so. There's that. In a match of Killer Inn, players are divided into two teams: The Lambs, whose goal is to survive the night, and the Wolves—murderers secretly sown amongst the survivors who are tasked with picking the Lambs off one by one. To survive, Lambs will either have to escape the castle, or eliminate their predators using a spooky mansion's worth of embellished knives, axes, and fancy sawn-off shotguns. Whichever side wins earns prize money, and the prize increases with every contestant killed. The complication, of course, is that the Lambs don't know who the Wolves are. Worse, it's forbidden for Lambs to kill each other. If you're a Lamb and you harm a fellow survivor, you'll be turned to stone and eliminated. It's not a complete guessing game for Lambs, however. Whenever a Wolf kills a player, they'll leave behind a clue—hair, fingerprints, and the like—that helps Lambs narrow down their identity. Also, Lambs are all apparently Batman, capable of using detective vision to see the killer's footprints, bullet casings, and more. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Throughout a match, you can complete quests, gain gold, and purchase or open chests for weapons and armor to use against your competitors. Lambs can also just, you know, try to leave—but escaping a mansion isn't easy when someone's throwing knives at you. Killer Inn looks like a vaguely absurd idea taken to elaborate extremes, which earns it an easy spot on my wishlist.

    "article_text": "The showdown between two big extraction shooters is set for Fall. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a short time,Arc Raidershas gone from under the radar, to on my radar, to darn near the top of my most anticipated games of 2025. That's all thanks to its recent tech test, which was so dang fun that itmade the (coincidentally timed) Marathon alpha look bad. We have two games fighting for the crown of freshest extraction shooter on the block, and now that Embark has announced Arc Raiders' release date during the Summer Game Fest showcase, the match-up is even more interesting. Arc Raiders will release onOctober 30on Steam, Epic, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. That's just over a month after Marathon's September 23 release date. Teases embedded in Arc Raiders' last tech test and recent updates to the game's backend on consoles had fans believing that Arc Raiders was going to surprise release at Summer Game Fest, the same way Embark's other game The Finals did back in 2023, but it wasn't meant to be after all. Embark says it's still got some work to do before the big day. \"The tech test was the best rehearsal we could get, ahead of what's shaping up as a big release this Fall. It’s clear that players recognize the passion, effort, and craftsmanship that’s been poured into the making of ARC Raiders,” said executive producer Aleksander Grøndal in a press release. \"The test also honed in on concrete things we’re addressing in this last stretch of development. There are bugs to squash, as well as general polish and performance improvements to be done. We're also fine-tuning game balance and the player economy, and will work on an even better onboarding experience for players who come in new to this genre. At release, the game will be further expanded, with more locations to explore, more adventures to embark on, and more for players to strive towards and discover.\" Enjoyers of the tech test will like the sound of that, considering a common impression of Arc Raiders is that it already feels more complete than what Bungie has shown of Marathon. The week-long playtest kept me and my friends busy as we explored the three available maps, checked off quests, unlocked crafting stations, and dumped skill points into a permanent tree. So Arc Raiders is an October game, but Embark still isn't talking about price. We know that Arc Raiders won't be free-to-play (just like Marathon), and we know that it won't have a \"premium\" price tag like $70 or $80. Based on what I played, I think folks would be happy if it lands in the Helldivers 2 range of $30-$40.

Put another feather in Troy Baker's already finely plumed cap: The famed voice actor is taking the lead role of Jack Pepper in the upcomingMickey's got a heaterFPS Mouse: PI for Hire, set to release later this year. Baker has 435 credits across 254 games, according toMobygames, which is kind of ridiculous, and that doesn't take into account his comparably numerous appearances intelevisions shows and movies. The dude's a worker, and he's pretty good at what he does: He recently earned plaudits from none other thanHarrison Fordfor his portrayal of Indy in MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and made an appearance in HBO's live action take on The Last of Us—appropriate, since one of his best-known roles is Joel in The Last of Us videogames. And now he's going to be a rat with a gat. \"I have been following the development of Mouse: PI For Hire since it was first teased,\" Baker said. \"Its art style, gameplay and 1930s film noir aesthetic continue to win me over. I cannot wait to keep working with the team to bring Jack Pepper to life and hope to have some exciting things to share as we get closer to launch!\" Mouse has come a long way since wefirst saw it in 2023. Early gameplay clips looked like a mashup of '30s Disney animation and Raymond Chandler: A black-and-white cartoon rodent with a tommy gun raising hell in a hard-edged city filled with anthropomorphic (and distinctly criminal) animals. That was enough toget me interested, and I probably would've been satisfied with a few hours of simplistic Kingpin-style blasting, but developer Fumi Games made it clear in a 2024 interview that they havegreater ambitions. Mouse: PI for Hire will incorporate numerous metroidvania elements amidst its FPS action, including \"NPC interactions with their own questlines … some minigames, some detective elements, and pretty adult, deep, gripping, dark storylines.\" Those ambitions extend to the narrative side of the game too: \"We are not avoiding serious topics like political extremities, racial segregation, poverty, social inequality—in a way, Mouse is the dark, twisted reflection of 1950s America.\" Given all that, it does seem more like a Troy Baker joint than it appeared a couple years ago.

    "article_text": "So stupid, so edgy, so sold. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a big souls guy—and I generally make an effort to play a variety of soulslike spinoffs, especially since they've gotten pretty good, lately. Lies of P, Lords of the Fallen, Remnant 2, Nine Sols—we've had some rather solid offerings. Alas, I never got a chance to try out Mortal Shell. Luckily, there's a kickass sequel coming around the corner that's grabbed my heart by the nuts and glory killed it with a big, unrealistically-sized steel boot. Announced today at theSummer Game Fest 2025, Mortal Shell 2 looks like it wandered straight out of a heavy metal album cover from the early 2000s, and the announcement trailer is—and I mean this as a compliment of the highest caliber—absolutely and joyously juvenile. We're talking shotguns, we're talkin' dramatic, bloody finishers, we're talkin' boss designs that look like they could've wandered straight out of Resident Evil: Village. This thing looks like what you'd get if you gave Doom Guy a claymore and told him to go ham—and I cannot help but be on board. While the irreverent nonsense of the trailer has me hooked, I'm actually curious about the mechanics, too. TheSteam pagedescribes a mix-and-match class-based system: \"Once discovered, each Shell can be awakened and possessed, unlocking their innate strengths and unique abilities. Evolve your own style of combat by harnessing the diverse unique abilities of each Shell, and unravel their secrets through the discovery of lost memories.\" The action-heavy trailer is more than just a vibe, though. The Steam pagealsopromises a combat system \"unrestricted by stamina\"—which might put Mortal Shell 2 in the same category as Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and the upcomingPhantom Blade Zero. More Ninja Gaiden thanElden Ring—a genre I'm secretly very happy to see grow and flourish. I can only imagine that stance-breaking a difficult boss and putting a .357 through their smug face will be incredibly gratifying.

In Chapter 4 ofDeltarune, I'm playing as a pixelated character named Kris when I encounter a hallway with a locked door, a step stool, and a bright green book on a shelf.ObviouslyI need to move the step stool so that Kris, or another party member, can reach the book and hit the switch mechanism I think is hidden behind it. But when I go to move the stool, there's no button prompt. I cannot do anything no matter how many times I press A. So I move on. Instead the problem resolves itself later, when Ralsei, one of Deltarune's three main characters, bends over (imagine a lil pixelated anthropomorphized goat guy on his hands and knees) and offers his body as a step stool. My third party member, a very punk and aggressive purple dinosaur named Suzie, uses Ralsei as a step and jumps up to hit the switch. In the end Ralsei and Suzie end up pancaked on the ground, but they manage to open the door. For the longest time, videogame logic, a sense of orienting myself honed through decades of experience, has helped me understand how to play games. I see something sparkly, I interact with it. I see an item, I want to try and pick it up. Blocks are made to be moved and fights resolved with careful strategy. But if there is anything that is clear from the recent release of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of Deltaruneon Steamthis week, it's that this game wants to poke fun at—and defy—every rule of RPG logic. Classic RPGs, and turn-based RPGs especially, rely on consistency and rules. Battles need to be logical so the game feels fair. If I'm playing Pokémon, it could feel disorienting or plain bad if an attack was strong one turn and weak the next. But somehow Toby Fox, the creator ofthe subversive and very funny Undertaleand new \"parallel story\" Deltarune, has found a way to challenge this idea. Instead, he and his Deltarune collaborators have created an experience that centers the emotions of its characters, even in the toughest of fights. Like Undertale, Deltarune combines turn-based battle mechanics with bullet hell-like minigames. You take an action that has some sort of emotional effect on the enemy, and then you guide a tiny pixelated heart through a maelstrom of attacks to avoid damage. The game challenges you to be creative and find pacifist ways to resolve a fight. The options your character has to \"ACT\" depend on the enemy and context of the game. (I once resolved a fight by using an old, curmudgeonly turtle to shout at the enemies like young rascals.) While you can memorize tactics for some fights, there's an erraticism to each and every encounter. Your enemies and allies will talk, chat, cry, scream, and laugh depending on the action you take or the general outcome of events. In one fight an enemy literally edits the UI for the entire battle screen and turns the fight into a roulette-like game using the menus. In another, a character's fury is so intense that it prompts a dizzying fight that contains five different complete minigames within it. One minute the characters are dodging attacks, the next the three are live on-stage playing a rhythm game. A lot of the humor of Deltarune comes from playing on expectations and conventions of the RPG genre. At one point, I interacted with a water cooler expecting to get a heal or item, but instead the water cooler fought me and put up a tough fight. During Chapter 3, the three heroes get roped into a live TV game show because a character with a CRT TV as a head is mourning the loss of group family movie and gaming time. The show host, Mr. Ant Tenna forces the party to sit down and play a game seemingly inspired by the original The Legend of Zelda. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. At one point while playing this game-inside-a-game, Suzie runs up to the console rendered in pixels and swaps her controller with Kris'. The moment feels goofy, because suddenly I was playing as Kris playing as a tiny Suzie in this weird Zelda-like game in Deltarune. But as with many of Fox's jokes, there was a point behind it— the scene pushed back against a typical RPG mentality, that Kris is some sort of empty vessel of a character for me to puppeteer. At the beginning of Deltarune, the game gave me the option to design a hero and name them. However, after entering my preferred characteristics, an omniscient narrator chided me for thinking I could just go and make my own character. After that I met Kris. As I controlled Kris controlling a video game version of Suzie, it reminded me that I, the person playing Deltarune, am not Kris. Kris is not a blank canvas that I can just name and project myself onto, like I would in other games. If you played Undertale, some of Deltarune's gimmicks might feel a bit repetitive—characters can only hijack the conversation so many times before I'm no longer charmed or surprised by it. But Deltarune keeps you on your toes. You never know when a fight might turn into a different game, or a water cooler will become a giant monster of death. Fox has more chapters of Deltarune planned, but the first four are already a phenomenal expression of his signature idiosyncratic style and a must-play for RPG-heads.

    "article_text": "First, dodge … then inadequate feelings ahead. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dear reader, I've started to be able to set my watch by the amount of time between the release of a newFromSoftwaregame and the eventuality, sure as the heat death of the universe, of a YouTuber swaggering along and making me feel very bad for the amount of times I've seen the 'You Died' text. Or, in the case ofElden Ring Nightreign, 'Defeat'. Parry masterOngbal, who hasmade us look like chumpsin Sekiro before, is back at it again. After strutting up andsolo-ing a Nightlordasthe Executorlast week, Ongbal has now officially defeated the game's penultimate big bad without taking a single lick of damage. Not so much as a bruise. Flawless, incredible, aspirational victory. You might notice Ongbal's health ticking down a little—don't worry, that's just because they're using the Executor's passive that gives them extra damage in exchange for a little self-inflicted hurt while in their Cursed Sword stance. The rest is all pure, perfectly-timed parry goodness. Heolstor the Nightlord gets repeatedly rebuffed like an absolute chump. My favourite part of the run, by far, is the particularly inventive use of the Executor's ultimate. This is a fact I've only just recently discovered, but it turns out the transformation itself has iframes—meaning Ongbal is able to dodge a powerful AoE by going dogmode, then immediately using the form's weapon art to get back to parrying. In the video description, they echo what PCG's own Ted Litchfield has said before—Nightreign is a game composed of thelongest boss runbacksin FromSoftware history. \"The runback to the boss is so brutal. I really wish there was a practice mode or something.\" Me too, bud, me too. They also beat one of the game's other bastards,Fulghor, who is currently the last on my hitlist in my own game before I go and tackle Heolstor myself. Hitless, of course, because I need new and exciting reasons to feel bad about my own game. In all seriousness, this has me sorely tempted to put together a parry-focused build and tackle some of these challenges myself. I've recently been all-in on astatus build Executor, but I've got enough relics to give this tanky, parry-based cousin a try.

    "article_text": "The beloved composer, who created the music for every Larian game up to Divinity: Original Sin, died unexpectedly in 2015. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since Divinity composer Kirill Pokrovskydied unexpectedly at the age of 53. I still remember being shocked by the news: Pokrovsky was one of my favorite videogame composers, and he was a high-profile presence at Larian Studios, having created the music for every game the studio ever made up to Divinity: Original Sin—including The LED Wars, the one only true die-hards have ever heard of. Maybe my faith in humanity is lower than it should be, but I found it genuinely heartening to see today that despite how far Larian has come over the past 10 years—from running Kickstarters to keep the lights on in Ghent to seven offices worldwide and telling Hasbro to take its money truck somewhere else—Pokrovsky is not forgotten. \"How has it been 10 years since we lost you, Kirill?\" Larian wrote in aheartfelt message. \"A mark left so deep, you’re still with us when the moments count, when we head into battle, and when the end credits roll. Forever cherished for who you were and what you helped achieve ❤.\" Larian also linked to a recently created playlist on YouTube, \"Remembering Kirill Pokrovsky,\" made up of clips of Pokrovsky's live concert in support of the Divinity: Original Sin Kickstarter, and just some general horsing around.

    "title": "James Bond doesn't need an origin story: IO's game looks great, but why has it turned 007 into a baby-faced Nathan Drake?",
    "article_text": "On Her Majesty's Smuggest Service. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. This week: I went back to Heroes of the Storm for the 10th anniversary, and played so badly one of my teammates called me an NPC. Then IO dropped the 007 First Light trailer and all I could think was \"the name's Bland. James Bland.\" I couldn't quite believe this when I looked it up, but IO first announced it was working on a James Bond game (\"Project 007\")waaaay back in 2020. There was no hard info or even a name for the longest time, but this seemed such a perfect match of developer and subject matter that it seemed this could only be a good thing. Fully five years later, we got our first proper look at007 First Lightduring Sony's State of Play and… erm,this Bond looks about 18 years old. With aserious case of Dreamworks face. OK maybe not that bad, but if you stuck Nathan Drake, Tom Holland and a young Tom Cruise in a blender, I'm pretty sure something like this guy is what would pop out. IO has been upfront about the fact this first game is an origin story, and that was the first thing that set my own alarm bells ringing. While accepting that there have been some great examples, I hate the modern trend towards origin stories, and think in a lot of cases they actually weaken the characters concerned. I'm not sure I ever want to know James Bond's origins in any kind of detail, and it's something that the films have either wisely steered clear of or handled in fragments. Casino Royale, Daniel Craig's debut as the character, told the story of his first truly high-stakes mission: but the character was clearly already James Bond, not learning to be James Bond. The third Craig film, Skyfall, used Bond's childhood home in the Scottish highlands for the climactic set-piece and hinted at elements of his past: but it was another layer to a character that was by this point well-established. Casino Royale was also Ian Fleming's first Bond book, and James Bond here is already a 00 agent in his mid-thirties. Fleming's books are excellent reads, for the most part, and throughout them Bond remains somewhat in amber: barely aging, the same character going through wildly different experiences. Fleming does briefly touch on Bond's past (or origins if you prefer) before life in the secret service but, whether by accident or design, some of these explanations slightly contradict each other: at first he's an English gentleman, but in the later books Fleming establishes a more pronounced Scottish connection. Point being that in both the original books and the movies, we are always dealing with a fully formed James Bond: he might be a bit younger or older and we might get these hints as to his past before M15, some heavier than others, but Bond's past is probably the least interesting thing about him. Before I launch into everything I hate about 007 First Light's take on the character, a necessary caveat is that this is almost definitely going to be an excellent videogame. IO's World of Assassination is a spectacular example of what the studio can produce with Bond staples like gadgets and action-stealthing around goons, and I have no doubt that First Light is going to package all this systemic goodness up in a slightly more cinematic form. Whatever I think about this Bond, he's probably going to be the star of the second-best Bond game ever made. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But god, he's a smug little bastard isn't he? Doesn't the header image at the top of the article just make you want to punch him? Granted Bond is a bit smug. Pierce Brosnan was smug, Roger Moore is the king of smug, and even the harder-edged Bonds like Craig have their moments. But this Bond already looks insufferable, and we've barely heard a dozen lines out of him. Of those lines, I thought there was one good joke in the entire trailer: when Bond and the MI5 guy Greenway are dangling above some crocodiles and Bond says to him \"I suppose this is another… teachable moment?\" Otherwise this Bond is just smugging around with that awful little crooked grin on his face, looking like a rejected Naughty Dog character sheet rather than Britain's finest. And maybe that's what I'm recoiling at so much here: Bond is one of the most famous and distinctive characters in the world. The choice of each actor for the films is such a big deal because the nature of that actor dictates the tone of the films themselves: now isn't the time for Bond 101, but suffice to say Brosnan and Craig's Bonds exist in very different worlds. This guy looks like he could be the lead in any Sony firstparty game, and you wouldn't think for a moment it was James Bond. That's my instinctive reaction and I could well be proven wrong: but for all his smugness, does this guy have even a hint of Brosnan's swagger, of Craig's menace? Of either actor'spresence? But I knew I wasn't going to like this take on the character from the first seconds of the trailer. It begins with M grimly intoning: \"His parents cut their own rope to save him. He watched them fall then found his way off that mountain… he was 11 years old.\" What the fuck is this, Harry Potter?!? James Bond doesn't need parents, he doesn't need the cliche motivation of dead parents, and we definitely absolutely do not need to know anything about what happened in his life when he was 11 years old. Take this one to the bank: in the third game we'll find out Blofeld was behind the climbing accident all along! Other massive red flags are the rogue 00 agent, in this case 009, which the movies have by this point done to death, and you're not going to top GoldenEye. But ech… I could list my issues with shot after shot in this trailer, not to mention the fact it looks like we'll be racking up a bodycount in the quadruple digits, but I am conscious of not going too far with what is merely the first trailer for a game that, again, I am sure will be a very good videogame. But for the first truly large-scale Bond videogame in forever, this felt way too influenced by the popularity of things like Uncharted rather than the solid gold source material IO has to work with. Bond is a magical character because he's chameleonic, always somehow the same but different. The Bond films guarantee a scale and spectacle few other action films can match, and occasionally even manage a decent story. This Bond? This Bond looks like he walked straight out of Beverley Hills 90210, like he could be the lead in dozens of other games, and like a little boy in search of a dinner jacket. I know I'm going to end up with egg on my face when this game turns out excellent. But let's just say I, for one, will be waiting for the Pierce Brosnan mods to drop.

    "title": "The Borderlands cup overfloweth with a huge sale—1-3, The Pre-Sequel, all their DLCs, and one very good Telltale game are available for $36",
    "article_text": "Tiny Tina's Wonderlands isn't on the list, but other than that? It's all here. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Borderlands series is having a massive stonking sale, and regardless of your opinions on some of Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford's recent—er,let's just call them 'online moments'—the sale is downright generous. For starters,Borderlands 2 was made straight-up free yesterday. If you are at all a fan of shooters, looters, or either genre, you have legitimately zero reason not to snap this up before the offer expires June 8. But the currentBorderlands franchise saleis also worth a peek. The headlining deal is thePandora's Box bundle. Originally released back in 2023, this thing's already a good deal at a baseline, but with 45% off, the value is kinda absurd. It includes all three Borderlands games, the Pre-Sequel, the very good Tales from the Borderlands and the, uh, less-than-good New Tales From the Borderlands. The icing on the cake is that you also get every single DLC released for all of them—classes, expansions, storylines, you name it. All for around $36/£28. Borderlands 3 is actually a pretty stand-out option, here. While I found the game's base storyline downright unbearable, every one of its DLCs fare far better, ranging from acceptable to 'honestly pretty good'. Besides, the gameplay across all titles is remarkably consistent. Gearbox figured out the looter shooter formula proper with Borderlands 2, and has only added some thin layers of mechanical switch-ups since. Clunky dialogue aside, I have basically never played one of these games andnothad an acceptable time. The bundle's also worth it for Tales From the Borderlands, which is some ripe fruit from the Telltale golden age. Enough to make me wish Borderlands 3 had actually done a decent job with its story.New Tales From the Borderlandsis, uh, less good, but Telltale didn't make it, and given the value you're getting elsewhere, you can comfortably leave it uninstalled. Or give it a bash, I'm not your dad. Mind, if you just want to dip your toe in, you can also snap up baseline Borderlands 3 for $3/£2.50—or Borderlands 2 and all its DLC in the Handsome Collection for $14.50/£11. Solid deals both, with both full-length games being priced like bitesized, experimental indies. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered’s improvements have Oblivion’s meme king hopeful Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas will see similar glow-ups: ‘[It’s] so much better and exactly what I have wanted for years’",
    "article_text": "Oblivion fans are feasting, but there’s room for more. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Oblivion’s renowned meme king, the YouTuber Bacon_, has recently regaled us with tales of rescuingEmperor Uriel Septim, secret agent-style, and why the original’s chaoticRadiant AI systemremains the gold standard for Bethesda NPCs. Bacon unsurprisingly has a lot of love for the recent remaster and believes that it makes “lots of good changes while also remaining faithful to the original”. Bacon is enjoying the addition of new voices, the upscaled visuals, and the ability to sprint—so he doesn’t have to get the zoomies (or 'skoomies') by duping “a lot of Skooma and [binding] it to a hotkey to run around.” Either way, he’s stillchugging the stuff. However, it’s the streamlined levelling system that takes the gold medal —which no longer has you at the mercy of level scaling if you didn’t focus on ‘efficiently’ levelling and allows for greater build diversity. “[It’s] so much better and exactly what I have wanted for years,\" says Bacon. \"They said it was a mix of Oblivion and Skyrim but I would say it's like a mix of Fallout 3 and Oblivion, [because] you get a set amount of points that you get to distribute over different attributes. “I always liked Oblivion's Attributes over Skyrim's Health, Stamina and Magic because I like stats and numbers in my RPGs but I really hated the way Oblivion went about doing it. So that was a massive improvement. I really hope that we'll see Fallout 3 get the same treatment and New Vegas.” When it comes to ‘remastering’ his own content, it hasn’t been smooth sailing for Bacon with Oblivion Remastered presenting roadblocks in certain scenarios. This includes theDive Rockskit, which sees the Adoring Fan quite literally go over the edge after being dismissed back to the Arena. “[This] isn't possible anymore because they have improved the pathfinding so he doesn't see running off the cliff as the fastest path back to the Arena.” Well, that’s a real shame if you ask me. Bacon also tried to remake the immensely popularFarewellvideo, featuring battlemage Fithragaer’s crushing demise, but—sadly—Fithragaer now emerges unscathed. “I think there is a bug causing those traps to not do any damage so Fithragaer survives (which also breaks the quest unless you kill him or know where to go next) and since the last half of the video happened entirely by chance I am not sure I'll be able to make it happen again on purpose.” When it comes to the janky comedy Elder Scrolls bounteously provides, not being able to revisit these specific moments may be disappointing, but there’s no denying that there will be plenty more Elder Scrolls hijinks to come. Bacon hasn’t previously used many mods as he prefers to “stick to vanilla” versions of games. However, he is excited for the upcomingSkyblivionmod and experiencing Oblivion “with Skyrim mechanics and AI behaviour. It honestly looks more like a brand new game than just a mod.” Between Oblivion Remastered and Skyblivion, fans of the classic game have quite the feast this year. “[These are] all great ways to experience this game and I am glad a lot of new people will get to experience one of my favourite games for the first time.” Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crewOblivion persuasion: Master the minigame Please logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name.

    "title": "'John Nightreign doesn't have a face': YouTuber manages to uncover all but one of Elden Ring Nightreign's hidden Nightfarer faces, 'leaving his appearance a mystery'",
    "article_text": "\"There is still something if we peel back their helmets.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The most mysterious part ofElden Ring Nightreignisn't itserrant matchmaking systemor howMorgott keeps tracking me down, it's actually much simpler than that: The identity of some of the Nightfarers. UnlikeElden Ringwith its character creator, Nightreign simply gives players the choice of eightNightfarers all with pre-built looks and skins. So it's fair to say that most players could go about their expeditions without ever knowing what some of these characters look like. That is until soulsborne YouTuberZullie the Witchuncovered the truth. Elden Ring Nightreign tips- Start your run rightNightreign tier list- The best nightfarersBest Nightreign rune farm route- Level up fastBest Nightreign team comps- Squad goalsNightreign best relics- The rite stuffNightreign bosses list- Every NightlordNightreign Remembrances- All character quests As Zullie the Witch explains ina YouTube video: \"Rather than customizable characters, Nightreign chose to focus on a handful of unique champions, trading flexibility for deeper specialization. While they don't use the character creation face data, there is still something if we peel back their helmets.\" Some of the character's faces are relatively easy to see. \"As a Witch of the Deep Woods, theReclusewears a traditional pointed hat, obscuring her face in the shadow of its wide brim. Between her skins, one does remove the hat entirely though, giving a clearer look at her features without its obstruction,\" Zullie the Witch says. Like the Recluse, theRaider'sface can also be seen below the dragonlike skull that he wears as a helm, and he also loses his headgear in one of his skins, revealing his whole face. Then there's theRevenantwhose face is clearly shown, although you can see this spirit's true identity when he uses her ult, peeling away part of her face to show the vengeful phantom beneath. \"For [the]Duchess, her face is largely visible already, obscured only by a blindfold crown reminiscent of Dark Souls 3's Firekeeper,\" Zullie the Witch continues. \"And removing the crown for each of them, both do have the rest of their face fully modelled beneath it, revealing their eyes.\" At a glance, you may think that theGuardianis just wearing a fancy helmet, but that's actually his head. This Nightfarer is of a new avian race, the Pinionfolk, who live among the clouds of the winged realm. But after seeing some player conspiracies, Zullie the Witch confirms that there's not a human face hidden behind the eagle. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then there are the characters who have more obscured visages. \"As a hooded assassin, normally only a thin stretch ofIroneye'sface can be seen, but the rest is modelled, at least from the front,\" Zullie the Witch says. \"Similar to Ironeye,Executor'sface is mostly concealed by his helmet, though glimpses can be seen through the visor's slits. Originally a Reedlander, he seemingly embraced the Crucible in the Lands Between, which may have tinged his copper eyes.\" The eye colour of most Nightfarers will change depending on which skin you're wearing. Light skins will have golden eyes and dark skins will have purple. But the Executor's copper-tinged eyes may have just given us the first clue as to what the Crucible Knights would look like. The only character that has no modelled face beneath their armour isWylder: \"In each skin, his armour obscures his features, and removing it just shows a black silhouette, leaving his appearance a mystery.\" A part of me is slightly frustrated that Wylder's face will remain hidden, and I'm not the only one, \"Of course, John Nightreign doesn't have a face\" one viewer says in thevideo's comments. But it doesn't make his character any less cool, and seeing as we've got answers for everyone else I'll try and not be too ungrateful.

    "article_text": "\"The challenges you shall face are set in stone.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It never ceases to amaze me just how many gems you can find on Roblox. Whether it'sRoblox's hottest game Dress to Impress, Project Lazurus which is actually better than most COD Zombies games, or now a remake ofDark Souls 3. \"Ro-Souls 3 is a mortal journey by perseverance and strength,\"the game description reads. \"There is no lowering the bar, nor raising it, the challenges you shall face are set in stone. You will fail, time and time again. It will be hard, but not unfair. A true soulslike game on Roblox; a sharp and precise recreation of the genre's mechanics, gameplay, story, combat, bosses, enemies, and replayability.\" No punches have been pulled. Roblox codes: Cross-game freebiesDress to Impress codes: Get fast fashionBlue Lock Rivals codes: Gear for the pitchBlox Fruits codes: Double XP and free statsFisch codes: Bring the best baitArise Crossover codes: Beat 'em up gear It may not be a shot-for-shot remake of Dark Souls 3, as the layout of the map along with a few enemies and items look different. But it's easy to see the inspiration, especially when you get to the first boss Iudex Gundyr. I've been playing a ton ofElden Ring Nightreign, so I thought that I was in pretty good nick to check out Ro-Souls 3, and I was kind of right. Rising from the mud in the Cemetery of Ash I was without armour or weapons, all I had was my innocently smiling default Roblox character and the knowledge of how to dodge roll. It was slightly chaotic at first, before I realised that there were no weapons nearby and I just had to beat all the enemies to death with my bare hands, but I soon got used to it. At one point I did find a sword, but I couldn't pick it up for whatever reason, and as I was being chased by 10 guys I decided to let it slide for now. Surely there'd be more weapons to pick up along the way. I was mistaken. I may have found a bonfire, but I found no other weapons on my ventures around the starting area, all I had to rely on was three estus flasks and my bloodied fists. In hindsight, I probably should've gone back for the sword but my hubris got the best of me. So I forged onward, beating up enemies and clearing my way to the first boss, Iudex Gundyr. Apart from the fact that I was naked and had no sword, it was just like old times. Gundyr poking me with his halberd, me rolling around and just staying as close to his back as I could, and then him getting angry at me for being so close and trying to slap me when he gets overcome with the Pus of Man. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Unfortunately, he was just too strong for me, and my punches did a pathetically small amount of damage. So Gundyr got the better of me this time, but the fight isn't over, I defeated him once and I will again, this time in Roblox. Aside from being simply a fun game to play, Ro-Souls 3 has now introduced soulslikes to over 1.6 million Roblox players. It was first added to the platform a few years back but got an update at the end of last month. I've also seen a few people turn to this game as a substitute for Nightreign, or just as a way to train for otherFromSoftwaregames. But I just want to indulge my morbid curiosity and see just how far I can get in Ro-Souls 3. I'd like to see Yhorm the Giant again.

    "article_text": "Three new adventures have been hinted towards, and I can see a lot of players getting excited. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a newDeveloper Update shared to the Disney Dreamlight Valley YouTube channel, a roadmap for the remainder of 2025 was shared. These usually hint towards which villagers we can expect to see in new game updates, and the three screenshots shared are definitely going to be big hitters. The first, coming not long after theMysteries of Skull Rock updateand arriving in \"late summer\" will introduce characters from Inside Out. Going off the image shared during the developer update, my best bet is we'll be getting Joy and Sadness. The tagline \"get in touch with your emotions\" doesn't give any clues as to what adventures we'll be sent on, nor does it give away who will accompany us, or whether or not we'll be able to invite these new characters to our valley straight away, but it's still exciting for fans desperate for more Pixar characters in the game. In autumn, we'll be able to \"return to an enchanting realm\" which heavily implies more characters from Beauty and the Beast. You're already able to invite Belle and the Beast to live in your valley, courtesy of the realm available in the Dream Castle. However, a well-placed candelabra and grandfather clock in the roadmap screenshot imply that this update could introduce Cogsworth and Lumiere. Finally, a character most players are bound to be ecstatic about, is coming in winter. We're shown a grand blue carriage, alongside the caption \"make your dreams come true\" which has confirmed Cinderella's arrival at long last. To coincide with the autumn release, a new Star Path will also be introduced. When the Inside Out launch rolls around, we'll still be in the \"Adventures in Neverland\" Star Path. But that still gives us plenty of time to make the most of its pirate and mermaid-themed content first. We don't know what sort of decor the autumn Star Path entails, but it'll coincide with the \"return to an enchanting realm\". I'm sure more details about each individual update will come out closer to the time—besides, I'm going to be busy making my way through Peter Pan's friendship quests after his arrival anyway.

Silksong may, after many long years, finally be releasing—or it may not be. A shadowdrop could be arriving tomorrow, or our eternal vigil may never end. It's either the final 24 hours, or time has no meaning anymore. One thing's for certain: SteamDB has some updates. In addition to the updatesreleased earlier this week, which included achievement data for multiple languages, Silksong has had support for Windows, Mac, and Linux added, visible viaSteamDB. At the time of writing, Silksong's minimum requirements don't list Mac or Linux as possible platforms,however,Steam does provide support for them, and developers canprep their store pagesto send out platform-specific packages. As always, the Silksong subreddit is being delightfully normal about the news. Inone thread, you can even see the ever-cynical doubters (we're well past the point of tribalistic factions) starting to crack. \"FUCK MY FLAIR SILKSONG TOMORROW,\" roarsone frantic switcher. \"I... CANT... DENY... IT... ANY... LONGER!\" writes another, with the tone of the Incredible Hulk swelling out of his shirt. On one hand, it is mighty suspicious that the games' Steam page would receive such a ferocious flurry of updates—seven in total, including this one—before Summer Game Fest. With a bevvy of announcements to come, the idea that Team Cherry's doing some preparatory updating before finally releasing the dang thing isn't entirely out of the question. On the other hand, a few SteamDB updates aren't substantial proof of anything if you aren't scrabbling for every scrap of hope you can. Almost no game sinceElden Ringhas had this muchfeverish hype built up behind itand, in a way, the cultish chanting is outstripping what Silksong is likely bound to be: A very good metroidvania. Which, given I've played several since Hollow Knight, is only saying so much. If Team Cherry does do thefunniest thing it canand shadowdrop Silksong in a manner of hours, it'll mark the end to all doubting and hoping, all coping and copium.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Comics publisher Dark Horse has announced that it will release a coffee table book showcasing the art and behind-the-scenes development stories ofVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The hardcover will retail for $54.99 when it releases November 18, and can be preordered on Amazon or Barnes and Noble right now. The 192-page book will feature \"a deep dive into the development, art, and artistry of the World of Darkness.\" That first one is what really intrigues me: I doubt a celebratory art book would dive too much into Hardsuit Labs' initial version of the game, but the book could prove a treasure trove of information on how final developer The Chinese Room went about rebooting development, what it kept, and how much it had to throw away. Bloodlines 2 was originally supposed to launch all the way back in 2019 before getting delayed, then indefinitely postponed, with its original dev, Hardsuit Labs, taken off the project by publisher and World of Darkness owner Paradox. Bloodlines 2 wouldn't come in from the cold until 2023, when we got a first look at its new direction under The Chinese Room, developer of Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs, and last year's well-received Still Wakes the Deep. I was a little touch and go for a second with The Chinese Room's very different direction and vibe from the 2004 original, but PCG online editor Fraser Brown has beensinging the praises of his first hands-on experience with the game. My cautious optimism is much less cautious these days. We've got a specific release date for the Bloodlines 2 art book, but right now the game itself is just scheduled for some time in October.

In the Mysteries of Skull Rock update, you'll work alongside the Forgotten to uncover the secrets of Dazzle Beach's interestingly shaped rock off the coast. You'll be able to befriend the Forgotten further than before, and even get to build them a permanent house in the valley where you can hang out rather than them just wandering around aimlessly. As you progress, you'll even be able to give them a name instead of constantly referring to them as \"The Forgotten.\" This ominous character is an integral part of unlocking the secrets of Skull Rock, as they can vaguely remember who lives there but need your help in jogging their memory. To no one's surprise, Skull Rock is where you'll meet Peter Pan. The road map from last year definitely gave away his arrival, but it's nice to have it confirmed nonetheless. While you work on your friendship quests with Peter, the Developer Update shared that you'll also be able to help him assemble a new crew of Lost Boys alongside his standard friendship challenges. A brand new Star Path has also been revealed, called Adventures in Neverland, offering a plethora of mermaid and pirate-inspired furniture and clothing items. You'll also be able to spend your Moonstones on a Max animal companion, which is what I will immediately be gunning for the second it releases. This companion also comes with the ability to dig up holes to save you from wasting your stamina. Friendship levels are also being introduced as part of this update, giving us more of an incentive to interact with our animal companions. Rather than just following us around the valley, you'll now be able to interact with your companions as you would a villager, and spending time with them increases your friendship level. Each milestone, you'll unlock rewards too, and much like the Forgotten, you'll also be able to give them a name as long as it hasn't been predetermined like Pua, Heihei, and Max. After the popularity of the Alice in Wonderland update, I can only imagine the Mysteries of Skill Rock update being received just as well. Especially with so many players speculating about what secrets the iconic landmark of Dazzle Beach holds. I, for one, can't wait to see what friendship quests Peter Pan plans to send me on, but I'm not looking forward to finding more space in my valley for a villager home. That's for sure.

    "title": "A new report indicates Intel's latest Battlemage GPUs are a total failure and AMD's gaming graphics market share fell to just 8% but overall graphics cards sales are up",
    "article_text": "The figures aren't quite recent enough to show the impact of AMD's latest GPUs... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD's share of the add-in graphics card market fell to a fairly pitiful 8% in the first quarter of 2025according to Jon Peddie Research (JPR), a specialist in tracking PC hardware sales. Meanwhile, JPR puts Intel's graphics market share at essentially zero, with Nvidia hoovering up the remaining 92%. Ouch. Before we all escalate the threat level to PC gaming to DEFCON 1 and panic, it should be noted that JPR's figures cover the period up to the end of March.AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XTwere only released on March 6. So, that's only three and a bit weeks of RDNA 4 sales in the figures. In other words, we'll have to wait for the Q2 numbers to get a full picture of how much impact AMD's new GPUs have had. Indeed, we'll arguably have to wait even longer than that, since it's theRX 9060 XT, which only went on sale yesterday, that's meant to be the real volume play for AMD and that won't have a substantial impact on market share figures until the Q3 data is out. Overall, GPU sales were up 8.5% in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024. JPR says that Q1 is usually flat or down compared to the previous quarter, but that, \"In Q1’25, AMD and Nvidia introduced new AIBs, which stimulated the market.\" If we'll have to wait a little longer to see how the RX 9070 and 9060 GPUs fare for AMD, the verdict onIntel's Arc B570 and B580 GPUsis surely in and it not good news, not good news at all. JPR reckons Intel's market share fell by 1.2% in the latest quarter, essentially putting it on 0% and not appearing in the data for Q1 2025. If there was already doubt over Intel's commitment to the add-in graphics card market, this apparent total failure of Intel's second-gen Battlemage generation of GPUs is extremely troubling. Battlemage GPUs went on sale at the end of 2024. So, in theory Q1 2025 was a full quarter for sales of Intel's latest graphics hardware. Obviously sales of the B570 and B580 haven't actually been zero. But if JPR is to be believed, the volumes are so small as to effectively push Intel out of its data. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If even half a percent of sales were going to Intel, JPR would no doubt have included that in its data. So, we're talking less than one in 200 GPUs sales being Intel cards, and quite possibly an order of magnitude or more worse than that. It really is a grim outlook for Intel graphics and putsrumours of more powerful Battlemage GPUs into context. With sales this low, is it remotely realistic to expect Intel to wheel out that purported Nvidia RTX 4070 / 5070 killer? It doesn't seem terribly plausible in the light of this latest data. Still, the numbers we're really looking forward to will be Q3 2025, when both of AMD's new RDNA 4 GPUs will have had at least a full quarter on sale. That data probably won't be out until the end of the year. So, check back in December and cross all your fingers and toes until then.

    "title": "Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG gaming monitor review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Two displays in one monitor is the promise and the dual-mode Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG mostly delivers and for relatively sensible money. Just note that the 1080p mode isn't truly like a native display. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Are the new generation of dual-mode monitors capable of both native 4K and a pixel-doubled 1080p alternative resolution actually worth it? It's certainly an intriguing idea. What with the ability to run much higher refresh rates in 1080p mode plus that crispy 4K native resolution, you're getting the best of both worlds. If that's the theory, one way to totally sidestep the question is to offer the dual-mode thing at little to no price premium. Then it's just a nice extra, not a feature that needs to be fully justified. Enter the newAsusROG Strix XG27UCG. For an Asus ROG branded 4K IPS gaming monitor, it's pretty attractively priced. In the US, it'scurrently available for around $450while in theUK it's just £349. That super-low UK pricing has me suspecting that the US price could fall pretty quickly. Whatever, with theAsus ROG Strix XG27UCGyou are certainly not paying a huge premium for the dual-mode feature. In this particular case, it's a 27-inch model with 160 Hz refresh in 4K mode and 320 Hz in 1080p mode. For context, theAlienware AW2725QF, another dual-mode 27 inch IPS monitor, is priced around $150 higher. Screen size:27-inchResolution:3,840 x 2,160Brightness:400 nitsContrast:1,000:1Response time:1 msRefresh rate:160 Hz 4k / 320 Hz 1080pHDR:HDR10Features:IPS panel, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C with 15 W power deliveryPrice:$449|£349 Elsewhere, you get basic HDR support via HDR10 signal processing and 400 nits of brightness, 1 ms claimed response and 95% DCI-P3 coverage. There's also not only HDMI and DisplayPort connectivity, but USB-C with power delivery, too. That catch is that the USB-C power delivery is limited to 15 W, which is just about enough to charge a slumbering thin-and-light laptop but nowhere enough for a gaming portable. What's more, there's no USB hub, so it's not really offering the full single-cable solution. Oh, and for the record, Asus has chosen a matte anti-glare coating for this display, as opposed to glossy. Still, this is a pretty appealing package for the price, especially given it's from Asus' premium ROG brand, albeit qualified by the fact that it also hails from the slightly more cost-conscious Strix sub-brand. You've certainly got your work cut out keeping up with all that branding. Speaking of which, the XG27UCG sports ROG's signature design vibe. That means it's unambiguously gamery, especially on the rear where the ROG graphic is backlit with configurable RGB lighting that outlines brushed metal inserts. Arguably, it would look a little silly in an office environment. But at least the front is pretty sober with the now industry-standard design aesthetic of slim bezels on three sides of the panel, plus a larger chin. Overall, it's well enough built and the stand offers a full array of adjustability, even if it's ultimately made mostly of dark grey plastic. The OSD controls on the rear of the chassis, which include a joystick, are easy to get at and the OSD menu itself is both pretty intelligible and fairly comprehensive. My only quibble in this context, and it's pretty minor, is that the dual mode function requires two button presses and takes what feels like an age to 'reboot' and resync with Windows. Up to a point that's understandable. In effect, the XG27UCG is becoming a \"new\" display when switching modes. But it does all feel a bit clunky. This is a very sweet and punchy 4K IPS monitor. Anywho, how does the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG actually perform? In basic terms, this is a very sweet and punchy 4K IPS monitor. If anything, it looks even brighter than its 400 nit rating and the factory calibration in terms of colour accuracy will be good enough for just about anything short of true pro-grade content creation workflows. Being a 4K 27-inch monitor, the pixel density is super sharp, fonts look fab and in-game detail is pretty outrageous. Where things get a little more complicated is that dual resolution shizzle. Our understanding is that Asus doesn't actually use straight-up pixel doubling to achieve 1080p on a 4K panel. You'd think that would be the most sensible approach. After all, if you double up a 1080p pixel in both directions, thus using four pixels for each 1080p \"native\" pixel, you end up precisely mapping to the 3,840 by 2,160 4K pixel grid. This is known as integer scaling but, for whatever reason, it's likely not being used here, Asus instead opting for some kind of interpolation algorithm. I should say there are some indications that interpolation as opposed to integer scaling is currently the norm for most if not all of these dual-mode monitors (one probable exception being theAlienware AW2725QF I mentioned above). I'm not clear on why this is the case as integer scaling surely makes more sense and ought to be easier to implement. As and when I get access to the right kind of monitor engineer, I hope to find out. As it is, you wouldn't want to use this monitor's 1080p mode on the desktop. It's a little soft and blurry. However, in-game it actually works pretty well and is certainly preferable to 1080p interpolated in the normal fashion onto a 4K panel. The 320 Hz 1080p mode is also that little bit quicker in terms of pixel response versus the 160 Hz 4K mode and obviously the latency is quite a bit better, too. The idea, here, is to deliver the best compromise between plenty of image detail and precision for general desktop use and single-player gaming, while also serving up the kind of speed and response you might want in online shooters. The idea is the best compromise between image detail for single-player gaming and speed and response for online shooters. And, you know what, that's largely what you get. Asus also offers very granular overdrive options, with no fewer than 20 available levels with which to tune pixel response. I found pushing the level beyond 15 began to introduce noticeable overshoot and inverse ghosting. But at around 15, this is a very nippy, crisp IPS monitor. Obviously an OLED panel is going to be quicker. But then a 4K OLED panel is going to be a lot more expensive, too. Ultimately, if what you want is a really nice all-rounder and you are happy with or favour the 27-inch form factor, the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG is a strong all-round package. ✅You want both speed and image detail:The XG27UCG's native 4K mode is super crispy while the 1080p serves up the speed. ❌You're expecting a truly native 1080p experience:The 1080p mode looks pretty good in games, but it's a little soft and blurry on the desktop. As for the dual-mode functionality, it doesn't quite deliver on the premise of a monitor with two native resolutions, but it certainly makes this a more versatile monitor. If you're based in the US, it might be worth seeing what happens with the price over the next few months. As it happens, we're expecting to see high-refresh 4K monitors get a lot cheaper in the coming months, although the cheapest of them probably won't offer dual-mode functionality. That caveat aside, if you're in the market for this type of display, the Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG comes recommended. Two displays in one monitor is the promise and the dual-mode Asus ROG Strix XG27UCG mostly delivers and for relatively sensible money. Just note that the 1080p mode isn't truly like a native display.

    "title": "Having spent time testing the Switch 2 mouse controls I no longer think it's a gimmick, but it just cannot compare to a gaming mouse",
    "article_text": "It does feel surprisingly smooth, though. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nintendo is a company that seems to thrive on strange hardware choices. From the look of theGameCubeto the feel of the Wii Remote, to, well, the switch part of theNintendo Switch, I'm reluctant to call them gimmicks. This is because, despite grabbing attention, they do seem to serve some kind of purpose. After using them, I don't think theNintendo Switch 2mouse controls (arguably one of the biggest changes for Ninty's new console) are a gimmick, as such, but there are a whole lot of growing pains—and I don't know if the end result will be worth it. First, let's start with the good parts. From my limited time with them (we've only just received the console for testing), theNintendo Switch 2 mouse controlsare smooth and intuitive. You don't need to access a special settings menu to turn them on, just unclick both controllers and place either one on a flat surface to get scrolling. As both Joy-Cons have the capacity to work as mice, it's functionally an ambidextrous set of controls. You will want to slap on the included brace to the bottom of the Joy-Con before controlling, as it gives much-needed stability to the controller. Having only two points of contact with the table also leaves me less worried I'll wear down the Joy-Cons or surface over time, too. I was worried mouse controls would have a delay, find some surfaces hard to read, or would feel a little artificially smoothed—none of those feel true in my time with them so far. I can confidently use the mouse controls on my lap, which I don't think I'll use too much, but it's a testament to how smooth things feel initially. For the likes of browsing the Nintendo eShop, I'd actually argue the mouse controls are a better way of searching through games than the joystick. The eShop has multiple entries in a line or on a page, which makes the mouse slightly more efficient at scrolling. You can drag a page up or down, much like you do with a tablet, so you don't even have to use the joystick as you scroll. It was when I booted upCyberpunk 2077that I ran into my first problem with the mouse controls. The Nintendo Switch 2 still wants you to treat the mouse Joy-Con as a standard controller in play. This means, as well as anchoring your hand to actually hit the triggers at the right time, you want to place your thumb in a place where you can hit all of the side buttons, too. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This becomes an even bigger problem when you have to click in the joystick to either run or crouch. I struggle to crouch without moving my reticle wildly to the left, which has already messed up some stealth sections. The mouse controls occasionally felt like using anupright ergonomic mouse, but without the specifically designed ergonomics to go with it. A lot of my problem with the mouse controls isn't in the technical aspects of the mouse, it's the fact that it's still a Joy-Con after all of that. Swapping controls around is an option here, but given the limited buttons at your disposal, this means having to leave some controls out, and means customizing buttons every single time you play a game that has mouse controls. As of right now, you can't actually turn off the thumbstick whilst using mouse controls, which means I've occasionally flicked onto the wrong page just because I've gotten a little too comfortable. The same is true of vibration, which feels uncomfortable and rattles in play. You can turn these off, but there don't seem to be more customisable controls to turn certain things on and off depending on how you want to use the Nintendo Switch 2. A 'mouse mode' could solve some of my woes here. There is some hope here for mouse controls. The act of actually using them, I'd say, is fairly comfortable and intuitive so far, and there are games that could really see the benefit, like those in the RTS genre. However, controls feel unaccounted for on launch day, and are missing some extra customisation that could make them feel much better. Cyberpunk itself feels like a great game to test them on, due to its focus on shooting, and I have positive feelings on the port as a whole. However, there are plenty of strange choices, like the fact that you can use mouse controls to move around in settings, but actually clicking on anything requires you to hit the A or B button. This means placing the mouse and then moving my hand across to actually accept. Just allowing you to hit settings or equip gear with a click of the trigger would feel so much smoother. You can't currently change the control scheme at all for the mouse sensor mode, though there is a decent level of customisability for how fast the cursor moves. On a similar note, you can access the map via mouse controls, but you need to use the thumbsticks to actually control it. This means I constantly lifted the Joy-Con up, changed some sort of setting, or clicked on a quest, then popped them back down again. Even looting and talking to NPCs are done via the right Joy-Con, which means I never quite felt like I was actually using a mouse. Though the Nintendo Switch 2 has support for keyboards, the launch only seems to support them for typing, and no game I tried would work with a keyboard. I certainly feel like keyboard support would help my problems with mouse controls so far, but there's one thing it can't fix: feel. The Joy-Con is a very light device. It's also rather small, and under my admittedly rather large hands, it feels like all the weight of the device is firmly in the centre of my hands. This leaves them feeling a tad unnatural. This is compounded by the fact that most of the controls of the Joy-Con are near the top. I constantly felt like my hand was craned over the top 40% of the Joy-Con, which left me feeling a bit unbalanced. From my time with the Joy-Con mouse controls, I've felt my thumb most comfortable next to B and Y, which means reaching up to A often requires adjusting my palm to adequately brace against the bottom of the Joy-Con to keep it still as I press. This doesn't feel like the most elegant solution, but it's the only one I've come up with right now. Different hands will, naturally, have a different response here, and my partner's smaller hands didn't seem to have quite as much friction hitting the buttons. They did, however, find the Joy-Con to be rather small and angular in their palms, like I do. It is worth noting, however, that this is only after a day or so with the Nintendo Switch 2. Not many of the Nintendo Switch 2 launch titles actually support mouse controls, and some you may expect to (likeHitman World of Assassination) don't.Fortniteis due to launch its own mouse controls over the coming days, but that is a game even more dependent on extra button prompts than Cyberpunk 2077. It is worth noting, however, that I'm a fairly experienced keyboard and mouse player. I'm comparing my feelings using my gaming rig to the Joy-Con mouse controls, and that's not fully the point of them. They seem designed just to give a little more variety to the use of the console, and it certainly does do that. As of right now, it does feel like games need to be designed, or at least customised with them specifically in mind, to get good use out of them, so it's hard to say how they will feel a year from now. The mouse controls are worlds better than gyro controls, at least. James is a more recent PC gaming convert, often admiring graphics cards, cases, and motherboards from afar.

    "title": "XDefiant is now ex-Defiant as the game closes and its executive producer leaves Ubisoft: 'We just didn't have the gas to go the distance'",
    "article_text": "\"We saw a lot of reactions from other games to what we were doing and that to me speaks volumes.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Let's get the obvious out of the way: XDefiant is one of the worst names for a videogame you'll ever see. Yet underneath the identikit theme and terrible name, XDefiant turned out to be a pretty decent shooter, and following last year's releasePCG's Jake Tucker called it\"the perfect antidote to those tired of Call of Duty's modern-day bloat\". Despite a strong start, however, player numbers soon fell off, and by the end of 2024Ubisofthad announced its intention toclose down XDefiant by June this year. This was shortly afterwards followed by a real oddity: a massive content drop ofeverything the devs had been working on. Turned out that a game players had criticised for lacking content actually had a tonne of content more-or-less ready to go. It was too little too late, however, and XDefiant is now gone for good. Yes it does seem slightly bananas that a Ubisoft game which only released last year is now just gone forever, but I guess that's the videogames industry for you. XDefiant executive producer Mark Rubin stayed with the game until the bitter end, and has now announced his own departure from Ubisoft and retirement from the games industry (thanks, GIBiz). \"It's a sad day for fans of XDefiant and for all of the passionate devs that worked so hard on this game,\"says Rubin on X. \"Something remarkable happened with this game in that, although we had very little marketing, we still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title just from you guys all talking about and promoting the game.\" After that launch period, unfortunately, \"we weren't acquiring new players\". Rubin goes on to list some of the issues the game faced. \"For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn't designed for what we were doing, and we didn't have the engineering resources to ever correct that,\" says Rubin. \"I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal. This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This was a major issue for XDefiant since launch, and never really went away. And it's linked to the fact that the team didn't have \"the right resources to make content for the game. What we saw at Season 3 wasn't even enough content in my mind for launch. There were some really cool features coming later in Season 4 or even 5 that would have completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch… we just didn't have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game.\" Rubin still thinks the team produced \"a really fun and terrific game\" with \"some of the best maps ever made for an arcade shooter\". And he reckons that, even though it's gone, XDefiant made an impact on other shooters: \"We saw a lot of reactions from other games to what we were doing and that to me speaks volumes.\" At the time XDefiant's closure was announced, Ubisoft also confirmed it meant hundreds of layoffs. \"The team behind XDefiant was all let go at the end of last year and I know many people have moved on to other studios, which is great, and I hope that for all of those still looking, that they find something quickly,\" says Rubin. \"As for me, I've decided to leave the industry and spend more time with my family so unfortunately you won't be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say.\" Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

Nightmare for the living.Resident Evil Requiemis the ninth title in the mainline Resident Evil series,\" theblurbreads. \"Prepare to escape death in a heart-stopping experience that will chill you to your core. \"A new era of survival horror begins in 2026. Technological advancements combined with the development team's depth of experience combine in a story with rich characters and gameplay that's more immersive than ever before.\" Bizarrely, Jun Takeuchi,Resident Evilexecutive producer, made a brief appearance earlier in the broadcast to tease the game, but stated that Capcom wasn't ready to reveal it. From the trailer, it seems thatResident Evil Requiemwill follow Grace as she investigates a serial killer who has a connection to her deceased mother.

    "article_text": "And I have mixed feelings When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We now know which four characters will be released as part ofStreet Fighter 6'sYear 3 character pass. The characters were announced during theSummer Game Fest 2025showcase, in a humorous live-action trailer starring legendary wrestler (andStreet Fighterpro) Kenny Omega. The characters you'll be getting in Season 3 are Alex, C.Viper, Ingrid, and Sagat. And while these are all fan favorite characters in some regards, it does feel like a very safe selection overall. Alex debuted inStreet Fighter 3: New Generation,and was effectively the face of that game. He also appeared inStreet Fighter 5. C.Viper was arguably one of the more iconic debutants fromStreet Fighter 4,and her omission fromStreet Fighter 5certainly left some fans out in the cold. Ingrid is an interesting one, as she effectively only ever appeared in two games - one of those wasCapcom Fighting Evolution,which many fighting game fans would prefer to pretend didn't exist (though it is playable again today viaCapcom Fighting Collection 2). She also appeared inStreet Fighter Alpha 3 MAX,a PSP port often considered among the best the Alpha subseries has to offer. Lastly there's Sagat. Cool.

    "title": "I can’t believe Deadpool is finally making his gaming return, and it’s as a hilarious Meta Quest 3 exclusive",
    "article_text": "'The Merc with a Meta Quest' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Is it a bird? A plane? No, it’s the Merc with a Mouth flying face-first into his next game:Marvel’s Deadpool VR– and it’s coming exclusively to theMeta Quest 3andMeta Quest 3S. We just got our first trailer for the title at Summer Game Fest, and it’s jam-packed with violence against a host of Marvel villains and Deadpool’s signature humor. While the gameplay focus doesn’t tell us too much about the story, the trailer’s description reveals that Deadpool has been given the chance to make big bucks after being transported to Mojoworld, which X-Men animated fans will recognise as the home of the TV-obsessed Mojo. He signs a contract (which he obviously doesn’t read properly) and that sends him across the Marvel universe to face off against Hydra goons, the Hand, and iconic villains including Omega Red and Mephisto. In a press release sent out to us ahead of the announcement, the combat style was described as “if you can imagine it, you can probably do it.” Based on what we’ve seen, this appears to be the case. Deadpool blocks incoming fire with his katanas before wall running while shooting at his foes and finishing them off by chucking his pistol at the robot trying to gun him down. Later in the trailer, we see him throwing appendages (his own and others) at his foes, pressing a goon’s face into a spinning plane propeller, and using the Hand’s kunai against them. If you like action-packed VR sandboxes, this looks like it could be right up your street, as the footage seems to stress the importance of creative killing rather than simply flailing your katanas around. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. All the while, Neil Patrick Harris is delivering humorous quips as the voice actor for Deadpool in this title. And while we only get a small taste of his performance, he already sounds like a great pick for the role with his characteristically dry, sarcastic humor. Meta and developer Twisted Pixel haven’t yet given this title an exact release date, but have said it’s coming “Late 2025,” and it can’t come soon enough. Deadpool and his fans have been crying out for a new video game. Since his 2013 title’s release, the character’s popularity has skyrocketed thanks to a trilogy of much-loved movies starring him. However, Activision also lost the Marvel license it had in 2014, so the game is impossible to get digitally and can’t be rereleased physically. That’s why copies of the 2013 Deadpool game have seen prices over $100 / £100 at times, and can still fetch prices in the $50 / £40 range from resellers. If this Meta Quest 3 title can live up to the superhero-fantasy that wasBatman: Arkham Shadow– one of the best Batman games ever made, and the perfect title for anyone who has dreamt of wearing the cowl – I exp[ect it could be the sought of 2025 system seller the Quest 3 and Quest 3s have been looking for (especially givenrumors that a Meta Quest 4 refresh has been delayed until at least 2027).

    "title": "AI can write a hit song, but it can’t lift your soul or break your heart",
    "article_text": "Why Timbaland’s new AI artist TaTa is not the future of music When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The presence of AI in music is on the rise, and there are plenty of questions about whether that's agood thing or not. Of course, the music business is a business, so the real question is whether it can be a success, not whether the quality matches human artists. The incredibly successful musical artist and producer Timbaland is going to find out for himself. Timbaland has signed an AI pop act named TaTa to his new company Stage Zero,accordingtoBillboard.The first performer for an AI-powered music genre he's named “A-Pop,” TaTa was created in a partnership withAI music platform Suno, a company Timbaland has worked with before. According to a statement toBillboard, Timbaland thinks of TaTa as far more than just a more complex auto-tune tied to achatbot. TaTa is “a living, learning, autonomous music artist.” I get the appeal of AI for someone like Timbaland. He’s a producer. His talent allows him to hear the possibilities for a song or artist before they are fully formed. And AI tools like Suno and its various rivals, like Udio, can generate catchy melodies, layered harmonies, and even full songs in just a few minutes. What took days now takes hours, and what took months now takes days. AI music production is fast, consistent, and never a diva about its lunch order. But, so what? That might be fine for elevator music or background music in a million insurance commercials, but that's not what Timbaland is pitching. Music that people listen to for fun or for the feelings may have been created in a burst of inspiration and a dream, like \"Let It Be\" was for Paul McCartney, but far more often, an album is the result of a lot of hard work, experiments, failures, and emotion. Consistency is what you want from fast food, but music shouldn't be that way. Sometimes a song is amazing, and sometimes it's bad, but that's better than dully competent. It's like with AI writing. Usually it's very competent and accurate, but supremely dull and lacking imagination. Sure, a good set of prompts can provoke something more imaginative, but even that's ultimately from the prompt; the AI just stitches together the rest from whatever good idea appeared in the prompt. It's not like AI music is always going to be bad. Timbaland is keen to point out that TaTa is not just an avatar, but a model able to learn. But, say TaTa has twenty thousand great pop songs to learn from. It may perform something that sounds just as good, but really will be exactly the average. I think we often confuse technical ability with artistry. AI can write lyrics and generate beats and melodies. But it doesn’t understand what it's writing, and I think you can tell in the best music the intention behind the singing. It’s the difference between cooking from a recipe and cooking from memory. Both result in a nice meal, but one has a story behind it to enhance the flavor. I think AI has a place in music. I really like how it can help the average person without technical or musical skills produce a song. Anyone with an idea can make a song without a whole team or a record label behind them. But, ultimately, it's the idea and the person providing it that make or break a song. AI should be a tool, even a collaborator, but I don't think it should be the whole act. That's not helping humans make better music; that's just replacing them. We’re replacing them with algorithms and calling it progress. Timbaland says TaTa is the first of a new generation of musical acts. That might be true, as there's certainly a lot of AI-generated music on streaming platforms now. We may soon see AI artists on half of the Top 40, all optimized for TikTok loops. But I question how many of them will be considered the best music around. Even as AI keeps getting better, more convincing, and more nuanced, I think real voices and songs will stand out. Timbaland could make a lot of money from TaTa, because he's that talented a producer. But I’d rather hear what he does collaborating with a young artist who's come up with a great hook and lyrics for a chorus. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Nvidia is planning to launch 11 DGX Spark and Station PCs with its partners: here they are",
    "article_text": "Nvidia’s DGX Spark and Station promise developer-grade firepower When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At Computex 2025,Nvidiatook a somewhat unconventional route by sidestepping the main exhibition floor and instead hosting its own “GTC Taipei” event at a nearby hotel. There, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered a trio of keynote speeches at the event, unveiling new AI-focused hardware. Among the biggest announcements were two devices: the DGX Spark, a compact mini PC aimed at AI developers, and the DGX Station, a more powerful workstation-class system. Though Nvidia-branded units were showcased, the real surprise was the range of OEM partners joining the initiative, with 11 models expected across the Spark and Station lines. The DGX Spark is built around the new Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which combines a 20-coreArmCPU co-developed with MediaTek (featuring 10 Cortex-X295 and 10 Cortex-X725 cores) and a GPU based on Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture. Designed for developers, the device delivers up to 1,000 TOPS (FP4/sparse) of performance and ships with a Linux-based DGX OS, Nvidia’s AI development suite also used in its data center platforms like Blackwell and Hopper. Several partners, includingAcer, Asus,Dell, Gigabyte,HP,Lenovo, andMSI, had models on display. At first glance, however, the only visible differences were in the external design. No internal teardowns were permitted during the event, raising a valid question: how different are these OEM versions beyond aesthetics? Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! While the DGX Spark promises to be a strong contender for the title ofbest mobile workstationfor AI development, potential buyers may want to wait for detailed reviews before making a purchase. The DGX Station, aimed more directly at professionals needing high-end workstation PCs, features the GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Desktop Superchip. It comes equipped with 288GB of HBM3e memory on the GPU and a 72-core Neoverse V2 CPU paired with 496GB of LPDDR5X RAM, making it far from an ordinary desktop. Like the Spark, it runs on DGX OS and supports Nvidia’s full AI development stack. The DGX Station board shown at the exhibition was a mockup, though the actual product was displayed during a separate session. Still, questions remain about how finalized the systems are, especially since full availability isn't expected until late 2025. Notably, the DGX Station will only be available through OEMs, with Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and Supermicro leading the rollout. This fragmented distribution model could introduce variation in build quality and thermal performance, critical factors for users seeking thebest workstation PC.

The prototype drive supports both NVMe and SAS connections, offering flexibility during what could be a lengthy transition. However, Pressley was quick to manage expectations: “There are almost no benefits in terms of performance. The latest SAS provides sufficient performance, and just because it becomes NVMe doesn't mean that there is a major improvement.” For consumers searching for thebest HDD,or even thefastest external HDD, NVMe support offers little immediate benefit.

With SSDs already running on NVMe, bringing HDDs under the same protocol simplifies driver requirements and software architecture. Importantly, the NVMe-compatible HDD is not based on a proprietary standard. Instead, it follows a formalized version of the NVMe specification, which now includes commands tailored to mechanical drives, such as spin-up protocols. This adherence to open standards increases the likelihood of broader industry adoption, especially in enterprise environments where consistency is crucial. However, NVMe HDDs are unlikely to become available to the general public anytime soon. According to Pressley and Seagate, it may take five to ten years for hard drives to fully transition from SATA/SAS to NVMe. That timeline mirrors previous transitions, like the shift from IDE to SATA, where new standards gradually replaced legacy interfaces. While this progression seems inevitable for data centers, consumer desktops and laptops are a different story. Most consumer systems today still rely on SATA for bulk storage, often pairing thelargest HDDavailable with a faster SSD for boot and application performance. Until motherboard chipsets eliminate SATA support altogether, a shift not expected for at least another decade, NVMe HDDs are unlikely to become mainstream in home PCs.

    "article_text": "Titan 2 is bold, boxy, and built to survive chaos When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unihertz has announced a Kickstarter campaign for its upcomingrugged smartphone, the Titan 2. In a 16-second ad released byUnihertz, the company said, “We are getting ready for our Kickstarter in June,” offering a first look at a device that feels both familiar and ambitious. The ad reveals the Titan 2 follows the originalUniherz Titanand theTitan Slim, continuing the brand’s focus on rugged smartphones with physical QWERTY keyboards. With its square screen and hardware keys, the Titan 2 clearly echoes the BlackBerry era, when such designs were synonymous with business productivity and communication. The new model appears to be a wider, flat-edged version of the Titan Slim, lacking the curved top and bottom design found on the original Titan. Though detailed specifications remain scarce, Unihertz confirmed toTechRadar Prothat the commercial version of the Titan 2 will offer a substantial 512GB of internal storage. This marks a significant upgrade from previous iterations, particularly the 2019 Unihertz Titan, which shipped with 128GB of storage, 6GB of RAM, and a MediaTek Helio P60 processor.

The original Titan was notable for its 4.5-inch 1440x1440 display, global LTE support, NFC capability, and 6,000mAh battery, all packed into a bulky 305g chassis with IP67 water and dust resistance. The Titan and Titan Slim were never aimed at mainstream users. Instead, they targeted those seeking something unconventional. The Titan 2 now seems poised to build on that lineage, with greater storage and a refreshed design, while remaining firmly rooted in the company’s niche aesthetic and utilitarian philosophy. Thisbusiness smartphonedoes not appear to be a contender for mass-market dominance. However, its physical QWERTY keyboard could appeal to professionals who value tactile input for communication-heavy workflows. That said, this device is undeniably a niche product, and physical keyboards have long fallen out of fashion. The Titan 2 will need to prove that nostalgia and rugged durability can coexist with modern expectations, otherwise, it will remain a niche offering.

    "title": "Google upgrades Gemini 2.5 Pro's already formidable coding abilities",
    "article_text": "The model promises stability to go with its smarts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google's rapid rollout of new models of Gemini is continuing apace, but the latest version of Gemini 2.5 Pro has some notable improvements that the company claims will put it in play for a while as the first “long-term stable release.” The upgrade also patches up some of the issues that might currently frustrate Gemini Pro users. For now, the model is still in beta, unlike its friskier sibling, Gemini 2.5 Flash. Gemini Pro 2.5 has reportedly taken longer and dealt with some complicated issues around regressions in conversation that made the AI model seem somewhat underpowered as a brain. Those issues have apparently been resolved, with Google bragging about the coding capabilities of the new model in particular. It's outscored rival models on the Aider Polyglot benchmark, a multi-language coding test popular for measuring AI model software composition. The updated model also offers developers what Google calls “configurable thinking budgets.” These are essentially a way to fine-tune how much computing power Gemini uses to answer complex queries so that you don't use up all of your credits building an app in one go. It’s already available through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and will likely become part of Gemini as a whole in the near future. And it's not just a technical whiz. Gemini Pro has faced complaints of lacking the same creative and conversational flair of its fellow Gemini models, failing to impress outside of technical tasks. The writing and formatting could get sloppy, and long-form responses tended to ramble or circle back on themselves. Google says it’s fixed that issue, with correct formatting, more nuanced writing, and no trailing off mid-response. All of those upgrades lead to why Google has declared this version of Gemini Pro to be a long-term, stable model, at least for now. For developers and enterprise users, that kind of certainty is valuable in its own right, just as much as regular upgrades. The new model will have an impact on Gemini users outside of the office, too. The same improvements to formatting, memory, and contextual understanding will likely be incorporated into the public-facing version of Gemini just to keep things neat. And it fits with Google's strategy to embed Gemini everywhere and encourage everyone to use it for any of their AI needs. Gemini Flash is the default option for those not paying a subscription fee for Gemini. Gemini Nano handles AI for Android devices, but Gemini Pro is intended to be the flagship model, the one that impresses everyone. Google will definitely try to live up to that vision with the new model, but the competition has hardly gone away.OpenAI, Anthropic, and evenAppleare all racing to be on top of the AI model game. Gemini 2.5 Pro proves Google won't be falling behind any time soon, at least now that it's stopped regressing.

An open instance containing \"billions upon billions” of exposed records has been discovered online by cybersecurity researchers - and millions of people could be at risk as a result. Researcher atCybernewsworked with cybersecurity researcher and owner of cyber risk and data protection site SecurityDiscovery.com to uncover a huge database without a password, leaking 631GB of information, equating to roughly 4 billion records.

TechRadar editors praise Aura's upfront pricing and simplicity. Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) This could be part of a surveillance project, researchers argue, and there are plenty of ways that a threat actor could exploit this information, such as social engineering attacks,identity theft,fraud or even blackmail. “The sheer volume and diversity of data types in this leak suggests that this was likely a centralized aggregation point, potentially maintained for surveillance, profiling, or data enrichment purposes,” the team observed. The instance was “”quickly taken down” after it was discovered, but it’s not known how long it was open for. Unsurprisingly for suspected surveillance data, the information contains PII like full names, dates of birth, and phone numbers, as well as financial data like card numbers, debt and saving information, and spending habits.

    "article_text": "The LCFC AI mini PC is powerful, but with a price to match When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lenovohas introduced a compact new system powered byAMD’s most powerful consumer APU to date, the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 “Strix Halo.” Part of the LCFC AIMini PClineup, this machine, now on salevia JD.com in China, combines workstation-class specs with a desktop-friendly footprint that targets AI developers, content creators, and power users. At the device's core is AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max+ 395 APU, featuring 16 Zen 5 CPU cores, 32 threads, and an RDNA 3.5-based Radeon 8060S integrated GPU with 40 Compute Units. It also includes a dedicated NPU delivering up to 50 TOPS. Taken together, the CPU, GPU, and NPU provide up to 126 TOPS of AI performance, which is enough to run LLMs and other AI workloads locally. Designed for AI tasks, creative workflows, and high-performance gaming, the LCFC system features 128GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, which is more than you'll find in many full-sized gaming rigs, and supports two M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 SSDs, each with up to 2TB capacity, for a total of 4TB of high-speed storage. Although it’s described as a mini PC, at roughly 9.7 x 7.4 x 3.8 inches, it’s firmly in the SFF (Small Form Factor) category; compact enough for tight workspaces while still offering powerful internals. Connectivity includes a 1GbE Ethernet port and built-in Wi-Fi, although it does not appear to support Wi-Fi 6. The I/O selection includes one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port, two USB 2.0 ports, one USB Type-C, HDMI 1.4, and DisplayPort 1.4. While the DisplayPort is useful, the HDMI 1.4 output is a drawback, as it lacks support for4Kat 120Hz, something expected in modern high-end systems.

The LCFC AI Mini PC is reportedly priced at ¥13,989 in China, which converts to approximately $1,946. That places it in the high-end category, although it's still competitively priced given its workstation-grade specs and AI abilities. Given the rising demand for compact PCs capable of running AI models locally, there's likely to be international interest should Lenovo decide to make its new system more widely available.

    "title": "Zelensky gave Putin ‘reason to bomb the hell out of’ Ukraine – Trump",
    "article_text": "The recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian airfields hosting long-range nuclear-capable bombers have sharply increased the risk of escalation and gave Moscow a valid reason to retaliate with force, US President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday. In addition to launching a coordinated drone strike on multiple Russian airbases, Ukraine also blew up railway bridges in Russia last week, derailing both civilian and freight trains, killing at least seven people, and injuring over 120 others, including children. President Vladimir Putin discussed the attacks in a phone call with his US counterpart on Wednesday, warning that Moscow’s response isinevitableand justified. Trump told journalists on Friday that he“didn’t like”the escalation when asked whether Kiev’s attack on a key component of Russia’s nuclear triad changed his view of“what’s at stake”and what“cards”Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky holds. “Well, they gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them last night,”Trump stated.“That’s something I didn’t like about it. When I saw it, I said: ‘Here we go… now it’s going to be a strike.’” In response to the recent“terrorist acts”by Kiev, the Russian military carried outlarge-scale strikesagainst Ukrainian defense industry sites early Friday morning, using air-, sea-, and land-based missiles as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), according to the Defense Ministry. The targets of the overnight strikes included“design bureaus, enterprises involved in the production and repair of Ukraine’s weapons and military equipment, workshops for the assembly of attack drones, flight training centers, as well as warehouses of weapons and military equipment,”the statement said. Putin described the deadly railway sabotage incidents as“undoubtedly a terrorist act”committed by the“illegitimate regime in Kiev,”which, he said, is“graduallyturning into a terrorist organization.” Moscow has accused Kiev of escalating its attacks in an effort to undermine US-backed peace talks. Russia has also claimed that Trump is receiving“filtered”information about the Ukraine conflict from individuals pushing Washington to support Kiev.",

    "article_text": "Russia and the Global South have been strengthening ties and expanding digital cooperation in light of new opportunities opened by Western sanctions, according to delegates attending the country’s first Global Digital Forum this week. The two-day event, which kicked off on Thursday in Nizhny Novgorod, brought together government officials, business leaders, and experts from more than 100 countries, including China, India, and some African nations. Some of them shared their views with RT on the sidelines of the forum, highlighting prospects for collaboration in areas such as trade, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and technology transfer. “China and Russia are strategic partners and good neighbors,”said Zhou Liqun, chairman of the Chinese Entrepreneurs’ Union in Russia. He noted that bilateral trade reached $240 billion last year, with China remaining Russia’s top food product partner for 15 consecutive years.“Even under sanctions, the number of Chinese companies in Russia is growing,”Zhou said, adding“We see the trend of promising cooperation.” Sun Tianshu, founder of the China-Russian Platform, pointed out that“many opportunities in the (Russian) market [were] freed up”following the introduction of Western restrictions, allowing Chinese firms to step in. “Trade between our countries has one tendency – growth,”he said, stressing that past challenges, including payment issues, had been resolved.“Even if new problems appear, we will be able to solve them,”he argued. Indian cybersecurity expert Sunny Vaghela called for closer cooperation in the AI and cyber fields.“Russia is technologically advanced, and India is a hub of tech talent. Why not join hands to make AI and cyber a boom for both countries?”asked the CEO of Techdefence Labs. He added that some Russian companies were ready to come to India to collaborate. African delegates voiced similar interest in digital partnerships, especially in sectors like agriculture, education, and information management. “We came to learn how to bring AI and robotics home to help our people,”said Tanzanian expert Henry Nkya.“Russia is using AI to boost productivity – we want to do the same.” His colleague Mawazo Mataje emphasized the importance of knowledge exchange.“We’re looking at sharing skills, experiences, and cultural understanding between Russia and the Global South,”he said. Bangladeshi entrepreneur Mohammad Saber Shah described the event as“a truly encouraging experience,”saying he had the chance to meet IT professionals“from around the globe.” “This forum acts as a bridge between us,”helping identify gaps that can be filled through partnerships. “Russia has long been a friend to Bangladesh – there’s now real opportunity for digital collaboration,”he said.",

    "article_text": "Senior Iranian lawmaker Abolfazl Zohrevand has thanked Russia for condemning American threats directed at the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. Speaking exclusively to RT, he also suggested that Washington was attempting to lure Tehran into a“propaganda trap.” The two countries began negotiations in Oman in April. US President Donald Trump has warned that if Iran does not“make a deal, there will be bombing.” In an interview with RT on Friday, Zohrevand, who is a member of the Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian parliament, praised Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova for clearly articulating Moscow’s opposition to the threats. The lawmaker also warned that Iran should be cautious not to fall into the“trap”set by the US. “The atmosphere that is being created by the Americans cannot be deemed credible,”Zohrevand stated, stressing that this was his personal opinion. Speaking during a press briefing on Wednesday, Zakharova described threats to target Iranian nuclear facilities as“irresponsible,”emphasizing that such a strike would lead to“catastrophic consequences”for the whole world. “It should be obvious to everyone that the path toward the resolution of [issues] surrounding Iran’s nuclear program is through diplomacy only,”she added. Following a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin that same day, Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion.” Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that“President Putin said that we are ready to use [our close relations with Tehran]… to help contribute positively to the ongoing talks.” On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that his country was prepared to“give assurances to all sides about the peaceful nature of our nuclear program.” Responding last month to Washington’s demand that Tehran stop all uranium enrichment, the diplomat dismissed it as“completely detached from the reality of negotiations.” Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity, far above the 3.67% cap set under the now-defunct 2015 nuclear deal. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was rendered null and void after President Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from it during his first term, claiming that it was toothless.",

    "article_text": "The EU is considering adding Russia to its anti-money laundering“grey list”in an effort to cause reputational damage and increase financial pressure on Moscow, Financial Times reported on Friday. The blacklist includes countries that Brussels considers to have inadequate regulations against shady financial activity. Inclusion on the list would impose extra compliance requirements on banks and financial institutions dealing with Russian individuals and entities, leading to higher costs in conducting business activity. The European Commission is preparing to adopt a revised list of high-risk third countries next week, after postponing its release at the last minute for“administrative/procedural reasons,”FT reported. ”There is huge support for putting Russia on the list,”Markus Ferber, a German MEP with the center-right European People’s Party, the EU parliament’s largest grouping, told the outlet. Typically, the EU aligns its blacklist with decisions from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global intergovernmental body that combats money laundering and terrorist financing. Although Russia’s FATF membership was suspended in 2023, several countries would likely block any attempt to formally add it to the FATF grey list, leading Brussels to consider unilateral action. Despite its suspension from FATF, Russia continues to engage with the Eurasian Group (EAG), a regional body affiliated with FATF. In 2024, the EAG assessed Russia’s progress in strengthening its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures. It acknowledged some improvements but urged further action, particularly in enforcing targeted financial sanctions and increasing transparency around beneficial ownership. Ukraine has repeatedly pushed for Russia to be placed on the FATF blacklist, citing its connections with already blacklisted states and the potential risks it allegedly poses to the global financial system. However, these attempts have failed due to resistance from several FATF member states, including China, India, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Despite being suspended, Russia remains obligated to comply with FATF standards and continues to fulfill its financial commitments to the organization.",

    "title": "Trump-Musk Big Bro bust-up: Ignore the noise, focus on the signal",
    "article_text": "Two very rich and very powerful and very big American egos have had a very public and very loud cat fight. US President Donald Trump, arguably the single most powerful politician in the world, and his now former“buddy-in-chief”Elon Musk, certifiably the single richest oligarch on (for now) this planet, have“torched”(Wall Street Journal) their occasionally exuberant bromance of almost a year in a“stunning”(Bloomberg) and“spectacular”(New York Times) finale of fiery mutual recrimination. Say what you will about oligarchic techno-capitalism, but it can be entertaining. Using their own social media platforms, Musk and Trumphave gone after each otherwith brutal reputational attacks, griping of the“You owe me!”–“No, you me!”variant, and high-value threats to do each other economic and political damage. The key trigger for the blow-up was what Trump calls his“Big Beautiful Bill,”which is currently making its way through Congress. For, Musk – despite his lucrative government contracts a deficit hawk,whose own DOGE cost-cutting effort has just frustratingly failed–the same tax bill is a“disgusting abomination.”Musk claims that he is greatly concerned over America’s exploding and unsustainable national debt. Since Trump’s Republican majority in the Senate is small,Musk’s open support for the bill’s vocal opponentsthere is a real political embarrassment for the White House at least, if not even a serious threat. US sovereign debt, moreover, is a real and very serious problem with dire economic and geopolitical implications; and estimates put the costs of Trump’s bill at3.3 trillionadditionaldebtover the next ten years: Musk has a factual point. Yet there also is the fact that Trump’s Big Beautiful Billforesees cutting subsidiesfor buying Musk’s Tesla cars (among other EVs), amounting to an estimated loss of $1.2 billion for Tesla. It can be complicated in that place between conservative ideology, pure and simple, and the unrelenting will to milk the public for yourself and your shareholders. Musk also“revealed”– if that is the word – that Donald Trump features on the client list of the sinister financier, pedophile, mass sex criminal, and most likely intelligence-connected elite blackmailer Jeffrey Epstein, who conveniently committed suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. To make it count, Musk, as if returning to his former Centrist political self, suggested impeaching Trump and founding a new party to contest the great blusterer’s grip on“the 80% in the middle.”Liberal Tesla drivers: Maybe you can love your car again.Even if the share prices of its manufacturer are tanking. Trump shot back by warning Musk that his“billions”in government contracts could melt away like the snows of yesteryear, which made Musk threaten to stop carrying US astronauts into orbit, that is, in effect – since the volatile oligarch is America’s de facto monopolist – shut down space for the US. That, according to the Washington Post, constituted a“serious threat to NASA and Pentagon programs.”Slow claps, Washington, for letting“the Market”handle national security. All in all, quite a reality show: noisy, no holds barred, and pretty indecorous. A dignified display of manly self-control and mature gravity at the empire’s top this was not. But, then again, it’s the US late-imperial“elite,”so the bar of the truly sensational is really high – or low, depending on how you look at it. The whole battle-not-so-royal may or may not blow over. Both Trump and Musk clearly have much to lose from a prolonged war against each other, financially and politically, and both are not only card-carrying egomaniacs but also ruthless, selfish pragmatists. There are already signals that Musk, for one, may want to wind down the confrontation again:he has relented regarding the astronautsandmade some semi-conciliatory noises. Between the president’s growing reputation for“TACO”(Trump always chickens out) and Musk’s proven ability to knuckle under when the price is right (in Brazil and toward Israel-while-committing-genocide, for instance), the two would-be alpha males might still find a way to share. Yet things will never be as before. For one thing, by losing their cool, Musk and Trump have ended up showing each other three things that neither of them will forget: Just how volatile they both are (I know: surprise, surprise…); that Elon is no sacrosanct exception for Donald and Donald isn’t one for Elon either: everyone can always end up on the menu; and, finally, that both can think quickly – really as if they had been doing so for quite a while already – of the nastiest way to hurt the other. If Musk and Trump do make up, think of it as a movie star marriage sticking together after both spouses have badly, publicly cheated and also tried to ruin each other, financially, career-wise, and reputationally. And now let’s take a step back. For, ultimately, the Big Bro Bust-Up is most interesting if we look at it as if we were historians a few hundred years from now in the future: What does this quarrel tell us more generally about America at this stage? First of all, it simply confirms what we all know already: The US is not a democracy by any stretch of the (reasonable) imagination but an oligarchy and plutocracy. Votes count much less than money because money produces the votes. Musk has been commendably explicitabout his belief that it was his massive financial support that made Trump win; and one of Trump’s worriesin the whole rumble is that Musk might not only withdraw future funds from his camp – already promised but not yet paid out – but also invest them elsewhere. Second, as of now at least, the American oligarchy/plutocracy is not under pressure“from below.”Objectively – to use a term long beloved by Marxists – Americans have every reason to rebel and shake off both Trump and Musk and then some. But, sadly, tension and conflict are generated inside the elite, not by“the masses.” And third, the US elite is and remains absolutely, ruthlessly amoral and immoral, indeed quite evil: Here is a major falling out between the biggest oligarch and the president, and it’s about taxes, the deficit, profits, ego, and personal advantages.Notabout, for instance, the fact that the US has, according to Israel, by now delivered90,000 tons of arms and ammunitions to the Israeli apartheid statewhile the latter has been committing the Gaza genocide. Indeed, Musk has never withdrawn his support for Israel, while Trump has reached the same level of complicit depravity as his predecessor Joe Biden. America: The world sees your priorities. And it won’t forget.",

    "title": "Trump and Musk go from hugs to insults",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, who just months ago celebrated the Republican candidate’s election victory together, have exchanged insults, accusations and threats. Their relationship has followed a familiar trajectory: over the years, many of Trump’s associates have gone from working closely with him to a public falling out. This is how the tech entrepreneur threw his wealth and clout behind Trump’s re-election campaign, took a proverbial chainsaw to perceived excesses in government spending, and later turned against the president and his signature spending bill. Musk first unequivocally endorsed Trump for a second term in July 2024, after a shooter almost killed the GOP contender during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. In the months leading up to the election, he spent an estimated $200 million securing the candidate’s victory through a political action committee he created for the purpose. But their relationship stretches back years. During Trump’s first term in office, which began in January 2017, Musk sat on a White House business advisory group, but quit later that year after the administration decided to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. In 2022, Musk said it was time for Trump“to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset”and blamed the Democrats for targeting him, arguing they had pushed him to seek office in order to insulate himself from legal problems. The remark reflected the tech entrepreneur’s broader dissatisfaction with what he called“the party of division & hate.” That same year, Musk purchased Twitter, a social media platform that at the time was the de facto public square for US national politics, whose management he accused of stifling conservative voices. The new owner reinstated Trump’s account, which had been suspended in January 2021 for allegedly posing a risk of incitement of violence in the wake of the Capitol Hill riot, and otherwise changed moderation rules. Critics claim Musk saturated the platform with“misinformation”and hate speech. Musk also blasted then-President Joe Biden’s immigration policy, which he said amounted to keeping the southern border“open”and decried failing to repatriate illegals as a ploy to increase the Democratic Party electoral base. Trump made the promise of mass deportation of such immigrants a key part of his campaign. In January 2025, Musk was appointed to lead the newly-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the Trump administration, with a mandate to review federal spending and cut exuberant or suspicious projects. Critics called Musk’s approach reckless and damaging, while Trump declared DOGE a“very big success”and an example of his administration’s no-nonsense treatment of red tape. In February, Musk gladly brandished a chainsaw at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which had been given to him by Argentina’s President Javier Milei, a similarly-minded politician, as a symbol of the efforts. Musk got embroiled in several controversies while working for the government. Claims that he threw a Nazi salute during an inauguration event were largely written off by the president’s supporters as partisan attacks. Musk’s criticisms of senior officials in countries which were traditional US allies, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany’s now-former Chancellor Olaf Scholz, were downplayed by officials. Behind closed doors, however, he reportedly clashed with senior cabinet members. In March, the New York Times claimed that the DOGE chief had criticized US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy for not firing enough staff members in their departments. Trump dismissed the report as“fake news.” Nevertheless, signs of the growing rift mounted. Days before his seemingly amicable departure from DOGE, Musk told CBS News he was“disappointed”with the“big, beautiful bill”– the centerpiece of Trump’s second term agenda currently pending approval by the Senate. This week, Musk derided the spending proposal as a“massive, outrageous, pork-filled … disgusting abomination.” The Trump-Musk“bromance”seemingly imploded over several hours on Thursday, after the president accused the Tesla CEO of going after the legislation out of personal spite.“He only developed the problem when he found out we're gonna have to cut the EV mandate,”Trump told journalists in the Oval Office. The billionaire pushed back on X, accusing Trump of lying about the bill and lacking gratitude for his backing on the campaign trail, which Musk asserted secured the victory. Trump doubled down on his Truth Social platform, declaring that Musk“just went CRAZY”and threatening to withdraw government contracts from his businesses. In response, Musk accused Trump in an X post on Thursday of covering up his alleged complicity in the sex offences of late financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting the president could be impeached for it. He also threatened to jeopardize NASA’s manned space program by decommissioning the Dragon family of spacecraft operated by his company SpaceX. Musk has since indicated that he would be taking a couple of days to cool off, while White House insiders reportedly suggested a possible truce was being arranged. Some Democratic officials have suggested that Musk could switch sides, while others expressed a sense of satisfaction at his downfall. Congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez claimed“these two huge egos were not longed for being together in this world as friends,”and the breakup was long overdue.",

    "title": "Trump threatens to sanction both Russia and Ukraine",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has signaled that Washington could impose sanctions on both Russia and Ukraine if the conflict between the two nations does not come to an end. Trump has thus far declined to commit to new sanctions on Russia, despite weeks of pressure from European leaders, saying only that he would act when the time felt right — and that moment had not yet come. He has also expressed concern that levying new restrictions could jeopardize peace talks between Moscow and Kiev. During a meeting at the White House with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday, Trump said he would decide when to act if it became clear that a peace deal could not be reached, noting that“it’s in my brain, the deadline.” He suggested he’d be willing to apply restrictions on both Russia and Ukraine, warning that“we’ll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both countries to be honest.” “You know, it takes two to tango,”the US president added. Trump likened the Ukraine conflict to“two children fighting in a park.”He also said a sanctions bill moving through the US Senate would be“guided by me,”but suggested it might be better to let Russia and Ukraine continue fighting“for a while”before“pulling them apart.” The US president was referring to legislation backed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a longtime Russia hawk and Trump ally, that would impose a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy, uranium, and other raw materials – measures aimed chiefly at India and China. Trump’s statement comes as Kiev has ramped up attacks on Russian territory, including a UAV strike on several Russian airbases and recent acts of railway sabotage in Bryansk and Kursk regions, which claimed the lives of seven people and left scores injured. Moscow has accused Kiev of orchestrating a series of violent incidents aimed at undermining peace talks. Russia has also claimed that Trump is receiving“filtered”information about the Ukraine conflict from those pushing Washington toward supporting Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly stressed that it is carrying out strikes on Ukrainian military-linked installations in response to Kiev’s increased drone attacks on Russian civilian targets. In a previously unannounced phone conversation on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin informed his US counterpart that Kiev’s recent attacks were intended to derail direct talks with Moscow, the second round of which took place in Istanbul on Monday. Revealing details of the phone call, which he described as“a good conversation,”Trump said that the Russian president“did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields.”",

    "title": "EU financing ‘extremism’ – applicant state",
    "article_text": "Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has accused the EU of inciting and financing extremism in his country. The claim comes amid a deepening rift between Tbilisi and Brussels over alleged“democratic backsliding.” Kobakhidze insisted on Thursday that his government has“indisputable”evidence that Western actors are backing anti-government protests in the country. ”We prove this with facts, videos, and [EU] financing practices. We have direct facts about how these people are financing extremism in our country. We talk to them with facts, but they respond with general phrases, and more often lies. This is sad,”Kobakhidze said, as cited by Rustavi 2. Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili echoed the charge, stating that“extremism in Georgia is supported and financed from the budgets of the EU.”He added that he had written to EU Ambassador Pawel Herczynski detailing the accusations but had yet to receive a reply. The ruling Georgian Dream party, which secured a decisive parliamentary majority in October 2024, has accused Western powers of interfering in the country’s domestic politics under the guise of“democracy promotion.”Officials in Tbilisi have drawn parallels to the 2014 Maidan uprising in Ukraine and say similar tactics are now being used to destabilize Georgia for refusing to adopt a confrontational stance against Russia in the Ukraine conflict. Following Georgian Dream’s victory, a coalition of pro-Western parties alleged fraud and launched protests to force the government’s resignation. EU and US officials voiced support for the opposition, which Georgian leaders denounced as foreign meddling. Brussels has also led a coordinated campaign against Georgia’s foreign influence transparency law, legislation that requires political organizations to disclose substantial foreign funding. Although similar laws exist across the West, the European External Action Service claimed the legislation in Georgia was“a serious setback for democracy”and warned it could“threaten the country’s EU path.” Tensions spiked last month when French President Emmanuel Macron, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz issued a joint statement on Georgia’s Independence Day, accusing the government of“democratic backsliding.”Papuashvili dismissed the statement as“shameful,”saying it disrespected both the state and its people. Georgia was granted EU candidate status in December 2023 but has since suspended accession talks, citing Brussels’ increasingly coercive tone. The government, however, insists that it remains committed to eventual EU membership.",

    "title": "4 ways to stop stressing about your schedule and reclaim your downtime",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Buyers' Guide Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Travel Wellness Wellness Hint: It doesn't involve \"inbox zero.\" Photo of a person looking at their watch. (Photo: iStock/Doucefleur) Sixty per cent of people surveyed by the Pew Research Center said theysometimes felt too busy to enjoy life. We asked experts for some tips on things we can do to feel more in charge of our time. Your to-do list will never end, said Thomas Curran, the author of The Perfection Trap: Embracing The Power Of Good Enough. So build your tolerance for leaving that list unfinished, he said. “We end our days obsessing over our unchecked boxes instead of celebrating our wins,” said Amantha Imber, the author of Time Wise: Powerful Habits, More Time, Greater Joy. So Dr Imber recommended completing the sentence “Today I made progress on … ” at each day’s end. Researchers call this practise a “savouring intervention,” and they say that it can improve confidence. Chris Guillebeau, the author of Time Anxiety: The Illusion Of Urgency And A Better Way To Live, said people can sometimes cause you “time anxiety” by pulling you into something they consider urgent, creating a “false deadline.” When this happens, he said, ask yourself: Is this actually urgent? Another person’s emergency, Guillebeau said, does not have to become yours. If it’s possible, you can ask, “Is this a high priority, or can I finish the other things I’m working on first?” Do you need to bake cookies for your book club, or will store-bought do? Can that Zoom meeting be a quick phone call instead, while you take a reviving walk? Be alert for those moments when you are needlessly giving it your all and could give, say, 75 per cent instead, Guillebeau recommended. Fight the impulse to view downtime as unproductive, Dr Curran said: “It isn’t wasted at all.” He sets an alarm for himself that goes off every day at 5.30pm. It’s a recording of his toddler asking to play with him. “It reminds me that whatever I’m doing, it can probably wait,” Dr Curran said. Often some of your happiest memories will be events that are “mundane and ordinary,” he said, so make time for them if you can.

    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Singapore Buyers' Guide Living Buyers' Guide Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Dining Dining Dining Dining Travel Experiences Experiences Travel Travel Travel Must-see pavilions include the interactive Saudi village, future-themed Korea Pavilion, and Singapore’s red sphere built with recycled aluminium discs. The Singapore Pavilion (left) and a life-sized Gundam at the Gundam Next Future Pavilion are among the must-visit places at the Osaka Expo 2025. (Photos: Tay Suan Chiang) This audio is generated by an AI tool. If you are headed to Osaka soon, you’ll want to add visiting Expo 2025 to your itinerary. World Expos are large-scale international events held every five years in a different country, bringing together nations to showcase innovations, culture, and ideas on a global stage. Expo 2025 – officially titled Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, Japan – is the latest edition of this historic series, running until Oct 13, with the theme “Designing Future Society for Our Lives”. With over 160 countries, regions and international organisations showcasing their latest technologies and unique cultures in specially designed pavilions, think of Expo 2025 astheplace to not only find inspiration for your next travel destination but to see what the future might hold, under one roof. Or in this case, under the Grand Ring, the architectural centerpiece and symbol of Expo 2025. Visible from the air when flying into Osaka (sit on the left side of the plane), the Grand Ring, designed by famed Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, represents global connection and unity among diverse cultures and nations. The ring is about 30m wide and 20m high on the outside, and built from 70 per cent Japanese cedar and cypress woods, and 30 per cent Scots pine, Measuring 675m in diameter, the Grand Ring holds the Guinness World Record for being the largest wooden architectural structure in the world, and is built using a fusion of modern construction methods and traditional Japanese nuki joints, where horizontal beams are slotted through vertical posts, a technique seen in temples and shrines. Besides being visually stunning, the Grand Ring serves as the main circulation route and also provides shelter from wind, rain and sunlight. In the evenings, head up to the Ring Skywalk, a 12m high elevated walkway that stretches 2km around the site, for a panoramic view of the Expo site and Osaka Bay, and to catch the sunset. Expo 2025 Osaka is projected to attract approximately 28.2 million visitors according to a target set by the Japanese government and the Expo organisers, which averages out to about 150,000 visitors per day. With such a figure, crowds are to be expected, which means lots of waiting in line to enter the pavilions, sometimes for hours. Some pavilions require reservation, but even then, an entry spot is not guaranteed, which means unless you want to spend weeks visiting the Expo, you’ll need to narrow down which pavilions to visit. I spent three days at the Expo and managed to cover some pavilions that I wanted to see, but also had no luck with others. Below are the ones I visited and would recommend. Top of the list is theJapan Pavilion, which embodies the concept of “Between Lives,” focusing on the relay and cycle of life. Its architecture and exhibition design explore themes of circulation, sustainability, and the interconnectedness of people, nature, and society. The pavilion also incorporates a biogas plant that processes food waste from the Expo grounds. TheKorea Pavilionexplores what Korean society may look like in 2040, focusing on values that endure over time and the convergence of cultural heritage with technological innovation. A fun activity requires visitors to record their voices, which are then transformed by AI into orchestral music, accompanied by synchronised light shows. This interactive experience symbolises unity and the blending of individual contributions into a collective harmony. TheKingdom of Saudi Arabia Pavilionis designed as a contemporary “village” that channels the spirit, textures, and urban fabric of traditional Saudi towns and cities. Visitors walk through winding alleyways and shaded courtyards. At the end of the tour, enjoy a cup of Saudi coffee that is infused with cardamom. TheBaltic Paviliondoesn’t boast any fancy architecture while featuring contributions from artists, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens of Latvia and Lithuania. There’s also an exhibit of around 300 plant specimens from Baltic meadows, highlighting their uses for health and well-being. But what’s more meaningful is the chance to plant a virtual tree, which will then be physically planted in the Baltic forests by professional foresters, demonstrating a tangible way Expo visitors can contribute to a greener future. TheBlue Ocean Domeis dedicated to the theme of sustainable use and revitalisation of the world’s oceans. It serves as both an architectural statement with its three domes each made from sustainable materials, such as bamboo and cardboard tubes, and an educational hub, aiming to inspire action on marine conservation and the reduction of plastic pollution. TheFuture City Pavilionrequires a reservation, and do choose the one that also allows you access to the participatory theatre. The pavilion offers 15 immersive experiences simulating life in a sustainable, technologically advanced city. What’s fun is visitors get to participate in creating their version of what the future may be like. TheOsaka Healthcare Pavilionblends futuristic healthcare technology, interactive experiences, and the spirit of Osaka innovation. Visitors can glimpse their future selves, engage with next-generation medical advances, and explore the evolving relationship between humans, machines, and society. This is also where visitors can view the Human Washing Machine, an evolved version of the famous 1970 Osaka Expo machine, now using fine bubbles and sensors to cleanse both body and mind. Expo 2025 also serves as a global stage for cutting-edge, experimental, and sustainable architecture, featuring bold designs from some of the world’s most influential architects and studios. The best thing is you can appreciate the architecture without having to queue. Here are some standouts. Designed by French architecture firm Coldefy in collaboration with Italian studio CRA-Carlo Ratti Associati, theFrance Paviliondraws the visitor in. Striking features include the helical copper-clad staircase that brings visitors into the exhibition space, that also doubles as an elevated viewing platform and gathering space, and the 17m high fabric curtains that move with the wind and light, animating the facade. TheQatar Pavilioncelebrates the country’s deep connection to the sea, its maritime heritage, and its vision for sustainable innovation and global partnership. Designed by Kengo Kuma & Associates, the pavilion’s form evokes a traditional Qatari dhow, a wooden sailing vessel, using a sweeping, scalloped timber structure draped in flowing white fabric, symbolising sails catching the breeze. ThePoland Pavilionis eye-catching for its striking wooden structure shaped like a dynamic wave, symbolising the spread of Polish creativity and innovation. Designed by Alicja Kubicka and Borja Martínez of Interplay ArchitectsIts, the pavilion’s organic form uses the traditional Japanese kigumi koho joinery technique, reflecting a dialogue between Polish and Japanese craftsmanship. TheSingapore Pavilionis a 17m tall red sphere, inspired by our Little Red Dot nickname. Designed by DP Architects, the exterior is covered with over 17,000 recycled aluminum discs, referencing Japan’s tradition of ema (votive tablets for wishes) and symbolising collective dreams and sustainability. It is hard not to be captivated by thenull2 Pavilion(pronounced \"nurunuru\"), created by Japanese media artist Yoichi Ochiai. The pavilion’s exterior is covered in a specially developed “mirror membrane”. This reflective surface constantly ripples and distorts, creating an ever-changing landscape and inviting visitors to contemplate the relationship between self, others, and the environment On certain days, theExpo Hallis opened for theatrical performances and concerts. Designed by Toyo Ito & Associates, the structure is better known by its nickname, “Shining Hat”, because of the building’s distinctive golden circular roof, which when seen from certain angles, appears to create a hole in the sky. When it comes toshopping, there is no shortage of items featuring the official mascot, Myaku-Myaku, a mysterious and shape-shifting creature, with a body made of red “cells” and blue “water,” symbolising life’s pulse and the continuous flow of wisdom, technology, and culture through generations. There are Myaku-Myaku stuffed dolls, sunglasses, snacks, artworks and even face masks. These are readily available at the official stores on site. Some of the country pavilions also have their retail section, as well as several other stores selling souvenirs and snacks. Visitors will not go hungry at the Expo, which offers bountifuldiningoptions. Several country pavilions have restaurants or cafes, offering visitors a sample of their cuisine. Keep an eye out for the separate queue to enter the restaurants and be prepared to wait in line. There are also food trucks and food courts, while popular Japanese chain restaurants, Sushiro and Kura, also have outlets on site. Part of the fun of attending a World Expo is collecting stamps from the pavilions. Purchase a Stamp Passport at the official Expo 2025 and visit each pavilion to collect a stamp. A special bonus stamp is available and changes with each month. Get a selfie with the life-sized Gundam at theGundam Next Future Pavilion. At 17m tall, the statue is displayed kneeling on one knee with its right arm raised high, symbolising reaching out to the universe and the future. The Japanese summer is harsh, and when you need to chill out, head toIce Cool Spot, an innovative, eco-friendly rest area that uses solar-powered ice thermal storage, or toForesting Architecture, pavilions which were created using state-of-the-art 3D printing technology with plant-based, biodegradable resin. TheExpo Arenais away from the pavilions, but worth checking out. It makes for a great picnic spot, and on certain days, it turns into an event space, complete with live music and food stalls.

In the men's 1500 metres, France's Azeddine Habz surged in the closing stages to beat former world champion Kenya's Timothy Cheruiyot. Habz won by three-hundredths of a second with a time of 3:29.72, while Cheruiyot finished in 3:29.75. American Trayvon Bromell claimed victory in the 100 metres, finishing in 9.84 seconds, while Tokyo Olympics high jump gold medallist Gianmarco Tamberi failed to reach the podium as South Korea's Woo Sanghyeok took the win with a jump of 2.32 metres.

Sinner beat Novak Djokovic 6-4 7-5 7-6(3) in a generational battle on Court Philippe Chatrier to deny his Serbian opponent a record 25th Grand Slam and leave him unsure whether he will ever return to Roland Garros, where he has won three major trophies. The 23-year-old Italian, who is seeking his fourth Grand Slam title, booked a mouth-watering meeting with his main rival Carlos Alcaraz, who will aim to retain his crown at Roland Garros and add a fifth major crown to his trophy cabinet. With Djokovic now the only active member of tennis' Big Four  that also included Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray and yielded a collective 69 major titles in more than two decades, Sinner sensed an opportunity for himself and Alcaraz.

    "title": "12 secluded resorts in Indonesia where you can truly leave it all behind",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences For your next getaway. (Photo: Lelewatu) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Gorgeous resorts have been sprouting in remote corners of Indonesia, offering sanctuary and privacy, combining unspoiled settings and contemporary comforts. Here are 12 to consider for your next getaway. This Indonesia’s first glamping resort was opened in 1993, way before the term became popular. It is nestled at the shore of Moyo Island, a protected nature reserve in Sumbawa, in between Lombok and Flores. The 349-sq-km jungle island has no roads, no vehicles, and no airports. Guests arrive by plane from Bali to Sumbawa Besar, followed by a 40-minute boat ride; or alternatively, by a chartered seaplane from Lombok and land surrounding the beach, where 17 white tented-camps designed by the legendary Jean-Michel Gathy are waiting to offer safari experience in a tropical wilderness. Due to its remoteness, Amanwana is favoured by some of the world’s top privacy seekers, from the late Princess Diana to Maria Sharapova. Every morning, the resort is visited by monkeys and in the afternoon, groups of deer grass around the tents. In between those visits, guest can go for snorkelling, diving, or trekking deep into the forest and showering under a pristine waterfall. aman.com Previously a tin mining centre, Belitung has transformed itself into a popular tourist destination — and the major change was uniquely driven by a single best-selling novel, Laskar Pelangi (The Rainbow Troops), which depicts a story of a group of students struggling with poverty. Not long after the novel was published in 2005, and then adapted to a movie, tourists flocked to the island, and soon hoteliers jumped on the opportunity. Arumdalu, tucked away in the southwest corner of Belitung, currently is the most premium (and expensive) accommodation on the island. Erected on a 40-hectare beachfront land, the resort’s only 10 pool villas are nicely concealed in between trees, a short walking distance from the 800-metre-long white sandy beach framed by massive granite rocks, a typical geological feature in Belitung. Take a kayak and paddle around the nearby shore to get a better view of the magnificent rock formation. arumdalubelitung.com Bawah, a group of unhabituated six islands in the Anambas archipelago, was merely a transit spot for fishermen and sailors. But then Tim Hartnoll came on a sailing trip, enchanted by its serene beauty, and envisioned a different future for the island clusters. Fast forward to 2017, the Singapore shipping magnate together with few fellow investors and architect Sim Boon Yang of Eco-id transformed Bawah into an almost Maldivian-style destination with 36 standalone suites, overwater bungalows, lodge and villas, plus four restaurants and bars helmed by executive chef Reynaldo DeLuna, an alumnus of Six Senses Yao Noi. Not long ago, Mr. Hartnoll addedmore accommodation offerings at Bawahby opening his private holiday home toclientsin big groups. Available for exclusive buyouts only, the Elang Private Residence is in a separate smaller island and has six cliffside lodges and a restaurant, all with private butler services. Bawah Reserve is connected to Batam by a 75-minute private seaplane flight. bawahreserve.com With proper infrastructure and wide range of facilities, including 19 properties, four golf courses, a man-made lagoon and shopping malls, Bintan Resorts in the northern part of Bintan has what it takes to cater to families. On the eastern corner of the island, nine kilometres off coast, Cempedak Private Island aims to offer a contrasting experience: Barefoot luxury in Robinson Crusoe charm. The adult-only, (minimum age is 15) 17-hectare island boasts 20 villas in tropical bamboo architecture, beautifully tucked within a rainforest. Each villa is divided into two floors, with a conscientious design that harmoniously blends indoor and outdoor, allowing natural airflow and eliminating the need for air conditioning. The ground level features a living space, a dining area, and a plunge pool. Above, a bathroom with hot water shower and a bedroom are smartly positioned to absorb the vista framedby the innovativecurve of thealang-alanggrass roof. Cempedak has been welcomingguestssince 2017. A year later, the spa was opened. The restaurant offers a daily-changing fixed menu and flexible dining configurations, from dining pods to balcony. cempedak.com Pacitan, a town locatedwithin a three-hourdrive from Yogyakarta, may not be a recognisable name among tourists. But for surfers, the southern regency of east Java Province has a special reputation for its rugged coastline and great waves — and Desa Limasan is one of their favourite surf bases here. The Javanese-style resort has six villas that fan out on a 6.5-hectare beachfront land facing the Watu Karung beach thathas rareboth left-hand and right-hand waves. Each villa was assembled from an old Javanese limasan house and teak woods, while its interior features a good selection of wooden furniture and ornaments. The owner, Roman Gerber, the father of Balinese surf legend Marlon Gerber, has hosted some of the world’s greatest professional surfers, including Kelly Slater, Gerry Lopez and Bruce Irons. Not long after Irons came here, Surf magazine reported his visit in an article entitled The Last Secret Spot. Well, it’s not so much a secret anymore. @desalimasanresort Out of more than 100 volcanoes scattered throughout Indonesia, Ijen in East Java stands out for its iconic blue fire, an eerie and deceptively beautiful burst of sulphur caused by the high temperatures from the underground volcanic heat. Perched on a scenic highland 26km from the magical craters, Ijen Resort has been long known as one of the favourite hiking bases among tourists. The resort’s 45 rooms and bungalows, restaurant and photogenic pool are beautifully set overlooking a mesmerising terrace rice field with mountains as its backdrop. Staying here, time slows down. Morning is always a magical moment, while the night promises a deep sleep accompanied by the sound of crickets. The resort’s owner initially planned to build this property in Ubud but decided to move the project to Ijen to bring tourism to an area rarely known by tourist at that time. ijenresortandvillas.com The three main destinations in Lombok have their own stereotypes: Gili is for party, Senggigi for family, while Kuta for surfers and honeymooners. And then you have Jeeva Beloam, which is located way outside the tourist circuits in the secluded southeast corner of the island. This hideout resort is so remote that it has no neighbours (the closest hotel is 20km away), no crowds, and almost no noise, apart from the strong wind and waves that wash over the crescent-shaped white sandy beach. Looking to lure holidaymakers who are looking for discreet luxury and privacy (Australian Miss Universe 2004 Jennifer Hawkins was here), the beachfront resort features only 11 lodges — or beach camps to be precise — made of recycled wood and bamboo, shaded byalang-alangroofs, handsomely designed as a creative interpretation of local barn.For maximumsolitude, opt for the Solas lodge located at the corner of the complex, right under the hill, overlooking the narrow Alas Strait separating Lombok from Sumbawa. jeevaresorts.com Opening Indonesia’s diving map, you would probably not discover Sape in the eastern part of Bima. Most people come here to see the famous traditional horse race instead of fishes and corals. But things have changed since 2016 when Kalimaya opened on its shore and put this obscure region on the world’s diving radars. The beachfront resort has seven rustic bungalows made of teak and mahogany woods, sheltered byalang-alangroof. The restaurant is connected to an infinity pool, facing the sea and Komodo island on the horizon. Run by divers and dedicated to divers, Kalimaya has a dive centre that regularly organises a tour exploring the surrounding underwaters (there are 40 dive spots in the area), including a visit to the Sangeang Island, an infamous market zone for pirates in the olden days but now a popular transit point for luxury cruises sailing from Bali to Flores. Kalimaya will require some effort to get to but it promises a memorable off-the-beaten-track experience. kalimayadiveresort.com Some dubbed it “Maldives with no tourism.” Not entirely true, of course. Karimunjawa, an archipelago of 27 islands in the Java Sea, is a popular holiday destination for locals, and has long been on the transit map of the Sail Indonesia event. However, as there is only one five-star international resort, it still has more fishes and coconut trees than beach goers. Founded in 1999 by a Swedish hotelier, Kura Kura Resort was instrumental in putting Karimunjawa on the global tourists’ radar. It started with five humble cottages, and now there are 15 of them, plus additional 19 well-appointed pool villasunder the new management. Island hopping and scuba diving are the two main activities on offer. Out of the 27 islands in Karimunjawa, only five are inhabited, while the rest are protected as part of the national park. For an ultimate island getaway, consider the Cast Away package where you can go to a separate small island and stay at a cottage without electricity. Weather-wise, a good time to visit is between April and June, while the best season is between September and October where you might encounter whale sharks. kurakuraresort.com Initially only attracting affluent surfers and anthropologists, Sumba Island, famously known for its megalithic culture, strong waves and annual equestrian war games of Pasola, hasbecomea new luxury hotspot for holidaymakers. More and more resorts are opening here, including Lelewatu, which is located on a handsome cliff facing the Indian Ocean in the southwest part of the island. Designed by Popo Danes Architect, the celebrated firm behind some of Bali’s most iconic properties, including Hanging Gardens and Kaba Kaba Estate, Lelewatu features 27 one-to-four-bedroom villas. The design inspiration comes from the Sumbanese vernacular housesofuma mbatangu. In between the towering, thatched roofs andwoodendecks, each villafeatures a privatepool with interior beautifully decorated by local crafts. Bokosawu, the only restaurant in the resort, serves in-house guests only, while the Maraga Spa offers rare Sumba-inspired treatments. lelewatu.com Nestled in the middle of Dutch colonial coffee plantation in Java highland, in between the majestic Borobudur temple and the bustling Central Java capital city of Semarang, MesaStila is a hidden sanctuary that dedicates itself to rejuvenate your mind and body. It has more than 40 different weekly wellness activities tochoose from, from yoga to cycling to therapy packages designed to deal with differenttypesof urban syndromes, including sleeping and eating disorders. The resort’s kitchen team is well equipped to tailor each therapy with the appropriate daily nutrition plan. (While delivering healthy meals or jamu to your villa, the butler will wait patiently to make sure you consume all the prescribed menu in the programme.) Make sure to check the authentic Turkish hammam, which offers steam bathing, body mask, and traditional massage. MesaStila, a massive 22-hectare resort, was opened as Losari Coffee Plantation by an Italian couple. It changed its name in 2011 under the new owner. The heritage coffee plantation is still producing beans, and there’s a unique way to visit it: Ride a horse andstopat a rustic stall to sip a hot cup of joe while chewing on locallyproducedbrown sugar. mesastilaresortandspa.com Seraya Kecil checks all the boxes of a perfect island in Flores: Short sabana hill, white powder sandy beach, turquoise sea, and mesmerising corals housing colourful fishes and baby sharks. In 2018, a charming rustic resort run by a local chain well-known for its good taste of amenities and exemplar services opened on the island. Located in the north part of Labuan Bajo, away from the crowd and busy marina, Sudamala Seraya is a quiet base to explore the Komodo National Park. The resort’s 23 stilt white bungalows blend nicely with the landscape. The largest category, Seraya Panorama Villa, has two-bedroom, a plunge pool and a private deck with 270-degree views of the ocean. The room rate includes various activities, including kayaking and snorkelling. In the afternoon, guests can hike at the lovely hill behind the resort to enjoy a beautiful sunset in the “Jurassic Park” of Indonesia. sudamalaresorts.com Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann PARIS :     Referees wearing body cameras and an upgraded offside detection system will be among the headline innovations at this year’s Club World Cup in the United States, FIFA said on Friday. For the first time at a FIFA tournament, match officials will wear body cameras, with selected footage broadcast live to audiences. A new, advanced version of semi-automated offside technology — combining Artificial Intelligence, multiple cameras, and ball sensors — will be deployed to speed up decision-making while maintaining VAR oversight for marginal calls. \"However, for challenging offside scenarios, the video assistant referee will still validate the information provided by the system before the decision is taken,\" FIFA said in a statement. The tournament, which expands to 32 teams this year, will serve as a major testing ground for both systems, the governing body said.

    "title": "US$70 a photo, no problem: Vintage vibes of peel-apart film charm Chinese youths",
    "article_text": "East Asia East Asia The long-discontinued type of instant film is staging a modern comeback in China, with celebrities hopping on the bandwagon and photo businesses cashing in on the retro hype. A customer (left) develops her peel-apart photo after getting her shot taken at Moyu Photo Lab, a photo studio in Beijing, on Jun 2, 2025. (Photo: CNA/Hu Chushi) BEIJING: It’s a delicate and manual process, with no second take. No guarantees on quality as well - in fact, unpredictability is a signature trait. Also, it costs a pretty penny - upwards of several hundred yuan per shot. A long-discontinued type of instant film currently seen as the preserve of photography enthusiasts, peel-apart film has been staging a modern comeback in China, driven by celebrity recommendations alongside a broader youthful embrace of nostalgia. Photo businesses have also sought to cash in on the youth-centred hype, marketing the scarcity of peel-apart film and offering their services for a premium. Some are also offering bells and whistles, such as hair styling and make-up, to sweeten the deal.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners.Loading The hefty prices didn’t put off Hu Wengji, 20, a Chinese second-year university student in Shenzhen. She got her peel-apart photos snapped in January, joining a crowd of young Chinese embracing the retro photo format. “I took three photos - one for myself, one for my friend, and one including both of us. Three photos cost me more than 900 yuan (US$125),” she told CNA. A form of instant photography, peel-apart film was introduced in 1947 by Polaroid founder Edwin Land. As the name suggests, it is developed by manually peeling apart the positive and negative prints after a photo is taken. Also known as packfilm, its popularity waned as more convenient instant photography formats like integral film emerged. The rise of digital photography left it further in the dust. But the vintage photography format has been enjoying a renaissance in China in recent months. The term “si la pian”, meaning “peel-apart film” in Chinese, has been trending on Chinese social media platforms like Xiaohongshu and Weibo, racking up millions of views. A search by CNA on these platforms found numerous posts of users showcasing their peel-apart film portraits. According to local news reports, people have been taken by its analogue charm and visual unpredictability. The film must be pulled out of the camera by hand before being peeled apart to reveal the photo. Mess this up, and the shot risks being irreversibly ruined. The development process also yields a distinct, vintage aesthetic - worlds apart from the polished, clean-edged images emblematic of digital photography. The trend has garnered extensive coverage from local news outlets. Many have highlighted how celebrities have been driving the buzz. In late April, Chinese actress and singer Ju Jingyi posted images of her peel-apart film photo shoot on Weibo, where she has more than 31 million followers. The post received more than 1 million likes. Fellow Chinese actress Liu Shishi and the immensely popular Taiwanese singer-actress Ouyang Nana are among the many other celebrities who have publicly embraced peel-apart film. But jumping on the bandwagon isn’t cheap. Major producers Polaroid and Fujifilm discontinued their peel-apart film in 2008 and 2016 respectively. This means all existing stock is limited and expired, and can only be found on the secondary market. And prices have gone up exponentially as the stock level goes down. Checks by CNA on Chinese secondhand marketplace Xianyu found Fujifilm’s popular FP-100c being listed at prices ranging from 1,600 yuan to 3,000 yuan for a 10-pack. The more recent the manufacturing date, the higher the price tag due to the lower risk of quality degradation. Before it was discontinued in 2016, the film retailed for a fraction of the price, typically around US$10 to US$20 for a box of 10. In a nod to its high cost, netizens have coined the term “zhipian maotai”, or “paper moutai” in Chinese, to describe peel-apart film, referring to the hallmark Chinese liquor that can itself retail for more than double its average price of 1,500 yuan, taking Kweichow Moutai’s flagship product Flying Fairy as an example. Photo studios have seized on the peel-apart film trend, with marketing centred on this sense of scarcity and vintage luxury. “Pai yi zhang, shao yi zhang” goes their refrain, loosely translated to “take one shot, lose one shot” - referencing how every photo taken eats into a finite peel-apart film trove. In a bid to reel in customers, photo studios in cities like Hangzhou and Chengdu offer packages that provide added services such as hair styling, make-up and framing, according to Chinese news site Shanghai Daily. And it’s clear why they’re gunning for a slice of the peel-apart pie - profit. Moyu Photo Lab, a Beijing photo studio located in the trendy neighbourhood of Sanlitun, opened in May last year and began offering peel-apart film photography four months later. While customers seeking such services currently make up just 10 per cent of overall clients, they account for more than half of the store’s revenue, its owner Xu Huan, 30, told CNA. Most of them are aged between 18 and 25. Moyu Photo Lab offers three peel-apart film options. A monochrome shot costs 149 yuan a piece, a colour photo sets you back 459 yuan, while a colour photo taken using the Polaroid Big Shot - a popular camera model from the 1970s - costs 499 yuan. The studio has raised prices twice over the past eight months. The rate was initially around 300 yuan for a photo taken with the Big Shot, before being hiked to just under 400 yuan in February. “With the recent surge in demand and rising (peel-apart) film costs, we had no choice but to raise prices again to just under 500 yuan a shot,” Xu said. The store offers test shoots where photos are taken with a digital camera for the customer to size up the shot. Before the actual shoot, customers are informed that the store is not responsible for how the photo turns out, and reshoots are not provided. Hu, the university student, had reservations during her shoot. “I was slightly concerned about how the photo would turn out, because the film used was out of date, and the chemicals would not be as stable. I was also worried about my gestures and facial expressions,” she said. While she enjoyed the experience, Hu views it as a one-off event. “I will not do it again, because I do not want to pay for the film at a premium like this. About two years ago, it only cost 150 yuan for a photo,” she said. “When you’re capturing a very meaningful moment or taking a photo with a significant other, but you’re worried about the high cost or concerned too much about the image quality, it somewhat loses the meaning of commemorating and recording.” The revival of peel-apart film in China has been linked to a broader global trend embracing nostalgia experiences, permeating sectors like fashion, music and technology. Vintage ensembles have come back into vogue, sales of cassette tapes and vinyl records have surged, and yesteryear gadgets like flip phones, iPods and Walkmans are being reintroduced. Tamagotchi, the egg-shaped toy housing a virtual pet that was hugely popular among children and teenagers in the 1990s,has made a roaring return, albeit with modern bells and whistles. In China, the newfound youth crush for peel-apart film comes after similar viral comebacks for other retro tech like charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and older iPhone models. “The unique imaging effect of peel-apart film has attracted significant attention from young people and quickly spread through social platforms, creating a retro trend phenomenon that has further stimulated market demand,” Jiang Han, a senior researcher at the Pangoal Institution think tank, told local media site China News Service. But how long will the fad last? Uncle Wang, the independent photographer, believes the peel-apart film trend has a limited shelf life. “Once all the celebrities and influencers have tried it, the trend will probably fade,” he said. Still, he thinks demand for Polaroid and traditional film will remain due to a “steady fanbase”. Xu, the photo studio owner, shares this sentiment. He believes the retro aesthetic trend will “continue indefinitely”. “Polaroids, film and peel-apart film each offer unique imaging effects and the fun of analogue photography,” he said. “As long as film supplies are available, enthusiasts will keep it alive.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

There are a lot of watches on the market these days, but you tend to hear about some of them more than others. That isn't, of course, a knock on unquestionable grails like theCartier TankandRolex Submariner, which have more than earned their places among the most iconic watches of all time. But in certain circles—and, uh, corners of the internet—their ubiquitydoesrob them of some of their surprise-and-delight value. Fortunately for anyone looking for an alternative to the usual suspects from thebig Swiss luxury brands, there’s a whole world of timepieces out there that are as startlingly original as they are oddly slept-on. These are the ones we're eyeballing right now. The Submariner earned its reputation on the wrists of serious undersea explorers in the 1960s and ‘70s. The full-gold Yacht-Master, by comparison, is best known as the watchDavid and Victoria Beckham wore for their engagement shoot in 1998. Does this make the Yacht-Master any less of a Rolex than the much-coveted Sub? It does not. Does it make it just ateeensybit more fun? Heck yes, it does. Rolex Bezel When your siblings are as famous as theSeamasterandSpeedmasterit can be tough to stand out, and that’s been the story of Omega’s perennially slept-on Railmaster since it launched in 1957. This 2017 reissue, however, demands to be appreciated. With the vintage charms of the original (check the “broad arrow” hands and clean 3-6-9 dial) and Omega’s modern co-axial Master Chronometer movement, it’s the definition of a sleeper. Omega Bezel This Parisianmaisonmight be best known for its saddles, Birkins, andties, but its watch lineup has been on a steady heater in recent years. Among the most tempting offerings from the gang at 24 Faubourg Saint Honoré is the titanium H08, a stylish—and characteristically whimsical—answer to a sea of uninspired sports watches. Hermès Bezel The world’s oldest watchmaker isn’t prone to hyperbole, so when they call something the “Ultra-Fine,” you’d better believe it’s going to be hot. Thissleek square ticker, which is part of the brand’s Historiques line of archival re-issues, lives up to its name more than half a century after it first hit the streets. Vacheron Constantin Bezel Abraham Louis Breguet was the godfather of high-end watchmaking, and the brand that bears his name still cranks out some absolute bangers. The Classique is an exercise in 19th-century old-school cool, from thegrand feuenamel dial—an age-old technique that produces an incredibly rich sheen—to Breguet’s eponymous hands and numerals. Those who know know, and now you can be one of them. Breguet Bezel Franck Muller watches are a bit likeWes Anderson moviesor the oeuvre of the Dave Matthews Band—you kind of have to love ‘em or hate ‘em. As with Wes Anderson, Muller has a very specific aesthetic signature of barrel-shaped cases and funky art nouveau numerals that might not be everyone’s cup of tea. Like Dave Matthews’ greatest hits, however, if you spend enough time with it—and this yellow-gold Casablanca is no exception—you’re probably going to end up a fan. Franck Muller Bezel With a legion of diehard fans, including many members of the watch Illuminati, A Lange & Söhne isn’t exactly underrated, but it still deserves more recognition than it gets. To understand what makes the Lange 1 such a flex requires a fair bit of extremely nerdy horological lingo, but here’s the gist of it: Lange creates watches on par with, or even better than, Patek Philippe, but does it in much smaller quantities and with much less fanfare. The Lange 1 is where it all started, and wearing one is nigh guaranteed to win you a nod of approval from your most watch-obsessed friends. A Lange & Söhne Bezel Breitling makes a lot ofnice chronographs, but most of them tend to be on the chunky side, with cases in the range of 40mm-plus. If you’re in the market for a classic chrono with more diminutive proportions, the discontinued Transocean lineup offers a bunch of excellent alternatives, including this 38mm specimen. Breitling Bezel Daytona, schmaytona. Sure, sure, the Rolex Daytona is the world\u0000\u0000’smost coveted chronograph, but the humble El Primero offers a very similar makeup with arguably more historical street cred. Not only was Zenith the first brand to build a modern chronograph, but its movements were so renowned that Rolex used them in the Daytona for more than a decade. Zenith Bezel It’s not a hot take to suggest that this collab between one of the world’s top watch brands and the Formula One GOAT deserves a much better name than the “Speedmaster Reduced Michael Schumacher.” Its ungainly name, however (which is a reference to its 39mm case size), doesn’t take anything away from the watch’s absolutely smoldering Ferrari-red dial. Omega Bezel Luxury watches that show off impressive movements through their dials are very much a thing these days, and most of them—if we’re being completely frank—do not look better for it. This is an exception. Instead of flexing a big ol’ tourbillon and a bunch of complicated-looking parts, the 7057 keeps things tight with a dial that’s both highly readable and mesmerizing to look at. Breguet Bezel Despite its vague resemblance to the iconic Cartier Tank, the Reverso is very much its own thing, with a unique swiveling case initially intended to protect it from flying polo balls. Add to that a timeless art deco design and a movement courtesy of one of Switzerland’s most respected makers, and you have the makings of an underrated classic. Jaeger-LeCoultre Bezel",

    "title": "11 Best Linen Shorts for Men 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Sometimes, it’s so damn hot that even theshortest of shortsaren’t enough to keep cool. That’s where linen—and, more, specifically, thebestlinen shorts for men—enters the picture. Linen is one of the oldest clothing materials in the world, prized for its durability, breeziness, and rakish rumpled texture. (Fun fact: linen fibers are actuallyhollow, which is why it cools so well.) These days, designers use it to summer-ize everything fromsuitstoshirts—and shorts are no exception. But a good pair of linen shorts does more than simply keep you cool. The natural rumpling and airy drape add all manner of visual interest to your warm-weather fits, which is key when you’re working with fewer layers and less coverage. They’re OOO essentials, sure—great when paired with a breezy linen shirt andchic sandals—but don’t limit yourself. Try them with a graphic tee and beat-upcanvas sneakersfor a grungy SoCal vibe, or dress them up with a polo, loafers, and snazzy linen blazer. The point? Linen is surprisingly versatile, which is why we’ve done the heavy task of wading through a sea of linen shorts to find the only versions worth your dollars. Banana Republic Banana Republic What we look for in a great pair of linen shorts comes down to materials, construction, fit, versatility, and pricepoint. Banana Republic has it all. The all-linen material is silky, lightweight, and drapes elegantly. Construction is solid as a rock. Fit is roomy but classic and hits right at the mid-thigh (and is available in ashorter, non-pleated version). While we love a free-and-easy, elastic waist for linen shorts, it can be limiting, stylistically. That’s why we prefer the fixed waist of these Banana Republic shorts (not to mention the pleated front). It allows them to be styled with dressier items like button-up shirts or even with a light blazer. And for well under a hundred bucks, there ain’t a better linen short. Uniqlo Uniqlo Maybe you’ve got your wallet on a strict diet or you just don’t see the need to invest too deeply into something as seasonal as linen shorts. Whatever your reason, budget is higher on your priority list and we’ll point you straight over to Uniqlo’s Easy Shorts which are a whopping thirty bucks. They fit like a classic pair of Patagonia Baggies, which is to sayperfect. They have an elastic waistband, two front pockets and a single rear pocket (everything you need, nothing you don’t). We would prefer it if these were made of 100% linen, but for such a low price point, Uniqlo makes them in a cotton-linen blend and that’s a compromise we’re willing to make. Alex Mill Alex Mill If you want an elevated, upgraded pair of linen shorts, the fabric should be a noticeable step up and Alex Mill’s Daniel shorts deliver in that department. The linen is undoubtedly more substantial, has that characteristic sheen and, perhaps counterintuitively, rumples more than it wrinkles which is a sign of a better linen. Natural corozo nut buttons and French seams let you know that the higher quality doesn’t end with the fabric, too. We love the relaxed silhouette and double pleats, but we have two concerns.The first is that the wider belt loops might be off-putting to some (though we think that’s the charm). The other is that we think Alex Mill is phasing them out. The upside to that is that they’re on a massive discount, so you’d better act fast. Alex Crane Alex Crane Just because gym shorts are technically “casual shorts” doesn’t mean youshouldwear them as part of your day-to-day fits. Now, linen shorts are inherently casual, but if you don’t need your shorts to pass muster at a fancy establishment, Alex Crane’s Bo shorts are the perfect everyday linen shorts. These drawstring-waist joints are a no-frills option that does away with any extraneous details like pleats, extra pockets. They’re made of 100% French linen which has an incredible drape and lightness. They hit right at the mid-thigh and are relaxed without veering into Y2K baggy territory, so they’re right at home with a tee or a button-up in equal measure. Oh, and they come in just about every shade imaginable, which means you can find something that works with your personal style. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Holidays are meant for relaxing, not worrying, and rather than packing eight different pants for every possible situation, it’s a whole lot less stressful to bring a pair of shorts that can do as much as possible. Todd Snyder’s all linen Beachcomber shorts are the platonic ideal of a vacation short. The elastic waist let’s you know they’re made for bumming out on a beach, the belt loops let you dress them up should you need to fit in at a nice restaurant, and the luxe linen has more structure than other linens meaning they’ll actually wrinkle less. Rarely has a garment embodied the beach to bar lifestyle as well as this one does. Stone Island SSENSE If the whole idea of linen shorts feels a little too “boy band on the beach”, cargo shorts will change your mind. They feel sportier, hipper, and a little more down to earth than the usual vacation-ready linen shorts. And who better do make a linen cargo short than the sportswear legends at Stone Island? The British label’s cargo shorts are made from a thicker, “diagonal twill” linen, Stone Island’s Ghost cargo shorts manage to take a rustic, old-world fabric and make them feel sporty. With sleek cargo pockets at the side, a clean welt pocket at the rear, and an easy elastic waistband, these drawstring shorts can pack in your keys, wallet, and many vices in one sleek package. COS COS Polo Ralph Lauren Ralph Laren Rick Owens Mr Porter Buck Mason Buck Mason Colbo SSENSE Comme des Garçons SSENSE Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, theflyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "14 Best Dress Shorts for Men 2025: The Sharpest Shorts You'll Wear All Summer",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Dress shorts, we'll grant you, used to be a bit of an oxymoron. These days, most of your favorite pants are readily available in summer-ready form: khakis, sweats, hell, evenjeans. And yet, the specific type of breezycapital-T Trousersall over the runway—and on the shelves of your local big-box brand—haven't had much in the way of warm-weather counterparts … until now. This is a huge relief: If you’re going to lunch on vacation, or spending the day at a beach club, or if you’ve got friends with a place upstate (lucky you), you’re really going to need a pair of shorts that weren’t made for the gym. That's where the best dress shorts for men come in. As for how to wear the style, there are two paths to take, best embodied perhaps by two of the most stylish men working in fashion today: Thom Browne and Rick Owens. The Thom route is neatly tailored with an abbreviated fit, designed to be worn with a button down or classic sweatshirt. The Rick route is more oversized, less structured, and cut to a longer length, to wear with tees or loose layers. Either way, you don’t want anything too tight: nothing undermines a dressy look faster than the sight of a visibly straining seam. As for fabrics, don’t overthink it. Cottons, linens, and lightweight wools are stalwarts for a reason. COS COS As a general all-rounder, this pair is hard to beat. Made by COS (the better made, dare we say better designed offering from the H&M group), it ticks a lot of the boxes you’ll need from a pair of smart shorts: a fit that’s tailored but not clingy, a lightweight and grown up fabrication, and a colour that’ll pair well with both the smart and summery ends of your closet. The drawstring waist gives them a slightly more relaxed feel, but these would still work perfectly with an unstructured linen jacket, or a gently oversized shirt. To make them feel smart enough for summer cocktails, wear them with a pair of Derbys and black socks. Hey, if you’re feeling particularly “menswear”, you could even swap in a pair of backless loafers. Gap Gap If you don’t want to spring for a fully tailored pair, it’s best to keep it simple. Look for something flat-fronted, mid-length, and made from linen, and you’ll be unlikely to go wrong. This affordable example comes from GAP, but squint and they could be made by a contemporary Scandi brand. They sit a little lower on the waist, which should influence your choice of clothing: Make sure a T-shirt, polo, or button-down is long enough to cover the belt loops, or you’ll risk an unsightly sliver of belly showing. Whatever you choose, leave it untucked, or French-tucked, to avoid looking like a Boy Scout. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Boasting a 7-inch inseam, this is one of the shortest options on our list, so it's perfect for those wanting to show a little more leg. For what it’s worth, Prada revived short-shorts a couple of years ago, and they’ve steadily regained popularity with menswear heads who are bored of baggier clothes. (If you’ve got the thighs for them, we’d advise going for it.) This pair also has the option of a matching tailored jacket, which is cut to a generous, slightly boxy fit. And even if you don’t spring for the jacket, we’d recommend following the same principle – look for more relaxed shapes up top, to keep the look modern. Just make sure that the length of your top doesn’t extend past the hem of your shorts. Stòffa Stòffa At the upper end of the dress shorts echelon sits this pair, from the reliably elegant New York brand Stòffa. Made in a mix of cotton and linen, they’re cut to a shorter, wider shape, which gives them a roomier fit around the thigh. In practice, it means they’ll look that much fancier than a regular pair of shorts – especially as they’re finished with an attached belt. Stòffa is known for consideringeven the smallest detailsof its products, and this pair is no exception. You can even select up front how you’d like the brand to hem them for you. For what it’s worth, we’d recommend the plain hem, to match their minimal design. Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Generally with shorts, it’s best to look for design details that are rooted in classic menswear, to avoid them looking over-designed. (After all, the whole point of shorts is to look breezy.) This Polo Ralph Lauren pair is a perfect example of how to incorporate a little sartorial flair: Their double front pleats and side adjusters give them the flavour of classic styles from the 1940s. As such, they carry a sophistication that makes them a perfect choice for semi-formal summer parties. Slim fit tees, linen shirts, and even a summer blazer would all partner well here. As for footwear, we’d stick to the classics: a pair of Weejuns or leather sandals if you’re going smarter, or canvas plimsolls if not. Auralee Mohawk General Store Arguably, no-one makes (or wears) shorts like the Japanese. Auralee, in particular, has mastered the balance between stylish and relaxed that every great pair of shorts needs. If you prefer baggier pants and avoid anything too slim-fit, this should be the pair for you. The added benefit of a longer length? They’re easy to smarten up. While running errands, you could wear these with Chucks and a baggy tee – but for drinks, swap in a pair of leather shoes, throw over a striped button-down, tidy up the beard, and you’re all set. Alex Mill Alex Mill An often under-appreciated element of summer dressing is that it needs to feel as low-effort as possible. Who wants complicated clothing in hot weather? With that in mind, a pair of pull-on linen shorts is about as low-fuss as it’s possible to get, while still looking smart. It helps that this pair, from US brand Alex Mill, is designed with enough polish to do the hard work for you: the flax linen gives texture and surface interest, while the patch pockets make them feel more ‘designed’. Wear them with almost any of your summer shirts, and feel good about making no more effort than that.

    "title": "Benson Boone Was Inspired to Backflip by This Unlikely Person",
    "article_text": "I had one question on my mind for Benson Boone: Sir, why are you always doing backflips? But the 22-year-old chart-topping artist behind the hit “Beautiful Things” was running late to our interview. I couldn’t blame him. Boone, as his publicist explained to me in an email, was “literally doing a flip.” You see, backflipping has become Boone’s schtick, a staple for quite possibly every performance he’s ever done since his days onAmerican Idol. Why and how did he learn? It turns out the talent runs in his family. “My dad does flips—ordid,” Boone, who’s partnering with Armani Beauty to support the launch of Stronger With Youparfum, tellsGQ. “I saw him do a backflip at a family barbecue. He did it off the neighbor’s balcony, and I was like ‘Hell yeah, dad, I’m gonna try that.’ And I was like four, so I just sent one off my couch, and it actually went surprisingly well.” He tells us he’s been doing backflips everywhere since then, and he’s not lying. He did it (more than once) when he was themusical guestonSaturday Night Livein May. The sacredThe Tonight Showdesk was alsoa prime locationfor a flip on Wednesday. And we’d put money that he does it at least five times when he’s co-headliningGovernors Ballin front of 150,000 music lovers this weekend—even if that crowd size is bigger than he’s used to. “I was doing one of my first shows, I think it might have been in L.A., and it was a really, really, really tiny venue—maybe 100 people,” he says. “I was so new to performing. I had no idea what to do to entertain a crowd, so I was like ‘I could backflip.’ And I did a backflip, and then over the couple of small shows I would do a couple [backflips], and people were like, ‘I love the backflips!’ And so I just kept doing them until it turned into a bigger thing.” “Bigger thing” these days means the countless memes of Boone backflipping in random situations, a phenomenon that may have even helped him sell out his upcoming arena tour for his sophomore albumAmerican Heart, due out on June 20. For the better half of 2025, Boone will be backflipping his way across 51 shows between North America and Europe. Will he ever stop defying gravity, the same way his dad did? “Hopefully someday,” Boone says. “I don’t think I want to do backflips forever, you know?”",

    "article_text": "Bryce Young is aware that many people view him, and every other football player, as emotionless, gladiator figures. As a Carolina Panthers quarterback who has won a Heisman and was once a number one overall draft pick, discussing his mental health can be taboo. But Young, 23, is part of a new generation of athletes who no longer fear the backlash of admitting when they’re not okay. Professional football is a beast that the general public cannot possibly comprehend fully, but Young wants fans of all ages to know that beneath every helmet is a human who likely struggles with the same thing they do. During this most recent season (his second in the league), Young made strides by doubling his win total, upping his touchdown-to-interception ratio, and shoring up some rookie fumble issues. Most notably, he went from being sacked 62 times in 2023 to just 29 last year, something that eased the physical burden of the job. As he gears up for his third NFL season, Young is hosting a football camp in Charlotte, North Carolina, where kids can learn ball from an NFL starting quarterback—and the value of mental health awareness. “We make sure that we can weave in some strategies, have some conversations, just get the kids familiar with mental health, give them some small little tokens,” Young explained. “Also, we'll have a portion for the parents as well, which is something that we believe is super important.” In a recent sit-down withGQ,Young got into the mental health spirals he often runs into, the challenges of losing, and trying to live truthfully. GQ: People only really talk about mental health when someone's having an issue with it, or when someone goes public with their struggle. But mental health as a concept is part of being alive. It’s almost like talking about breathing, you know what I mean? Bryce Young:I think that's a great way to put it. Mental health has such a negative connotation because, like you said, when you think of mental health, people traditionally think of the struggles. Mental health is something that's ongoing, it's good, it's bad, it's up, it's down. It's something that we all are dealing with. Having more conversations about it, I think we'll realize that it's not all bad. It's not negative. It's just something that we all live with. It's the same as our physical health. The more we can have conversations, especially with the youth, hopefully we can continue to normalize it. Once people start to be more aware of their own mental health, it can lead to eitherOh, I'm hyperfocused on this now, or,I’m going to ignore it, and not think about it at all. One of the things about mental health is that there's so many tools, and so much to discuss, but ultimately everyone has to decide things for themselves. No two people are alike. Everyone can find what works for them and what their routine is to maintain something healthy. A lot of people have talked about how they feel like mental health is so daunting. I think the more that people share you understand that there're so many different ways of navigating things. What led you to focus on mental health? Mental health is something that just is in my family. My dad was an MFT [marriage and family therapist] and a school counselor. My aunt and sister, same thing, counselor and a therapist. My grandfather was in the mental health space. Being able to have so many relationships—from sports and outside of sports—you grow up, you hear everyone else's disposition towards mental health, and you see how varying it is. There's a lot of uncomfortability. Especially earlier on, you just see how it can affect everyone's life, a lot of times without people knowing it or seeing it. That was something that I've always had a lens for. But the more that I was able to interact, especially with teammates, the more I felt called to, hopefully, make it a lot more accessible.

In the NFL there’s a huge stigma around appearing mentally weak, especially for quarterbacks. Was there any ​​hesitation on your part to speak up about this, because you didn't want to be perceived a certain way? There’s definitely been a big stigma around [discussing mental health in] athletics for a long time. For me, I like to deal and live in the truth. I'm super grateful to have my profession. I'm super passionate about it, but we're all human. People, a lot of times, think that we don't have the same struggles, we don't deal with the same things. Our lives, at times, maybe can look different from others, but it's all a set of circumstances. The makeup of who we are, what we go through from an emotional level, it’s all the same. You were a top high school recruit, then you went to the football factory at Alabama, won the Heisman, first overall pick in the NFL Draft. I think it would be easy for people on the outside to be like, “Oh well, his life is perfect.” Yeah, for sure. Especially when I was younger, that was something that was always in the front of my mind. I'm blessed to have the path that I've had. There's a lot of things behind the scenes that went into that, of course. I always felt like I didn't have any right to complain, or any right to feel a certain way. I didn't have the right to be down. Ultimately when stuff like that would happen, it would make things worse. I would try to minimize real-life things that everyone goes through, and try to suppress emotions. That's one of the restrictions that I made growing up. It's not one or the other. You can be dealing with something, you can have an emotion, you can feel upset, angry, sad, whatever it is, and you can accept that and still be grateful. It's not,Oh, how is this happening to me? Why was it me? There's nothing going on in my life, or,I'm perfectly fine. Everything's working.You can be both. That's something that I've learned, and I definitely try to impress on others. Your mind is just so powerful in everything that you do. What does the struggle look like for you? It's a shift in mindset of “Man, I'm selfish because I'm going to try to take care of myself,” or, “Man, it's weak to try to be thinking of yourself instead of just blindly giving your all to a team.” But in reality, it's the opposite. It's selfish if you'renottaking care of yourself. That shift of mindset, again, it's something I'm still working on. Being a competitor, I feel like we're always taught to be our toughest critics. I'm always hard on myself. For me, it's just finding that balance and making sure that I'm doing everything on the field and holding myself to the highest standard. To be the player that I want to be for myself—and for the team—but also doing it in a way that's sustainable and healthy. Do you have any tangible things that you do when you find yourself in a bad mood? I'm big on breath control and focusing on your breath. Breathing is so powerful, both physically and mentally. That's just centering for me. Then, meditation is definitely a tool that I use when I have more time. It's something that's helped me a lot. I remember feeling like I didn't know what I was doing, didn't know what was going on, not being sure if [football] was for me. I feel like I've grown a lot in that space, and [meditation] is something that, again, has allowed me to center myself. Do you see a therapist, a sports psychologist, anyone like that? Yeah, I got super lucky. We have a really good sports psychologist in Carolina,Dr. [Joanne] Perry. She's amazing. Having someone that understands that stuff that you can express things to is always super helpful. Do you have access to other things at the Panthers’ facility that you feel like has had an impact on your mental health? For me, it’s more physical. I know people who, even though they're getting physical stuff done, it's a form of [mental health] treatment. It can still be a space where you’re like, “Even though I'm going to go and [physically recover]with this red light, everything's down. I get my alone time. I get time to reset.” I try my best to compartmentalize. I'll do that a lot with location too. So stuff that's physical and stuff that happens at the stadium. The stadium, that's me. That's the quarterback, that’s work, that's all in. I try to leave everything at the stadium. Leave work at work. When I do leave, that's where I try to separate myself. Have you had any older players come to you and be like, “Hey, thank you for saying this. This has changed my perspective on mental health?” There's an older player, I won't say the name, that had played in the league for a while. It was actually really cool. I had a couple of conversations, and the first one was very curious and very like, “Back in my time, you couldn't really talk about these things.” I ended up seeing them again, having the conversation come back up. It was more of “I definitely did struggle with this and I got through it. It took a while, and it was a lot of work, but I never took that approach toward it. We always just wrote that off as something that wasn't for athletes.” It was just cool to see how they described [how] their view changed a little bit. As an athlete, how do you separate your mental state from the binary of wins and losses? That's something that I've struggled with a lot. I haven't always dealt with it the best. I'm a work in progress, for sure, and it's difficult. For someone like myself—and all the other competitors out there that fill out the league—you want to win. You want to win for yourself. You want to win for your team, who also work super hard. All of us at this level have pretty much dedicated our lives to it. It's a business, and it's a business where you're judged by numbers and by wins and losses. When things don't go your way, it is hard. I try to think,Okay, is it me feeling this, or me doing this, is it productive?Is it something I can control?What are my goals? How do they align with them? Obviously, I also try not to run from the emotions. I try not to [say] “I don't care. I don't feel this.” I try to embrace how I feel, embrace when I'm hurt, embrace when I'm upset, and try to be reasonable with myself. If I'm upset, it's okay that I'm upset. I understand if I work this hard, and we don't get the result, it's okay to be upset. If I'm sad about something for our team, I try to validate those feelings first, and then move on.All right, we've accepted where we are. Now, what's our goal? And what we're doing, our habits, are they helping that goal, or are they hurting it? If we want to change it next week, how are we going to go about that? The last three games of your season, you had seven touchdowns and no interceptions; two of the games were overtime wins. Ending the season on that note, what did it do for your mental health? I think it was great for us as a unit, just as something to build off going into the offseason. [This is] the first time we'll be with the same staff, same system, a lot of continuity on the offensive side of the ball. Now it's that balance of feeling the confidence and seeing the build, but also knowing that we still have work to do. I still have stuff to improve on. We all still have stuff to improve on!",

    "title": "New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite V4s Review: Our Perfect Race Day Shoe",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If yourun, you’ll probably be more than aware that some pretty major new running shoes are rumored to be landing on our shelves later this year. There’s some new Adidas models, theNikeVomeros—which seems to have an endless stream of influencers already backing it on TikTok—a Puma supershoe—and then there's the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite V5. Debuted by whom? Only Olympic gold-medallist triathlete turned marathon runner Alex Yee, who clocked in with a debut marathon time of 2:11:08 (that's just 6 minutes off Mo Farah's British record) in London while wearing them this April. I love a newrunning shoeas much as the next person—Ireallydo—but while I wait for the V5s to drop in August with great anticipation, I'd ask you to cast your mind back to New Balance's last major release: the V4s. In fact, with so much attention now on the FuelCell SuperComp Elite line thanks to Yee, I felt the moment had come to properly confess my love for the pairs that are on the shelves right now. I'd even go as far as to say they're my favorite race day running shoe of the current era. Here's why we still love the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite V4. New Balance New Balance Specs The first thing that’s essential to note about the SuperComp range is that it's a race shoe. It’s not the kind of thing you can wear here, there and everywhere, and I’d even suggest approaching with caution about wearing it to your weekly interval session. These are shoes that are almost entirely designed to be fast, which means that they ultimately make sacrifices in other areas, such as support and cushioning, to help propel you around a course on race day with as little holding you back as possible. The carbon plate is the key here, giving you extra propulsion. Part of my job involves testing out running shoes, so I’ve tried a fair few carbon-plated shoes in my time. There’s a great range out there: theAsics Metaspeedsgot me my 5K PB, theNike Vaporflysare our Lifestyle Director Mike Christensen's marathon shoe, and theSaucony Endorphin Elitesare ultra responsive. But for my foot personally, and the way I run, the New Balance Elites feel the fastest. While I'm not going to waste a shoe by cutting it open here (IYKYK), it’s definitely important to go through the intricate details that those really invested in the running shoe world have noted. The conclusions tend to be quite similar across the board: it’s not the most explosive shoe for a fast 5K or sprint distance, but if you’re looking to cruise at a fast marathon, half marathon, or even a 10K pace, it’s got you covered. The rocker feels strong, the new Pebex foam that New Balance brought into the mix here is more comfortable than most supershoe foams, and it offers a bit more of a smooth ride than the super performance-focused shoes that really strip things down. Testing the New Balance SuperComp running shoes What you’re getting here is a carbon-plated supershoe that offers a bit more give than some more professionally minded shoes. For the average runner, this is preferable, helping soften things up, feeling generally more comfortable than other supershoes, but still helping you feel bouncier, speedier and overall closer to hitting those PBs. It's why we think it offers the perfect balance between speed and comfort. From a personal perspective, this is one of the best shoes I’ve ever run in. I debuted them on a half marathon in Verona, and while I put most of my speed down to my intensive training plan, I knocked eight minutes off my PB despite slippery cobblestones while wearing them. As the technical gurus of the internet suggest, they’ve not felt explosive enough on the faster paces to break my 5K PB just yet, but if you’re after a long-distance race shoe that doesn’t leave you feeling totally wrecked afterwards from the lack of support, this is your one.

    "title": "Is Carb Cycling the Key to Increasing Your Endurance?",
    "article_text": "If you work out a lot,you need carbs. Despite the fair share of shade they get, carbohydrates arethe body’s primary source of energy. But it can be hard to know the best way to incorporate the macronutrient into your diet—especially since a carb-heavy diet can alsolead to weight gain. Enter: carb cycling, which involves alternating between high-carb consumption days and low-carb consumption days. The method’s not for everyone. And there’s definitely a wrong and right way to do it, according to sports dietitians. Here, they break down everything you need to know about the diet hack, including what it is, who can benefit from it, and what to keep in mind if you want to give it a try. “Carb cycling is a method of eating in which you alternate how many grams of carbs you eat each day, usually labeled as high, moderate, or low, and matched to your daily workout plans and long-term goals,” saysTravis Thomas, an associate professor of clinical and sports nutrition in the Department of Athletic Training and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Kentucky. So, for example, you can carb cycle by eating a lot of carbs on an intense workout day and eating much fewer on a rest day. Some people may opt fora five-day carb cycling plan, eating a low-carb diet for three days a week and a high-carb diet two days a week. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all carb cycling protocol, but most people who try it sync it up with the intensity of their workouts, says registered dietitian and certified athletic trainerDana White. There aren’t scientific studies showing the best breakdown, says White. But typically,someone who is carb cyclingeats between 100 and 125 grams of carbs on low-carb days and between 175 and 275 grams of carbs on high-carb days, according toLaurel M. Wentz, a registered dietitian and associate professor at Appalachian State University. She adds that some athletes carb cycle by consuming between 30 and 60 grams of carbs before they work out while doing other workouts with little or no carbs—like doing a morning run without eating, for example. So carb cycling can sometimes be a choose-your-own-adventure endeavor, depending on your health goals and workout routine. Here’s what the sports dietitians say carb loading isn’t: eating all the bagels, noodles, and rice you want one day and switching to a low- or no-carb day the next. All three experts say that carb loading is typically done by people following a regimented workout routine who are using it to give their body what it needs to get the most out of every workout. That said, carb cycling includes both simple carbs andcomplex carbs. Dr. Thomas says that more emphasis is placed on complex carbs (like brown rice, quinoa, beans, lentils, and starchy vegetables) because they are more nutrient-rich than simple carbs, but simple carbs (like bread, white rice, and pasta) are used by athletes with high calorie and carbohydrate needs. The type of carbs to prioritize depends on the timing and type of exercise someone is going to be doing, White says. For example, complex carbs are typically high-fiber, which isn’t ideal if you plan on working out or going on a run soon after eating because it could lead to gastrointestinal distress. “In these cases, you would want to eat simple carbs, because they digest faster,” she says. All three experts we spoke to say that those who can benefit from carb cycling the most are serious athletes—or people who work out like them. “Carb cycling can improve performance for elite athletes who have prioritized all other aspects of training, such as sufficient total daily carbohydrates, meeting protein needs as well as total energy needs, practicing good sleep hygiene, and having a solid training and recovery program,” Dr. Wentz says. “For most amateur athletes, carb cycling won’t make much of an impact.” She adds that serious endurance athletes are especially primed to benefit from carb cycling because they typically have multiple long training sessions a day. That means they need a quickly absorbed energy source, like simple carbohydrates, to keep them going. “For serious athletes, who train one to five hours daily, the idea of matching carb needs with training load and intensity, referred to as nutrient periodization, is not a new concept,” Dr. Thomas says. “The difference is that serious athletes train and compete at high training loads or intensities and need more carbohydrates than what a standard carb cycling plan might suggest,” he says. But that carb load will lessen in the off-season or if they’re rehabbing an injury, Dr. Thomas says. All three dietitians we spoke to say that carb cycling can help you shed pounds but only if it’s part of an overall plan to maintain a calorie deficit. If dedicating a few days a week to being low-carb is your way of resisting simple carbs high in calories, then that’s a strong start toward slimming down. But it won’t help you lose weight if you’re going carb crazy on your high-carb days. If you have diabetes or another medical condition that affects your blood sugar levels, White says that carb cycling likely isn’t the best eating plan for you. Instead, she recommends talking to your doctor about what you are hoping to get out of carb cycling and coming up with a plan together about the best way to reach that goal, taking into account your individual health. The most important thing to consider is the nutrient value of the foods in your diet, both on low-carb days and on high-carb days. What’s going to provide your body with what it needs? Do you need fast-absorbing simple carbs to prep for a long run during yourmarathon training? How are you going to meet your fiber goals on days when complex carbs are on the back burner? If you have no idea what your nutrient needs are and where carbs fit in, start from scratch ateatright.orgormyplate.gov. But remember: Carb cycling and low-carbohydrate diets are completely different. “Athletes should maintain adequate total carbohydrates and energy to support training,” Dr. Wentz says. “At the same time, some athletes train better and are able to better maintain their weight with moderate carbohydrate intake.” If you’re an athlete—or you train like one—she recommends working with a sports dietitian to figure out a detailed nutrition plan that’s best for you. The bottom line is if you’re doing intense workouts, carb cycling may actually be a beneficial option for you. But if you’re not all that active, you aren’t going to gain a whole lot from it.",

    "title": "10 Best Underwear for Working Out in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you're not wearing the best underwear for working out while, well,working out, then you know what a literal pain in the ass it can be. Your everydayunderwearjust can't withstand all the sweat and movement: hence the wedgies, the swamp crotch, and every other bad thing that can happen below the waistband. If you've been struggling to hit a newsquatPR or if yourmile time'sstill far away from what you're aiming for, there's a big chance it's probably because you're wearing the wrong underwear (or you still have some extra training to do). Below, the best underwear for working out so that you can finally start training like you mean it. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Material: 91% Modal, 9% SpandexSizes: XS to 2XL When it comes to workout gear, Ten Thousand is a brand to know. From shirts to shorts, the brand's tough-as-nails workout apparel can handle any and every workout with ease so that you can do the heavy lifting without worrying about your fit. And its underwear? Well, let's just say it'd be disappointing if everything the brand made did wellexceptits undies. The A—L boxers perfectly teeter the line between supportive boxer briefs and compression liners—they're tight but not too tight where your balls are screaming for room. Its no-bunch waistband stays put so it's not digging into your skin as you're mid hip hinge and the front pouch cups your junk with dual layers for full coverage (i.e. no peekaboos here). They're designed to be stink-free thanks to silver ion technology, and the modal construction feels slick and smooth against the skin. Mack Weldon Mack Weldon Material: 50% Polyamide, 33% Polyester, 17% ElastaneSizes: S to 2XL If you're more of a briefs person, Mack Weldon's have you covered (literally). Its AIRKNIT material is cooling and soft to the touch for comfort, while being moisture-wicking and anti-odor. It's basically the perfect underwear for anyone who sweats with even the slightest movement. These lightweight briefs offer a barely there feel with a lay-flat waistband that won't disrupt your flow. Plus, targeted cool zones offer the breathability that you've been so desperately dying for so you can finally stop peeling off your underwear post-workout like it's a second skin. CDLP CDLP Material: 95% Tencel lyocell, 5% ElastaneSizes: XS to 3XL CDLP's subtle (and sexy) boxer briefs are maybe the most luxurious to ever grace our bottoms. Made mostly from cooling and sleek Tencel, these boxer briefs offer top-notching breathability—there's a reason why some of our favorite bed sheets for hot sleepers are made from the same stuff. “What truly sets it apart is its luxurious softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties, keeping you cool and fresh throughout the day,” CDLP's CEO Andreas Palm says. Because of that, they're great for working out because if you're anything like us, sweat is already starting to form by the time you've stepped into the gym. Lululemon Lululemon Material: 91% Modal,9% ElastaneSizes: XS to 2XL We love to razz Lululemon for its move to make clothes you can wear outside of the gym (c'mon, anactivewear suit?), but at its core, the brand does know how to do performance-wear well. Its Always In Motion boxers are the underwear you'd want to pair with those stretchy athleisure shorts. The majority-modal construction makes them sleek and smooth, but also breathable and quick-drying. The four-way stretch makes these perform especially well with any type of exercise that requires a bit, or a lot, of flexibility—yoga, pilates, barre. We'd recommend these for anyone who prefers briefs with a longer inseam, but if you like the idea of these but want something shorter, they also come in three-inch and five-inch options. Skims Skims Material: 72% Polyamide, 28% ElastaneSizes: XS to 5XL WhenGQSports writer Matthew Roberson tried out the OG Skims underwear, he called them “FUCKING PERFECT.” With the Skims Sport briefs, the brand ditched the cotton and made a pair of underwear that's pretty fucking perfect for working out, especially at their price point (just 10 bucks a pop now that they're on sale). They fit exactly the same as the original Skims underwear, but the fabric has been updated to make it more lightweight and quick-drying, two important factors for underwear designed to worn while exercising. They're extra stretchy and and breathable, and if you're looking to stock up on that underwear drawer, this is what you should be filling it with. Saxx Saxx Material: 85% Nylon, 15% ElastaneSizes: XS to 2XL Compression shorts are the secret to a good workout, and compression underwear could be the difference between a mid workout and a major one. Saxx's Kinetic Light-Compression mesh underwear offer lightweight, targeted compression to everyone's favorite leg muscles: the quads and hammies. The micro-mesh construction offers some breathability so that sweat can more easily evaporate, and the odor-resistant fabric avoids any dreaded stenches emanating from your gym bag as you're commuting home. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo's AIRism fabric is great for anyone who overheats, and that's the reason why it's a great material for workout clothes. These briefs offer odor control and are cool to the touch, although they can lean on the thinner side. Nike Nike A bit of compression and a whole lot of support make these an excellent choice for an elite athlete who wants to make sure that their choice of underwear won't restrict their movements and leave them stuck in a puddle of their own sweat. Tommy John Tommy John An extra-long inseam and four-way stretch lend themselves to a pair of boxer briefs that stay put and make it feel as if you're not wearing anything—because maybe you're used to going commando at the gym. Path Projects Path Projects If you've ever dealt with underwear chafing, then these Path Projects underwear will be a relief to your poor thighs. Stitch-free seams prevent any unwanted abrasion to your skin and a quick-drying fabric keeps you nice and cool while the rest of you gets your sweat on. What's the best underwear for working out for men? We found theTen Thousand A—L Boxersto be the best underwear for working out, combining an excellent fit with a superior drying abilities and zero post-exercise odors. What's the best material for workout underwear? While cotton is a great material for underwear in general, we think a synthetic like modal or lyocell make great options because of how quickly they dry and how they're breathable so that your privates don't get stuffy and sweaty. Are boxer shorts or briefs better underwear for working out? Your choice of underwear for working out is a totally personal decision, and the style doesn't really affect your workout. Just make sure that your choice of underwear lets you stay mobile and isn't restricting. A fair bunch of GQ editors like to work out, so finding people to test out underwear while they were sweating it out was not a hard task. Luckily, even those who tend to go commando when they're popping a squat, were down to add the extra layer to their bottoms. We evaluated underwear performance based on comfort and breathability, plus how well they allowed us to stay moving without making us feel hindered. The result are the 11 best pairs of underwear for working out, no matter the exercise.",

    "title": "Tyrese Haliburton Can’t Keep Getting Away With This, Can He?",
    "article_text": "Tyrese Haliburton has a weird-looking jump shot. Compared to his NBA peers, in fact, almost nothing about his game marks him as a prototypical superstar. He’s not smooth likeShai Gilgeous-Alexander. He’s nota sicko like Luka Doncic. He doesn’t play with the same adamantine, dead-eyed style that makes Nikola Jokic so fascinating, and he’s also not a shit-talking alpha who wants to dunk you through the floorboards like Anthony Edwards. But after adding yet another instant-classic moment to his increasingly legendary highlight reel—this time to cap off what was probably the craziest ending to an NBA Finals game sinceJ.R. Smithforgot the score—Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers find themselves three wins from a championship. To be in this position at all is a major feat. During the regular season, the Pacers had four different losing streaks of at least three games, were below .500 on New Year’s Eve, and generally were not considered a real threat to hoist the Larry O’Brien trophy. Yet here we are, with Haliburton sinking an improbable shot in the dying seconds of a game for thefourthstraight series, with the Pacers’ seemingly bulletproof opponent left searching for answers. It is, of course, just one game, but the Oklahoma City Thunder were generally out of sorts in their first showing of this championship series. (Who had Isaiah Hartenstein moving to the bench out of nowhere, Chet Holmgren playing only 24 minutes, and Belgian rookie Ajay Mitchell getting actual run in the NBA Finals?) Losing to Tyrese Haliburton on a backbreaking shot is now a rite of passage for NBA playoff teams. It has happened to theBucks,Cavs,Knicks, and now the Thunder (all on their home court, by the way) in the span of basically one month. Oshkosh, Wisconsin, stand up. Your most notable hometown kid, by far—apologies to thepageant of Wisconsin State Assemblypeople who are from thereas well—is straight up one of the clutchest players in NBA history. Since the start of the 1997 playoffs, only a guy named LeBron James has more go-ahead or game-tying field goals in the final five seconds of regulation or overtime. Sure, Haliburton has the ball in his hand a lot at the end of games, and the Pacers’ penchant for playing tightly-contested games provides ample opportunities for this type of clip farming. But he’s also 25 years old and already has more of these than Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, or Kevin Durant, who have played 461 postseason games during that time frame. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. For Haliburton—whose biggest stage prior to last night was the 2024 Paris Olympics, where hefamously did not play very much—the Game 1 dagger proved once again that he is the right guy for these clock-winding-down scenarios. It has gotten to the point where, when the game is on the line, you expect the ball to go in every time it leaves his hand. Whether that is a repeatable skill, or the cluster of big-time buckets he’s put together recently are pure coincidence, the fact remains. The Indiana Pacers have the upper hand in theNBA Finals, one that nobody thought they’d even be participating in, let alone winning the first game on the road. Haliburton’s overall numbers from Thursday night don’t scream at you (the middy he hit over Cason Wallace at the end was just his second made basket of the fourth quarter, and he finished with a modest 14 points), but a 1-0 lead against the most authoritative team since the peak Warriors sure does. Credit to Pascal Siakam’s double-double, Andrew Nembhard and Myles Turner combining for 16 points in the final quarter, and a remarkable shooting night from Obi Toppin as well. But when this game is unearthed from theNBA time capsule, whether Indiana takes the series or not, all anyone will remember is Haliburton, who made sure that a sloppy offensive night for Indiana would be salvaged by way of a beautiful garnish. We told you this wouldn’t be boring.",

    "title": "The Best Sneakers of 2025 (So Far)",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. We’re only halfway through the year, but as far assneakersare concerned, 2025 has already been one for the books. From signature hoops bangers andall-time great retrosto landmark designer collaborations and under-the-radar technical masterpieces, it feels like a full year’s worth of heaters had already hit before the clocks sprung forward for daylight savings. While there are plenty of major drops still to come through the summer and fall, now feels as good a time as any to take stock of the best sneakers of 2025 so far. From slimmed-down sneakers to supersized boat shoes, these are the footwear styles you’re about to see everywhere. Wales Bonner and Adidas don’t miss, but this might be the hardest they’ve ever hit the bullseye.The designer’s first original silhouette with the Stripesdidn’t disappoint, and while we’re looking forward to future colorways, the debut sequined edition is going to be tough to beat. Auralee and New Balanceare a match made in sneaker heaven. Their latest linkup, a suede-happy spin on the 1980s-era 475 model, is an understated masterpiece that overdelivers on the premium materials and keen attention to detail we’ve come to expect from both brands. A’ja Wilsonfinally has her own signature Swoosh model—and unsurprisingly, it’s one of the bestperformance hoops shoesof the year. With its swoopy, low-cut silhouette, unparalleled cushioning, and splashy colorways, the Nike A’One is a sneaker worthy of the best player in the WNBA. Margiela dove into a key moment in sneaker history in designing the Sprinter, a souped-up homage to the Waffle Racer—i.e. the OG Nike running shoe circa 1972. The luxury house’s updated take drapes the upper in crisp nylon above a pre-aged sole, resulting in an instant heater and welcome addition to thetorpedo sneaker canon. With its effortlessly chill palette, Australia’sTemptation Vacationteamed up with Asics on one the beachiest, most versatile kicks of the summer. Keep an eye out for future sneaker collabs from the Gold Coast label—based on the strength of this first at-bat, they’ve got plenty of heat up their sleeves. We’ve been saying the granddad shoe is here to stay—and nobody does the orthopedic aesthetic better thanMephisto. For this handsome edition of the iconic Match model, Toronto’s Body of Work swapped the typical pebbled leather for a rich brown suede. That simple change makes what’s usually the ultimate old-man shoe look like it’s barely a day over 45. We’re always going to be a sucker fora good Nike SB Dunk, and this one would be great evenwithouta compelling backstory behind it. Regardless, it has one: it’s the debut Swoosh sneaker for Australian skateboarding phenom Hayley Wilson, one of the most exciting young skaters in the game. Spencer Badu brought the heat forhis eponymous label’s Hoka debut. The Toronto native’s take on the Elevon X silhouette is bold, brash, and rich with nods to Badu’s Ghanaian heritage. In other words, it’s exactly what you’d want from a rising young designer working on his first major sneaker collaboration. Los Angeles loves Kobe. Los Angeles loves the Dodgers.This shoe, then, makes all the sense in the world. If anything, we’re surprised it took the folks at Nike this long to execute such a slam dunk—or, in this case, home run—of a colorway. Chavarria has proven himself the designer of the moment, with everything he’s touched in 2025 having turned to gold:a Super Bowl collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, asensational showing at Paris Fashion Week in February, and of course,his work with Adidas. The still-young partnership is off to a tremendous start, with his pointy-toed take on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s signature sneaker an immediate highlight. Mark our words: After a few years on the sidelines, gingham is about to beeverywhereagain. And the venerable checked pattern launched its takeover campaign withthis delightful Asics runner direct from the minds behind Story Mfg., one of the most exciting (and ethical!) independent menswear labels in Britain A year ago, few of us would have expectedballet sneakers to take over the gamethe way they have in 2025. And at the forefront of that trend is this low-slung, pirouette-ready spin on the buzzy Puma Speedcat. Supreme and Nike have beenworking together for 23 years now, but somehow the legendary duo had never released an Air Max 1. That all changed in March with a quartet of clean, summer-ready takes on the quintessential runner—in purple, yellow, black, and white—all rendered in smooth leather and offset by a touch of snakeskin print on the swoosh. It’s a successful back-to-basics reset—one that’s made us far more curious about what the pair might cook up next than we have been in ages. It’s rare to see an athlete’s signature line get the sort of reinvigoration James Harden’s has in the last couple of years. The design language of his shoes headed in a far more avant-garde direction around the seventh incarnation, and this season’s Harden Volume 9 is easily the boldest pair the superstar has ever stormed the court in. The molded, chromed-out uppers call to mind ’90s-era Nike hoops classics like theAir Foampositeand Air Flightposite in the best possible way. Sometimes less reallyismore. Case in point: Prada’s new Collapse Re-Nylon kicks, an instant-classic entry in theminimalist sneakers canon. And unlike most designer sneakers, you can actually pull these off without looking like you’re trying to flex a logo. Union owner Chris Gibbs’original Air Jordan 1 colorwayshad a strong case for being the best sneakers of 2018. As far as we’re concerned, the dude isnow three for three—it’s safe to say these Frankensteined beauts will be at the top of many year-end lists come December. Move over, dad shoes—the granddad shoe is here.New Balance’s newest UK-made kicksare a killer addition to theOld Man Style canonthat is sure to inspire countless imitations in the years to come. Canadian menswear retailer Haven’s signature aesthetic sits at the center of the Venn diagram between gorpcore and Yohji Yamamoto. Their spin on the Asics Gel Nimbus 10.1 distills that design ethos perfectly, delivering all the blacked-out tones and contrasting textures you’d expect on a can’t-miss silhouette from one of thehottest names in sneakerstoday. Sure, we might be a tad biased given that these kicks made theirdebut on the runway at the first-ever GQ Bowl. But after turning aforgotten football shoe into a genuine smash last year, Bode has kept the Nike Astrograbber hype rolling by turning it out in its sickest colorway yet: an all-leather version in gorgeous Kermit green. In designer fashion circles, Marni has always had something of a “little engine that could” energy—making a big impression in a crowded space byfollowing the beat of its own quirky drum. The same could be said for Hoka in the sneaker world. Together? They’re a match made in heaven, withthese puffed-out kickssignaling a freaky and rewarding start for what should hopefully be a long, fruitful partnership. Ever laced up a pair of bowling shoes at the alley and low-key wished you could just wear them home? Thanks toBrain Deadand Adidas, now you can. After debuting these clean leather bowlers in 2024, the collaborators teamed withDover Street Marketto run them back this spring in a sharp black colorway. They’re an absolute strike. For years now, hoops fans have been clamoring forNBA style god—and current MVP candidate—Shai Gilgeous-Alexanderto receive a signature shoe line. And at NBA All-Star Weekend in February,Converse finally lifted the veil on the Shai 001, an appropriately fashion-forward sneaker with serious performance credentials beneath the hood. The buttery debut colorway is killer, but you can bet this one’s going to get all kinds of hype-worthy renditions and designer collaborations over the next year. With his latest pair of much-hyped retros, Nigel Sylvester has cemented himself as one of Jordan Brand’s premier collaborators. The BMX star’sbrick-red Air Jordan 4sare a masterful take on a timeless silhouette, complete with considered details and thoughtful storytelling. Jerry Lorenzo and Adidas’s Fear of God Athletics partnershipgot off to a bit of a shaky start in 2023. But the last few months have seen the brand level up substantially, beginning with the killer on-court Athletics Basketball II. The real heat, however, is theAthletics Trainer, easily the best pair of shoes Fear of God has put out since theiroriginal Nike collaboration. Even on his way out the door,now-former Balenciaga creative director Demnahad some heat in the chamber for all the sneakerheads out there. Nearly a decade after ushering in the gigantic sneaker wars withBalenciaga’s positively enormous Triple S, the Georgian designer used his final show for the house to unveil a pared-down collaboration with Puma, starring this hyper-distressed flip on the red-hot Speedcat silhouette. Every year brings a new entry in to the storiedAir Max line. Not all of them stick. We’ve got a feeling theAir Max Dn8—with its souped-up, futuristic design and weird (in the best way) sole—will have some serious staying power. An incredibly groovy take on an old-school Adidas silhouette, mixed with elements ofa classic ballet flat, has made for the It shoe of 2025. Expect some killer collabs on this one in the future.

    "title": "Did Tariffs Send the Vintage Watch Market Skyrocketing?",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. The panic set in immediately. In early April, after President Trumpannounced crippling tariffs on nearly every country in the world, the global watch industry was suddenly faced with a 31% levy on American imports from Switzerland—the primary source for new luxury watches—and similarly high taxes on countries like Japan, from which dealers source a great deal of vintage pieces. At long last, Trump proved it was possible for an American to cause more chaos in Switzerland than I do every year during Watches and Wonders. In the days between Trump announcing the tariffs and subsequently putting them on a 90-day pause, figures in the watch industry sprung into action. In April, Jacek Kozubek, the prominent dealer behind Tropical Watch, told me that a “big group that I sell certified, pre-owned watches to all of a sudden bought a big package from me, because they feel they're not going to get stuff from Switzerland and they need inventory in their store.” The independent watchmaker H.Moser & Cie. also confirmed in those early days that it expedited a cache of watches to sneak into the US before the tariffs set in. It turns out Moser had the same idea as the rest of the industry: Last week, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry reported that watches had flooded the US like hipster tourists headed to Portugal. Swiss watch exports more than doubled in April compared to last year,WatchProreported. Roughly 852 million Swiss francs’ worth of watches landed in the US that month, compared to 342 million Swiss francs’ worth in April 2024. But while many in the industry were putting out their sandbags and gathering their umbrellas for stormy days ahead, the sun broke through the clouds for one large segment. The resellingplatform Subdial toldBloombergthat its sales jumped 160% higher than usual toward the end of April, with buyers seeking to avoid even higher tariffs than the current 10% levy. Could it be that, despite the tariffs and increased pricing, watches are now hotter than ever? Several watch dealers on the secondary market confirmed sales have been doing well. “It’s been strong,” James Lamdin, founder of vintage watch purveyor Analog:Shift, texted me when asked about the state of the market. Likereallystrong: “Our sales are up almost 20% the past three months,” Paul Altieri of Bob’s Watches said over email. A boosted secondary market was always on the list of potential tariff side effects. When I spoke with Kozubek in early April, he said it was plausible that as prices increased for new watches at your local boutique, buyers might seek out purchases on the secondary market that were already in the US and thus unaffected by the tariffs. The theory was half right. The secondary market is doing well—but for exactly the opposite reason. Much like with brand-new watches, prices on the secondary market are increasing. “They have already started going up and I think will continue to do so,” Kozubek said over text. Customers are buying watches like a hot stock, getting in now because they fear prices will be even more bloated later. “People feel like prices will go up, so they are buying more now,” Kozubek said. The potential for looming price increases have only stoked urgency among watch collectors. “Customers may be accelerating their purchases now to avoid higher prices later, especially for big-ticket items like Rolex and other Swiss brands, which could jump 10 to 25% in price if and when the tariffs hit,” Altieri said. Altieri pointed out another interesting wrinkle there: Some brands, like Rolex, are more likely to be affected than others. What will be hit the hardest by price increases? Most likely the blue chip watches. If customers are making purchases with the expectation they won’t be able to get them cheaper later, they’re most likely steering toward the safe watches from brands like Rolex. However, while all the dealers I spoke with agree on the market’s strength, not all of them believe it’s for the same reason. When I asked Wind Vintage’s Eric Wind if he thought tariffs were pushing strong sales, the dealer simply responded, “Nope.” That doesn’t mean Wind isn’t seeing the same growth as his fellow dealers. “I would say right around May 9 or so things really picked up,” he texted me. So, what happened on May 9? Last-minute Mother’s Day gifts, of course. I’m kidding. The Geneva auctions kicked up at that time, and the encouragingly good results reverberated throughout the industry, according to Wind. The other main driver? The tariffs impacted the price of watches, but it also had a calamitous effect on the economy. In early April, the value of the Dow Jones stock market index dropped below $40,000 and didn’t return above that benchmark until late in the month. “I think the Dow Jones being over $40K is really the key,” Wind said. “People are feeling good about the economy.” In early April, even before the tariffs, there weren’t many reasons to feel optimistic about the watch industry. The market has been soft ever since the boom time of the pandemic, when people were flipping watches at unsustainably high prices. Now, it seems that a combination of factors—whether it’s the stabilizing economy or pre-tariff scaries—are jolting collectors into action. See all of our newsletters, includingBox + Papers,here.",

    "title": "Surprise: The Government Is “Scrambling” to Rehire Workers Fired by DOGE",
    "article_text": "AfterElon MuskboughtDonald Trumpa second term in office, the president granted his benefactor the power toindiscriminately firethousands of federal employees under the guise of saving taxpayer money. But as it turns out, letting a “move fast and break things” billionaire can whomever he pleased—including individuals with decades of institutional knowledge—wasn’t the best idea. In fact, one might even go so far as to call it a really bad one! TheWashington Postreportsthat “across the government, the Trump administration is scrambling to rehire many federal employees dismissed under DOGE’s staff-slashing initiatives after wiping out entire offices, in some cases imperiling key services such as weather forecasting and the drug approval process.” For example, in May, the Food and Drug Administration started sending ridiculously euphemistic emails to fired staff that read, “Notice of Reduction in Force (RIF) issued to you…is officially RESCINDED [and] you will not be separated from employment,” according to thePost,which reviewed the message. “You are expected to return to duty the next business day following your receipt of this notice.” Other agencies, like the USDA, have similarly attempted to reverse their firings; for instance, a safety inspector told thePostthat he was called one weekend and told he was being fired over “performance”—despite his having received positive reviews—only to be told days later that his termination was being canceled. Thousands of probationary employees with the Internal Revenue Service were similarly dismissed for fake “performance” matters, until the agency “reversed course and told them to show up to work in late May.” Staffers at the US Agency for International Development—which was wholesaleguttedby Musk in February—opened their inboxes this month and found “an unexpected offer: Would you consider returning—to work for the State Department?” The rush to rehire employees callously fired by DOGE comes as Musk and Trumpgo scorched-earth on each other, a public feud thatshows few signs of abating. On Thursday, the president threatened to cancel Musk’s government contracts, and with all kinds ofpotential retributionon the table, it seems more than a little possible that Trump could shutter DOGE as a fuck-you to his backer turned enemy.

    "title": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Big, Beautiful Blow-Up Could Tank the Megabill",
    "article_text": "The fate ofDonald Trump’s megabill in the Senate was already uncertain. Then came the spectacular dissolution of his alliance withElon Musk, who began the week railing against the legislation and ended it with a battery of attacks—including alleging that the president has ties to Jeffrey Epstein and suggesting that he should be impeached and replaced by Vice PresidentJD Vance. Suddenly, Republicans—who’d spent months watching with delight as the two took flamethrowers to the nation’s democratic institutions—found themselves caught in the crossfire as the former alliestook aim at one another. Most, to this point, have aligned themselves with their official boss: “President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads,” Vanceposted, several hours after Musk suggested he take the reins. “I’m proud to stand beside him.” But the vice president’s careful statement, and the public efforts in Trumpworld toease hostilities, were telling: Trump may command the bully pulpit and the powers of the presidency, but Musk’s money, platform, and own legion of followers can pose a formidable threat to the MAGA movement . The most immediate peril, of course, may be for Trump’s so-called “big beautiful bill,” which could turn into a big, beautiful blow-up if House SpeakerMike Johnsonand Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thunecan’t find a way to diffuse the situation. Johnson, who narrowly passed thelegislationthrough the lower chamber, has been one of its chief lobbyists as it heads to the other side of the Capitol. And Thune, who can only afford three defections, is trying to get a deal done by Independence Day. “Failure is not an option,” hesaidon Thursday. But with some in his conference worried about cuts to Medicaid and other programs, and others saying that the cuts don’t go deepenough, failure is certainly in the realm of possibilities. Musk’s attacks—lobbed from his perch on X, the social media platform he owns—could make the math worse for Thune: “You don’t want the world’s richest guy with the biggest megaphone shitting on the bill in crunchtime,” as a top Hill leadertoldPolitico. He’d only need to persuade a few holdouts, the person noted, and “if he spends [the] next few weeks shitting on the bill, that will move the numbers.” With that in mind, Johnson has been eager to negotiate a truce between the warring parties. Just one problem, though: “I called Elon last night and he didn’t answer,” the House leadertoldreporters Wednesday. “It’s very friendly,” he assured, “and we’ve laughed about our differences on policy before.” But while much of the nation indeed watched this drama play out with plenty of mirth, there have been more tears than laughter in MAGAland since the feud broke open: “It’s hard to see a path forward for these two to repair their relationship,” Fox News’Will CainlamentedThursday. The fear, it seems, is that the acrimony could upend more than the “big beautiful bill.” Since Musk threw in his lot with Trump, they and their allies have gotten everything they wanted: Musk enjoyed virtually unchecked power; Trump enjoyed a virtually unlimited war chest; and Republicans enjoyed rubbing their newfound political and cultural might in the faces of their opponents. The fracture in Trump and Musk’s relationship threatens to fracture their broader political fantasy: “Who else really wants [Musk and Trump] to reconcile?” SenatorMike Leeaskedon X. “The world is a better place with the Trump-Musk bromance fully intact.” Your Guide to the2025 Tony Awards An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Chaos InsideJohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding What Is Going On WithPatti LuPone?

    "article_text": "Wow, who could have seen amessy public breakup that may impact our tax returnsand daily lives through petty policy moves coming, apart from, oh, all of us? As the world watchesDonald TrumpandElon Muskvolley social media insultsback and forth at one another likeZendayainChallengers—only you just know neither Trump nor Musk has the fast-twitch reactions or lateral movement that make for a great tennis player or love triangle participant—Vivian Jenna Wilsonappears to be watching right there along with us. And Wilson, it turns out, has the reflexes and comedic timing to score points. Wilson, the 21-year-old estranged daughter of Musk who has embraced modeling and absolutely scathing takes on social media since publicly cutting ties with her father, is hesitant to comment on him these days. In late May,speaking withVanity Fair, she paused for roughly 30 seconds when asked for her take on Musk’s thenin-progress public pivot away from politics, murmuring a drawn-out “giiiiiiiiirl” before asking for the next question. Now, she appears to have taken a page out ofPatti LuPone’s “no comment” playbookto acknowledge the current battle of the bros without actually commenting on it. Though the embattled Broadway icon is currently in a precarious position within the Broadway community after her indelicate comments in a recentNew Yorkerprofile, LuPone’s primly dismissive non-answer when asked about her “not a friend”Audra McDonald’s Tony-nominated performance in the current revival ofGypsybecame instant gossip fodder. AsNew YorkerwriterMichael Schulmanrecounted, after he asked the question, “she stared at me, in silence, for fifteen seconds. Then she turned to the window and sighed, ‘What a beautiful day.’” Wilson, too, would rather just, oh, appreciate the sunshine than talk about two aging drama queens doing all but pulling out rulers to compare stats and prove who’s the manlier man. “Such beauty in life,”Wilson posted on her Bluesky accountThursday afternoon around 3:30, which would be shortlyafter Musk posted that Trump is in the Epstein files, but before he said he was going totake his rocket and go home, sothere. “The weather is so lovely today,”Wilson added two minutes later, complete with a sparkle emoji for pizzazz. She did not share her opinion on McDonald’s work inGypsyeither. And you know what? It really is a gorgeous day out here.

    "article_text": "On Thursday night, amid the buzz of the 24thTribeca Film Festival, nearly two dozen directors gathered at theFour Seasons Hotel New York Downtownto fête their recent projects.Vanity Fairhosted the second annual Directors Dinner, celebrating excellence in entertainment, at CUT byWolfgang Puck,the legendary California chef’s first New York City outpost. Over tartlets and glasses of Dom Pérignon Vintage 2015 – Jean-Michel Basquiat Special Edition, the guests chatted withVFacting editor in chiefDaniel Kileand Condé Nast global head of film and televisionHelen Estabrook,before taking their seats under the striking art in the restaurant’s dining room. Miley Cyrus,the night’s special guest, is premiering her pop opera,Something Beautiful,at the festival tonight. It’s a visual accompaniment to heralbum of the same name, which was released last week. Before sitting down for dinner, she explained the title’s significance. “It’s a name that really embodies what everyone here was wanting and inspired to create,” Cyrus said. “What we’re putting out into the universe, it’s medicine for a sick culture. When we do it with pure intentions, a pure heart, and pure love, I really do believe that it is medicine.” During the cocktail hour,Mariska Hargitayand her husbandPeter Herrmancaught up with comedianJim Gaffigan.Hargitay’s powerful documentary,My Mom Jayne,premiered at Cannes last month to rapturous audience response. In it, she grapples with the legacy of her mother, Jayne Mansfield, and her discovery as an adult that Mickey Hargitay, the parent who raised her, was not her biological father. In his remarks, Kile praised Hargitay’s work and explained whyVFdecided to turnlast year’s partyinto an annual event. “We got so much out of it that we decided to do it again here, bigger and better than before,” he said. “We’re so honored to have so many filmmakers, speakers, jury members, and producers of projects out tonight.” Cyrus was joined by her codirectors,Jacob BixenmanandBrendan Walter,and the film’s producer,Panos Cosmatos,as well as her musical collaborator,Shawn Everett.In advance of Cyrus’s arrival with boyfriend and fellow musicianMaxx Morando,Cosmatos reflected on the process of makingSomething Beautiful,tellingVFthat he was able to join Cyrus in the studio as its songs were coming together.

A common topic of conversation was dressing for the abnormally intense Manhattan humidity. Fashion designerCynthia Rowleyand comedianMichael Ian Blackchatted about his reflective blazer, while AMPAS presidentJanet Yangand filmmakerBing Chendiscussed how to best wear a tie in the summer weather. DirectorElegance Brattonand producerChester Gordon,whose new filmMove Ya Body: The Birth of Housepremieres next weekend, discussed making a film about the genre of music they both love.

But next week,King Charles IIIwill share his birthday honors list, the biannual summary of changes to the system with knighthood at its pinnacle, and according toThe Sun,this year is finally Beckham’s chance to join the historic royal club. The tabloid notes that even though this year’s honorees are not yet public, private letters have already gone out to the recipients. Ever since retiring from soccer in 2013, the 50-year-old has pursued business deals, raised a family with wifeVictoria Beckham,built up a philanthropic legacy, and gotten close to the British royal family. In September 2022, the self-described “huge royalist” even waited 13 hours in the queue to see Queen Elizabeth’s casket as she was lying in state. Over the last few years, Beckham has been a reliable presence at royal engagements, evenexchanging honey with the kingand joiningPrince Williamfora helicopter photo shoot. In 2024 he made the affiliation official when he became an ambassador for the King’s Foundation, the youth-empowerment charity Charles founded as a young Prince of Wales in 1976. “I’m excited to be working with The King’s Foundation and to have the opportunity to help raise awareness of the charity’s work,” Beckham said ina statementat the time. “I’ve always been keen to help young people to expand their horizons and I’m particularly looking forward to supporting the Foundation’s education programs and its efforts to ensure young people have greater access to nature.” The UK honors system, which dates back centuries, awards prominent Brits with a tiered series of medals to commend their contributions to public life. While serving as the captain of the England national team, Beckham received the medal for the Order of the British Empire, the second rung on the ladder to knighthood, from the late queenin 2003. There isno set timelinefor knighthood after a person has received an OBE, and many who receive the initial honor do not go on to receive the final one. Beckham celebrated his milestone birthday recently witha series of parties in London. The reporting following one of those parties revealed that Victoria and David’s oldest son,Brooklyn Beckham,has been making a few new royal friendships of his own. Thehot-sauce entrepreneurand his wife ofthree years,Nicola Peltz,reportedly went to a dinner party withPrince HarryandMeghan Markleinstead of attending his father’s birthday celebrations. Peoplereports that the party took place at the home of Paramount Pictures CEOBrian Robbinsand his wife,Tracy Robbins.“Brooklyn and Nicola were invited prior to David’s numerous global birthday galas, so the timing is pure coincidence,” a source told the magazine. “Brooklyn and Nicola had a wonderful time and found Harry and Meghan to be particularly kind, caring and generous.” Your Guide to the2025 Tony Awards An Exclusive First Look atWicked: For Good The Chaos InsideJohnny Depp and Amber Heard’s Wedding What Is Going On WithPatti LuPone?

    "title": "When Megalomaniacs Collide: Trump Threatens to Ditch His Tesla as War with Musk Goes Nuclear",
    "article_text": "The countdown toElon MuskandDonald Trump’s epic fallout started as soon as their bromance began. Long before the chainsaws and the spurious salutes, there was always only one way that an alliance between two megalomaniacal billionaires who see themselves as society’s saviors was going to end. And now, here we are. After days of holding his fire in the face ofMusk’s online tiradeagainst the GOP spending bill,Trump fired backThursday, threatening on Truth Social to “terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” which he said would be the “easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars.” He's also—gasp!—reportedly consideringselling his Tesla. Trump—who just one week ago during an Oval Office sendoff insisted that Musk was“not really leaving”the administration —wrote thathe asked Musk to leaveafter “he just went CRAZY” over Trump’s push to end electric vehicle tax credits in the GOP bill. Trump’s allies, meanwhile, are pushing for even more retaliatory measures.Steve Bannontold Politicothat the feds should investigate Musk’s immigration status, alleged drug use, and connections to China, and “seize both SpaceX and Starlink and put them under government management until that time that all investigations into Musk are complete.” And how did the target of these threats respond? Byposting a seriesofraised eyebrow emojisabout alleged ties between Trump andJeffrey Epstein. One thing is clear: Trump and Musk are now on a path of mutually assured destruction. Over the course of the day Thursday,Axios reportsboth Trump Media and Tesla lost billions of dollars in value. Since the election, the most powerful people in business have been silent as Trump disrupted the economy with his tariffs and trade wars. The richest men in tech have uttered not a peep as the administration has eviscerated the universities whose research they rely on and sent foreign researchers packing. Who knew it would be the chief financier of the Trump administration and the pied piper of the new tech right who would be the first to publicly oppose Trump? But Musk seems to have something thatTim Cook,Mark Zuckerberg,Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezosand others don’t: Comfort with chaos. Musk is the only one who has proven himself eminently willing to burn his own house down. This is the same guy who riskedan SEC investigationinto securities fraudover a 420 joke, who lit$44 billion on fireto buy Twitter, and whosacrificed Tesla’s revenue and reputationto go all in on DOGE. Musk appears to believe that he has enough political clout to withstand a split with MAGA. In a poll on X,Musk askedThursday whether it's time to create “a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” As of Friday morning, more than 80% of respondents had answered “yes.” Of course, the irony is that Musk, a free-speech absolutist, is now getting a first hand look at how the man he ushered into office actually treats the people who speak out against him. Billionaires, they're just like us.

    "title": "After Arriving in New York City, Princess Leonor Heads to Carnegie Hall",
    "article_text": "On Thursday,Princess Leonor, heir to the Spanish throne, attended a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. Accompanied by the rest of the midshipmen, the Princess of Asturias enjoyedA Musical Fantasy from Spain.The program included works by Manuel de Falla and Maurice Ravel and zarzuela pieces performed by the sopranoSaioa Hernández, who made her debut in the mythical New York hall. Another of the attractions of the concert was the performance of violinistMaría Dueñas, who played Wolfgang Korngold's Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in D major. Official photographs of the event show Princess Leonor in the stalls of Carnegie Hall, seated with her fellow midshipmen and dressed like them in the Navy's white uniform of special prominence. Prior to the concert, the midshipmen also attended a reception and dinner where they posed for a group photo on the roof of the building. The princess also posed for a photo with the group of female midshipmen who have been part of this cruise of the Juan Sebastián de Elcano. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This is the first activity which Princess Leonor has taken part in New York afterher arrival at the port of the city last Wednesday. Before returning by plane to Spain on June 10, the Princess of Asturias and her companions are expected to participate in other events, such as the swearing in of the flag aboard the training ship or a meeting with Spaniards, which according to¡Hola!will be joined by the Duchess of Medinaceli,Victoria de Hohenlohe, who has been living in New York for some time due to her husband's work. For the moment, it has not been announced that any member of the Royal Family will travel to New York to accompany Leonor on this last stop of the Juan Sebastián de Elcano. Queen Sofiapresided over one of the Royal Theater's previous concerts at Carnegie Hall in 2022, and also usually travels to the city as honorary president of the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute, so there had been speculation that she might go to meet her granddaughter there.

    "title": "The Birkin Bag That Started It All Heads to Auction",
    "article_text": "If you had to keep just one object to tell the story of the last 40 years of fashion, it could fit in one hand -- or on one arm, worn nonchalantly like its original muse. It's not a bag, it'sthebag. Created following a now mythical Paris-London flight, thevery first Birkin bagimagined by Jean-Louis Dumas (former president ofHermès) forJane Birkinin 1984 will be auctioned by Sotheby's at its first “Fashion Icons” sale in Paris on July 10. More than an accessory, this prototype is a relic. A unique piece with the patina of an icon's life. Marked with her initials \"J.B.\", it features an unexpected detail: nail clippers suspended from a chain. It has to be said that Jane Birkin has never been one to overdo luxury. It was precisely this contrast that forged the Birkin legend. A bag born of chance, from the charming disorder of an airline flight, which became the most coveted model in the history of leather goods. Before crocodile skin, diamond inlays and endless waiting lists, there was this model. The original Birkin differs from those subsequently marketed. It has the width and height of a Birkin 35 with the depth of a Birkin 40, closed metal rings as on the house's high strap model, gold-plated brass details that would later be replaced by gold, rose gold, palladium or ruthenium jewelry. But also a shoulder strap sewn in one piece (which would never be the case again) and a “vintage zipper.” Each detail recounts a moment of transition between bespoke craftsmanship and standardized luxury goods. The details. The shoulder strap. The inside zipper. The nail clippers. This bag was well worn by Jane Birkin. The singer and actress couldn't stand bags that were too small, and once carried around a bag she didn't think suited her lifestyle. That is, until its contents - diapers, cigarettes, glasses, notebooks - were scattered all over the CEO of Hermès, who happened to be sitting next to her on the plane. He asked her to draw her ideal bag... on a sickness bag. The rest is history. This famous Birkin is not just a prototype, it's ground zero of contemporary luxury fantasy. The skillful blend of rarity, storytelling and heritage that made the myth of the French label. Hermès produces only a limited number each year, sold only to the most loyal (or patient) customers. Obtaining a Birkin is often an initiation process. It's hardly surprising, then, that this very first model should be the object of much envy. It has already been sold twice. The first, by Jane herself, in aid of Solidarité Sida in 1994. Then again in 2000, when it joined the private collection ofCatherine Benier, founder of vintage boutique Les 3 Marches in Paris. MorganeHalimi, head of fashion collections at Sotheby's, believes that it is \"rare [...] for an object to transcend trends and become a legend\": \"Jane Birkin's original Birkin bag is one of those. A true unicorn in the world of fashion and accessories, this iconic handbag stands side by side with other exceptional items of equally dazzling provenance - such asPrincess Diana's symbolic black sheep sweaterand Freddie Mercury's crown and cape. Both set exceptional benchmarks for items of their kind. Like them, the original Birkin has the potential to redefine records, but above all, our priority is to ensure that it finds a new home worthy of its iconic status and legendary history.\" The bag will be on display at Sotheby's in New York from June 6 to 12, then on view in Paris on rue du Faubourg St Honoré from July 3 to 9. It will then be auctioned on the 10th, alongside other iconic fashion items from famous couture shows by Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, John Galliano, Thierry Mugler and Azzedine Alaïa. Jane Birkin's original Birkin bag (on base) next to the new standard Birkin design. The auction house has not yet given an estimated price. However, precedents such as the Birkin Himalaya sold for $513,000 in Hong Kong in 2017. The original Birkin, with its strong history and provenance, could lay claim to this record. All the more so as the object today transcends its status as an accessory: exhibited at MoMA in New York and the V&A Museum in London, it now belongs to the pantheon of global visual culture. Jane Birkin, who died in 2023, sometimes joked that she might be remembered not for her films orJe t'aime... moi non plus, but for this bag. What she didn't know was that the fashion world hadn't simply adopted the Birkin: it had sanctified it.

    "title": "The One True Andy Kaufman: A New Doc Uses Private Tapes to Capture His Genius, Kindness, and Chaos",
    "article_text": "Who was the real Andy Kaufman? It’s a question that had people scratching their heads even before the actor/performance artist—who was often pigeonholed as being a comedian, much to his own chagrin—passed away in 1984 at the age of 35. Within his too-short lifetime, theTaxistar managed to pack in a lifetime’s worth of rich material that we’re still analyzing today. Whether he was lip-synching theMighty Mousetheme song—specifically, the chorus—wrestling women as the self-proclaimed Intergender Wrestling Champion of the World, readingThe Great Gatsbyin itsentiretyto an audience, crooning as an obnoxious lounge singer named Tony Clifton, or taking the entire audience of Carnegie Hall out for milk and cookies, Kaufman is still keeping us guessing as to what is and isn’t real. The thing is, how you view Kaufman can change depending on who you ask. For instance, he himself always said he was “just a song and dance man.” His secretary,Linda Mitchell,has said that he told her he aspired to be “the greatest entertainer of all time.”David Lettermantells me that spending time with Andy was like, “spending a day at the carnival.” FilmmakerClay Tweelsees him as being “someone who is very sweet and full of contrast.” Longtime admirerDwayne Johnsonrefers to Kaufman as being “the epitome of humanity in that it takes guts to go down the road that Andy went down.” To his sisterCarol Kaufman-Kerman,he was simply “a gentle man who genuinely loved his family.” Now, Tweel’s new documentary—Andy Kaufman Is Me—premieres tonight at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film attempts to pull back the curtain and show a side of Kaufman that audiences may be unfamiliar with: the man behind the meticulously calculated chaos that he relished in making you believe was genuine, off-the-rails chaos. “I remember seeing oldSNLclips when I was little of Andy,” Tweel says of his first exposure to the gifted performer. “And he struck me as strange and sort of gave me uncomfortable feelings, but I liked it and I didn’t know why. I love being able to understand people who are the best at what they do, what their creative juices look like. Trying to get inside their brain.” There’s been countless books written about Kaufman, a major motion picture starringJim Carrey,TV retrospectives, a podcast, a long-running award devoted to preserving his legacy, and even an entire college course at DePaul University in Chicago dedicated to his work. But there hadn’t been a comprehensive documentary that adequately covered the scope of his life and career. Kaufman’s family knew there was a story there left to tell. Says Tweel, “I’ll never forget my first conversation with the Kaufman family. They were talking about how there was parts of Andy that the public never got to see. And my first question was ‘How are we going to be able to show that? It’s a visual medium. What’re we going to do?’ And that’s when they told me about the 84 hours of audio tapes.” From 1977 until 1982, Kaufman kept a tape recorder rolling in his coat pocket. Some would know they were being recorded. Most would not. According to Kaufman’s brother,Michael Kaufman,“He wasn’t doing it for a purpose. He wasn’t doing it for legacy. He was just having fun. And look at the results. It allowed memories to be rekindled.” For Kaufman, this was an act of self-expression. And he was able to do it without the gatekeepers of the TV or film industry telling him he couldn’t. He had complete control over his tape recorder. As his sister Carol says, “Self-expression was so important to him in his life. And on the flip side: the lack of self-expression—when he was voted offSNL,when he was prevented from going to the Maharishi workshops, when he wasn’t invited to other television shows—was also a detriment to his health.” He would record conversations with fans, including those who wrote him hate letters, who he would personally call. (He would always tell Letterman, “Send me the hate mail,” after he did hisLate Nightshow). He would record moments of fun singing in the car with his family, or heartfelt conversations with his grandma, Lillie, whom he loved so dearly that he would wear a shirt that says “I Love Grandma” while onstage. He would record prank phone calls made to the restaurant he worked at as a busboy, mundane conversations with those in his life that seem to go nowhere, and interactions with hitchhikers he picked up. Once, he recorded hours of material as a character he was playing in a movie. He wanted to go somewhere where he wouldn’t be recognized, so he flew to London and stood in Hyde Park where he would claim to be God in a thick Southern drawl. Moments that would otherwise be lost to time were just waiting to be unearthed. “In my opinion, [the 84 hours of audio] took the documentary to another level,” says Dwayne Johnson, who is a producer on the film via his production company, Seven Bucks Productions. “When you just hear him speak at times, he’s so vulnerable and open.” Adds Carol, “The first time I heard the tapes, I felt like I was hanging onto Andy and the brotherly love. When Andy got busy and famous, he couldn’t give me the same time as when we were much younger and living together in a house. I did this search of ‘How did Andy relate to me? Did he still love me? Was I still important to him as his kid sister?’ So when I heard these recordings [which featured Andy and his sister talking on the phone, with her not knowing she was being recorded], I was very emotional because it was so tender and loving. I could feel our closeness and how easily we could speak about personal things. How he was interested in my life.” Kaufman is often heralded as being ahead of his time. When people say that, they’re speaking specifically to his professional output. But on these audio tapes, you realize that he was also a pioneer of capturing everyday moments as they unfolded, much like what you might find on social media today. These tapes represent a fascination with catching raw and real emotions during a time when the only output for something like that would’ve been onCandid Camera.It was just another way for Kaufman to orchestrate his own narrative and bring his ultimate fantasy world to life. As unpredictable as things might have looked when he was onFridaysand pouring water onMichael Richards’s head, for instance, everything he did was completely by design. There were no accidents with Andy. And unlikeSacha Baron Cohen’sBoratis that—a lot of times—he’d even let the other person in on it. “One of many nice things about Andy is you would get a rough outline,” says Letterman, an executive producer of the new documentary via Worldwide Pants. “It was like a menu at Denny’s. He would tell you what he was up to, generally. So there were never any surprises, except that the performance that he had outlined was always interesting and exciting.” The audio archives that Tweel had access to aren’t limited to just Andy’s personal recordings either. Featured in the film are archival audios used for Bill Zehme’s 1999 book,Lost in the Funhouse. Through this archival audio, Andy’s father, Stanley—who passed in 2013—is able to shed light on his relationship with his son, which was occasionally strained when Andy was a teenager. He even shares a letter that Andy wrote to him a few years before his big break onSaturday Night Livethat really paints a picture of not just the regard that Andy held his family in, but his determination to make it in show business and the big things that he had on the horizon. Tweel told me that Zehme’s tapes were important because “sometimes audio interviews are a little more candid and a little more honest because people have dropped the pretenses that a video camera brings.” Another way of showing this different side of Kaufman was through his writing. As his brother Michael says in the film, “We love Andy as a performance artist and an entertainer. But we only get a small part of who is really there. As big as Andy is, you only get to see a small part of him. But to read his writings, you get to see so much more of that creative brain.” When Andy died, he had been writing a novel that was, in many ways, his magnum opus,The Huey Williams Story.It is an epic told in four-parts, the first being autobiographical. This was the work that Andy always said he was proudest of. It was his most personal, and it was also, sadly, something that he didn’t get to finish before his death. (The book was later released as-is posthumously.) If you’re looking to really get a glimpse into how Kaufman saw the world and just how his mind worked, all roads lead back toHuey. The issue with featuring writings in a documentary, however, is that you’re sort of limited to featuring someone else’s narration. Luckily, before he put pen to paper, Andy talked out the entirety ofThe Huey Williams Storywhile staying at a hotel during a meditation retreat. This audio served as a way to bring Huey to life to help tell Andy’s story. Tweel broke the documentary into four parts and utilized puppets for this portion of the film. “For me, it was the moment of being able to see how much Andy used puppetry in his own act,” the director says about his inspiration for using puppets from the Bob Baker Theater in Los Angeles to tell Andy’s story. “I did not totally realize until I sat down and was watching all of the archive together at once, ‘Man this keeps coming back up.’ It was probably the funnest two-day shoot I’ve ever done in my career—being able to create a world of Fellini/Andy Kaufman puppets to try and bring Huey Williams to life.” One of the most talked about moments of Kaufman’s career is the wrestling, of course. He had been fascinated with wrestling ever since he was a kid, when his dad took him to see a match at Madison Square Garden the night Buddy Rogers lost his World Championship title. Wrestling would become a big part of his professional life when he started grappling with women onstage. In the documentary, you get to learn just how significant this moment of his career was for Andy: It was a chance for him to live out his childhood fantasies of professional wrestling, and he took the opportunity to play the villain. “At the time, wrestling certainly wasn’t the global business that it is today,” says Johnson. “So any kind of exposure on national television was always a big deal in the world of wrestling, especially when Andy went down to the company that Jerry Lawler was a part of [in Memphis]. And that was a company, USWA, that my dad wrestled at. That was a company that I wrestled at. So it was big exciting news in the world of pro wrestling that this celebrity from outside, this television star fromTaxiand fromSaturday Night Livewas involved in wrestling and giving professional wrestling the rub, if you will.” Andy’s time in the ring reached new heights when he went head-to-head with a man for the first time—Jerry “The King” Lawler in Memphis on April 5, 1982. The match got widespread national attention due to Andy’s celebrity, particularly because Lawler gave him the “piledriver,” which led to him being in the hospital for three days. Then purely for added theatrics, Kaufman and Lawler were later reunited onLate Nightwith Letterman. Letterman recalls, “I saw the documentary two nights ago. And whenever I see Andy and Jerry Lawler, it’s always exactly as I remember it. Which is interesting because most often your memory deletes things or adds things that did not happen or were unnecessary. But my memory of that is exactly how it unfolded when Andy got slapped by Lawler. The very next day, the account of this is inThe New YorkTimes.And it refers to Andy as Mr. Kaufman and Jerry Lawler as Mr. Lawler. And they’re talking about this ridiculous stint on a TV show.” The same guy who played “bad guy wrestler,” and donned a mustache as the obnoxious singer Tony Clifton—which Kaufman’s brother calls “the best therapy you could do”— would go on to insist that his childhood hero, Howdy Doody, appear in his 1979 ABC special. In the documentary, you learn just how significant it was for Kaufman to share a tender and heartfelt moment with Howdy Doody. It may be the most vulnerable that Andy ever allowed himself to be on camera. Says Tweel of that moment, “Showing that allowed us to show that this boy, who perhaps spent a lot of time by himself in his room when he was little and was a little bit isolated, truly could’ve formed a very unique connection with the people on TV, including this puppet.” “It’s one of those rare moments where you see something so authentic,” says Michael. “Because most art is exaggerated. But that’s one piece of art that was never exaggerated in any way. It wasn’t even fantasy. It was just reality. It doesn’t matter whether the person is inanimate or not. It’s just his childhood hero.” Even though you couldn’t always see it in his performances, vulnerability was a consistent thread within whatever he did. He put so much of himself into what he was creating, even if he was playing a character that wasn’t himself. When he’s playing the lovable Foreign Man who couldn’t tell a joke to save his life, for instance, there was truth in that. Kaufman was always the first to admit that he never told a joke, despite being pigeonholed as a “comedian.” “Vulnerability,” Johnson says, “was always percolating with him from what I’m told. He put himself in these positions where he could have fun and he could get lost in these characters.” Even as you’re watching all of this archival footage that’s been unearthed for the documentary, you wonder if there’s more—and there always is, of course. An hour and 41 minutes doesn’t even scratch the surface of capturing the entirety of a standard person’s essence. In the case of someone like Kaufman, who’s made a career out of keeping the audience guessing, perhaps the fact that we still have questions is exactly what he would want. Why should we have all of the answers, anyway? But of course, there is that selfish part of us that always wants to know more. “Isn’t this all about trying to figure Andy out?” his sister asks in the documentary. “Are we trying to get some clarity on who Andy is? Because even in trying to get that definition of who Andy is, there’s a sense of containment in defining somebody. And Andy was not interested in being remembered as just one thing. And aren’t we all so much more complex? Which makes Andy in a way not just unique, but like the same of all of us.” “Everything he did was real,” his brother Michael assures me. “He operated from the gut. I don’t know anyone more real than Andy. But it was all real because Andy didn’t do anything to get someone’s approval.” In retrospect, those who were lucky enough to find themselves in Kaufman’s orbit realize what a special chance it was to get to go on a journey with him. That’s a constant thread you’ll find in not just the documentary, but also anytime people talk about him in retrospective interviews in the last 40-plus years: You can’t talk about the guy without mentioning the word “fun.” As Letterman sees it, “For a guy that made the kind of impact that he did, that was very satisfying to him to have created this character that was so multi-faceted and inexplicable and to some people repulsive and to other people joyful. That’s a pretty good accomplishment by the time you’re 35.” For Tweel, the director, the quest to figure out who Kaufman was comes back to the man himself. So, in the new documentary, the subject of all this guesswork speaks for himself, both in writing and in the audio tapes. That is how you get to know Andy. “I always try to be as empathetic and try to understand people as best I can,” Tweel says. “And try to humanize them. So that played out in a way with this film. Let Andy try to humanize himself and talk for himself in a way he hasn’t before.” In addition to his work in journalism, Andrew Buss has been the official Andy Kaufman archivist/historian since 2015. He was an archival consultant onAndy Kaufman Is Me,and has the distinction of having listened to all 84 hours of Kaufman’s audio tapes.

    "article_text": "InReunited,Awards Insider hosts a conversation between two Emmy contenders who have collaborated on a previous project. Who would have thought that a raunchy comedy featuring a naked breakup scene and a Dracula musical would change everything for its two lead actors? The 2008 comedyForgetting Sarah Marshall,about a freshly dumped guy who takes a solo vacation to Hawaii and discovers his ex is at the same resort with her new fling, did just that forJason SegelandKristen Bell. At the time, Bell had been playing a teen detective on the TV seriesVeronica Mars,but wasn’t known as a comedic heavyweight. After playing Sarah Marshall, she went on to star in films likeCouples RetreatandBad Moms,as well as the beloved Emmy-nominated seriesThe Good Place. Segel had built up a notable acting career, having starred on the TV seriesFreaks and Geeks,Undeclared,andHow I Met Your Mother—butForgetting Sarah Marshall,which he wrote andNicholas Stollerdirected, launched his career as a writer. He and Stoller later collaborated on the scripts forThe Muppets, The Five-Year Engagement,andSex Tape,with Segel also starring in all of them. “We’re coming up on 20 years,” says Segel, looking back onSarah Marshall.“It feels like a lifetime ago. We were all probably different people.” But when Segel and Bell get together over Zoom for this Reunited conversation, they quickly discover that a lot of things haven’t changed. Segel, now the lead actor and cocreator of the Apple TV+ seriesShrinking,is still pushing the envelope while giving everyone inhis castmoments to shine. He’s already earned an Emmy nomination for playing Jimmy, a therapist who is grappling with his own grief; in season two, he blossoms in his performance as an awkward man with big feelings. Bell currently stars on the hit Netflix seriesNobody Wants This,playing an agnostic podcaster who falls for a Jewish rabbi (Adam Brody). The role showcases her agile comedic abilities and undeniable charisma, making you root for her character even as she’s sifting through the chaos of her dating and family life. After a breakout first season that earned Bell nominations at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, and Critics Choice Awards, the rom-com has been renewed fora second seasonthat will debut on October 23. Here, Bell and Segel look back on the wild days of filmingForgetting Sarah Marshallin Hawaii, explain why a script is “like a treasure map,” and share what type of out-of-the-box role they’re each still hoping to take on in the future. Segel and Bell inForgetting Sarah Marshall Vanity Fair:What do you remember about the first time you met? Jason Segel:I remember the process of castingSarah Marshall.We had developed this ethos that just because two people are great actors separately doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re going to have chemistry. So it wasn’t about just offering it to an actor we admired—it was getting in a room and seeing if you improv well together, if the vibe is there. We read together. Kristen is not going to let you sink with theTitanicin an improv scene—she will go down with you. It’s a ride or die. And that’s the only way to do that kind of process. You have to have this faith that at the end, in the editing, no one’s going to make you look dumb. And it was pretty instant. Like, Oh, that’s our lady. Kristen Bell:That’s incredibly flattering to hear, because I’ll tell you—I was so tired. So scared. I also saw famous people in the waiting room and I thought, Well, what are you doing here? I felt so dejected. The only thing I clung to was, You can be open. I’m not trained in improv by any sense of the word, but I’ve seen people do it, and I tried to pick things up here and there. Segel:The advantage I think that you had by not having a lot of improv experience is that there is an improv trap: You think your job is to be funny. You think your job is to show off how many different clever responses you have. It ends up being self-indulgent. At the end of the day, you can only use one [take], and you’re going to use the one that’s generally the most honest—especially if you’re the main character. There are some side characters whose job it is to be a fucking joke assassin and come in with the funniest thing you’ve ever heard, but when you’re the main character, your job is to drive story. How high were the stakes for you for this movie to work? Segel:I was a kid. I think I was 25 when I wrote the movie, and 27 by the time it came out. So there are two things going on: One is you’re getting your shot, and so there are the stakes to that. But there was also this naivete of youth—why wouldn’t they let us make a movie? Why wouldn’t they let this end with a lavish Dracula puppet musical? In my head, it was all so clear. It’s only since then where you become savvy, and you start to understand how it works a little more—and there’s a real risk at becoming less brave. The more experience you get, you’re like, Oh, I don’t know, we should probably test the Dracula puppet musical. And it is not going to pass the test. Kristen, what do you remember about that time?Veronica Marswas a big hit for you, but it got canceled while you were filmingSarah Marshall. Bell:Was it a big hit? Segel:It was a big hit. We were fucking psyched you were coming. Kristen Bell’s coming in! Make no mistake about it: big hit. Bell:Critically, it was great, but no one was watching it—we were always on the bubble. The fans were always doing something insane, like sending dollar bills into the UPN executives’ offices, because there was a dollar bill where I wrote, “I’m Smarter Than You,” and hid it in someone’s locker. They rented a plane and did the letters in the sky. They were crazy. They sent thousands of Mars bars. The fans were the ones making a ruckus about the show. We were always at risk of being canceled, so in no way, shape, or form did I feel secure in my career. I felt very hungry, and I saw this group of people that were doing what Jason’s describing, being bold and authentic and strange and bringing new things to the table. I just wanted to dance with them so badly. I felt, when I got the audition, that this could change everything for me. And it did. It changed the whole trajectory of my career. Do you have any fun off-set memories from filming in Hawaii? Segel:The honest answer is that it was like half a movie and half camp. We cast a couple adults to work at the hotel because, at one point, Nick and I were like, “Is everyone who works at this high-end professional hotel under 25 years old?” But we were all so young and so enthused about making it, and so we were— Bell:Drinking bottles of wine together.Mila [Kunis]brought her video game console.Jack McBrayerstayed four weeks when he worked four days, convinced everyone to keep him there. Every day that we walked to work, he was just at the pool sunbathing. Segel:I’m going to embarrass Jack McBrayer too. He did this thing, which takes such balls. I couldn’t do it. Every morning when he wasn’t shooting, he would come to set with a backpack and load the backpack up with craft service—just a backpack full of snacks—and wave to everyone and leave. Harrison Ford and Jason Segel inShrinking. How hard is it to get the comedy right on your current shows—ShrinkingandNobody Wants This—while balancing drama as well? Bell:I’m very respectful of that process. I’m not a person that comes in and is like, “I know exactly what we should do.” There’s been a writers room thinking about it for six months. I take what’s on the page, and it’s almost like I close my eyes and just feel it. I will read it and then I’ll say it in my head. I don’t know how to articulate how I deliver a line or do comedy. It comes completely and utterly from my gut, and I can tell if it’s working, and I can tell if it’s not. I lean into the things that are working. Then there’s a second phase, which is, I’ll push a boundary here, or I’ll pull one back. I like to hand it to the editors and say, Now you do the emotional math. Segel:The script is like this treasure map. Then this handoff happens where you’re dropped into the treasure map, and it’s three-dimensional, and suddenlyHarrison Fordis looking at you funny and you say, “Why are you looking at me funny?” Then you have this little pocket off to the side, this little pocket of new experience. I think that’s the best version of improv at this stage of my career: As opposed to thinking it’s your job to come in and improve the script, it’s more to be present and to be alive and make sure you don’t miss that something might be happening. Bell:Jason, one thing sticks out really beautifully to me, which was a gift you gave me. We were in the scene on your lanai, and we were having a breakup talk. I was crying, and I couldn’t remember the line because I had a lot of emotion. And you stayed in character and looked at me and fed me the line. It was such a gift, because there wasn’t this big stop, or being left hanging in this abyss where I couldn’t figure out what my next line was. Jason was so connected to our common goal in that scene. He took a chance and knew that maybe if he whispered the first four words of my next sentence, I would click back in. And I did. Segel:I had a similar experience with Kristen where we were doing the nude breakup scene. I was sitting on the couch kind of emoting, and she leaned over and whispered to me, “Close your legs. You don’t want people to see your dick looking like that.” Kristen Bell and Adam Brody inNobody Wants This. What have you learned about acting from your costars onShrinkingandNobody Wants This? Bell:Every single job is the same training experience. I’ve read the script, I think I know where my instincts lie, I come to set, I get to work with someone likeJustine Lupe—who will bring something that I never even saw in the script to life. So I would still describe it as an openness. I am surprised every time I do a scene because I don’t know what’s happening inside the other actor’s head. Sometimes that surprise is amazing, and I immediately agree with it and I think it’s fun. And other times, I really don’t think the scene should go there. I’ve read a scene, and Adam [Brody] is playing it completely differently than how I saw it. It’s a bit of emotional gymnastics for me, but it’s still fun. It’s not negative; it’s just surprising and different. Segel:I think of my job onShrinkinglike a point guard on a basketball team. That’s my job. I have to really pay attention to where my costars want to receive the ball, how they play best. The show is written so that I’m going to get mine—I’m going to get the ball in crucial moments. But most of the time, my job is to set upJessica [Williams], set up Harrison [Ford], make sure that everybody has this chance to thrive. It’s sort of my job to help them create their highlight reel. Bell:That is such a beautiful way to say it. There are some shows you could watch where it feels as though the lead actor is a bit of an energy vampire, and everyone else is just in support. And those aren’t my personal favorite shows to watch. But there’s something inarticulable about the vibe that Jason’s talking about being cognizant of creating. Segel:I had a moment onShrinkingin season one where Harrison was set up to kill, and he fucking killed. Of course he did. But he’s in a slightly new environment of a comedy set, and he got a big laugh from the crew. They yelled “cut,” and Harrison walked by me and—just in the Harrison way that he has—whispered in my ear, “I knew I was fucking funny.” I’ll get to have that forever. As actors, we all have these parts of us that we believe about ourselves that we maybe haven’t gotten the chance to show. I think it’s pretty awesome to set up scenarios where people are pushed a little further than your first thought. Do you feel like you have a side of yourselves you haven’t gotten to show yet? Segel:I crave playing a villain. I feel my whole career, I’ve walked the line between charming and creepy, and then at the very end I tipped charming. But I would really be interested to see what happens when you tip creepy. Those are all the villains that I love: these ones that are charming and funny and creepy, and then turn out to be horrible. Bell:I feel like I love being a mom so much, and there’s such a well of complexity of emotion behind that, when you start living for something else, cellularly, that changes you. And then it’s also a ton of highs and the absolute lowest of the lows—you have this beautiful thing you’re so proud of, but as it gets older, it lives to cut you down. It’s a very turbulent inner world. I’m currently playing a 44-year-old rom-com love interest—I cannot believe they’re letting me do that. But I would like to explore something more into the complexities of motherhood. Even if it weren’t a project about motherhood, but just playing a mother. I feel like it’s a very deep well for me. Segel:Can I just jump in on “44-year-old love interest”? Because I think it’s exactly right. I made a mistake: I was sure my 20s were my prime, because you’re doing all this stuff, and it’s electric, and you’re new at it, and you’re at the top of the world. You’re getting all this attention. And there was a moment where that kind of fizzled out and things got a little smaller. In my mind, my prime had happened. But what I have found, and I certainly see it for you, is that that wasrehearsalfor your prime. That was prime without the depth of experience, without the depth of making it through some shit and coming out the other side. Now I’m in my 40s, doing these scenes onShrinkingthat I couldn’t have done in my 20s. I had no depth of experience about what it’s like to lose somebody, or what it’s like to have your kid go off to college and feel so proud—but also that your heart’s being ripped out of your chest. It makes total sense that you’re the lead in a rom-com right now because you’re the best version of yourself now.

    "title": "Donald Trump Is Trying to Tip New Jersey Red",
    "article_text": "Donnie from Bedminster is calling on line two! Donnie, go ahead, you’re on the air with Jack! Okay, so this Donnie is the president,Donald Trump,and he’s really from Queens, or Florida, or maybe Washington, DC. But he spends part of the year at hisNew Jersey golf club: “Special place. You know that I stay there all the time. I live there alot.” And he’s calling in to a political rally one week before the state’s gubernatorial primaries. Yet Trump, whatever his means of communication, can’t help but give off serious right-wing talk radio crank vibes. “The radical-left Democrats in the race are woke…lunatics who want New Jersey to be a haven for illegal alien gang members, human traffickers, dangerous criminals of all kinds, including murderers who have been let into our country by Biden and his group of people with their open-border craziness,” Trump says,his rantgaining speed, if not coherence. “And if you get four more years with somebody that you’ve been going through, I mean, it’s just so sad. Your taxes go up. You crush the middle-class families and cause mass exodus. And that’s happened. Mass exodus of jobs and businesses all throughout the state while they indoctrinate your children at a public school. It’s a terrible thing that happens to the children. You look and hear and all—it’s called transgender for all, and we’ve ended that. New Jersey’s economy will wither and die, and you’ll be living in a nightmare of chaos and crime, and you sort of have that to a certain extent now.” The beneficiary of this tirade isJack Ciattarelli,the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the New Jersey governor’s race. Ciattarelli, a former state legislator wholostby just more than three percentage points in 2021, has a commanding lead in the GOP primary largely because of his shift from Trump skeptic to Trump worshipper. “I’m so very grateful for his complete and total endorsement,” Ciattarelli gushes when Trump lets him get in a word. “Mr. President, thank you. I so very much appreciate your faith, your trust, your confidence. And I know none of us are surprised here, since New Jersey’s kind of your summer home, how in tune you are with the issues that matter to all New Jerseyans.” Sucking up to Trump is standard in Republican politics these days. What’s less certain—and what’s likely to determine both the Democratic nomineenext weekand the winner in November’s general election—is just how big a role Trump ends up playing with New Jersey voters. The crowded field of Democratic contenders to succeed incumbent governorPhil Murphy,who is term-limited after eight years in office, has come at the Trump problem from a variety of angles.Steve Fulop,the mayor of Jersey City, has used a broad antiestablishment, policy-geek message to climb to second in recent polls, where he’s tied withRas Baraka,the mayor of Newark, andJosh Gottheimer,a combative, centrist congressman. Of the six candidates, Baraka is the furthest left, ideologically, and the most strenuously anti-Trump, stylistically. He recently visited a new federal migrant deportation facility and was arrested by Homeland Security agents; Baraka isnow suingthe interim US attorney for New Jersey,Alina Habba,a close Trump ally. Regardless of whether Baraka intended to be detained, the confrontation earned him a bonanza of media attention. “I think he did a very smart thing by getting arrested,” saysJulie Roginsky,a Democratic strategist who was the main architect of Murphy’s 2017 campaign before a bitter falling-out with his team. “It gave him a tremendous amount of national exposure at just the right time.” If Baraka wins, he will set up a polar general election contrast to the MAGA Ciattarelli. The consistent Democratic front-runner,Mikie Sherrill,has so far pulled off a deft balancing act. The former Navy pilot was elected to Congress as part of the 2018 “blue wave” reaction to Trump’s first win. And during the current campaign, Sherrill has at times been passionate in expressing her opposition to the president, appearing to wipe away a tear when speaking about immigration policy during a candidate forum at Rutgers University. “As a country, we’ve been really dedicated to the democratic ideals of delivering opportunity. That it doesn’t matter who your parents were or where you were born or how much money you have, but it’s what you can make of yourself,” Sherrill tells me just after shaking hands with voters at a diner in Hamilton Township while battling a migraine. “The Trump administration is trying to shut down those opportunities for people across the country and especially people here in New Jersey.” Sherrill calls Trump “a huge factor” in the race, but she has been careful not to become a one-note anti-Trump candidate—regularly emphasizing, for instance, her plans to lower utility bills and housing costs. She has assembled formidable support from the state’s powerful county organizations; Sherrill has also come across as providing the closest thing to a continuation of Murphy’s agenda, a posture that could cut either way. “Anybody who wants to be governor is going to have to be strong and be willing to stand up to President Trump’s administration as they attack the things we care about here, willing to take them to court, as Jack Ciattarelli has vowed not to,” she tells me. “But at the same time, I think it’s incumbent upon the next governor to deliver for families, to drive down costs here.” Sherrill has tried to avoid taking any positions that might come back to haunt her in a general election matchup with Ciattarelli, should she win the Democratic nomination next week. “For a Republican to win in New Jersey, Democrats have to screw up so much to make Democratic voters hold their nose and vote for a Republican candidate,” Roginsky says. “That’s what happened withChris Christiein 2009, that’s what happened withChristie Todd Whitmanin 1993. Then again, we’ve never had a Donald Trump before.” Registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans in New Jersey, but the second-biggest bloc is independents, and last year Trump lost the state toKamala Harrisby just less than six points. Trump’s approval in the reliably blue state clocked in at 47% ina recent poll, which is just above thenational average, and he has a particularly strong base in south Jersey. “I can’t imagine the Republicans believe they can win the governor’s race in Virginia—Trump has laid off half the state by now,” a New Jersey Democratic strategist says, referring to major cuts to the federal workforce. “So if they think they can win here, do they pour a hundred million dollars in crypto into the campaign? Ciattarelli is a good politician. For us, the message is going to boil down to: ‘We have to stop Trump here in New Jersey.’” Next week’s primary results should show who voters think is best equipped to not only lower their property taxes, but also stand up to the bully from Bedminster.

    "title": "1 in 4 Hongkongers unaware of coming public healthcare fee changes: survey",
    "article_text": "Lawmakers call on authorities to ramp up efforts to promote reform, set to come into force in January 2026 One in four Hongkongers is unaware of the expansion of a medical fee waiver mechanism, a survey has found, with lawmakers urging the government to ramp up efforts to promote the public healthcare subsidy regime reform set to be implemented in six months. The survey, involving 724 respondents and conducted by the city’s largest workers’ union between April 22 and May 13, showed that some participants lacked a clear understanding of the measures that were aimed at broadening the safety net in public hospitals. Lawmaker Stanley Ng Chau-pei, president of the Federation of Trade Unions, said residents were more familiar with the measures related to fee increases, including in accident and emergency (A&E) rooms, and general outpatient clinics. “When residents have a limited understanding of the reform, how can the government effectively implement the measures?” he said. “The government should ramp up its efforts to promote the reform, especially in areas concerning how it will increase support for patients.” The survey found 29 per cent of respondents did not know about the relaxation of income and asset limits of the fee waiver mechanism, while about a quarter had no idea about the HK$10,000 (US$1,274) cap on annual spending for public healthcare services.",

    "article_text": "John Lee outlines 10 measures to address concerns over black particles found in water supply at two public housing estates Hong Kong’s leader has ordered authorities to replace hundreds of metres of bitumen-lined pipes as one of 10 measures to address residents’ concerns over black particles dirtying the water at two public housing estates. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu weighed in on Friday, a week after initial reports of the particles emerged, as he tasked Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun with supervising the implementation of the measures. Government test results on Thursday confirmed that the particles found in the freshwater supply at Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court in Fanling were bitumen, a substance produced through the distillation of crude oil and known for its waterproofing and adhesive properties. It has been banned from use in water pipes since 2005, but authorities have stressed that the water remains safe to consume. “I am highly concerned about the freshwater incident at Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court, and I convened a high-level meeting [on Friday] afternoon,” Lee wrote on his social media page. “The government is responsible to ensure the public can safely consume freshwater, and the incident must be handled quickly and the public concern can be thoroughly eased.”",
